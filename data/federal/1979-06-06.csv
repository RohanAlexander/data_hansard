The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australiarespectfullyshoweth: That the plan to obliterate the traditional weights and measures of this country does not have the support of the people; That the change is causing and will continue to cause, widespread, serious and costly problems; That the compulsory tactics being used to force the change are a violation of all democratic principles. Your petitioners therefore pray: That the Metric Conversion the people are free to utilize whichever system they prefer and so enable the return to imperial weights and measures wherever the people so desire; That weather reporting be as it was prior to the passing of the Metric Conversion Act; That the Australian Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional mile units to be restored to our highways; That the Australian Government request the State Governments to procure that the imperial and metric systems be taught together in schools.

To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That restoration of provisions of the Social Security Act that applied prior to the 1978-79 offset the rising cost of goods and services.

Great injury will be caused to 920,000 aged, invalid, widows and supporting parents, whorelysolely on the pension or whose income, other than the pension, is $6 or less per week.

Universal Disarmament To the Speaker and the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia in Parkes, New South Wales, respectfully showeth that taking note that the very survival of mankind is at stake, with the stockpile of nuclear weapons able to kill every person on Earth 24 times over, and this at the inflation-causing cost of $ 1,000m per day for the World, $7m per day for Australia; and noting that the energies released by lifting the burden of armaments could solve such problems as: World hunger. The cost of one nuclear missile could feed the entire population of Bangladesh for 2 months; and 1 percent of military budgets could finance the World Food Conference plans for increased food production and emergency reserves. Malaria, smallpox, even cancer The total cost of WHO's campaign for the eradication of Smallpox was $83m-the cost of one bomber; with $450m-V i day's spending for military purposes, WHO could completely eradicate Malaria; similarly with Cancer. Education: At present, there are as many soldiers as teachers. Unemployment: $49m-on e week's worth-1/5 2 of Australia's defence spending-coul d create 3,000 jobs. And noting that the Prime Minister, in his speech to the UN Special Session, said that 'conscience and reason demand that this waste of resources cease' and 'that disarmament is a matter of political leadership'. Call upon the Australian Government, as a matter of the highest priority, in the interests of the Australian people no less than those of other peoples, to give this political leadership by acting promptly and effectively to funher the disarmament which is the desire and determined will of the vast majority of the people of every nation in the World.

Health of Aboriginal Children To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: + that there are Australian Aboriginal children living under conditions of inadequate nutrition in a background of poor housing, hygiene, and over-crowding that amounts to a Third World enclave in the midst of affluence; + that such a state of affairs is intolerable in our country; + that only an effort on an unprecedented scale could create conditions that would give these children the rights set out in the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will make generous funding available for the specificpurposes of: + making a real improvement in the health, housing, educadon, employment and welfare of our Aboriginal people, doing so with due regard for the needs, hopes and aspirations of the Aboriginal people themselves. + providing increased help, encouragement and opportunity for Aboriginal people to train as nursing aides and in other para-medical roles, and as fully qualified nurses, doctors and social workers; + providing increased health education for Aboriginal people in ways that are acceptable to them.  Petition received. Supporting Parents Benefits To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australiarespectfullyshoweth: That the present Social Services arrangement which gives single parents with dependent children a 'Supporting Parents' Benefit' if they have not previously been married, and a 'Widow's Pension' if they are previously married persons who have been separated, divorced or widowed, is inequitable. It denies that need, and degree of need, should be the primary test by which the help given should be distributed. Accordingly, your petitioners call upon their legislators to: Education Abolish the Supporting Parents' Benefit and the Widow's Pension, and introduce in their stead a Lone Parents' Pension, based on need, particularly the needs of children, and independent of sex, and marital status or cause of single parenthood. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, services are inadequate. by Mr Young. Petition received. NA NA (REDEPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT) NA",15
2,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,BILL,"I direct a question to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. I refer him to a question asked of him on Monday, 4 June, about the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill and his assurance that-and I use his words'Before regulations are prepared and promulgated there will be consultation with staff organisations'. I ask the Minister: Is it not a fact the Public Service Board has sent instructions to the Attorney-General's Department requesting omcers to draw regulations prescribing 'limited efficiency' as a reason for redeploying staff, and had not these instructions been given before the question was asked of the Minister on Monday?",16
3,Mr VINER,BILL,"I do not know whether it is a fact. I will make inquiries and advise the honourable member. However, as I have said before, there will be consultations with the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations and the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association after the legislation is passed by Parliament and is assented to by the Governor General. That assurance has been given in correspondence to both organisations. NA NA",17
4,Mr LLOYD,BENEFIT SCHEME,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health. The Minister recently announced the first change to the domiciliary nursing care benefit scheme since its introduction by a Liberal-Country Party Government in 1972. Will the Minister endeavour to have the $2 a day benefit, which has remained unchanged since 1972, increased to a more realistic level before the 1 November starting date of the expanded eligibility criteria which now includes patients 16 years of age and over?",17
5,Mr HUNT,BENEFIT SCHEME,"I do not think I need tell the honourable member for Murray that the Government strongly supports policies that are designed to minimise the high cost of institutional care. The Government's strategy generally is to encourage the development of policies that will minimise illness in the community. The prime aim of the health promotion campaign that will be launched in the next financial year will be to improve the quality of health of the Australian people. At the same time, the Government believes that it should give incentives to people to provide domiciliary care when it can provide a satisfactory alternative to high cost stitutional care. It was in that context that the Government took the decision to reduce the age eligibility criterion for the benefit from 65 years of age to 16 years of age in the amendments to the National Health Act which were debated in this place only this week. However, the increase in the daily benefit will be a matter for Cabinet's Budget consideration. I cannot give any guarantees whatsoever. I know that the honourable member for Murray is a member of the Government parties health and welfare committee and that he has a very keen interest in ensuring that that this policy is maintained and strengthened.

6,Mr DAWKINS,FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"I refer the Minister for National Development to questions which I asked him on Monday and yesterday concerning his secret lunch with representatives of oil companies organised by the Liberal Party in Western Australia and to which the Minister replied yesterdayMr Killen- I raise a point of order. The question carries the plainest of imputationsMr Innes-What has that to do with it? Mr Killen-It has everything to do with it. I respectfully submit that any question that contains an imputation, as that question contains, is clearly out of order. Mr Keith Johnson-On the point of order, I put it to you, Mr Acting Speaker, for your consideration that no point of order arises and that in fact all the honourable member for Fremantle is doing is repeating a question which you allowed on Monday. If it is out of order now, it would have been out of order on Monday; but you allowed it then.",17

9,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"I warn the honourable member for Melbourne, and honourable members on my right will assist if they remain silent. The observations of the honourable member for Burke are not incorrect. They require me again to draw the attention of the House to what I have said on a previous occasion, that is, that our practices have tended to drift from the Standing Orders. Many things in- are accepted by practice which in fact are not consistent with the Standing Orders. In this situation the Minister for Defence took a point of order and I had no alternative but to uphold that point of order because it is consistent with the Standing Orders and not with the practices which in many respects have become somewhat questionable. The honourable member for Fremantle will withdraw the imputation and proceed with his question deleting such references.",17
10,Mr HAYDEN,FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"I raise a point of order. Under Standing Order 142 it is quite clearly provided that questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially connected, to proceedings pending in the House or to any matter of administration for which he is responsible. I recognise that the question raises a very serious matter. It is a matter which is being discussed rather widely in the community at the present time. It is in the interests of the Minister that he should be confronted with this matter and be able to respond to it. If we are not going to be provided with the opportunity to ",18

12,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,The honourable member for Bendigo will withdraw that remark. Mr Bourchier- I withdraw that remark.,18
13,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,I think the Leader of the Opposition may have missed the point. There is no quesuon about the right of the honourable member for Fremantle to pose his question. In making the imputation attaching to the term 'secret' he offended against ing Orders.,18

He said yesterday that he wanted to back and check his correspondence concerning the question I asked him yesterday. I now Did the Minister attend a lunch at the Parmelia Hotel on 20 April at which representatives of various oil companies were present.

I might mention that my secretary and handled approximately 200 invitations and during the month of April.

My personal secretary has informed ask: me that in the arrangements that were made advice was received that there would be no discussion regarding fund raising at that luncheon.

27,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,EDUCATION FUNDING,"My question is directed the Prime Minister or the Minister acting for the Minister for Education. Is it a fact that generally most non-government schools are at Level 6 it according to the Schools Commission, which is it the lowest physical resources level? Does he apI preciate that attempts to lift these Level 6 schools public expenditure assistance cannot be to accomplished by the Commonwealth alone, and that some States have dragged their feet for years? Will he therefore seek the co-operation of these States to accomplish this task rent and capital expenditure fields and ensure that the Commonwealth's effort is made known to those schools, the students and their parents, and will he make known the fact that the States dragging their feet are New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania?",18
28,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,EDUCATION FUNDING,"The honourable gentleman is correct when he indicates that the Schools Commission has pointed out that the Level 6 schools have resources far below the national average and that the Commonwealth has introduced poUcies to try to redress that. As the honourable gentleman will know, the payments from the Commonwealth to independent schools are linked to a percentage of what it costs to educate people in a government primary or a government secondary school. Obviously Level 6 schools get a higher percentage from the Commonwealth than those independent schools that are better endowed. In addition, of course, the Commonwealth has, in recent times, been providing some capital expenditure so that independent schools can have an opportunity to establish themselves in new and growing areas so that they might continue to provide educational opportunities for the children of those parents who would prefer their children to go to independent schools of one kind or another. I think that under these policies, for the firsttimein many, many years, independent schools of these categories are looking to the future with a much greater degree of confidence and with a capacity to expand of a kind that they have not had and would not have had without the Commonwealth's policies. Even in this year offinancialstringency, of course, the payments to the lower level schools are going to be increased to provide some additional support in real terms. That is quite plainly justified on the resources comparison between independent schools and government schools. It is also true, as the honourable gentleman points out, that there is a very great difference between the resources provided by States to independent schools. I do not think any of the States enter into the capital arena. If they do, they do so in a very, very modest way. I would like to see all States supplementing what the Commonwealth seeks to do in that regard. It would certainly expand educational choice and possibilities for a wider section of the Australian community. The dual system of government and independent schools is a very important part of Australian life, something to be maintained and in both recurvery much to be encouraged. A number of States do provide recurrent support to independent schools. In the last Victorian Government election policy speech, for example, a commitment was made to move from 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the costs of education in government schools to be paid on account of children in independent schools. But the States that the honourable gentleman mentioned do lag very far behind in this matter. They discriminate positively against children in independent schools. I do not believe that they meet their general responsibilities to that section of the community. Governments have a responsibility to all children within their general boundaries. They ought to match that by making sure that some taxpayers' dollars not only go to government schools but also are paid on account of children in independent schools. The States concerned could certainly do very much more than they do. NA",19
29,Mr LES JOHNSON,LUCAS HEIGHTS ATOMIC REACTOR,"Does the Minister for National Development accept responsibility for an official minute circulated at Lucas Heights Atomic Research Establishment which seeks to justify escalation of security arrangements in the HIFAR reactor area? Does this minute claim that Japanese anti-nuclear activists are alleged to be in the country to train local activists in antinuclear activity? What evidence is there to support this claim? Are establishment employees or local residents under any threat or danger? Are any local activists being investigated as possible threats to the reactor or is this an unjustifiable innuendo, probably prompted to provide some justification for telephone tapping or some curtailment of civil liberties?",19
30,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LUCAS HEIGHTS ATOMIC REACTOR,The honourable member will not debate the matter.,19
31,Mr NEWMAN,LUCAS HEIGHTS ATOMIC REACTOR,"If the honourable member for Fremantle was making mountains out of molehills, he was just trumped by that question. I heard the speech that was made by the honourable member for Hughes last night. I sought to get the circular from him last night but his staff had departed although I asked to have it. I am having the matter investigated and I will let the honourable member have a reply. NA",19
32,Mr BURR,WAGE FIXING GUIDELINES,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Do the wage increases that have occurred in recent months conform with the Cpnciliation and Arbitration Commission guidelines? What effect will these demands have on economic recovery in Australia? Is there a correlation between rising wages and unemployment?,19
33,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,WAGE FIXING GUIDELINES,"There is obvically ously a correlation between wages that rise too fast and unemployment. At one point at any rate that was the bipartisan view of this House cause a former Labor Treasurer, Mr Frank Crean, had made it perfectly plain that, in view, one man's wage rise was another man's were made. job. That remains very true. If we return to the time under Labor when in one year wages for males increased by over 25 per cent and for females by over 35 per cent, I think, that was also the time when a very significant rise in unemister ployment of approximately 200,000 occurred in one year. It is worth noting that under the Labor Administration, Ministers for Labour were enserious couraging wage claims within the Commission and outside the Commission. They were doing that in a way which was totally irresponsible destructive of jobs and job opportunities Australia. Over the last two to three years compliance with the wage indexation guidelines has been quite high-abou t 90 per cent. However, there have been a number of work value cases which have been judged to be within the guidelines but which many would judge to have been outside the guidelines in the sense of being phoney work value cases. That might tend to deasked preciate the degree of compliance if a different view were taken of those work value cases. Most of the wage increase that has recently been recorded and which attracted some publicity terday would have flown through from the last six-monthly decision of the Conciliation Arbitration Commission. That decision granted 100 per cent indexation, which the believed to be totally irresponsible and totally destructive of general efforts to achieve a better balance between wages and profitability and to establish circumstances where firms can be encouraged to take on more people. I heard of number offirmswhich had been planning very directly to take on more people but had deferred that decision or postponed or cancelled it as sult of the Commission's decision. I think it is worth noting that not only Government but also many sections of the Ausof tralian community regarded that decision as being one of very great irresponsibility in the cumstances of the time. We are to be faced shortly with another Arbitration Commission decision. It would be quite wrong to try to prejudice that decision, of course, but I hope the Arbitration Commission and trade union leaders will pay greater regard to the need to encourage greater employment. I do not believe that the industrial relations consequences of an economimore responsible decision are anything like as great as the Arbitration Commission fears. 1 believe it has been deterred by threats that have bebeen madetimeand time again by a number of union leaders about what would occur if a rehis sponsible, economically based wages decision NA",20
34,Dr JENKINS,FEDERAL NARCOTICS BUREAU,"I direct a question to the Minfor Business and Consumer Affairs. Did Mr Bates, the chief of the Narcotics Bureau, withhold from the Minister information concerning allegations against officers of the Narcotics Bureau? What decisions have been made about future communication between Mr Bates and and the Minister as a result of past experience? in Has the Minister now devised procedures which will ensure that he supervises the running of his Department and keeps himself informed about the degree of matters in relation to it?",20

36,Mr DEAN,WORLD SUGAR MARKET,My question is addressed to the a Minister for Special Trade Representations. I understand that the Minister is not here but that the Minister for Trade and Resources will a reanswer the question. I refer the Minister to the settlement which he reached last week in Australia's bilateral negotiations with the the European Economic Community in the context the Multilateral Trade Negotiations: Has the question also been raised with Vice President cirGundelach of the difficulties being caused on the world sugar market by EEC export subsidies and its non-membership of the International Sugar Agreement?,20
37,Mr ANTHONY,WORLD SUGAR MARKET,"One of the virtues of having Mr Gundelach in Australia was for us to be able to impress upon him our concern at the attitude of the EEC towards the International Sugar satisfied Agreement. This matter was raised in discussions that he had with the Cabinet, and also in personal discussions that I had with him. I know that, when he visited Queensland, members of the Queensland sugar industry took the opporing tunity of impressing upon him their concern the implications of the EEC's dumping of large quantities of sugar on the world market and thus depressing it, and undermining the operations the International Sugar Agreement. I was vious pleased with his reaction. He was more rethe sponsive than I had expected in that he exthat pressed his point of view that the EEC should a member, but he was having great difficulty getting member countries to accept the recNarcotics ommendation of the Commission that they attention. should look towards becoming members and making some quota arrangements under the International Sugar Agreement in order that some discipline might be imposed upon them. As a result of comments that he made to the sugar industry and to the Government, I have written to ask him to confirm those remarks and to ask that they be brought before the Commission so that action can be taken as promptly as possible for the EEC to become a member. He has repeatedly said that he will have difficulty in getdng the Commission to move on this matter until the United States ratines the International Sugar Agreement. There has been a long standing dispute between the United States Administration and members of the Senate regarding the domestic pricing arrangements for sugar in the United States. I am hopeful that that situation has been resolved. They have said that it has been resolved on a number of occasions and yet they have failed to have it ratified by Congress. However, Congress has only another month to go before it rises and I have been given firm assurances that during this latter period of its session this will be ratified. Once that has been done, I hope that the EEC will live up to its undertaking and that it will commence negotiations with the International Sugar Council and work out an arrangement which is acceptable to the members of the ISA which will impose also some limitations on the amount of sugar which the EEC is dumping onto the world market.

40,Mr FISHER,WHEAT PRICES,Has the Minister for Trade and Resources noted the recent increase in world wheat prices? What influence does he expect moves to improve co-operation between the major wheat exporting countries have had and will have on future wheat prices?,21
41,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT PRICES,"Following the record wheat harvest in Australia, I think everybody is extremely gratified to see that the international wheat prices are firming up. In fact, the export price for Australian standard white wheat is now $A135 a tonne compared with $121 a tonne in February this year. Whilst I am not one to try to predict the future as to what the price for wheat might be, all the indications are that for the balance of this year the price will remain at these levels, or it might even strengthen. This year the world wheat crop seems to be down about 5 per cent or 10 per cent on the record crop of 441 million tonnes last year. Whilst stocks are at high levels around the world they are not considered to be exceptionally high in view of the food needs of the world. In fact, stocks in the United States of America, which has the major influence on international prices, tend to be down this year on what they were last year. Some other countries, such as Canada, which have substantial stocks have severe limitations on their capacity export that stock. They have limitations on their transport systems, both rail and shipping. We have a similar problem in Australia, particularly in New South Wales, where disruptions to the loading of wheat have severely reduced our capacity to meet some of our export requirements. In fact, it seems as though we will be able to export only about 10 million tonnes of wheat this year, which means that we will have a carry-over of probably about six million tonnes. I think most unfortunate that these delays in the movement of wheat occurred in the earlier part of the year because they will deprive us of the very good market and price opportunities that exist at the moment. Regarding the International Wheat Agreethat ment, negotiations took place under the auspices of the United Nations. These negotiations did not result in unity. I visited Canada in April year with a view to getting together all the major wheat exporting countries. There has since been a meeting of officials of those countries so that there can be a degree of co-operation and cofor ordination in selling programs. It has been agreed that all these countries will meet together regularly to monitor the market situation and to in see that there is no undue competition on the market which would depress prices. There can unfair competition by countries trying to get a bigger proportion of the market which leads to traditional markets of countries being taken away by other countries. This only jeopardises the overall international price situation and, the long run, does not in any way benefit any the major exporting countries. Whilst I would not say that this is a price fixing arrangement, believe that there is an understanding people who have traditional markets will maintain them. I hope that the pricing arrangements that are now fairly stable can be maintained in the future. NA",21
42,Mr HOLDING,FEDERAL NARCOTICS BUREAU,"When did the Minister for say Business and Consumer Affairs first raise with the Federal Narcotics Bureau the question of the serious allegations contained in an article in Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial of 28 May? Does the Minister recall that the Customs Amendment Bill giving vastly increased powers to the cotics Bureau was not debated in this House until the afternoon of 29 May and did not pass this lished House until one o'clock in the morning of Wedof nesday, 30 May? In view of the time which elapsed between the appearance of the alleators. gations in the Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial to and the passing of the Customs Amendment Bill, can the Minister state why he was not able to inform this house as to the truth or otherwise of those allegations before the legislation was passed?",22
43,Mr FIFE,FEDERAL NARCOTICS BUREAU,"I repeat that these serious allegations first came to my notice early in the morning of last Monday week when a reporter from the Melbourne Herald telephoned me at my it is hotel and asked me whether I was able to comment on the report that had appeared on the front page of the Sun News-Pictorial on that day. I responded to the reporter and indicated that I would seek immediate advice from the permanent head of my Department and the Commissioner of the Federal Narcotics Bureau. I did and I received advice. I received confirmation that those allegations had been made and that they were contained in transcripts of tapes that had been referred to in the Press article. The this debate on this matter continued on the Tuesday, which was the day following the allegations. I did not believe that it was incumbent upon me to introduce that subject into the debate at the time two reasons: Firstly, it was public knowledge that those allegations had been made. By that time, the report of the allegations had appeared media other than the Sun News-Pictorial. Secondly, consideration was being given to what be kind of investigation should be carried out. NA",22
44,Mr GRAHAM,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,Is the Minister for Proin ductivity aware of a report in the Canberra of Times reflecting on the airworthiness of the Nomad aircraft produced in Australia? Will he I advise the House whether he has any inforthat mation in relation to this matter?,22
45,Mr MACPHEE,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"My attention has been drawn to an article which appeared in the Canberra Times this morning which does cast some doubt on the airworthiness of the Nomad aircraft. The article makes reference to a fatal accident which occurred at Avalon in 1976.1 might that that accident occurred during an experimental flight with a tail-plane which had been modified and was different from that which is in the the production aircraft in use around the world. The modification was designed to improve the short take-off capability of the stretched version Narof the Nomad, the N24. This modification work was not proceeded with as it has been estabthat the excellent short field characteristics both the N24 aircraft and the standard N22 aircraft amply meet the requirements of operHonourable members on both sides of the House have long been proud of the Nomad and rightly so. The last three governments have given financial support to this aircraft. I am not aware of any request for funds having been made to government, as the article alleges, for the redesign of the tail-plane into a T configuration, alone any denial of such a request. Nomad aircraft are now flying in regular passenger carrying services and in a range of other applications in a number of countries including Australia. They have been certificated by the Australian Department of Transport and the United States Federal Aviation Administration as well as a number of other airworthiness authorities. All of these authorities regard the Nomad as meeting their airworthiness requirements in both the regular public transport and normal categories. These certifications were granted after critical and intense evaluation by the Department of Transport Flying Operations and Airworthiness Division of the aircraft's flying qualities and design characteristics with particular attention to safety aspects. The certification process means that the design and manufacture of the aircraft, as well as its operation, are strictly controlled by the relevant national airworthiness authorities. The Nomad meets all relevant flight safety standards laid down by those authorities in the countries where it is operating. Nomads are in use by seven government departments and instrumentalities. Mr Morris- I raise a point of order. I submit that the Minister is abusing the forms of the House. The information that he is repeating is readily available in public documents, or ought to be. Mr Acting Speaker, will you ask him to draw his answer to a close?",22
46,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,There is no point of order. I ask the Minister not to protract his reply.,23
47,Mr MACPHEE,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"It is most interesting that the Opposition spokesman on transport is not interested in setting the record straight about a very great Australian invention. Nomads are in use by seven government departments and instrumentalities, both at home and abroad, and by 11 commercial companies. Several of the aircraft sold to date have been repeat orders from satisfied customers. Nomads are in use in Australia, Europe, Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, the Middle East, South America and the Pacific. Nomad has a very good operating record. Without exception, Nomad users around the world have given testimony to their satisfaction with its operational handling, maintainabilityMr Charles Jones- I raise a point of order. Whilst we welcome the statement by the Minister concerning the Nomad, I think he is abusing Question Time by reading a prepared statement let which the Opposition would give him time to present to the Parliament as a ministerial statement. His action is an absolute and utter abuse of Question Time.",23
48,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,Order! The honourable member for Newcastle will not debate the matter. The Minister is entitled to answer the question as he sees fit. His answer must maintain relevance and not be unduly long. I ask the Minister to bring his answer to a conclusion.,23
49,Mr MACPHEE,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"Within the responsibilities which I believe I bear, I will make my answer as short as possible. I have made it clear that there is testimony from customers to the Nomad 's operational handling, maintainability, ruggedness and overall cost effectiveness in use. I spoke this morning to the head of the Department of Transport's Flying Operations and Airworthiness Division. He confirmed to me that the Nomad satisfies all the certification requirements of his Department and those of the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. He further informed me that the FAA test pilots flew the Nomad and did not rely upon the Department of Transport's certification when making their own certification. The Nomad has therefore passed all the standards laid down by two countries with outstanding civil aviation records.",23
50,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,Order! The Minister will indicate to me whether he is about to conclude his remarks. ',23
51,Mr HAYDEN,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"Mr Acting Speaker, I take a point of order. The Minister indicated to you earlier that he was about to conclude his remarks. He is continuing. It is quite clear that this is not a spontaneous question and answer interlude. The Minister is making a statement. A more appropriate time to make a statement would be subsequent to Question Time.",23
52,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,The Chair has already taken that matter in hand. The Minister is required to bring his remarks to a conclusion forthwith.,23
53,Mr MACPHEE,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"Oppositio n members are delaying Question Time by their interruptions. I wish to add that my colleague, the Minister for Defence, also has informed me this morning that the Australian Army has purchased 11 N22 aircraft for special military applications and that these aircraft are performing most satisfactorily. In the interests of brevity, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a document which contains a record of customer satisfaction. Whilst the journalist who wrote the article to which the honourable member for North Sydney referred said that he was not knocking the Nomad aircraft, I can only say that I wish he had gone to the customers who are using it. Had he done so he would have found a great demonstration of satisfaction contrary to the points that he was raising. Mr Acting Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a document which sets out customer satisfaction in support of the Nomad aircraft.",23

76,Mr SINCLAIR,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,Mr Acting Speaker,24
77,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,Just a moment. The Leader of the House does not know what I am going to say. He ought to listen.,24
78,Mr SINCLAIR,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"Mr Acting Speaker, might I ask, on a point of order, whether the honourable gentleman is speaking to the motion?",24
79,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"It is the Chair's be that the honourable member is doing so. If he fails to do so, he will be required to resume his seat.",24
80,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"The reason I oppose the motion is to make this comment: During Question Time today there have been two very important questions which have taken up a lot of time. One related to the future of wheat prices, to which the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) replied. It was a reply that the Parliament should have heard. The reply that the Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) gave regarding Nomad aircraft was a reply that the Parliament was entitled to hear-bu t not at Question Time. Both of those replies should have been given to the Parliament by way of a ministerial statement. The two Ministers concerned, instead of sending their questions to the members who asked them, should have asked the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) whether he would be willing to grant leave to them to make a statement and, in so doing, indicated to the Leader of the Opposition the nature of the statement. Had that been done, and had the Leader of the Opposition refused to grant leave, there would have been an entirely different situation. That was not done. I believe that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) ought to talk to his Ministers about the way in which they are abusing the forms of the House to draw out Question Time, thereby preventing members from asking questions. Where statements such as the two to which I have referred today have to be made, they ought to be made by way of a prepared statement to the House. I have been trying to get a question in all this week and it is pretty obvious from the way in which the Prime Minister is jumping from his place that it is not likely that I will question in tomorrow either. That is about all I want to say. The Prime Minister ought to do something with his Ministers. If that does not work and if the Leader of the Opposition proves to be unreasonable in preventing the Ministers from making statements on matters such as the two subjects to which I have referred, that is an entirely different question. But that has not been put today to the Leader of the Opposition. It should have been, and I hope it will be in future.",24
81,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"Speakin g to the point order, the honourable member for Hindmarsh Leader (Mr Clyde Cameron)",25

92,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"There is only one Opposition reason that the Leader of the Opposition tried prevent the incorporation in Hansard of the dence that the Minister wanted incorporated, and it is a very surprising reason indeed. plainly, the Minister has a responsibility to come to the defence of the Nomad when inaccurate accusations are made about an aircraft which is a fine Australian achievement, well designed, well constructed and well received by the customers.",25
93,Mr HURFORD,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"I raise a point of order. I understand that the Prime Minister is speaking in support of the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable a document to be incorporated in Hansard. I ask you, Mr Acting Speaker, which Standing Order is being suspended in order to incorporate that document, because I know of no Standing Order which get the allows incorporation in this way.",25
94,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"The motion has the effect of suspending all Standing Orders or any particular Standing Order which would prevent the incorporation, and that is the spirit of the motion.",25
95,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"The Minister was very properly coming to the defence of the Nomad, and the Labor Party quite plainly by its interjections and points of order does not want to hear that.",25
96,Dr EVERINGHAM,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"I raise a point of order. The of Prime Minister has imputed motives to the of the Opposition in relation to his reason for raising his point of order and the objection to the incorporation. I ask you, Mr Acting Speaker, to ask the Prime Minister to withdraw that",25
97,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"There is no subin Hansard stance to the point of order. Mr Innes- I raise a further point of order. My point of order goes to the substance of the motion moved by the Leader of the House. He moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable a procedure to take place. The Minister is debating the issue that evolved out of the question that was asked and not the reason why the orders of the House ought to be the suspended, and he is out of order.",25
98,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"There is no subLeader stance to the point of order. Mr Morris-Speakin g in opposition to the only one motion, Mr Acting Speaker",25
99,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,Order! The Prime Minister still has the call.,25
100,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"It is perfectly plain that the Opposition, and the Leader of the in particular, do not want to allow to this Parliament to be used as a proper forum for evithe defence of a very fine Australian achievement. If it had not been for false points of order Quite and phoney points of order which have been taken successively by the Opposition, this matter could have been concluded long ago.",25
101,Mr HOLDING,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,I raise a point of order. The issue before the Chair is the suspension of the Standing Orders and the Prime Minister is not entitled to deal with other substantive matters which were the subject of answers.

The document read asfollowsNA A significant indication of the acceptance of the Nomad as a product can be gauged from those customers who have placed subsequent orders for aircraft after a period of sampling the capability of their first aircraft. A list of these customers and the number of re-orders is set out below: Douglas Airways (PNG)-Fou r separate purchases Club Air (Australia)-Purchas e of a second Nomad six months after the first Provincial (PNC)-Secon d aircraft twelve months after first Geosearch (Australia)-Purchas e a second aircraft nine months after the acquisition of the first RFDS, NSW Section-Purchase d a second aircraft two months after first Indonesian Navy-Initia l acquisition-si x Searchmaster B Nomads, repeat six Searchmaster B Nomads two years later (The Indonesian Government has recently requested the provision of a funher six Nomads-to a total of 18-unde r Defence Aid; these last six to be Searchmaster L) The following verbatim quotations have been extracted from GAF correspondence files: Testimonial from Royal Flying Doctor Service, NSW Section: At the handover of the first Nomad aircraft to the Royal Flying Doctor Service, NSW Section in mid 1978, Dr Golland, the Chairman, referred to the basis of selection of Nomad for this role. He indicated that the aircraft had been chosen entirely on its merits and the equipment selection did not have any relationship to the source of funding for the RFDS operations. A thorough evaluation was carried out of a large range of aircraft and the decision in favour of Nomad was made on the basis of economy of operation, maintenance record, the most suitable fuselage layout which was judged to be ideal for RFDS purposes and other capabilities available with Nomad. Ken Simmelink, Vice President-Asia , Missionary Aviation Fellowship 'Our Nomad N22B has been in operation in Irian Jaya, Indonesia for just over 13 months. During that time it has flown more than 1000 hours in some of the most rugged terrain in the world. It has flown in and out of 400 metre mountain airstrips with payloads hours were flown in emergency earthquake relief operations carrying more than 900,000 Ib of food and other relief supplies to earthquake victims in the remote mountains and canyons of Irian Jaya. ' I just want to report the Nomad has not let us down. It has, in fact, surpassed our that you said it would be-and more. Our maintenance has been minimal. We in MAF salute the GAF. You have designed and built a truly rugged, meets all our requirements.' Peter Brown, Managing Director of the Wewak-based Independent Air Transport 'The Nomad is basically an easy aircraft to maintain and, when necessary, repair. Most notable is its very good economy of operation. We mainly fly out of rough strips. Another plus for the aircraft is ease of loading. We don't use the STOL capability-ver y few strips need that. But we like the aeroplane essentially for its size of the aircraft, it's extremely easy to maintain.' Dennis Douglas, Managing Director of Port Moresby-based Douglas Airways 'This aeroplane is a good money maker now and will prove in time to be an excellent money maker. The Allison is an excellent engine. It's perfect in this aircraft in the hot and high environment we have up here. We've had really big savings on fuel through its very low consumption, and we look forward to even more once avgas becomes even more scarce in remote areas. In the long term I think aircraft will all be powered by turbines, and the Allison's consumption is way down on the PT6 on the Twin Otter. I Ve bought two Nomads and they are flying 1800 hours per year over all types of strips. I've got two more on order. John Laffan, Ferry Pilot, Superior Air Service ' I have delivered over 30 of the Nomads sold around the world-to Europe, the Philippines, South America and the USA, across both Atlantic and Pacific. I have not had one serious problem with the aircraft even at high ferry overloads, through severe turbulence, and in heavy icing during winter months around Iceland, Greenland, Northern Canada and Scandinavia. All delivery deadlines have been achieved on schedule. 'The aircraft is reliability and safety personified.' C. Swanson, Managing Director, Club Air Pty Limited TESTIMONIALS The following is an extract from letter to Mobil Oil, Libya. ' I would find it hard to convey my total appreciation of the aircraft as there are many aspects that I will not be able to mention. 'Although we have had a little trouble at the start I feel that the engine is in fact very reliable. We are conducting 12 sectors a day with one aircraft and after 700 hours we have had only two non starts. One was a faulty ignitor box and the second a faulty fuel control unit. I consider this very acceptable. The fuel control unit has caused some problem in the past, however, they now know what the problem is and it should be no real problem in the future (I might add that the problem is a slow start one and is evident a while before it fails totally.) Check valves also play up with the oil dripping out of the exhaust-w e carry spares. 'Airframe. Once again what aircraft has not any faults. The aircraft is built like the proverbial Brick Barn with only a few areas that require attention. The use of poprivetin some areas is of doubtful merit as these work and require replacement. Undercarriage will take anything and only the micro switches can be a problem (we have had two go because of water) however, the new production aircraft, I understand, have had these removed and resited on the actuator in the stubwing-n o more problem. of up to 3000 lb.

138,Mr BRYANT,NOES, I want to make it clear that this is not an argument about the Nomad aircraft. It is about reasonable parliamentary procedure. During Question Time it was reasonable for the Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) to give a short answer to the question he was asked. He could have made a more detailed statement later.,30
139,Unknown,NOES,Government members interjecting,30
140,Mr BRYANT,NOES,"Honourable members opposite are attempting to intimidate me. The Nomad aircraft is the product of all governments and has the full support of the Opposition. It would not be in operation were it not for the actions of the Labor Government. The real question is whether honourable members opposite are to be allowed to continue to subvert and dalise our parliamentary system and to obstruct the reasonable procedures that have been developed over the last 600 or 700 years to let all voices in this place be heard. The Minister for Productivity, who has been in this Parliament about five minutes, chooses to subvert Question Time to stop members of the Opposition asking questions. We know perfectly well that over the last two or three weeks every Question Time has been a time of great worry and anxiety for honourable members opposite. EverytimeMinisters, including the Minister for Productivity, answer questions, honourable members opposite sit there worrying about what sort of gaff they will produce next. Everytimewe ask the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to account for his behaviour, for the promises he has made and has broken, honourable members opposite all sit there in terror. The honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem), who has now reached the stage where his party gets about 20 per cent of the vote in Canberra, may as well take his time now. If there are any nomads about, he is one of them. He is the first political nomad. This morning, about 50 minutes ago, we suggested that the Minister for Productivity should take the opportunity after Question Time to Martin, V.J. make a statement which we could then debate. We want to put our point of view about how we should support and sponsor the Nomad. We want to know why this Government has taken steps in various areas to prevent the Nomad from being accepted as the aircraft for surveillance in Australia. Why were the specifications deliberately written so that in all probability the Nomad would not be the aircraft used for this work? These are the questions we want answered. This Parliament is the debating chamber and the forum for all points of view. Over the last few months, and particularly the last two or three weeks, we have seen an increasing suppression of Opposition points of view in the House. I have been in this Parliament long enough to understand the Government and what it is doing. In all the years I have been here some pretty rough characters and people, who have been totally insensitive to parliamentary democracy and everything else, have sat on the other side of the House; but I have not seen a government behave towards an opposition in the way in which the present Government has behaved. From the Opposition side I have seen political censorship imposed on debates in this House. When the vanhonourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) was talking a few weeks ago, two days before the election in Victoria, the Government moved to suppress the whole debate to silence him. Last year I remember that the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) was silenced on an education question in the same area. On many historic occasions the Government has taken steps to silence political comment in this place when such comment was in order. When the honourable member for Reid spoke, points of order were raised by honourable members opposite and the Deputy Speaker, in accordance with his duty and with a proper understanding of the situation, said that the remarks were in order. Honourable members opposite- I think it was probably the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier)-move d that the question be put, and the whole debate was silenced. If that state of affairs is allowed to continue this place will become another rump of a parliament such as those that exist in other parts of the Ellicott. R.J. world. This is one of the few free parliaments left Falconer. P. D. and we will fight to the last ditch to keep it that Fisher, P.S. way. We will take to the people the remarks made by honourable members opposite. Their comments and the interjections on occasions such as this will be circulated around their elec- Groom, R. J. torates. We will let their constituents know how they are treating one of the most important institutions in this country. The honourable member for Canberra who is occupying his seat only temporarily is barking like a small puppy because he has to try to impress the Prime Minister. We will let his constituents know what he is doing. It is time that we told the people of Bendigo what sort of man represents them. These are the people who will subvert every parliamentary and democratic institution in the country. this place into a bear garden. Under the leadership of the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair), who is a parliamentary disgrace when he gets warmed up, they did it when the Australian Labor Party was in office and they are continuing to do it now. Their time has come.",30

143,Mr MACPHEE,NOMAD AIRCRAFT," I really must refer to the extraordinary behaviour of the Opposition half an 68 hour ago, when this motion to suspend Standing 29 Orders was moved and the Government said that I would be willing to make a statement. We 39 have gone through an extraordinary charade of moving a motion to suspend Standing Orders to AYES which we said that we would agree. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) told us that Howard, J.W. Hunt. R.J. D. we have in some way destroyed the processes of this House. Mr Armitage- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Minister for Productivity is to make a statement on a specific issue and not on the question of Standing Orders or the remarks Lucock, P. E. MACKellar, M.J. R. of previous speakers. He is dealing with a specific issue. He is to make a statement on that, and I ask that you rule accordingly.",31
144,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"I ask the Minister Martyr. J. R. Moore, J. C to address himself to the question. Neil, M.J. Newman, K. E.",31
145,Mr MACPHEE,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"I am delighted to address myself to the question. A question was put to me at Question Time by a distinguished member of this House, who is a former airman, interested in a distinguished aircraft. It is legitimate for a bench member, a private member of the Government parties, to ask a question at Question Time. The Opposition wanted to deny him the right to do that. When, in fact, the Opposition asked me to make a statement, the Government made it clear that I would be prepared to make a statement. We need not have gone through this charade that we have just gone through. I said at Question Time",31
146,Mr BRYANT,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"Mr Acting Speaker, I take a point of order. It is fair enough in debate to make sorts of statements. The fact to stop the question. We tried to stop the lengthy answer so that we could get on with the job.",32

148,Mr MACPHEE,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"The answer was lengthy tion only because of the number of interruptions that came from the Opposition. The question was relation to an article in this morning's Canberra Times. Amongst the matters raised in the article was the questionMr Charles Jones- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. We have had enough humbug from this Minister this morning.",32
149,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"The honourable May, member for Newcastle knows full well that if wishes to raise a point of order it is not introduced in that fashion. I am not prepared accept a point of order of that nature.",32
150,Mr MACPHEE,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"It is interesting that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles shortly. Jones) speaks on this debate because last night he was trying to deny the Australian public cheap air fares to the Association of South-East Asian Nations countries. He said that in this House. Mr Charles Jones- Mr Acting Speaker, thank you for anticipating what I was going do. The Minister is a liar.",32
151,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,The honourable like a member for Newcastle will withdraw that has expression. Mr Charles Jones- I withdraw the statement. What the Minister just said is completely and totally untrue.,32
152,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,There is no point of order.,32
153,Mr MACPHEE,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"I have extolled the virtues of the Nomad aircraft on many occasions. Its versaback tility is well known to all honourable members of this House. It was designed to fill a gap in aviation, and this it did. The aircraft has a short take off and landing capacity. It has an Allison engine which has distinguished itself in helicopters. It has a great hovering capacity. As well as being a fast aircraft, it is able to hover in much the same way as helicopters were designed to do. Anyone who has seen the Nomad knows the capacity of the aircraft to land in difficult situations. It comes in several varieties which have been certified not only by the Department of Transport all but also by the United States Federal Aviation is that we did not try Authority. The basic certification for the Nomad N22 airwas granted in Australia by the Department I of Transport in April 1975. The United States Aviation Administration certification was awarded in May 1977. Certification in the Scandinavian countries will proceed as soon as the Department of Transport's de-icing certificais completed, which we expect to be in the very near future. The certification for the N22 in version to operate as a regular passenger transport was granted by the Department of Transport in January 1978 and by the Federal Aviation Administration in November 1978. Australian certification of the stretched Nomad N24 was granted on 21 October 1977. The Australian Department of Transport certification of the N24A, the commuter version, was granted in and the Federal Aviation Administration he certification was granted in November 1978. The to be floatplane version of the N22B is now with to Wipline in Minneapolis in the United States of America and has completed FAA certification trials. The FAA certification is expected very I mention those certifications because they do indicate the versatility of the Nomad. I have referred to the floatplane version. Experiments are going ahead with an amphibious version. The Nomad is an aircraft of which we can be proud. I I mentioned the hovering qualities, and the to honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) sought to construe that as meaning that it was helicopter. It is not like a helicopter but it a remarkable capacity to slow down so that it can search the ground. It is, therefore, ideally suited for surveillance purposes as well as having a capacity to land on beaches or in rough terrain in a short distance. The important capacity of the Nomad for surveillance purposes has been recognised by this Government. We have made a decision that in respect of the experimental period there are three main roles of surveillance aircraft, and in each of those three roles the Nomad will be used. At the end of the experimental period, Cabinet will again consider the precise nature of our surveillance contribution and the precise role the Nomad will have in it. In respect of marketing the aircraft, I think it is fair to say that we have a marketing concept which has established a world-wide network of distributors and agents. Distributorships and agencies have been appointed in Australia and overseas countries. We cover New Zealand, South East Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, Southern Europe, Pakistan, South and Central Americas, the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Scandinavia, India and the Philippines. We have a most extensive array of distributors. The Nomad has been exhibited at many overseas air shows, including a current one in the United States and one shortly to be held in Paris. The Nomad aircraft has aroused great customer interest from all over the world. I have mentioned before in this Parliament the number of countries in which the aircraft is operating. Time and time again the Government has showed its support for the aircraft. In fact, it has given approval to the production of a total of 145 aircraft, and we have arrangements in train for evaluating future requirements. One of the points I was trying to make in Question Time this morning was in relation to customer satisfaction. It surprised me that the journalist in question did not seek to talk to people who have had experience in flying the Nomad. Most people who have been in Papua New Guinea or elsewhere in the Pacific know that the mission pilots are very skilled and experienced pilots who really test their aircraft to the full. They demand a great deal from their aircraft. Let me quote the words of Mr Simmelink, who is the Vice-President for Asia, of the Missionary Aviation Fellowship: Our Nomad N22B has been in operation in Irian Jaya, Indonesia for just over 13 months. During that time it has flown more than 1000 hours in some of the most rugged terrain in the world. It has flown in and out of400 metre mountain airstrips with payloads hours were flown in emergency earthquake relief operations carrying more than 900,000 lb of food and other relief supplies to earthquake victims in the remote mountains and canyons of Irian Jaya. I just want to report the Nomad has not let us down. in fact, surpassed our expectations. Performance is all that you said it would be-and more. Our maintenance has been minimal. We in MAF salute the GAF. You have designed and built a truly rugged, high performing aircraft. It meets all our requirements. The only other comment I wish to make is to quote Mr John Lallan, the ferry pilot of Superior Air Services, who says: I have delivered over 30 of the Nomads sold around the world-to Europe, the Philippines, South America and the United States of America, across both Atlantic and the Pacific. I have not had one serious problem with the aircraft even at high ferry overloads, through severe turbulence, and in heavy icing during winter months around Iceland. Greenland, Northern Canada and Scandinavia. All delivery deadlines have been achieved on schedule. The aircraft is reliability and safety personified. I believe that the confidence which this Government has shown in the Nomad is more than vindicated by those remarks. In addition, those remarks more than vindicate the certification granted to the aircraft by both the Department of Transport in Australia and the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. Each of those authorities has an excellent safety record, and Australian civil aviation can be very confident that the Nomad satisfies all of their criteria. I present the following paper: Nomad Aircraft-Ministeria l Statement, 6 June 1979. Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",32
154,Mr MORRIS,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,This morning in this House we have seen an exercise in obstruction by the Government and an exercise in abuse of parliamentary procedures which is wholly unjustifiedMr Ruddock- I wish to raise a point of order.,33
155,Mr MORRIS,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"Are you going to take the time now? You are still disrupting. Mr Ruddock-Th efirstpoint of order taken on the previous speaker, the Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) came from a speaker on the opposite side of the House who said that the Minister was not speaking to the paper when he did not immediately start to discuss the Nomad aircraft but discussed proceedings that had gone on before. The Minister was called to order by the Acting Speaker. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to ensure that the Opposition complies with the same standard that was set in relation to the Minister for Productivity and that the honourof up to 3000 Ib. Well over 800 able member for Shortland speaks to the paper on the question of the Nomad aircraft and nothing else.",33
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"I It has, naturally agree with the point of order that was taken on the previous speaker and with the decision that was given at the time. I ask the honourable member for Shortland to address himself to the statement.",33
157,Mr MORRIS,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"Might I also suggest that a short time ago the House supported a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. Within that motion for the suspension of Standing Orders was a very important motion that the Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) should explain the Government's action in initially drawing aircraft surveillance tenders in a form that excluded utilisation of Nomad aircraft. It is significant the Minister did not touch at all on the very important thrust of the motion that had been adopted by the House. The Minister responsible not only got the Nomad confused with helicopters-h e thought it could hover like a helicopter on the basis of its having the same engine manufacturer-bu the also could not even get around to the substance of the motion. Here we get back to the real story of the Nomad aircraft with this Government. The Nomad has been an orphan, an unwanted aircraft with the conservatives opposite. It was the subject last year of perate ministerial brawls between the Minister for Productivity, the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). As I recall it, the Minister for Productivity ried out backroom briefings of the Press on how he was losing out, and how the aircraft surveilsatisfactory lance guidelines and the tender documents which were being drawn would exclude the issue? Nomad aircraft. The Minister responsible was unable to persuade his fellow ministers to utilise the Australian product. At that verytimeI was at the Farnborough Air Show. I inspected the Nomads on display. I was there on the afternoon that the Belgium and Netherlands police forces were to be given demonstrationflightsin the use of that aircraft for police surveillance work. returned to Australia a week later and learned that there was a solid campaign in this country by the senior ministers of the Government-no t by the junior boy, almost the lowest ranking minister, but by the heavies-to exclude the use Nomad aircraft in aircraft surveillance around the Australian coast. Let us put to rest the bleating and complaints of the Minister for Productivity about his Government's attitude to the Nomad aircraft. The record shows that it was an craft. It was an orphan aircraft. It was not until the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) got involved as a result of pressure by the Opposition and the public and media attention compromise was made. The record shows that the tender document guidelines were changed that the aircraft could be used whereas under the original guidelines it could not have been used. say that the Opposition from the beginning has always supported the development, manufacture, marketing and utilisation of this fine Australian-built aircraft.",34
158,Mr HODGMAN,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,You are its worse knockers.,34
159,Mr MORRIS,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"The honourable member is a disgrace to the Parliament. The safety, performthat ance and the rebuttal of allegations against the aircraft's performance are important and should have been the subject of a ministerial statement. A bleating statement has been dragged out of the Minister. He has been forced into making a report to the House. In the process he has got confused with helicopters. He did not know what he was talking about. Mr Macphee-Rubbish .",34
160,Mr MORRIS,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"It is not rubbish. The Hansard record will show the Minister's detailed explanation. For once he should be factual. The perdes- formance of the aircraft warrants a parliamentary debate. The back door method of writing a Dorothy Dix question, giving it to a back bencher and then trying to read the answer is an abuse of Question Time. That is what happened this morning. We saw a deliberate abuse of carQuestion Time by a Minister without the courage or expertise in this subject to make a full and statement in the Parliament on a very important issue. Is this not an important Mr Macphee-Of course it is.",34
161,Mr MORRIS,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"Why did the Minister not make a ministerial statement? Why did he use the back door method of answering a Dorothy Dix question, the cheapest and most paltry form of parliamentary procedure, to get a statement. I across and protect himself from any kind of response from the Opposition? That was the performance of the lowest ranking Minister. Mr Bourchier- I take a point of order. The of shadow Minister at the table is making comments that are totally incorrect. The Minister was trying to support a motion.",34
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"Mr Armitage)Order! The honourable member for Bendigo will resume his seat. He has been warned by the Acting Speaker time and again about taking frivolunwanted airous points of order. Mr Bourchier- I take exception to your comments, Mr Deputy Speaker. I did not take a frivthat a olous point of order.",34
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"The honourable so member for Bendigo has been warned time and again by the Acting Speaker about raising frivolI ous points of order. He is well aware that the attempt to take the point of order which he has just raised was not valid. Mr Bourchier- Mr Deputy Speaker, I am asking you",34
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. I have ruled that there is no substance in the point of order. I ask the honourable member to address himself to the Standing Orders relating to points of order. The honourable member for Shortland was discussing a matter. It is not in order for honourable members to enter the debate by taking points of order. Mr Ruddock- I raise a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to what I regard as a breach of your earlier ruling. The honourable member for Shortland is canvassing the debate and not speaking to the motion that the House take note of the paper.",35
165,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,The honourable member for Shortland will need to address himself strictly to the statement under discussion. I ask him to do that.,35
166,Mr MORRIS,NOMAD AIRCRAFT,"It is quite clear that the Government is so sensitive on this issue that it does not want to debate it. That is why it is disrupting the debate on the statement. I return to the substance of the motion which called for an explanation of the Government's action in initially drawing aircraft surveillance tenders in a form that excluded utilisation of the Nomad aircraft. Can somebody from the Government side-obviousl y the Minister is incapable of doing so-explai n to the Parliament why this aircraft has suddenly become the subject of so much attention and why the Minister answered a Dorothy Dix question in the House today when the aircraft was rejected outright by the Government only a few months ago? Why the contradiction? Perhaps when the Government has enough courage and expertise we will get an answer. I refer to the facts. The first major air order Nomad aircraft was placed by the Whitlam Government. Those aircraft were to be used in the Northern Territory medical and health services. There was no mention of that by the Minister for Productivity. The Minister in his statement sought, firstly, to elude the main thrust of the question and, secondly, to try to score some petty political point. The other matters referred to in the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders which I moved included the quality and the economies of the aircraft. No one doubts the quality of the aircraft. No one doubts its economies. Yet the Minister told us nothing of those matters. This is an imponant subject. A detailed statement should have been made setting out those matters. The Minister did not make such a statement. We heard only a smattering of information about the advantages of the Nomad for the varying types of tasks at hand. The whole exercise was a ruse to get a little publicity for a Minister who cannot make a proper ministerial statement on a very important subject. The crucial matter is the safety performance of the aircraft. I ask honourable members whether it is good enough when the safety performance of the major aircraft manufactured by Australian industry is under serious challenge in the media for the Minister to use a Dorothy Dix question to try to dismiss the matter. We say that that is not good enough. It underlines the cursory support of this Government for the Nomad aircraft. The Government did not want it. The Prime Minister forced the Government to order it and change the aircraft surveillance guidelines. Why did the guidelines change? That is the question that needs to be answered. We understand from the various statements and programmed leaks from the Government side that the Nomad was not considered fast enough. The Government wanted a faster aircraft to catch the baddies. When the baddies got a faster aircraft the Department of Defence would have asked for a faster aircraft still. As one writer who took this process to its logical conclusion said, we would have had to equip the surveillance force with Mirages. That would have been the only way we could have kept up. From that kind of idiotic argument we come back to the fact that the guidelines were suddenly changed overnight to enable the utilisation of the Nomad aircraft. Why? Who stood on whom? Who was brawling with whom? I have outlined the concern of the Minister for Transport. I neglected to mention the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) who should have been included. I also referred for to the Minister for Productivity and some input from the Department of Defence. Again, on this very important subject about which the Government pretends it has concern, we have been given no explanation. The most ridiculous statement of all was that of the Minister for Productivity in describing the engine capacity of the Nomad aircraft. He said that Allison engines which are used in helicopters because of their hovering capacity are admirable for the Nomad aircraft. My rough recollection is that a Nomad aircraft has a stalling speed of about 100 miles an hour. Unless the Minister for Productivity and the whizz kids in his research section have developed some method by which the Nomad aircraft can hover at 100 miles an hour, I am very sorry for the Minister. I would like him to try to hover in a Nomad aircraft with Allison engines just like a helicopter. It is not good enough lor him to say that that is not what he said. The record will show what he said. He did not know what he was talking about. I now refer to overseas marketing. I think it is a great feather in the cap of the Nomad aircraft and the Government Aircraft Factories that the certification of the aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States will open up new avenues for the sale of the aircraft. We welcome that. We also welcome the Government's efforts, although they were not as strong as they might have been, in developing a wider market acceptance of the Nomad aircraft on a global basis. We would have to agree with that. We would have to agree with the marketing of the aircraft abroad. But as I said earlier, it is a pretty poor kind of sales exercise to be trying to convince people at foreign air shows that they ought to use aircraft for the very purpose for which this Government has rejected them. Even though the Minister's statement, forced upon him as it was, is some addition to public knowledge on Nomad aircraft and to the claims made in today's Canberra Times, it is not a satisfactory response to the issue at hand.

In the House today the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman) claimed that he had not seen a minute circulated at Lucas Heights which claimed that security had been tightened up because of an alleged threat by Japanese anti-nuclear activists. The Minister claimed that I had not complied with requests to make the minute available. That is not correct. Last night a member of the Minister's staff agreed to call at my office to collect the minute. A member of my staff and I waited for 15 minutes after the House had risen, but no one from the Minister's staff came to collect that document. This morning, at five past nine, I made a copy available to a member of the Minister's office. Clearly the Minister needs another alibi for his incompetent reply this morning at Question Time. NA Ministerial Statement",37
177,Mr ELLICOTT,NORTHERN TERRITORY FORESTRY,"by leave-In accordance with the procedure to be followed with respect to reports tabled by Parliamentary committees, as outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to this House on 25 May 1978,I wish to make a statement on the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure relating to the Northern Territory forestry program. (Quorum formed). This report was tabled in the House of Representatives on 2 June 1978 and there was a short but informative debate on the subject. The report was very critical of the Northern Territory forestry program and recommended that it be substantially reduced, particularly in relation to wood plantings. As honourable members will know, responsibility for forestry matters passed to the Northern Territory Government on 1 July 1978 when the Territory gained self-government. The report has therefore been made available to the Northern Territory Government to assist it in the consideration of future forestry policies, and I am sure that it will find the report helpful. There are a few points of detail about the report that should, I feel, be mentioned. In relation to the activities of the Forestry and Timber Bureau of the Department of Primary Industry, it should be noted that, although the initial survey was undertaken by a Bureau officer in the late 1950s, the Bureau ceased to have executive responsibility for the program in July 1967. Thereafter, the Bureau's work in the Northern Territory was confined to research into the species that should be grown and the various problems that became evident. The Standing Committee recommended a substantial reduction in funding for the Northern Territory forestry program in 1978-79. As honourable members will be aware, expenditure priorities are now determined by the Northern Territory Executive within the limit of the funds available, including the grant from the Gommonwealth. In fact, the Northern Territory Government in its 1978-79 Budget has diverted a significant proportion of the operational expenditure of the former Forestry Branch to parks and gardens operations in Darwin, Alice Springs and other locations. I am also advised that the Northern Territory Government has taken action to incorporate the Forestry Unit into the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission in recognition of the major conservation PROGRAM role of forestry. The Committee also recommended that any future financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth for softwood plantation operations in the Northern Territory should be determined on the same basis as now applied to the States of Australia. The Softwood Forestry Agreement Act 1978 authorises loans to the States to cover maintenance costs of softwood plantations established with Commonwealth assistance under the three previous Acts. The Northern Territory was not a party to those agreements and does not qualify for assistance under the 1978 Act. However, under the Memorandum of Understanding in respect of financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and a self-governing Northern Territory, it is open softfor the Northern Territory Government to seek a specific purpose payment for forestry from 1979-80 under similar conditions applying to the States. Under the Memorandum of Understanding such payments would be accompanied by a reduction in general purpose funds to the Northern Territory. Should further agreements be made with the States for financial assistance for softwood forestry plantations, the Northern Territory Government would have the opportunity to participate in the negotiation of those agreements. The Government appreciates the value of the Committee's report which, as such reports should be, was searching and, where it seemed necessary to the Committee, critical. In view of the highly technical nature of the matter, however, the then Minister for the Northern Territory considered it desirable to obtain further expert technical advice on some of the important matters raised. He therefore arranged through the Queensland Minister for Lands, Forestry and Water Resources for a technical evaluation to be undertaken by professional officers of the Queensland Department of Forestry. This report was duly received. It endorsed, with some qualification, findings of the Standing Committee regarding further research, but favoured the continuation of further plantings on Melville Island and some native forestry projects. The Government is grateful to the Queensland authorities for undertaking this task, and the report will be made available to interested parties on request. The Government believes that the two reports, although differing in certain respects, will form a valuable basis for consideration by the Northern Territory Government of its future forestry policies. Although, as I have said, the subject matter of the Standing Committee's report relates to functions and responsibilities of the Northern Territory Government, the Commonwealth Government is grateful to the Standing Committee for its analysis and recommendations. I present the following paper: Northern Territory Forestry Program-Ministeria ment, 6 June 1979. Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",37
178,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY FORESTRY,"As Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure and of the Sub-committee which inquired into the Northern Territory forestry program, I will respond to the remarks of the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott). I know that the Vice-chairman of the sub-committee and a third member, the honourable member for Perth (Mr MCLean), also want to say a few words. The members of the Committee are very disappointed with the response that has been given to the work that the Subcommittee has carried out. First of all, we are disappointed that the urgency of the response has not been heeded by the Government or the Minister. The Minister mentioned that our report was submitted on 25 May 1978. He knows that the response to that report should be made within six months, according to the advice of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The response came more than 12 months after the report was submitted to this House. The members of the Sub-committee feel that that fact deserves at least the barest of passing references, but it did not gain any from the Minister. The history of the Sub-committee's attitude to the Northern Territory forestry program needs to be recounted. We were informed in late March 1978 by a former member of the Expenditure Committee that this matter should be investigated. We knew that substantial self government responsibilities were to be handed to the Northern Territory on 1 July 1978. So within a short period and with very expert advice we made a report, not one word of which is in dispute. Where there is a pretence at dispute, such as by the Chief Secretary of the Northern Territory Administration, that pretence is shot down by a report of his own officers. I will read the words of that report into Hansard in a few minutes. The upshot of the Sub-committee's report is that, whilst its members are mollified with statements that the work of the Sub-committee was found to be useful, good, deserving of praise and so on, not one skerrick of our recommendation on financial restraint or financial consequence is to be put upon the Northern Territory Administration. That simply means that $25m to $30m has been wasted. In 1979 dollars terms that is not a small amount of money. All the circumstances exist for a waste of $25m to $30m to continue del Statespite our report. That ought to concern this House. I know that it concerns all members of the Expenditure Committee, irrespective of the party to which they belong. It is true that in the middle of last year an investigation of our report was commissioned by two Queensland foresters, a Mr Hawkins and another gentleman whose name escapes me. That report has been relied upon by the Northern Territory Administration to justify its attitude. I want to read into the Hansard the results of the investigation of that report by officers of Mr Everingham's Department in the Northern Territory itself. They are significant. This has not yet been disclosed. In a five-page report they very substantially supported all the work that the Expenditure Committee had performed. I will quote from the report: After 20 years in the forestry business we do not seem to have much to show. For example-n o commercial forests; no approved species on areas of development; a large amount of research still required. A report from QueenslandThat is the report on our submission to this House. . . does not necessarily justify what has been, or is being, done nor does it rescind the House of Representatives report on the economies of the venture. It states that 'still large amounts of research are required before doing anything else'. Yet funding is to continue from the Commonwealth Government for doing something else. One principal example is 400 acres a year of plantation on Melville Island for which there is no justification whatsoever from any scientific or rational authority. I will speak for only a few more minutes because I think this is a significant matter. The Forestry and Timber Bureau of the Department of Primary Industry cannot escape responsibility. There is the reference in the Minister's statement to the fact that the Bureau ceased to have executive responsibility for the program in July 1967. That carries with it the impression that what has happened since that time is not of the Bureau's doing. That is not quite correct. I want to deal with this at some length. A letter was written last year to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) discounting that disclaimer. I do not want to seek to incorporate that letter in Hansard, but I want to say this: The big leap forward in terms of Northern Territory forestry occurred from the late 1960s to 1975. The Director of the Forestry and Timber Bureau was on the interdepartmental committee which recommended that big leap forward. I suggest that the Minister ought to ask for the minutes of that IDC on that leap forward which is the time period which principally accounts for the appalling waste that has occurred. The disclaimer cannot be accepted. It was unanimously supportedMr Ellicott-What IDC is that?",38
179,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY FORESTRY,"The IDC on the Northern Territory forestry program on which Dr Cromer sat and which accounts for the expansion of activities in the period up to 1975-76. There was unanimous support for that recommendation and he was involved with it. I will comment on only one or two other points because the other members of the Sub-committee want to make some remarks as well. The plain fact is that there was a forestry partment in the Northern Territory. That departhas ment has now been incorporated into what is called the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission. Very little work was done and a of cover-up was involved. On our information the Forestry Section of that Commission consists of a larger number of personnel than worked the Forestry Department which has been scarified and lacerated by our report, and justifiably so. How can governments claim a program of some austerity under those circumstances when there was one rule for some parts of Australia and apparently another in respect of the Forestry Department of the Northern Territory Administration? It is a ludicrous set of circumstances. We agree with the report that if there is to be a commencement of activities it ought to be after adequate research. That is not the case now. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is carrying out research which should be appropriate to the situation. We believe that expansion or maintenance of softwood plantation activities should be pursued under the Softwood Forestry Agreement and that financial assistance should be provided at rates of interest which are acceptable to the Australian Forestry Council. Nothing that has been said this morning, nothing contained in the report of the Queensland foresters and nothing discovered in the investigation of both reports by the Northern Territory Administration disputes the substance of what was submitted to this House over one year ago. Every skerrick of the sub-committee report is correct, and the members of that subcommittee are not inclined to retreat from it one iota. If every skerrick of that report is correct, there has to be and there should be financial consequences that flow from that fact. There is no point in saying: 'What you said is correct, what you said is true and what you said is right, but let us ignore the economic, financial and money consequences that flow from it and pretend that nothing has occurred'. That is contrary to common sense, contrary to the procedures of this House and contrary to what we present to the Australian people. The funding for the Northern Territory forestry program should not be included in the general grants for the Northern Territory so that we do not know how much it is. A waste of $25m to $30m has occurred. We should not allow this to continue. There is a sense of some anger. I know dethe honourable member for Perth (Mr MCLean) a welling, although subdued sense of anger about these matters. The same sense of anger wells up in the honourable member for Parlot ramatta (Mr John Brown), who has a stoic-like face. I know those honourable members want to say something. We have the abiding impression in that there is a sense of co-operation between bureaucracies trying to maintain themselves. Debate interrupted. NA",39
180,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ALLEGATIONS AGAINST MEMBER,"Yesterday in response to a quesuon directed to me by the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Burns) regarding the implied allegation by Senator O'Byrne that a member of the House of Representatives was summoned to my office regarding a barbecue set allegedly missing from the Senate courtyard for several days I replied to the effect that there was absolutely no substance to the implied allegation. I am informed also by the Secretary of the Joint House Department that a barbecue set had not been removed from the Senate courtyard. The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) requested that, because of concern felt by honourable senators and members, I in con circumstances of the alleged event and report to the House. I have to inform the House that, following the earlier raising of the matter by  ducted an investigation and reported to the Senate at some length. The essential element of  recorded in full in the Senate Hansard of 4 June 1979, was the report of the Secretary of the Joint House Department furnished in response to Mr President's request. The report is itemised and I shall read it for the benefit of honourable members. It states: Allegation by Senator Cavanagh Departmental investigations have been carried out into the following aspects or the allegations by Senator Cavanagh. These investigations have failed to produce any evidence in support of the allegations made. Medical Treatment The record of medical treatment given in the first-aid room contains no entry to support the statement that Mr Pretty was doctored with bandaids, et cetera, in the first-aid room'. Barbecue Fire The foreman Gardener has reported there is no evidence of recent fires being set or lit in the Senate or House resentatives Gardens. Administrative Action The senior administrative staff of the Department comprise: The Secretary- Mr E. J. Donnelly Security Co-ordinator- Mr W. J. MCLaren Chief Executive Officer- Mr R. L. Burrell Senior Administrative Officer- Mr M. D. T. Niven They first became aware of the allegations as a result of Senator Cavanagh's statement and each has denied involvement in or any knowledge of any administrative action or  Police Enquiries have been made of the Commonwealth Police and the preliminary police reply trols were not aware of any incident of the nature alleged. It has not been possible to interview the female employee allegedly involved because she is not identified in the allegations and the Joint House Depanment has no information which would enable identification. Signed E. J. DONNELLY, 4June 1979 It will be recalled that, in an earlier statement by the President to the Senate, the Secretary of the Joint House Department had advised him as follows: The statement of events made by Senator Cavanagh has   of all the alleged events. As undertaken to the House yesterday, I have  jointly come to the conclusion that all proper avenues of inquiry have been explored. We are led to the conclusion that there is no substance in the allegations as originally raised by Senator Cavanagh and supplemented, to some extent, by the subsequent question in the Senate by Senator Justin O'Byrne. It is proper that I should add that, following the President's statement to the Senate on 31 May acquainting the Senate of the result of his inquiries, Senator Cavanagh immediately apologised to anyone he had injured and to the Senate. In all the circumstances, it is not my intention to pursue the matter further.",40
181,Unknown,ALLEGATIONS AGAINST MEMBER,Sitting suspended from 12.58 to 2.15 p.m. NA NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed.,40
182,Mr JOHN BROWN,PROGRAM,"In speaking to the response that the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) has made to a report of the Standing Committee on Expenditure I would like to start my remarks by suggesting to the Minister that the whole response leads me to of Rep- wonder what parliamentary committees are for. I wonder whether they are set up only to be a sop to the back benchers on the Government side to keep them busy or whether they are really set up to provide objective, rational, critical analysis of government programs, their aims, objectives and performances. The Expenditure Committee under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) and formerly under the Deputy Chairmanship of our late lamented colleague, Mr Frank Stewart, exemplifies the real reason for the Parliament's existence. Surely bipartisan investigation of public expenditure is one of the real reasons why all members are sent here by our electorates. We beindicates that the police palieve that the results which this Committee has produced in a number of subjects have been non-political, bipartisan, honest assessments of expenditure of public funds. The Northern Territory forestry examination was a classical example of that rationale being implemented. The three members of the subcommittee, the honourable member for Lilley, the honourable member for Penh (Mr MCLean) and I , had the complimentary advice of Australia's most eminent forester, Mr Kel MCGRATH, who is the former Dean of Forestry at the Australian National University and who has been decorated by the United Nations for his work in the forests of Brazil. There is nobody in Australia with a higher degree of expertise in forestry area than Kel MCGRATH. We were very lucky to have his services. I would like to reacquaint members of the House with the history of the project. The investigation into Northern Territory Forestry was promoted by a report which was made to the Parliament by the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins), who suggested that there might be some scope for forestry in the Northern Territory. The history of the report is that the Committee, after its short investigation, discovered that there had been a $30m waste of public money over 20 years. I would think that the report we issued should be a salutary warning to governments, and particularly to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, of how governments can be seduced and fooled by devious officials. The original Cabinet submission of 1959 which promoted the scheme was an exaggerated assessment of the Northern Territory's forestry potential. These reports were provided by people either blatantly dishonest or lacking in accept. the technical expertise they were supposed to possess. Their error was probably a combination of both factors, that is, poor advice provided by mediocre foresters with a more than acute sense of potential empire building. Over the years this web of deception and/or ignorance, inexcusable from highly paid people described as experts, has been allowed to spread until a pathetic ation revealed by our inquiry 20 years later was ultimately reached. The sub-committee, on its visit to the Northern Territory, was appalled not only by what it found but what it did not find. The gentleman to I referred earlier, Mr Kel MCGRATH, spent days the forestry areas looking for what he aptly desearch scribed as the mythical tree, even one that was worth harvesting. The professional sense of Mr MCGRATH, a world renowned forester, was questionnaires assailed and offended by what the Department was exhibiting as its precious resource. The native eucalypts have practically no commercial value and the pine plantations exhibited growth rates well below accepted levels. The scheme was originally set up with three high-sounding ideals; preserving the natural resource, providing youthful employment for Aborigines and conserving the soil, water and wildlife. On each count it has been a splendid failure. In 1955 a report was published by an eminent forester named Mr Bateman which stated in unequivocal terms the limitations on forestry development in the Northern Territory. This report was a realistic assessment of the Northern Territory forestry resources and its little potential for the development. The report gave due recognition to the realities of the Northern Territory environment. Despite the truth of this report a large forestry organisation was developed. The organisation was significant in terms of Northern Territory expenditure and personnel employed. This organisation completely overshadowed the meagre forestry resource. The forest itself had always offered mute protests. Despite paper expectations and peoples' opinions, the resource remained as it was and always will be, a very poor and primitive one. The simple figures of this 1955 report illustrate the overstatement of the Department's view of its resources. For example, the Maningrida area had, according to the Depanment, a projected output of 2,245 super feet an acre. The real production and what was eventually produced was accurately nominated by the 1955 report as 100 super feet an acre. The 100 super feet an acre is a much different result from a projection of 2,245 feet an acre. That figure is something we cannot There are a few other interesting statistics which come from the report, but I will not bore the House with the lot of them. A few of them are these: The Department of Aboriginal Affairs admits to spending $870,000 since 1971 for Aboriginal enterprises in forestry. The total return situ- has been $33,000. At Umbakumba, $45,000 was spent with no return. At Maningrida $370,000 was spent in 1975-76 for a return of $ 1,500. Even that does not include a quarter of a million dollars spent on a defunct sawmill which we saw rusting away. The Commonwealth Scientific and whom Industrial Research Organisation has spent in $948,000 in less than three years on forestry rewith such a significant lack of results that it is now withdrawn from the Northern Territory. One of the answers to one of the sub-committee's suggested that surveyed areas of natural timber on Melville Island totalled 695,000 hectares. As the total area of Melville Island is only 570,000 we wondered where the area to plant the rest would be found. Overstatements like these are fairly typical of the figures that were quoted to us. One simple fact emerges. Despite the idealism of the original concept, despite the great efforts over the years of many of the more devoted forestry staff to conquer the myriad of problems, the grant dream is in tatters. One telling statistic fully illustrates the history of this ill-conceived and disastrous venture. The Department in 1974 informed the Forwood Conference that the anticipated production of hardwood sawlogs in the Territory in 1980 would be 58,000 cubic metres. Despite criticism from foresters, this figure for 1980 production was raised again in 1977 to 82,000 cubic metres. The Committee is now informed that the figure has been revised in 1978 to zero. The Minister, in his response to our report, does less than justice to the amount of work which went into the investigations and ultimate report of the Standing Committee on Expenditure. The Minister has virtually said: 'Thanks for your trouble but the Northern Territory now has self-government and may use the money it gets anyway it likes'. This reply to the Committee's report is certainly not good enough. The Committee was well aware of the approach of self government in the Northern Territory when it started the investigation. The Minister virtually tells us now that the Committee's report is superfluous. Although the Committee's investigation did not commence until 26 April, the report was tabled on 2 June, for the reason of the approach of self-government. That was stated, in fact, in the introduction of the report. Indeed, as the inquiry proceeded, the need for urgency became startlingly evident so that necessary Commonwealth action could be taken before the Territory obtained self-government on 1 July. As the Committee began to find, an estimated $30m in expenditure had been wasted. It was essential, the Committee decided, that the convestment ditions under which the Territory obtained the money from the Commonwealth should be should clearly understood by the Northern Territory Government to exclude the possibility of the tinuance of this profligacy. In contrast, the ter saw no urgency at all in the matter. Instead treating it as one demanding immediate the Minister has not even observed the procedure outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The Prime Minister promised that all committee reports would be answered within six months. I refer the House to the fact that the Committee's report was tabled on 2 1978 and the response has been made on 7 June 1979. Meanwhile the Northern Territory Government has comfortably settled into the new order which in the absence of any action from the Commonwealth relative to the Committee's report is, in this matter of forestry, merely a continuation of the old order to which the Committee tried to apply the brakes. The Minister's statement indicates incorrectly that the Northern Territory has diverted a significant proportion of the operational expenditure of the former Forestry Branch to parks and gardens operations in Darwin, Alice Springs and other locations. He does not indicate that the expenditure of public funds has been reduced to the extent of a curtailment in forestry funds, but merely that they have found an additional way of spending the money. Surely the Minister does not imply that he believes this is compatible with the austerity the Government is attempting to impose on practically every other avenue of government expenditure? The intention to continue planting on Melville Island is one of the more unjustified examples that the Northern Territory Government is now showing of its absolute lack of faith in our report. A decision to continue planting would rank with the decision to spend millions of dollars on resource inventory in the hope of a woodchip export, for which there never has been any possibility because of the constant burning of forests by the Aborigines in the Northern Territory. Since the Minister's statement appears to accept the Queenslander's rejection of the report for the cessation of Melville Island softwood afforestation, as was instanced by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns), it is pertinent to examine this aspect of the report. It is worth noting that the Chief Minister s investigators asked the interesting question: If it truly believed that forestry can be an economicaal proposition in the Northern Territory, 'why not try to attract private enterprise to undertake forestry production?' Why not, indeed? Private inin afforestation has been established elsewhere in Australia for half a century. Why it not be established near Darwin, which is starved for local supplies and entirely depencondent on costly imports? Perhaps private afforesMinistation would make a killing there, although one of should examine the rationale under which the action, Northern Territory forestry operates. There are a number of cautions which private enterprise would consider before it put money into a forestry venture. It is justifiable that governments would expect to make less profit on June their revenue than perhaps private industry would make, but when we look at the problems involved I do not think that stands up to examination. The Melville Island prospects are too low for even a government to accept a combination of impossibly low productivity, Northern Territory termites, floods, fires, climate problems, soils, cyclones, Aboriginal ownership and Aboriginal burning traditions. All of these add up to a formidable parcel. All but the last two are not unknown elsewhere, but each hazard is extreme under Northern Territory conditions. In combination, they add up to a pretty disturbing prospect. The Queensland foresters saw three other ways of spending forestry money in the Northern Territory, and the Committee rejected all three without reservation. Particularly in relation to softwood afforestation, we felt that here was just another example of what an increasing number of expert examiners have concluded to be the reason for failure after failure in the Northern Territory, namely, the idea that all one needs to do is transplant the technology of the temperate regions to the Northern Territory and it is bound to succeed. Despite early promise, it has always failed when it develops to the point of putting stress on the slender resources of the site. This has been fully documented time and time again. As Heatley, who is a very eminent author, concludes in his scholarly work 'The Government of the Northern Territory"": Neither should the lessons of Territory history too many failures have occurred in the past to discount the likelihood of others in the future. In that event, however, there would be one significant difference; for the first time (i.e. since self-government) the responsibility for failure could not be attributed so easily mote administration. I hope the people of the Northern Territory bear that in mind, because so it has been in Northern Territory forestry-bot h failure and the passing of the buck to Canberra. Plantations of cypress pine on Melville Island were commended to the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science by the Northern Territory chief forester as the saviour of Darwin's dependence for its timber on costly outside supply. That was in 1971, but almost at once the cypress started to fail to live up to its promise. His expectation of a growth rate of 150 cubic ft per acre per year almost immediately started to slide as the plantations developed and began to stress the limitations of the site. That figure of 150 slipped to 100, to 60, to 50, and now, within seven years of the figure of 150 being put forward, the Queenslanders put the growth rate at about 20 cubic feet. Meanwhile, with the failure of cypress already recognised, the switch was made to pinus caribaea as the plantation species. Will it go the same way? The Queenslanders obviously hope it will not because they recommend that taxpayers' money still go into it, despite all the risks and hazards. They estimate that hopefully it will grow 10 cubic metres per hectare per annum- a productivity figure one half of the figure that is still not good enough for afforestation in South Australia, the State with the longest and greatest development of plantations in the Commonwealth. Moreover, it is a figure which is only one-fifth of that which pinus radiata plantations actually achieve on the average in that State. How the Commonwealth Treasury can now stop the Northern Territory Government spending Commonwealth money in a continuation of the practice that it inherited from its predecessor to statehood, which the Minister now defends, certainly poses a problem. As one rueful observer recently ruminated: 'Well might the taxpayer ask: ""When departmental expenditure has gathered full headlong momentum, can it ever be stopped?"" Perhaps the bureaucrat always wins'. Certainly the Minister's cavalier treatment of the Expenditure Committee's report will not help. The Minister concluded that the Government believes the two reports will form a valuable basis for consideration by the Northern Territory Government.",40
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROGRAM, Order! be ignored; The honourable member's time has expired.,43
184,Mr MCLEAN,PROGRAM," I want briefly to support the remarks of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) and the honourable to the shortcomings of a remember for Parramatta (Mr John Brown). I also am concerned at the way in which the findings of the Expenditure Committee regarding the Northern Territory forestry program have been handled. As has been said, our report was brought down in May last year, over 12 months ago, and we have not had a response until now. I do not want to blame the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott). I am sure that he has many more urgent and important matters on his plate than this program, and he has had to await the result of other inquiries. But I do think that a serious precedent was set, in relation to the handling of our report, by a subsequent report being commissioned. If adverse findings of Federal parliamentary committees lead to the establishment of further inquiries by State or territorial officers, at the instigation of the Federal Government, then the integrity of our committees is being questioned with the obvious intention of justifying existing expenditure programs. I think it should be said that our Committee had a detailed look at this program. We had expert advice available to us and we took a great deal of evidence. We inspected the program at first hand and brought in a very carefully considered report. It was not done off the top of our heads. It would appear, however, that the attempt to justify the expenditure of more than $30m over the past 20 years has failed. We know that the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Mr Everingham, instructed two officers of his Department to examine the operations of the Northern Territory Forestry Service following the publication of our Committee's findings. Their conclusions, particularly as they related to the report of the Queensland foresters, were very interesting. They stated quite clearly: After 20 years in the forestry business we do not have much to show, e.g No commercial forests. No approved species on areas of development. A large amount of research still required. Most important of all, they said: A repon from Queensland does not necessarily justify what has or is being done nor does it rescind the House Representatives report on the economies of the venture. It appears to me that efforts to question our original report have failed and that the Chief Minishad ter, Mr Everingham, has been misinterpreting and drawing wrong conclusions even from the report of the Queensland foresters, which was commissioned presumably to form a second and opposing opinion regarding our report. In answer to a question in the Northern Territory Assembly only a matter of days ago, Mr tives Everingham made a number of quite incorrect comments regarding the nature of our inquiry, the extent of natural resources in the Northern Territory, the viability of plantation growth rates, and the export potential of seedlings of pinus caribaea. In my view, the findings mittee on Expenditure remain valid. The conclusions from the Queensland foresters are very optimistic. In my view, if the grant to the Northby ern Territory is to continue on the basis of their recommendation to continue with further plantnificant ings on Melville Island, then I would suggest that this would be throwing good money after bad, even on the basis of a purely technical evaluother ation. It would certainly not be justified under any economic test. Page 6 of their report supdiversion ports this planting recommendation, stating that such plantations would be capable of sustaining a mean annual increment of at least 10 cubic metres per hectare. Our advice is that this is not an acceptable level of productivity. It is commercially viable. The report of the Queensland foresters begins by admitting that it has not been possible to carry out an economic evaluation of the softwood planting programs. With regard to the Melville Island plantings, they also state that a detailed benefit cost analysis be carried out to determine the longer term future of this plantation project. I would have thought that the plantation business by its very nature was a long term project and should, therefore, not proceed until such an analysis was undertaken. The report of the Queensland foresters seriously understates the natural hazards of forestry in the Northern Territory. It ignores the fact that although these hazards may be separately and effectively countered elsewhere in the world, in the Northern Territory they occur together and with great intensity. We were told quite clearly that even billiard balls were not safe in the Northern Territory. The report concludes by simply stating that in the aggregate all these risks may involve some additional costs and it does not state their magnitude. In my view their disregard for commercial of viability is serious and should not be discounted by referring to the social gains of the program. Our evidence clearly showed that this activity not been a successful long term employer of Aboriginals, quite apart from the question whether it is wise to train people for noneconomically viable enterprises. In summary, I can see nothing in the Queensland Foresters report which changes any of the recommendations of the initial report by the House of RepresentaStanding Committee on Expenditure. There are differences between the recommendations of the Queensland report and the report of the officers of the Chief Minister. There are differences in the conclusions of the Queensland report and the statement of the Chief Minister in the Northern Territory Assembly. These inconsistencies only reinforced my confidence in our of the Standing Cominitial repon. I am particularly concerned with the statement the Minister that, in the 1978-79 Budget, the Northern Territory Government diverted a sigproportion of the operational expenditure of the former forestry branch to parks and gardens operations in Darwin, Alice Springs and locations. I would like some additional information in this regard. I am concerned at the of these funds. It seems to imply acceptance of our Committee'sfindings,but no reduction is made in the level of funding. I am not opposed to money being spent on parks or garjust dens. Street gardens have some value which is not more than can be said of the forestry program. The point which I make is that if the Northern Territory wants to have a parks and gardens program it should certainly have one but this should be within its own assessment of priorities and from its own resources. It should not be funded simply because previous levels of funding were over generous in supporting a poorly conceived and administered forestry program. I therefore hope that the Minister, in acknowledging as he did that the Northern Territory expenditure priorities are now determined by the Northern Territory Executive within the limit of available funds-includin g the grant from the Commonwealth-wil l recognise that to some extent this limit has a false base and that no evidence has come to light which disputes this fact. I think this whole question raises very serious issues about the principles of Federal funding and I hope that the Minister will have a very close look at the Government's funding response to this program and to our Committee's recom mendations.",43
185,Mr ELLICOTT,PROGRAM,"Wentworth-Minister for Federal Homes Affairs and the Minister for the Capital Territory) (2.39)-The problem in that the members who have spoken, whose comments I value very much and with whom I do not want to get into a heated debate, are in members of the Federal Parliament and not members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I have not disagreed with these members at any stage because I believe it would be presumptuous of me to disagree with the speech. findings of a committee that has gone to such a lot of trouble and has taken so much care in looking into this matter. Since 1 July last year, the Northern Territory has had self government and under that arrangement, in the practical sense, the Northern Territory Executive has control over what will happen to monies that are made available to that government the purposes of administering the Northern Territory. Mr Kevin Cairns-The Commonwealth makes the money available.",45
186,Mr ELLICOTT,PROGRAM,"The fact is that those amounts of money are made available not in a tied way as the honourable member for Lilley well knows. They are made available as a lump sum which goes to the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly the members are responsible to their electorate for the expenditure of that money. If the legislators are wise administrators they will get hold of this report and read it very carefully-as I have done-to take note of it and see what they can They should also take note of the report that received from Queensland. As I said in my report to this House, the fact is that the responsibility does not lie with me, nor did it lie with my predecessor. As soon as this report was received and tabled in this place on 2 June 1978, he acted quickly. He sought a report from Queensland, because as it was his responsibility and his right he felt that it needed further investigation. On 1 July last year, the responsibility for these matters passed over to the Northern Territory Government. That is the complete answer to the questions asked by honourable members whose bona fides I do not dispute. Honourable members raise matters that they should have new raised with the Northern Territory Government. Immediately this report was received, as I understand it, the report was sent on to that Government and I have no doubt that it took note of it. If it has not taken note of it, honourable members should tell some of the representatives in the Northern Territory to take it up in their Legislative Assembly in order to ensure that it is brought to the attention of that Government. So far as the Government is concerned, the funds are not determined on the basis whether they should this debate is be put into forestry. Mr Kevin Cairns-That is not a correct statefact ment. You allowed them to be transferred.",45
187,Mr ELLICOTT,PROGRAM,It is correct.,45
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROGRAM, Order! The honourable member for Lilley has made his,45
189,Mr ELLICOTT,PROGRAM,"It is all right for the honourable member for Lilley. He is sitting there making postulating statements about these things. He was not even involved in the negotiations with the Northern Territory. He knows quite well that those amounts are worked out on the basis of an overall sum. It has nothing to do with forestry. You know quite well, my learned honourable friend, that not one cent is passed to the Northern Territory Government for the purpose of putting into",45
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROGRAM,Order! The Minister will address his remarks through the chair.,45
191,Mr ELLICOTT,PROGRAM,"Mr Deputy Speaker, tell the honourable member for Lilley that he will get end of my tongue if he attacks me from the rear. Tell the honourable member for Lilley to be quiet. What I am putting to this Parliament is the fact, and the fact is that this money is not passed to the Northern Territory Government for the do. purposes of forestry. We have set up a self was governing body to determine how those funds will be utilised. I can understand that the honourable members who formed the subcommittee, having seen these things, felt disturbed about the fact that they were not able to press them upon a Commonwealth Minister. Needless to say, if I had the responsibiUty for these matters, I would be most disturbed if I had this report in my hand. I do not have it in hand as has the Minister who is responsible for forestry in the Northern Territory. I would like to make this clear to the House. On the question of delay, this matter has taken a little bit longer than it should have taken. I apologise to the House. This was partly due to the fact-if not largely due to the fact-that there had been this change in responsibility. There was not only a change of legislative cause the governing body was set up in the Northern Territory, but also a change in ministerial responsibility because the Department of the Northern Territory was abolished. On 1 October last, the responsibility came over to me as Minister for Home Affairs, well after these events occurred. At the same time, I was endeavouring to find some way of meeting the needs or demands of these honourable members who came to see me beforehand and raised the matter in other ways. The fact of the matter is that I cannot find a way as there is no way of achieving this end. It may be that at some stage the Northern Territory may seek a grant through the Grants Commission process. It could seek a grant for forestry purposes. If Mr Justice Else Mitchell is still the Commissioner, I would hope that he would take this report and the report of the Queensland officials into account. Before a grant is made for a special purpose, all these relevant matters should be taken into account. May I conclude on a pleasant note. I reiterate that at no stage have I wanted dispute either the bona fides or the judgment the honourable members who formed committee. I do not dispute those things. I appreciate very much the work that they have put into the report. They would not be getting up in this place today unless they felt very strongly about it. I understand that, but I want the honourable members concerned to know that I as the Minister who is responsible in that I have been handed this report, do not feel any sense of conscience in relation to it. I cannot do anything about it, nor can the Government unless it stands over the Northern Territory Government and tells it that it will deduct say $20m from its grant because that money was provided for forestry purposes. In other words, would have to pass some judgment on how the funds should be disbursed in the Northern Territory. As I understand it, that would quite contrary to the memorandum of understanding. Therefore, with all the goodwill in the world, I feel that the Government, through me as the responsible Minister, has dealt with this report- a little late I concede, nevertheless bona fide-with a view to trying to do our best with it. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",45

The implication is that I am opposed to the in, dexation of pensions. That is totally untrue and the sense the record shows that to be so. The second occasion on which I was misrepresented relates to page 2942 of yesterday's Hansard. It was alleged last night by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) that I had made insulting remarks about him and I was requested to withdraw them. I examined it the Hansard this morning and could find no such remarks, which reinforces the view I stated at the time. I do not involve myself in the kind of personal abuse which requires such withdrawal.

It was alleged that I had said something improper and that I had in fact made an insulting remark. I think it is vital that the record be restated so that you can see that there was no such insulting remark, that it is offensive to me that I should be accused of having made one. I put it to you that it is vital that I state was said.",47
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The honourable member has stated his point of view. I request him to take the matter up with Mr Acting Speaker if he feels that any injustice has been done. In the meantime, I accept the first point that he made about being misrepresented.",47

207,Mr ARMITAGE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In the debate last night I took exception to the remarks of the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). As far as I was concerned, his remarks were insulting in that they imputed improper motives to my activities in this chamber. As such, I asked for them to be withdrawn. It was so ordered and they were withdrawn. Unfortunately, they have been compounded today by the honourable member for Macarthur, particularly in his reference to me as a Deputy Chairman of Committees. I would say that when I am in the chair I conduct myself with the utmost impartiality. That is my position whether I am acting as an Opposition member representing the Opposition or as a Deputy Chairman of Committees or Deputy Speaker. When I am in my place in the House I am in a different position altogether from that which applies when I am acting as Deputy Speaker. When I am no longer in the chair, I am the member for Chifley and, as such, it is my job to represent the electors of Chifley. I do that with whatever little ability I have.

INCOME TAX (RATES AND ASSESSMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1979 Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1979 Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first 63 time. 30 Second Reading 33 Mr HOWARD (Bennelong-Treasurer) (3.2)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 to enable certain of the Governor General's powers under Johnston, Roger Jull.D.F. that Act to be delegated to the Treasurer, or a delegate of the Treasurer, so that new arrangements for marketing Commonwealth securities, Lloyd. B. MACKellar, M.J. R. as agreed to by the Loan Council, may be introduced later this year. Honourable members will probably be aware of these new marketing arrangements, which were the subject of a Press statement issued following the Loan Council meeting on 2 April 1979, and have commonly been referred to as the 'tap' issue of bonds and the issue of Treasury notes by tender. Essentially, these new arrangements are designed to modernise the marketing of Commonwealth securities in a way which is appropriate to the changed funds markets in this country. Ultimately interest rates can only be determined in accordance with market forces. The increased sophistication of capital markets makes this more apparent. The arrangements introduced in this legislation faciliEven tate the selling of Commonwealth securities at rates more in accordance with the forces of supply and demand. In outline, the proposed new arrangements are as follows: Treasury bonds and associated inscribed stock, which are referred to simply as 'bonds', are to be made available on a 'tap' basis, that is, with one or more securities available to investors on a more or less continuous basis throughout the year, in contrast to the past practice of issuing new Commonwealth bonds through periodic cash loans. Bonds will be offered to investors by the Reserve Bank of Australia acting as agent for the Commonwealth. The Loan Council will continue to determine the maturity date and coupon rate of the securities issued in the tap and will, from time to time, establish the limits within which the yields on the approved tap stocks on issue may be varied by the chairman of the Loan Council without further consultation with Loan Council. Treasury notes and associated inscribed stock, referred to as 'notes', are to be sold by periodic tender, through the Reserve Bank acting on behalf of the Commonwealth. This will replace the present system whereby notes are available on continuous issue at predetermined prices. The advantages of selling bonds through a tap rather than through the occasional cash and conversion loans of the present system include the following: Firstly, having bonds on sale for longer continuous periods, with different stocks being issued fromtimetotimeand adjustments being made to prices to reflect market movements, will offer greater flexibility and scope greater control over the quantity of securities issued and the maturity spread. Secondly, it should minimise the disadvantage of the present system of encouraging speculation associated with good and poor loan results, thus contribute to an unwelcome instability in bond rates and difficulties in marketing debt. Thirdly, the issue of bonds on a more or less continuous basis should also be more satisfactory from the point of view of institutional investors. Even with the instalment facility, the take-up of securities has in the past tended to be concentrated into a very short period which, given the large size of some past cash loans, and the large borrowing programs to be financed, itself contributed to instability in money markets. (Quorum formed). I repeat that the third advantage of the new system is that the issue of bonds on a more or less continuous basis should also be more satisfactory from the point of view of institutional investors. with the instalment facility, the take-up of securities has in the past tended to be concentrated into a very short period which, given the large size of some past cash loans, and the large borrowing programs to be financed, itself contributed to instability in money markets. Fourthly, sharp swings in liquidity, for example, as are associated with tax payments can mean that the maturity dates of existing bonds, which normally coincide with new cash loans, can be quite inappropriate for trying to raise large sums in cash loans, though of course, cash loans can be, and have been, held at other times. The advantages of selling treasury notes by tender include the following: Firstly, the amount sold can be more precisely determined by the authorities but with the price more fully reflecting market views. Secondly, the advantages of that situation will be that the authorities will be in a better position to ensure that adequate volumes of treasury notes are taken up by the private sector in accordance with policy objectives, including the need for the private sector to be adequately equipped to finance seasonal contractions in liquidity. For the new arrangements in respect of the marketing of bonds and notes to operate effectively, it may be necessary to make changes at short notice to the prices at which the securities are issued. It may also be necessary to make changes to the maturities, interest rates and other conditions of issue at short notice. With notes being offered by tender, the prices and hence the for yields at which notes will be issued will, of course, depend on the terms bid by those participating in each tender. The tap issue of bonds will also entail adjustments to price in order to change yields so as to reflect market conditions. In addition, technical adjustments to prices will be required to maintain the existing pattern of yields as the period to maturity of the tap stocks shortens. The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act, which I note is a very old Act, presently provides for the prices and other terms and conditions of issue of Commonwealth securities to be determined by the Governor General. To allow for the flexibility required for dealing with these matters under the new arrangements, it is proposed that provision be made to enable the Governor General to delegate his relevant powers, and it is the essential purpose of this Bill to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act accordingly. It is to be emphasised that these amendments to existing legislation will, if passed, in no way reduce the powers of the Parliament to authorise the borrowing of money by the issue and sale of stock, bonds or other securities. Such borrowing would continue to require the authority of an act of Parliament. The new arrangements for marketing Commonwealth securities represent essentially a modernisation of procedures in relation to the issue of Commonwealth securities in line with developments in capital markets which have become increasingly sophisticated since existing methods of marketing treasury bonds and treasury notes were introduced. Finally, I mention that, whilst certain details of the arrangements in respect of bonds are to be the subject of further discussion with the State Premiers later this month, the new marketing schemes have been endorsed by all the State governments as well as the Commonwealth. The Bill does not in any way pre-empt further consideration of marketing techniques in the Loan Council. Rather, it provides for flexibility in adopting methods of marketing of Commonwealth securities as agreed to by the Loan Council. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Innes) adjourned. NA",48

226,Mr HUNT,QUARANTINE AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will recall the legislation introduced earlier this year to increase penalties for breaches of the Quarantine Act. This Bill now provides for the amendment of the Quarantine Act 1908 principally to enable compensation to be paid when it is necessary to destroy certain goods or animals in order to prevent the introduction or spread of disease, and to give to quarantine officers powers of entry and search in carrying out their duties. This legislation provides a comprehensive range of legislation to ensure that the quarantine service meets the needs of the times. It is an unfortunate fact that the successful eradication of exotic diseases introduced into this country involves, in many cases, the destruction of animals, plants and goods of innocent persons. In some instances this could result in a primary producer losing his entire stock through no fault of his own. I am sure honourable members would agree that a person who has suffered losses under such circumstances should be entitled to compensation.

It is the prerogative of any member of this House to call the attention of the occupant of the chair to the state first of the House.

The present limitations are unreasonably restrictive. For example, they provide no compensation where Australian animals are destroyed in a quarantine action to eradicate an exotic disease, nor where imported animals are destroyed after becoming infected through unavoidable contact with infected animals in a quarantine station. Similarly, there is no provision for compensation where it is necessary to destroy goods or plants of Australian origin. I regard the lack of adequate compensation provisions unacceptable when the destruction of livestock or goods is undertaken in the national interest and where the owner of the goods or animals, birds, et cetera, is not guilty of any misconpest duct. The Bill now before the House will remedy these deficiencies. Every effort is made to prevent the illegal of animals, plants or goods which could introduce exotic diseases. Our determination in this matter is reflected in amendments recently made to the Quarantine Act which substantially increases penalties for quarantine breaches. Quarantine controls over conventional entry of persons, animals, plants and goods are rigorously maintained at all first ports of entry into Australia. In addition, as honourable members will be aware, the surveillance of our northern coastal area has been increased substantially. A daily coverage of our northern coastline between Geraidton and Cairns has as its prime objective the highest practicable protection for our national quarantine interests. However, I must stress that despite these measures, we cannot guarantee total exclusion of all material capable of introducing exoticdisease.

I ask members on both sides to be aware of this and to act accordingly. I call Minister.",51
238,Mr HUNT,QUARANTINE AMENDMENT BILL,"In addition to regular law enforcement and surveillance activities, an important part of an effective quarantine service, and any disease eradication program, is public cooperation. This co-operation is particularly important in detecting all possible sources of exotic disease infection within Australia should the quarantine barrier be breached. The Government has recognised that an essential aspect of eliciting such public co-operation is the existence of a simple, expedient system for compensating owners for animals, plants or goods which it is found necessary to destroy in the interests of ease security. I draw the attention of honourable members to clause 6 of the Bill which establishes machinpremises ery for the payment of compensation to innocent persons who may suffer losses because of quarlegislation. antine actions. I point out that these provisions will not allow compensation to be paid for imported goods which are destroyed because of non-compliance with quarantine or other requarantine quirements prior to release to the importer. provisions of the Bill specifically exclude these cases and cases where an illegal act by a person results in the destruction of his own animals, tine plants or goods. The Bill also provides in clause that where there is a dispute as to the amount compensation to be paid the matter shall be termined by an independent arbitrator. Clause 7 of the Bill extends the powers quarantine officers to include the power to spect baggage which has come from an overseas vessel or aircraft. These powers are presently vested in Customs officers, and in practice Cusfrom toms and quarantine officers together in the clearance of overseas baggage. However, many instances arise during baggage clearance which have specific quarantine impliquiring cations. It is reasonable and proper that our quarantine officers should have the power to inin spect baggage in their own right to carry out their duties effectively under the Quarantine Act. In proposing these amendments, I point out that appropriate arrangements will be made with the Bureau of Customs to ensure that there will proper co-ordination and no overlap with the responsibilities and duties traditionally carried out by Customs officers. The amendments will allow improved staff utilisation and will improve the efficiency of quarantine screening procedures at ports of entry in the face of increasing passenger volumes. The Bill also extends the power of quarantine the officers to search premises to detect animals, plants or goods that may be a source of introduction or spread of a quarantinable disease. In recent instances where breaches of our quarantine barrier have occurred it was necessary for quarantine officers to enter and search premises for animals and material likely to be infected with disease, treat or destroy items which could be a source of disease, and undertake all other quarantine measures necessary to prevent disease spread. These actions were taken under a general provision of the Act which allows taking of certain actions in emergency situations. However, this Government considers that as these actions affect property and the rights of individuals it is dismost desirable that where practicable the appropriate powers should be set out in specific legislation. It is also proper that where a search of is required it should be subject to clearly identified procedures set out in I therefore draw honourable members attention to clause 8 of the Bill, which provides that a officer may apply for a quarantine The warrant to enter and search premises and to carry out necessary quarantine functions. The issue of a warrant will also empower a quaranofficer to control an area to the extent necess6 ary to prevent the spread of exotic disease and of make inquiries concerning movement to and defrom those premises. Provision is also made for the issue of a separate warrant which will permit the search of premises for documents relating to of goods which may be infected with a quarantinainble disease. Inclusion of this additional procedure is to provide for the cases where documents related to infected goods may be sought premises not suspected of containing goods work closely actually infected. Finally, the Bill repeals a section of the Act reall overseas travellers to report any illness or disease suffered within 14 days of arrival Australia. With the volume of overseas travellers now arriving in this country it is not practical to use this provision as a means of disease detection and control. In all recent cases of exotic human disease in Australia, effective detection be and treatment have been possible through our present public health systems. As a person not complying with this provision may be liable for a fine of up to $500 on conviction it is desirable that this provision now be repealed.

This Bill is a formal measure to change references contained in the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Act 1962, from the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. The Act now requires one member of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority to be a member of the Legislative Assembly who has been elected by the Legislative Assembly as its representative. Because the title of the Legislative Assembly was changed earlier this year by territorial Ordinance to the House of Assembly, the references to the Legislative Assembly must be changed accordingly. The Bill provides for commencement on 2 June 1979, the date of the election for the House of Assembly. Its effect will be to enable the member of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority representing the Legislative Assembly to continue in office until the House of Assembly elects one of its members to represent it on the Authority. In order to be consistent and to ensure that the term 'House of Assembly' is used, the necessary amendments are being made to two other Commonwealth statutes which presently contain references to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.

247,Mr GROOM,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 to cilitate the development of a township at Jabiru, which is located in the Kakadu National Park, consistent with the Government's announced policies on uranium mining development. (Quomoving rum formed). The Kakadu National Park was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act on 5 April 1979 and was a major step in giving effect to the protective measures which the Government announced tablished would be established in the Alligator Rivers gion before permitting mining of uranium commence. The first stage declared covered an area of some 6,000 square kilometres. The area for stage II will as soon as practicable be declared a conthe town. servation zone under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act to ensure that the Park values are protected prior to its formal clusion in the Park. In keeping with the recof ommendation of the Ranger Uranium Environcomplete. mental Inquiry the Government decided that mining town to serve mines developed in the gion should be included in Kakadu National Park and should be a closed town with a limited population. The town will be developed on land leased from the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and will be subject to the plan of management. The National Parks and Wildlife Conserof vation Act requires the Director of National Parks and Wildlife as soon as practicable after park or reserve has been declared to prepare plan of management in respect of that park serve. The Director has to follow a series of directed by the Act in preparing the plan of management, including the receipt of public submissions and making the plan available for comment by interested persons. There will also be consultation with the Northern Territory Government and the Northern Land Council in the preparation of the plan of management. The Director then submits the plan to the Minister for Science and the Environment together with any representations made and comments by the Director on those representations. The Minister, when he is satisfied with the plan of management, will lay the plan before both Houses of 1979 Parliament. Either House of the Parliament, within 20 sitting days, may, in pursuance of a motion upon notice, pass a resolution disallowing the plan. If neither House passes a motion of Second Reading disallowance, the plan of management then comes into operation. It was the Government's intention that by including the townsite in the National Park the town would be planned and managed in accord fawith the Park plan of management. Following the Government's decision in November last year, to allow the Ranger uranium deposit to be developed, increasing numbers of people are into the mining areas adjacent to the Park. It is important that an early commencement be made on preliminary construction work in relation to the Jabiru town to ensure that a properly developed town of high amenity is esas soon as practicable so that workers Reand their families are not accommodated in temto porary camps any longer than is necessary. The Jabiru Town Development Authority, a statutory authority set up under Northern Territory legislation, has been established to develop Under the existing requirements of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act in the procedures relating to the coming into force a plan of management will take some time to The amendment envisages a mechanthe ism which would permit an early start to be remade to preliminary construction work prior to the plan of management formally coming into effect. The proposed amendments will ensure that Park values are properly protected while such preliminary construction work proceeds. It is the intention that the major construction work in the town will take place within the framework the plan of management. Construction in the Northern Territory is largely limited to the dry a season-that is April to the end of Novembera and during this dry season the Jabiru Town Deor revelopment Authority proposes a program to steps build the construction camp and access roads, and to provide temporary water-supply, sewerage, power and telecommunication services for the camp. Major construction work on the township is not scheduled by the Jabiru Town Development Authority in this dry season. The amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act contained in this Bill permit the Director, before the plan of management is in effect, to approve, by instrument in writing, the performance within the park of such work as he considers necessary or desirable for the establishment of a township at Jabiru, upon such conditions as he considers desirable. Before granting a licence, the Director will be required to consult closely with the Jabiru Town Development Authority and the Chairman of the Northern Land Council. The Jabiru Town Development Authority will be the focus for co-ordination of the views of the relevant Northern Territory authorities. In issuing such a licence, the Director shall specify environmental conditions to be a part that licence to ensure that the Park values preserved. The licence will be a 'prescribed inIAC strument' within the meaning of the Environlaneous ment Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Act 1978, which enables the Northern Territory Supreme Court at the suit of the DirecAffairs tor of National Parks and Wildlife, the Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission or the Northern Land Council to make orders for the enforcement's ment of any requirement under a prescribed strument so far as the requirement relates to matter affecting the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region. The amendment will also enable the Director to issue a lease or licence for land on which the Jabiru township is to be develmeasure oped in advance of the plan of management. would like to stress that, in proposing these amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, the Government is deterbenefits mined to protect the integrity of the Park. The Kakadu National Park is one of the world's great national parks and will continue to be so. commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on niotion by Mr Innes) adjourned.

248,Mr FIFE,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill, I would like to suggest that it might suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill 1979 as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the two Bills to be discussed in this debate.",55
249,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these Bills? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",55
250,Mr HURFORD,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT BILL,"We are dealing with a cognate debate on two bounty Bills. I will deal first with the Bounty (InjectionMoulding Equipment) Bill 1979. This Bill gives effect to the Government's decision on advice from the Industries Assistance Commission of asof sistance to manufacturers of injection-moulding are machines, which recommendations from the were contained in the report entitled MiscelIndustrial Machinery. Whilst this report is dated 12 December 1978 it has not been released. The Minister for Business and Consumer (Mr Fife) in his second reading speech to the Parliament when introducing this Bill sought to excuse this on the ground that the Governdecision on other products covered by in that report have not been announced. He will any understand, and I am sure the House will understand, that without the benefit of being able to examine that IAC report, there are difficulties for the members of the Opposition to examine this as closely as we would like and to be as I informed as we would like. However, the Minister did reveal that the IAC had concluded that it could not identify public commensurate with the high rate of tariff protection, currently 55 per cent, for these particular injection-moulding machines and that I reduced tariffs would lower costs to the plastic products industry, the users of injectionmoulders, so increasing that industry's competitiveness in world markets, thus being able, we would hope, to create extra jobs in the plastics industry. We take the Minister's word for this. I am Second Reading sure that the information is correct because he knows that we will be able to check it when eventually the IAC's report is tabled. The IAC recommended, therefore, that existing tariff protection, namely the 55 per cent which I have mentioned, should be reduced to 15 per cent. It also recommended that transitional assistance to eligible Australian manufacturers of injection moulding machines be accorded by way of bounty payments, initially at the rate of 45 per cent of value added, but reducing by 10 percentage points each year overfiveyears. Such a phasing out of bounty over that period would allow the industry to restructure and to become, hopefully, more competitive at the lower tariff level. This is the view of the Government in reaching its decision. The Government has accepted all the major recommendations of the IAC. The only recommendation that it has rejected is the payment of the bounty on equipment sold overseas. Tariff proposal No. 18 introduced into this House on 22 May 1979 has given effect already to part of the recommendation which reduces tariff. This Bill is to give effect to the bounty elements of the Government's package. The cost of the bounty scheme is estimated to be approximately $4.2m over thefiveyears, of which $1.5m will be spent in the first year of operation of this bounty Bill. The Opposition does not oppose this Bill since we are informed that it conforms largely with the IAC's advice. Our major complaint, however, is that the detailed reasoning underlying this IAC advice is not available to us and to the Parliament generally so that we can be absolutely confident in the decision we have made. Frankly, this is unusual as no draft report was released either in this particular case. I repeat that create difficulties for the Opposition and weakens the checks and balances which are the essence of this Westminster system. The absence of this report raises problems since this policy itiative is based upon a gradual reduction in assistance to the industry. I am on record at other times in condemning the use of general acrossthe-board tariff cutting alone to promote industrial development, particularly at times of high unemployment such as we are suffering today. I do not deny, however, the benefits of giving reasonably long advanced notice of future tariff cuts- I emphasise-in certain industries. I do not want to be dogmatic about this but I emphasiseMr Hyde-Why don't you say 'high cost industries'?",55
251,Mr HURFORD,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT BILL,"One industry I have in mind which was a high cost industry was the domestic whitegoods industry to which tariff reductions have been given notice of well in advance and where, indeed, structuring is taking place. In answer to the interjection of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) I state that that is a case where I believe the policy is working. He will agree with me that plenty of notice has been given of the reductions and those reductions are gradual and phased and give time for the restructuring. I merely state at this point of time that I accept that as one of the methods to be used in certain industries to bring about the structural change, but I would not be dogmatic and state that it is the method that ought to be used to bring about that structural change in every case. Appropriate industries for such action must satisfy certain criteria. I want to list those criteria which will also supplement the answer I have given to the interjection. The industry must be made up of large firms all with reasonable market shares. The potential economies of scale and economies of greater capacity utilisation must be sizable. Furthermore, the direction and nature of industry rationalisation must be apparent to all in the industry. The last of the criteria I want to mention- I do not pretend to be necessarily exhaustive-ar e that management must be progressive, which includes a progressive attitude to industrial relations, and management must be committed to adjusting to international market realities. Not many industries do satisfy these criteria. Whether the injection-moulding machinery industry is one of these I cannot say because, I repeat, we do not have the IAC's description and analysis of the industry. Nor do we have the IAC's views on the sort of rationalisation they it does would hope might occur within the industry. The main reason we have not opposed this Bill on the grounds that I have stated is the Minister's in- assurance that officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce will be monitoring developments in the industry. We look forward to the IAC's report being tabled because without it we are putting more trust in the Government than perhaps the Government deserves. But I can only sum up by saying that we are coming in on a wing and a prayer. I turn now to the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill 1979, which is the other Bill before this House in this cognate debate. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to continue assistance to the manufacturers of books in Australia. The purpose of this assistance which is, and has been, provided in the form of a bounty for some time, is to assist local printers against import competition. The intention is for the bounty to be available only for books which, in the absence of assistance, would otherwise have been printed overseas. The Bill largely conforms with the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission contained in its report entitled 'Products of the Printing Industry' dated 31 July 1978. The IAC report pointed out that book production is a relatively small section of the Australian printing industry, employing about 1,500 persons and having an annual turnover of about $28m in 1976-77, the last financial year for which statistics are available, as far as I know. However, it is the section of the printing industry which currently records a relatively low level of profitability and experiences more and more import competition. The Bounty (Book) Act 1969-75 has assisted the printing of books in Australia by providing for the payment of a bounty on eligible books on the basis of one-third of costs of production. The payment of the bounty under the Act had been due to terminate on 31 December last year but following the recommendations from the IAC, this bounty assistance is extended to 31 December 1979. The existing bounty is equivalent to an ad valorem tariffof about 55 per cent and affords an effective rate of assistance to book manufacturing of 45 per cent. Having examined the background to the introduction of the bounty generally and its history and effects, the IAC concluded that the purpose of the bounty should remain to assist local book manufacturers to obtain work which, in the absence of assistance, could be lost to overseas competitors. To this end the Commission recommended, and the Government accepted, that assistance in the form of a bounty should continue for a period of seven years from 1 January 1980. There is already legislation in force to 31 December 1979 and now the further seven years from 1980 is to be covered. It was the Industries Assistance Commission's view, however, that the present bounty is high. Further, the Commission considered that significant improvement in the international competitiveness of Australia's book manufacturing was unlikely while the industry remained fragmented. The commissioners of the Industries Assistance Commission who looked at this industry, and whose report which I mentioned is dated 31 July 1978, argued that at the original bounty rate of 25 per cent-the rate which applied between 1969 and 1974-som e rationalisation had occurred in the book sector of the printing industry. However, since the increase of the rate to 33 Vs per cent in 1974, the assertion by the commissioners was that production had become progressively more fragmented. Therefore, the IAC recommended that the long term rate should be returned to the 25 per cent rate. Recognising the need for stability in business planning they also recommended that the bounty period be extended until 31 December 1986. The Government has accepted this advice. However, the Government has decided to phase in the reduction in the bounty rate, that is, the reduction from 3316 per cent to 25 per cent, by leaving the bounty at the 33'/3 per cent rate until the end of 1982, then setting it at 30 per cent for the year 1983 and finally setting the rate at 25 per cent from 1 January 1984. This contrasts with the IAC's recommendation that the new rate of 25 per cent be brought in on 1 January 1982. Finally, the IAC argued that the various eligibility criteria employed since 1969 may have led to the payment of bounty for publications of a kind likely to be printed overseas. However, to avoid the need for a complex set of eligibility criteria, the Commission argued that the criterion which most determined the likelihood of import competition for book production was the size of the order. I will quote the argument of the IAC from its report: Of 700 imports examined, only 0.4 per cent involved orders of less than 1,000. The Commission considers that, by setting the minimum order size at 1.000 copies, almost all books not subject to overseas competition will be excluded, and the need for a complex set of eligibility criteria will be avoided. Based upon this reasoning, the Bill incorporates the revised eligibility criteria recommended by the IAC, incorporating a minimum order size of 1,000 copies if the particular bounty is to be applied. It is this last mentioned aspect of the Bill to which the Opposition objects. It is our view, based as I will show in a moment on representations and submissions made to us which seem to be good, that the rather arbitrary minimum level of 1,000 copies will be detrimental to the continued operation of efficient, more specialised smaller printers. The figure of 1,000 was first suggested to the IAC by the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of Australia, a body which frankly represents the larger printing organisations, not the smaller ones. In our view, the smaller printers were not properly heard on this issue. The IAC, having heard this representation, then rationalised this figure of 1,000 on what I consider to be a fallacious analysis that only 0.4 per cent of import orders involved less than 1,000 copies. But thesefigureswere based upon import orders during the operation of a bounty scheme when local printers, both large and small, were being protected, more printing was being done in Australia than otherwise would be the case, and when only large orders may have been profitable enough to be handled by overseas printers. Thus the IAC's evidence in support of afigureof 1,000 is quite inappropriate and irrelevant. It would have been appropriate only if it was based upon the import figure in the absence of any protection or assistance. For this reason, the Opposition rejects the 1,000 run requirement as being based upon a rather flimsy analysis. I have a suspicion that the IAC was hoping use the restrictive eligibility criteria to reduce fragmentation in the industry by forcing out business many smaller printers. However, we the Opposition argue that the sudden exclusion of small orders from eligibility for bounty ments is quite unacceptable as an instrument for reducing fragmentation. I have already said something about their often being the need for rationalisation in many industries, but in cases this way of going about things is the wrong move: way. This is especially so when the Government has been encouraging the smaller, specialised printers, not only by the provision of a bounty hitherto, but also by the provision of the 4 per cent investment allowance. The reduction of fragmentation in this way is quite unacceptable as an instrument when the social and economic costs of this move involving bankruptcies and redundancies are compared with the small benefits as measured by the very small reduction in Government expenditure brought about by making the runs a thousand or more in order to attract the bounty. The IAC estimated that if the more limited ellimitless. igibility criteria had been adopted in the 1976-77 financial year, bounty payments would have been almost $lm less-in fact, $920,000-with only part of this figure attributable to books printed in runs of less than 1,000 since eligibility is to be restricted in ways in addition to the copies requirement. If a minimum order size required, the Opposition suggests that the figure should be 500. We believe this would be far more appropriate, from what we have learned from those in the industry, than the 1,000 that has been included in this legislation. This figure was unsuccessfully put to the IAC by Craftsman Press Pty Ltd and the Australian National Unigive versity on behalf of the Association of Australian University Presses and the Australian Vicemoulding Chancellor's Committee. It is also the substance of representations made to me by a small South Australian facsimile printing firm, Austaprint, our which has specialised in the reproduction early colonial books, something which I believe ought to be encouraged and which we would like to continue to exist in this country. In addition, the Australian Book Publishers Association has made objections to any minimum order size tored requirement. I do not think it will be altogether happy with the 500 recommended by the Opposition. It certainly will not be happy with the minimum run of 1,000 set down in the Bill. For this reason I give notice of my intention to move a second reading amendment to the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill requiring that it be to withdrawn and redrafted. I am unable to move the my amendment at the Committee stage because of it involves an increase in government expendiin ture by the payment of an additional bounty to those who have book runs of between 500 and pay1,000 copies. I am left with only one means of recording the Opposition's objection to the requirement of 1,000. Therefore I give notice now that when we are considering the second reading many of the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill I will That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to submore stituting the following words: the House, whilst supporting bounty assistance for local printers, is of the opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and re-drafted to provide such assistance for minimum runs of 500 copies instead of the present 1,000 copies in order to aid smaller, more specialised printers who have previously been encouraged to invest in facilities through, for instance, the investment allowance and who must be encouraged to undertake structural adjustment in more equitable and less costly and disruptive ways. We do not suggest that there should not be rationalisation; that there is not a need for economies of scale; or that the Government coffers are such that the amount of bounty available is We suggest that at this stage it would be far more equitable, less disruptive, and less likely to lead to bankruptcy in printing firms if the order was 500 rather than 1,000. In summary, the Opposition is not opposing the Bounty (Injection-moulding Equipment) Bill 1979, but 1,000 we will be moving a second reading amendment is to the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill 1979.",56
252,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT BILL," On e of the two Bills that we are debating cognately is the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill, the purpose of which is to continue to help the book manufacturing industry. The other is the Bounty (Injection-moulding Equipment) Bill to transitional help to an industry. Most book manufacturing and much of the injectionmachine manufacturing is small business. This responsible Government has appreciated that small business is very much a part of way of life in Australia. It is vital to our econof omy and, therefore, we have encouraged small business in many ways. The main approach has been the responsible economic policy of the Fraser Government with its top priority of reducing inflation. This responsible attitude has resthe climate for expanding business activity and investment. The bringing down of inflation has made Australian products more competitive with overseas products. At this stage it is worthwhile noting some of the other responsible economic moves under the Liberal Government which have helped to bring small business back from the brink where they were under the Labor Government. Book manufacturers and injection-moulding machine manufacturers were helped by these moves. There is the additional investment allowance for taxation purposes on the purchase of new plant and equipment. (Quorum formed). Other measures are the increase of the retention allowance for private companies, the extension of the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank, and the extension of the Reserve Bank guidelines to majorfinancialinstitutions. These last two have greatly improved thefinancefacilities available to small business. Let me turn attention to book manufacturing alone. The latest fullfigures,those for June 1976, show that the printing industry is large; in fact there are over 3,000 businesses employing 70,000 people. This accounts for over $ 1,500m worth of sales, with a profitability slightly above the manufacturing industry generally. However, book manufacturing is not a large part of the total printing industry. This sector employs about 1,500 people and another 300 are employed by supplying industries. In 1976-77 the turnover was about $28m and resulted in a lower level of profitability than that of the general printing industry. This represents 60 per cent of the total book market. In most cases books constitute a minor part of production of firms which produce them and no doubt this is one reason for limiting the bounty to books produced in a minimum run of 1,000 copies. This provision will overcome the arguments of the Opposition as stated in their amendment. In 1973 the TariffBoard report said this about the industry: The ability of the local book manufacturing industry to compete with its Asian counterparts has been impaired by fragmentation, excess capacity, high over award payments and union constraints on the operation of printers. The Opposition forgot to mention those. The report went onThe Board considers that the community should not be expected to bear, through bounty or other means of assistance, costs attributable to these factors. In the ensuing six years fragmentation decreased somewhat as some small businesses were driven to the wall under the Labor Government. This is not the way to reconstruct an industry. Excess capacity has remained and high over award payments have increased. This has all made the situation worse. Union constraints have certainly not reduced. Therefore, the Australian people continue to maintain these companies in business and these people in employment when they refuse to do much, if anything, to help themselves. I wonder whether the Australian people really understand the nature of the help they are giving? How long are we prepared to pay the price? As will be seen, the Australian Government has started the process to make the two parties involved aware of the situation and thus reverse the trend. Let us look at the help that these businesses and employees have been obtaining. This book bounty Bill is to amend further the original Act of 1969. This Act has already been amended in 1970; twice in 1973; in 1975; and in 1978. In May 1969 the Government announced the introduction of an interim book bounty to operate immediately. This was to hold local manufacturers' sales at the 1967-68 level. The initial bounty was 25 per cent of the cost of production. This cost of production factor is very interesting. It is the bounty base and was defined in the Book Bounty Act as the price paid, or payable, to a manufacturer, or manufacturers, by a publisher for the production of, or the production processes carried out in relation to, the book. If the publisher is the manufacturer, bounty is payable on the cost incurred in producing the book. This statutory definition means, in fact, that the bounty is not based on costs incurred but on the cost, excluding some items such as outward freight and packaging, plus profit, less the bounty, of course. (Quorum formed). The initial bounty was 25 per cent of the cost of production. In 1973, on the recommendation of"" the Tariff Board, the Government increased the bounty to 33W per cent. This has meant an increase in bounty payments from 1969-70 or $ 1.4m for 18 million books, with a production value of $7m, to a bounty of $8m for 37 million books, with a production value of$32m. This is a lot of bounty. The bounty was shared by 1,930 operations, although 10 of these accounted for 43 per cent of the $8m. The next 50 recipients of the bounty accounted for 33 per cent of the $8m. Thus we have yet to see a significant improvement in the fragmented structure of the industry. The Industries Assistance Commission, after examining the industry fully, recommended continuing the bounty at 33!/3 percent of production costs from 1 January 1980 for two years and to reduce the bounty to 25 per cent for the next four years until the end of 1986. However, the Government has decided to phase in the reduction more gradually. The 33'/$ per cent level will hold for two years as recommended, then 30 per cent will apply for one year and 25 per cent will apply for the remaining three years. This also applies to the cost of paper, but I cannot into the details of that matter. Again the Government ment decided to phase in the reduction over a longer period. In keeping with the purpose of the bounty to protect against imports, certain types of books have become eligible for the bounty while other types will no longer be eligible for the bounty. The Government has shown that it is anxious to maintain employment and activity in the book industry. But it is also desirous of providing the opportunity and the incentive for the industry to restructure. The IAC is to be congratulated on its report. However, it must be remembered that these indemonstrated vestigations cost a large amount of money. A large number of witnesses had to bear their own costs. We must also consider the large bounty which works out at a cost of over $6,000 for each person in the industry. This responsible Government has again given help ness, in this case, the book industry. It should protect employment in the industry but also it puts the onus of restructuring on both the managements and the unions. I hope they accept this responsibility. The other Bill with which we are dealing in the cognate debate is the Bounty (Injectionmoulding Equipment) Bill. The Government's decision to protect the injection-moulding equipment industry is based on the recommendations of the IAC in its report on miscellaneous industrial machinery. As the spokesman for the OppoAdermann. A. E. sition said, unfortunately this report has not yet Aldred.K.J. been released because the Government has still Baume. M. E. to announce the decisions on some products Birney. R. J. covered in the report. However, a draft report Bourchier.J. W. was released. I hope the honourable member for Bungey. M. H.

P. plement the assistance with a bounty which will be phased out later. When the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) tabled the Customs Tariff Proposals No. 18 on 22 May 1979, he reduced the customs tariff from 55 per cent to 15 per cent, to Falconer. P. D. take effect on the next day, that was, on 23 May 1979. This Bill covers the other side-the bounty Giles. G . OU side. The bounty will be payable at the rate of 45 per cent of the value added by the Australian manufacturers, but it will be phased out over five years, reducing at the rate of 10 per cent a year. It must be noted that the bounty will not be paid on equipment sold for export. It is of interest that go Australia's largest injection-moulding equipmanufacturer, Johns Consolidated Ltd, is establishing a manufacturing base in Singapore which will presumably be making its new technology machines available for sale to the United States of America. (Quorum formed). However, it is expected that local manufacturers will be in a better position to develop their export markets as they become more competitive. Again, the cost of helping an industry is high. For the first year the cost will be $ 1.5m and the total forfiveyears could be over $4m. This is a responsible Government, and it has again that with its help to this small industry. I am glad that the Opposition is not opposing these Bills. They are good Bills put forward by a very responsible Government. I a year commend the Bills to the House.",58

264,Mr FIFE,PAIRS," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1979 as they are related measures. Separate questions will of course be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the two Bills to be discussed in this debate.",63
265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the two measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",63
266,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,"This is a debate on two Bills, the Customs Tariff Validation Bill and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2). Let me say at the outset that the Opposition does not oppose either of these Bills. I mention with the indulgence of the House that the Opposition moved an amendment to the motion that the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill be read a second time but we did not call for a division on that question because agreement has been reached that the time that has now been saved can be used to permit additional debate at the second reading stage of the Australian Federal Police Bill after debate is concluded on these Bills. The purpose of the Customs Tariff Validation Bill is to provide for the validation until 31 December 1979 of duties collected under Customs Tariff Proposals introduced into this Parliachanges ment during this session and not covered by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1979 which was debated in this House last week. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill which was passed on 31 May will consolidate Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 1 to 15 in the Customs Tariff Act. However, the Government has also introduced Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 16 and 17 on 3 May, No. 18 on 22 May and No. 19 on 5 June, which Proposals were not contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill that I referred to earlier. These Tariff Proposals which were not contained in the earlier legislation relate to decisions by the Government on recommendations by the Industries Assistance Commission on four separate items. The first is the IAC report on nuts, bolts and screws-Proposal s No. 16. The second is the report on the Australian citrus industryProposals No. 17. The third is the report on injection moulding machines-Proposal s No. 18. The fourth one is the report on acetyl products, oxo alcohols, butyl alcohols and vices-Proposal s No. 19. However, Customs duty collected on these Proposals, namely Proposals Nos. 16 to 19, are protected from legal challenge only until the end of this session of Parliament which we of the Opposition understand from the Government, although we have not been kept fully apprised, maybe some time tomorrow. Because the Government is unable to prepare another Customs Tariff Amendment Bill before the House adjourns for the winter recess, it is introducing this Customs Tariff Validation Bill to give legal authority to Customs duty collected up until 31 December of this year. This Bill therefore enables the Government to cover itself temporarily. Because validation Acts have a limited life, ultimately these changes will have to be incorporated in amendments to the Customs Tariff Act via a Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. We presume that that Bill will be introduced in the Budget session. This Customs Tariff Validation Bill is therefore an element of the procedure which allows the Government to implement tariff variations without first having to legislate for these changes. That is, this Bill is part of the special provisions which enable quick alterations to the tariff. I remind the House that in the debate last week on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill I set out the procedures relating to the enactment of tariff proposals which have been in operation for some 15 years. I will not go through that list again but I draw attention to that debate in which I set out the procedures. The consequence of these procedures is that individual tariff are not given the same scrutiny through full debate in the House as is given to other legislative changes such as assistance through bounties. I will not repeat the points that I made in that debate. I merely want to draw attention to them because surely the most feasible way of achieving proper consideration of tariff changes is to have a parliamentary standing committee examine and report on each change as soon as possible after the Government gazettes the tariff proposals. Such a standing committee could meet during the parliamentary recess when proposals are made known and much of the work could be done then. This would allow the representatives of the people to exercise proper scrutiny over proposals which are of immense importance to job creation and many other features of our economic life. I would be glad if the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) at some stage, as he has now had notice for a week or two of this, would give an opinion on this suggestion of mine. I am not suggesting he is able to do so in this debate because he has had the courtesy to tell me he has been called away on other business and is unable to take part in the debate. Unless, as I hope, the Government falls in the meantime there will be other opportunities for him to talk in tariff debates in the Budget session and perhaps he could then give me an opinion on this suggestion. The procedures currently in operation may have been satisfactory during the 1960s and imported early 1970s but they are not satisfactory today. With three-quarters of a million Australians able to find a job-that is, the Australians want one-and with enormous changes taking place in our trading patterns, and so on, each one of the IAC reports, as I have indicated earlier, and each one of the tariff proposals which flow from Government decisions about the IAC's advice is more sensitive in nature and more imthen portant to our economy than previously and requires close scrutiny. I turn to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1979. The purpose of this Bill is to inmaining crease the excise on naturally occurring liquid petroleum gas from $13 to $14 per kilolitre. The Minister for National Development (Mr Newman) announced this excise increase in a statement to the House on 2 May this year the higher rate has been in effect since 3 May. the time of this announcement my colleague, the shadow Minister for Minerals and Energy, not oppose this move. Similarly, and for the same reasons, we do not oppose this Bill now fore the House. We do not oppose the increase excise, because it will offset windfall which accrue to the producers of liquid petroleum gas. Since the last increase in excise from $ 12.60 $13 a kilolitre in December last year, the Prices Justification Tribunal has allowed the price LPG sold on the domestic market to increase by $27 to $110 a tonne. This increase has brought the domestic price almost in line with export para ity, which on 1 May was $ 116.40 a tonne. Such an increase in the domestic price was necessary to encourage usage of LPG in Australia. If there had been a margin between the cost of LPG and the cost of natural gas, needless to say, natural gas would have been used and the LPG would have been flared. At the time that the domestic price was $27 a tonne less than the export price, the Bass Strait producers of natural LPG had no economic incentive to sell on the Australian market. There was far greater scope for increased earnings by exporting their production. Bringing the domestic and export prices into line will forthwith. therefore create a more favourable economic climate for producers to develop a domestic market. This market for our own LPG is of great value to us. Our own energy should be used to the greatest extent possible in this country, particularly if the cost of that energy is marginally lower than the cost of energy available to our competitors. This should enable us to create jobs in this country. In the face of rapidly increasing prices for oil supplies, liquid petroleum gas is the only fuel now available to the transport sector unwhich can be used to decrease Australia's conwho sumption of motor spirit. In 1976 the Royal Commission on Petroleum recognised that LPG was the only available alternative to motor spirit in Australia before 1990. It is not that we are opposed to the export of Bass Strait LPG, but if steps can be taken to encourage domestic usage, in terms of Australia's energy needs this is applied the more desirable course of action. The energy value of Australia's reserves of LPG is equivalent to about 50 per cent of the rerecoverable reserves of crude oil in Bass Strait. Therefore, this resource can make a considerable contribution to Australia's liquid fuel requirements. Even with the $27 increase in price, LPG remains about 12.5c a litre cheaper and than motor spirit. Although consumption per At kilometre is greater than that for petrol, at this price differential a vehicle will save about $ 14 for did every 1,000 kilometres travelled on LPG. A higher price was necessary to encourage probeducers to develop a domestic market, but even at in this higher price LPG retains its competitive profits advantage over motor spirit. Although raising the price to export parity was desirable, this does not mean that producers to should receive substantial windfall profits by way of the $27 a tonne price increase, as this inof crease occurred without any corresponding increase in production costs. For this reason the Opposition supports the increase in excise by $ 1 kilolitre provided that returns to producers are still sufficient to encourage the penetration of the domestic liquid fuel market. They are the reasons why the Opposition supports this measure. I repeat that the Opposition support not only the Customs Tariff Validation Bill 1979 but also the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1979. Question resolved in the affirmative.

267,Mr INNES,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"The Ausparison tralian Federal Police Bill represents just one more about-face by this Government from the time when the coalition parties were in opposition. In 1975, the creation of the Australia Police by the Labor Government was veterms hemently opposed by the conservative oppoof sition. In 1979, a conservative Government has decided that there are benefits in the amalgaand mation of the Commonwealth and Australian by Capital Territory Police Forces. For our part, have never been in doubt about the advantages which amalgamation would bring, particularly in the area of operational efficiency. However, the creation of a two-component force, with general police services component and a protecquiring tive services component, is an aberration which is totally inconsistent with the purposes of gamation. Of course, this amalgamation would never have been brought about if it had not been for the tragic Hilton Hotel bombing. The fact that Sir Robert Mark was appointed to inquire into the allocation of police resources in the Commonwealth area was an admission by the the Government of the inadequacy of the security rangements for the Commonwealth Government Regional Meeting in Sydney in February 1978. Apart from the suggested amalgamation of the two existing forces, we do not find very much of value in the Markreport.Much of it is unhelpations ful rhetoric about Sir Robert Mark's perception of the role in society of the police or commentary on the Australian Constitution. It needs to be made clear that the creation of a protective services component is not in any way related to (No. 2) 1979 counter-terrorism. Counter-terrorist activities Second Reading will be undertaken by members of the general services component. The members of the protective services component will, in the main, be involved in static guard duty at Commonwealth places of low securityrisks.The creation of two components will create a two-class force and second class police officers. Under this Bill, members of the protective services component Third Reading are not even to be called police officers. We are to moved have commissioned and non-commissioned police officers, and commissioned and non-commissioned protective services officers. Understandably, the Commonwealth Police Officers Association is very concerned about the creation of a two-component police force. We 1979 share its concern. This move will have a conSecond Reading siderable detrimental effect on police morale and efficiency. We are totally opposed to this splitting of an amalgamated police force into two components and will vote against it both at the second reading stage and in Committee. Any comof the 1975 Australia Police Bill and this Bill can lead only to the conclusion that police are getting a raw deal under this legislation. Firstly, let us take the question of the general and conditions under which the members the Australian Federal Police will be employed. Under the 1975 legislation, the terms conditions of employment were determined the Secretary to the Department of Police and we Customs with the concurrence of the Public Service Board. The Public Service Arbitration Act was applied without exception to police officers. Under this legislation, the Minister alone will a make these decisions. There are provisions rethe Minister to consult with various people, but these are not worth a pinch of salt. Of amalcourse there are elaborate provisions enabling agreements to be made between the Minister and police associations, and for police associations to submit questions relating to terms and conditions to the Police Arbitral Tribunal. We do not object to these provisions, but we do object to fact that any matter not covered by an Arbiartral Tribunal determination will be decided by Heads of the Minister alone. Regulations made under clause 40(a) will have to be scrutinised carefully. The clause allows regulations to be made which will shackle the rights of the police to organise into associwhich are in their best interests and which protect the future of their total membership. It also theoretically allows for the Government to refuse police the right to be heard by the Tribunal by not making regulations at all. We want an undertaking from the Government as to what regulations are intended to be made under clause 40 (a). I understand the framing of these regulations is well under way. I ask the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay) to confirm or deny this. Those regulations already framed should be tabled in the Parliament during this debate. Clearly they are of relevance and should be taken into account. Access should be allowed to members who are going to participate in the debate on the Bill and eventually vote on this Bill. Next, there is the question of promotions. Under the 1975 legislation, provisions were spelt out by which appeals could be made to Prono motions appeals boards by police officers who considered that they should have been promoted in preference to others. This legislation employs provides: the same criteria to be used in the consideration of promotions, that is, efficiency and seniority. terms Seniority is relevant only if efficiency between officers is equal. However, visions in the Bill apart from clause 40 (c) governing the question of appeals to a promotion appeals board against decisions as to prothe motions. Clause 40 (c) is simply not satisfactory in that it simply provides that regulations emphasise 'may'-be made to provide for these matters. This sort of government by regulation quite unacceptable. Regulations should be consign, cerned with matters of detail, not matters of stance. We consider the question of and associated appeals to be of great importance, and something which no proper legislation should omit. Clause 40(d) allows for early retirement the age of 55 years to be introduced by reguhas lation for the members of the Australian Federal Police. This is a totally dishonest provision. If the Government intends to bring in provisions allowing for management-initiated retirement along the lines of the Commonwealth Employees interests (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill, which the police will no doubt oppose, then it should have the guts to legislate for it, instead of taking coward's way out and doing it by regulation. will be moving for the deletion of clause 40 (d) Bill. at the Committee stage. In clause 39 of the Bill, the Commissioner given power to transfer to a lower rank or retire members of the Australian Federal Police on the grounds of overstafnng. There is no appeal from these decisions. We would propose to allow such matters to be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal. There are other aspects about this matter that the Opposition feels are most unsatisfactory and go to the principles which we opposed in the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill. If a perfectly fit officer is capable of carrying on in a position, then once staff ceilings are imposed, these officers can be disposed of. If it were in the legislation then it would at least have shown more courage than the introduction of it by regulation. The Bill is also unsatisfactory on the question of retirements. As far as the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner are concerned, there are no legislative provisions governing the resignation of people in these positions. Clause 37 does not apply either to the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner. Therefore, as there are substantive provisions governing resignations of people from these provisions, we are left with the fall-back position of clause 17(4). It A person appointed under this section holds office on such and conditions (if any) in respect of matters not provided for by this Act as are determined by the there are no proGovernor-General. In every Act of Parliament creating positions of statutory office holders, provisions are made for resignation of the people in those positions. Clearly, there must be some limitation of the may- I right of a Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner to resign, so that undue disruption is is not caused. However, everyone is entitled to reand simply to say that any question of resigsubnation will be left to the Governor General to promotions decide is absolutely absurd. The procedure governing the retirement of ordinary members of the force is also unacceptable. Under clause 37, a member of the Ausat tralian Federal Police cannot resign unless he given between three and four months' notice. Whilst the Commissioner is given power to vary this period, it is a ridiculously long period in the first place. Whatever reasons may motivate a police officer to retire, it is not either in his or in the interests of the police force as a whole, to require him to wait around for between 3 and 4 months until his resignation takes effect. the We will be moving in Committee that this period We be reduced to one month, in line with the 1975 We believe that any legislation which does not is establish procedures for complaints against the police is so totally defective as to be unacceptable. This question, with the related matter of ensuring that the rights of suspects and accused are not abused by police, is matched in importance only by the question of accountability of the police force to the Minister. The time to provide for these matters is when a force is being established. Entrenched practices die hard. Public confidence in any police force is vital to the success of that force. Accusations of police corruption or malpractice can and do arise. If the only mechanism to investigate these accusations is an internal investigation by the police themselves, the public simply cannot be expected to have confidence in the impartiality of such investigation. One must speak bluntly about this. I refer, the Government to what was done in the recent past in an investigation of one of the forces in this country. It seems to be a contradiction in fact when we read about the mechanisms involved in this Bill. As I have indicated, one must speak bluntly about this matter. Whilst the vast majority of policemen and policewomen are totally dence dedicated, hard working and underpaid, there are and perhaps always will be a minority unwilling to use properly the power given to them by society. Such people must be weeded out for the good of the force and for the good of the community. The Australian Capital Police Force, by an administrative arrangement, established an internal affairs branch in January complaints, 1978. The Opposition commends it for establishian to ing that branch, but that was ible for the Australian Capital Territory police to go without legislation. In his second reading to speech, the Minister said: The Government anticipates being able to introduce legiscomplaints lation upon complaints procedure later in the year. Clearly the Government will take heed of the advice of Sir Colin Woods in this matter. One should bear in mind the extraordinary performance of Sir Robert Mark in relation to the English Police Act. Sir Robert Mark resigned prematurely in 1977 in protest against this legislation. He had been responsible for the creation of the A-10 unit to deal with complaints against the police. Whilst this was a significant advance on what had been the position before, the system allowed only for internal investigation and hence was full of pitfalls. As the report of the Law Reform Commission in 1978 points out, there is evidence that in some cases A-10 did not investigate complaints because police commanders sometimes too readily came to the defence of their subordinates. Sir Robert Mark's petulant retirement meant that Sir Colin Woods was in line for the job of commissioner. The fact that he was passed over gives rise to the suspicion that he shared Sir Robert's views about the legislation. In an article on Sir Colin Woods in the Australian on 11 May, John Phillips, reports: 'One of the ideas he is considering is to start a section modelled on Scotland Yard's A-10 branch'. It is most unlikely that Sir Colin would make this statement unless he had the support of the Government. If internal investigations, as proposed by Sir Colin Woods, have the Government's imprimatur it would appear that a major departure from what everyone expected to be Government policy is being heralded. On the other hand, if he did not have the approval of the Government to make this statement, Sir Colin should be carpeted. We make it clear that the setting up of an A-10 style branch alone is not sufficient. We have had two reports from the Law Reform Commission on this matter-in May 1-975 and in June 1978. In addition to the establishment of an A-10 style branch, the Commission on both occasions has recommended two additional elements necessary to ensure indepenand impartiality in the investigation and determination of complaints against police. The Law Reform Commission at page VIII of the summary to its 1978 report, spelt out the role of and the need for these additional instruments Territory in the following terms: The Ombudsman as 'neutral territory' for the receipt of as investigator of last resort and as public guardrequire certain public complaints to be scrutinised in a as far as it was posspublic forum. A police tribunal, whose President is a judge, which can sit hear charges brought based upon breaches by police of the discipline code. Criminal charges against police will continue to be dealt with in the criminal courts. Many publicagainst police, whilst not involving criminal conduct, arc nevertheless serious matters that should be publicly dealt with. These proposals have been accepted by the Australian Capital Territory Police Force, although not, it would appear, by the Commonwealth Police. A rather watered-down version has been introduced into the Northern Territory. We are convinced that the Law Reform Commission's proposals are the best way of ensuring that a proper balance is struck between the need to ensure impartiality in the investigation and determination of complaints on the one hand, and the need to ensure that police morale and efficiency are maintained, on the other hand I shall make reference in the Committee stage to an addendum that should be considered in relation to the point I am making. It is outrageous that this legislation should be introduced without provision for complaints against police procedures being incorporated in the legislation. The current furore over the Narcotics Bureau demonstrates that there must be a guaranteed method of independent investigation and determination of complaints against police. Indeed, in its 1978 report the Law Reform Commission stressed the need for such a system to apply also to the Narcotics Bureau. The Government has simply sat on that for a year and done nothing about it. The half-baked inquiry initiated by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) would never have been necessary if the Government had acted on the Law Reform Commission's report. Now we find the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay) fobbing off the whole question in this legislation. Despite two reports from the Law Reform Commission, the Minister apparently believes that Sir Colin Woods has the answers on this. The Opposition does not believe that he has. The other matter which came in for passing mention by the Minister in his second reading speech, was the question of the Criminal Investigation Bill. The Law Reform Commission reported on this matter in September 1975. A Bill was introduced into the Parliament in March 1977. However, that Bill lapsed and nothing further has been introduced. Now the Government, through the Minister, promises us another long delay. In a country without a Bill of Rights, legislation such as the Criminal Investigation Bill is essential. In the recently introduced Customs and telecommunications legislation, the Government decided simply to ignore the Law Reform Commission's proposals. Fortunately, some Government back benchers voted with the Opposition at a legislation committee to prevent Government riding roughshod over civil liberties, and perhaps that was to its credit. We fear that the Criminal Investigation Bill, if and when it is ever introduced, will resemble the Law Reform Commission's report and draft Bill in name only. Much of the criticism of this legislation was the result of a failure to understand it, and what it did and did not do. The proposals provided for certain general rules by which the police were to abide. If they did not abide by these rules, then the evidence obtained in contravention of the rules would be excluded unless the police could justify the departure from the rules. The legislation did not provide for the automatic exclusion of evidence. I want to deal now with what is always a controversial subject in relation to any police forcetotal trie question of ministerial responsibility and rection. This question, which in the State sphere is often bubbling not far from the surface, came to a head in South Australia in 1977 in the events which lead to the sacking of the Police Commissioner, Mr Harold Salisbury. We have since been treated to a book on the subject by a member of the Adelaide establishment, Stewart Cockburn. There are two separate questions involved in this. The first is the extent to which Ministers are accountable for the actions of the police. If they are accountable to Parliament, then they must be in a position to obtain full knowledge of those actions. The second question is the extent to which Ministers may direct the actions of the police force. Mr Salisbury took the view that he was responsible to some vague, undefined higher authority called the Crown, not to elected politicians. That is a view which has no place in a democratic system. The upper echelons of the South Australian Police Force from 1971 had continuously misled the South Australian Government as to the nature and extent of Special Branch files. Mr Salisbury, sworn to uphold the law, was acting in defiance ofit. In South Australia the position as to the relationship between the Police Commissioner and the Minister is absolutely clear as a result of the 1972 amendments to the Police Regulation Act. A Commissioner is subject to government direction, full stop. There is no qualification on this whatsoever. These amendments followed the 1970 moratorium demonstrations and the Bright repon into police handling of those demonstrations. There is absolutely no doubt that in South Australia police commissioners must supply whatever information is required by the Minister. In our view, that position is absolutely the correct. Sir Robert Mark, in his report, made a fairly glib distinction between administrative accountability and operational autonomy. What appears to be the traditional British view on the relationship between Government and the police, of total independence from the elected government, is rejected in Australia. Yet we find Sir Colin Woods importing the British view into Australia. Our view is fortified by a comment that he made on 11 May. He said: Every chief of police in Britain is a very proud, very independent man. He maintains his independence hy proclaiming it on every occasion. I think it is of the greatest importance that chiefs of police should have that independence. I would be very sorry if there were some idea that the development of the Federal Police Force in any way threatens that.' We, on this side of the House, believe that the independence of the police force from the diGovernment of the day and, in particular, the need to answer to, and inform that Government, is very dangerous. It cannot be accepted. We do not see Clause 13(2) in its present form as being acceptable. The meaning of directions as to 'general policy' is vague and uncertain. We believe that a government should be able to give to a police commissioner such directions as to the performance of his duties as the government sees fit, provided there is ministerial accountability, the Minister is then responsible to this Parliament. As we have pointed out in relation to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization and Customs legislation, there can be no real ministerial accountability unless there is disclosure. The South Australian legislation provides the model for this. It requires both the tabling and the gazettal of any instructions to the Commissioner. In that way, a government must answer for whatever it does. We would place no limits on the ability of a Minister to direct a police commissioner, provided that there was public disclosure. Of course, the Queensland Government has interfered with the police in order to ensure that it carries out government policy, as abhorrent as that policy is. However, there is no principle of freedom of information in Queensland, nor is there any procedure for the public ventilation of complaints against the police. Provided that there is an independent review of police actions, the question whether the actions of Ministers in giving police commisioners directions is proper or improper must be decided in the political arena. I stress that, the South Australian model, which we will be seeking to have incorporated into this legislation, Ministers can give no directions unless they are prepared to answer for those directions publicly. In some siege situations where demands are being made for the release of hostages, surely Ministers must be able to direct commissioners. If hostages were killed, it would be too late for a Minister to say that he was unable to give directions to a commissioner as to how such a situation should be handled. That is absurd. People elect governments to make decisions. Governments must answer for those decisions. Our amendments will ensure that the power of governments to make decisions is not limited. They will ensure also that governments answer for those decisions by requiring immediate closure of directions to the police. We will moving in Committee that all provisions relating to the appointment, promotion and termination of commissioners, deputy commissioners and should commissioned officers, should specify that it is the Governor General in Council, not simply the Governor General, who is to make these dein cisions. While we believe that it is a desirable practice always to write 'Governor General in Council', rather than simply 'Governoras General ', into legislation, that is not the reason that we propose it on this occasion. It is rather reinforce the view that the police are accountable to the elected government of the day, and not to some vague notion, as I have indicated before, of a higher authority called the Crown. In this legislation, for some reason best known to the Government, a very purposeful attempt has been made to try to establish the Salisbury relationship between the Police Commissioner and the Government of the day. The purpose for this legitimisation of the Salisbury attitude fascinates me. It appears to be the action of a conservative establishment framework adding another cross member to its superstructure to inhibit and to frustrate attempts at progress and change in our society. For those reasons it is totally unacceptable to the Opposition. Of course, I would be delighted for the Minister to illuminate the Parliament with his reason for the adoption of the Salisbury attitude. I hope that he will respond to that in his reply. I also make reference to clause 18, sub-clause (3) which I would compare with clause 17, subclause 4. I mention clause 20, sub-clause (1). I would like the Minister to respond not only on all of the aspects of the Bill to which I have made reference but also on the aspect of the legislation to which I will now refer. Why is it that an acting on commissioner shall have not only terms and conditions but also his or her remuneration and allowances set by the Minister? That does not mean that an acting commissioner can receive more or less remuneration than a permanent occupant of the office. Why should not an acting Commissioner receive the same terms, conditions, remuneration and allowances due to a permanent commissioner with the exception of those terms and conditions normally peculiar to an acting occupant of the position? Why should not terms and conditions for the position of acting commissioner and acting deputy commissioner be set in the same way as those for the permanent occupants of the positions? Finally it must be said that we are disappointed at the appointment of Sir Colin Woods. dis Sir Colin has had a distinguished career in also be England, but his appointment reeks of the colonialism to which conservative governments in this country still cling. The appointment have been from a State police force or the judiciary. Surely the appointment of Sir Colin is an insult to the dedication of the people serving the police forces in this country? However, we are faced now with a fait accompli. We should ensure that never again is there an appointment insulting to both Australian police and Australians generally, as that of Sir Colin Woods. to The Opposition cannot accept this Bill in its present form. For the reasons that I have mentioned, I move: That the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted to provide: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted to provide for: (1) the creation of a single component force: (2) the creation of rights of appeal in relation to transfers, promotions, discipline, demotions, tirements and dismissals: (3) the power of appointment and dismissal of the Commissioner to be vested specifically in the Governor General in Council; (4) the conferring in the Minister of more extensive powers of direction of the Commissioner, subject to the requirement that any such directions be tabled in Parliament and gazetted: and (5) a system for the independent determination of complaints against recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission'. Mr Jacobi- I second the motion.",65
268,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"I regretand I believe the Government and the majority of members of this Parliament would regretthat in the concluding minutes of his address the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) saw fit to make critical comments with respect to the appointment made by the Commonwealth, an appointment which is now accepted. I would have thought-recognisin g the realities of lifethat it is not the best way to launch a new venture for the Opposition spokesman to persist in this extraordinary attack on the appointment of Sir Colin Woods. I feel that the Opposition showed itself up in a somewhat petty light when dealing with this subject. The Government's main objective was to obtain the best person available for the establishment of the new Australian Federal Police Force. Whether that person came from Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada or any other part of the world, I believe the Government was duty bound to appoint the best person available. Contrary to the comments made by the honourable member for Melbourne who preceded me in this debate, I have not heard one word of complaint from a serving officer of the Commonwealth Police Force or the Australian Capital Territory Police Force with respect to the appointment of Sir Colin Woods. I have not heard one complaint. Mr Innes-They could not trust you.",70
269,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"The honourable member the makes an insulting comment. He might be mation interested to know-and if he want to behave a ratbag, that is his right-that I have acted for large number of police officers who quite happily trusted me. Indeed, I was honorary legal adviser to police associations when the honourable member was not even a member of this Parliament. The point I am making is a substantive one, that it does nothing to the credit of the honourable member for Melbourne that he can stand in this Parliament and say the sorts of things that he said a moment ago about Sir Colin Woods. If the honourable member is challenging rethe integrity and ability of Sir Colin Woods, I would be interested to hear the basis for his charges. What the honourable member has done is to scream 'colonialism'. He has smeared a man who has been appointed to be the initial Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police Force. I think it is a matter of great regret that the speech which the honourable member delivered, which was not a bad speech, was completely marred by the fact that he behaved like a larrikin police in accordance with the in his concluding remarks and attacked the appointment of Sir Colin Woods. Mr Innes- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Two remarks that have been made by the honourable member for Denison I find offensive and I want them to be withdrawn.",70
270,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,Mr Drummond) The honourable member for Denison will withdraw the remarks he made regarding the honourable member for Melbourne. I remind the honourable member for Melbourne that he has made his speech and that he was heard in silence.,70
271,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"I withdraw the remark and, if I may say so, I seek no withdrawal of the remarks that the honourable member for Melbourne made about me. I invite him particularly as there will be a Federal election next year-if he wants to help me retain my seat, to come to Hobart and campaign on behalf of Senator Wriedt. The purpose of the Bill is to establish the Australian Federal Police Force. I compliment the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay), who is at the table, and indeed the Government, on the manner in which they have gone about this task. It has been in marked contrast to the incredible performance of the Whitlam Government during its years in office when it endeavoured to establish in this country what in essence would have been a police state kind of police force. There are three very important differences between the way in which we went about this operation and the way in which the Whitlam Government went about operation. Of course, the source of my inforis basically the officers themselves. In the like Whitlam Government's attempt to establish its a own secret police force in this country, the operation was carried out in this way: Persons were detailed to go overseas to make arrangements, not in consultation with serving officers of the Commonwealth or the Australian Capital Territory Police forces. There was an attempt in the Whitlam Government's period of office to establish a political police force in this country. This Federal Police Force which we are establishing is, of its very nature, apolitical. I cannot understand the amendments moved by the honourable member for Melbourne because he has failed to note in the Bill that the police force that we are establishing cannot be politicised. He has failed to note that the Minister cannot give a direction to the Commissioner as to the operations of the Australian Federal Police There Force unless he does two things: First, he has confer with the Commissioner-in other words, he has to explain the direction to him-and ondly, he has to put the direction in writing for the record. That would not have been so under the Whitlam proposals. A telephone call would have been made in the middle of the night; record would have been made; and a direction would have been given by one of Mr Whitlam's political henchmen that the force was to take action in relation to a certain person. No record at all would have been kept. Not a skerrick evidence would have been available upon which the truth could have been nailed home and upon which political intervention could have been established. One should examine the provisions of the Bill and consider how on earth they can be reconponents ciled with the remarks made by the honourable member for Melbourne. The power of the Minisand ter to give a direction is restricted. He can as I said, only after he has conferred with the Commissioner and if he is prepared to do so in sectionswriting. I ask: What Minister of this Government would be prepared to give a political direction writing? What Minister would put his reputation on the line by putting in writing-as the Bill requires-the direction to the Commissioner? The honourable member for Melbourne obviwas ously has not been talking recently to officers the Commonwealth Police Officers Association. would have thought, if he had, that he would be well aware that following a number of meetings with the Minister and with back bench comThe mittees, practically every single objection to legislation in fact was ironed out. Unlike fruitless efforts of the honourable member for MelbourneMr Jacobi-That is a different story from one that we have.",70
272,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"The honourable member  example. He ought to talk to the people who spoke to the back bench committees. He ought to see the amendments that went through after the police officers had had discussions with the Minister and with the back bench committees. The fact of the matter is that the Opposition is talking about a situation which existed six months ago when it talks about a single component police force. It has been accepted that, providing the rights of the individual officers are protected, a double component police force will in fact be implemented. As I said, the honourable member is trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. is nothing to support his contentions in reto lation to a single component police force. As at this moment, I suggest to the honourable secmember that he is completely without instructions, that he has not been receiving the right information or that he is simply making up what he is saying. It was accepted in the report of Sir no Robert Mark that the proposed Australian Federal Police should be a dual component police force, one section of it involving general police functions and the other involving police protective service functions. What is so extraordinary of about that? Why is it that the honourable member for Melbourne contends that this is not an efficient way to run a police force? It seems that he knows very little about the operation of State police forces, which are not single component forces. There are three, four or five separate components. I shall draw some of these comto his attention. There is the uniform section and the non-uniform section, the racing gaming section, the vice squad section-the do so, honourable member would have heard of thatand the licensing branch. A number of separate Mr Innes- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point in of order. The imputations of the honourable member continue on and on. I am not thin skinned about some of the remarks that have been made but the imputation in his last remark such that if he made it outside the Parliaof ment he might find himself in different circumI stances. I demand that it be withdrawn.",71
273,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,Mr Drummond) honourable member's point has been made. this I ask the honourable member for Denison to the rephrase that last part of his speech.,71
274,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,I was simply endeavouring to point out the separate sections. I will go through them again. I shall deal with the Tasthe manian police force. It has the uniform sectionMr Innes- I demand a withdrawal.,71
275,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"I feel that the honourable member for Melbourne is being over-sensitive about the matter. Mr Innes- Mr Deputy Speaker, I can recall the words that were used by the honourable member for Denison, he said that I knew something about the vice squad section of the State police force. Mr MCLeay-He did not mention you at all. Mr Innes-He made direct reference to me during his remarks and an examination of Hansard will show it. It is offensive to me and I ask for a withdrawal.",72
276,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,Mr Druinmond)The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has made his point. The remarks are offensive to the honourable member and I would ask the honourable member for Denison to withdraw that imputation.,72
277,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"If it please you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not talk about the vice squad. I will remind the honourable member about the traffic branch.",72
278,Mr HOLDING,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,You will withdraw it.,72
279,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,The honourable member for Denison will withdraw the remarks.,72
280,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,Jus t a minute; the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is laying down the law. He is accusing himself. I have not accused him of contact with the vice squad.,72
281,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,Order! The remarks that have been repeated by the honourable member for Denison have offended the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I ask the honourable member for Denison to withdraw those remarks.,72
282,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"At your request, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will withdraw them. I will now talk about the drug section. We have the traffic section, the racing and gaming section, the licensing section and the vice squad. It is well known in the operations of police forces that these sections have to be put into separate components to obtain the best efficiency. A team of detectives who are experts in the subject of vice particularly look for, search out, apprehend, arrest and charge people involved in vice. Similarly, in relation to the traffic section, one not put a man from the vice squad in charge of the traffic operations for the city of Melbourne. The fact that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is up and down on the question of whether it is a single or double component indicates that he does not have the faintest idea what the Bill is about. The Bill seeks to establish what will be an efficiently operating Australian Federal Police Force, bearing in mind the duties which have to be performed. I invite the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to turn to the Bill for, what I imagine will be the first time. He will find that the functions of the Australian Federal Police Force are set out in clause 8 as follows: (a) the provision of police services in relation to the Australian Capital Territory; (b) the provision of police services in relation to(i) laws of the Commonwealth; (ii) property of the Commonwealth (including Commonwealth places) and property of authorities of the Commonwealth: and (iii) the safeguarding of Commonwealth interests: and (c) to do anything incidental or conducive to the performance of the foregoing functions. It is clearly recognised that there is a different function to be performed by those who are interested, for example, in the protection and safeguarding of Commonwealth property than the function which will be performed by those who are involved in the investigation of crimes against the Commonwealth, such as the planting of bombs on aeroplanes, the destruction of Commonwealth property, acts of sabotage, terrorism and the like. To come back to the example which I gave before, one would not put a man from the vice squad in charge of the traffic section or a man who has been spending many years guarding an airport in charge of an inquiry into a proposed act of terrorism at one of the naval bases or at some other place. It seems to me that the honourable member has failed to appreciate the purpose of the Bill. He has his wires crossed because he believes that if somebody who is currently in one section is transferred into another section of the proposed new force, that person will be disadvantaged. I want to nail that one right on the head here and now. If ever there was a Bill which protected the rights of incumbent members of the Australian Federal Police Force it is this Bill. The honourable member talks as if he had not read the Bill when he talks about the creation of rights of appeal in relation to transfers, promotions, discipline demotions, retirements and would dismissals. I invite the honourable member to look at the Bill. There is a right of appeal in respect of every appointment other than that of commissioner. Because the honourable memberMr Jacobi-They are going to declare them by regulation.",72
283,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,That is the position at the moment. When the Australian Labor Party was in GovernmentMr Jacobi-You would not know; you were not here.,73
284,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"Labor did nothing to put such a right of appeal in an Act of Parliament. The Opposition accepted that this could be done by regulation. The honourable member can blandly say that there is nothing in the Bill in lation to rights of appeal. But he is completely wrong. The present status quo is in fact preserved and maintained. Mr Jacobi-That is right, there is none. What happened in 1975?",73
285,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"The honourable member for Hawker says that there is no right of appeal at present. That is not correct. Mr Jacobi-There is, but not in the Bill.",73
286,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"If that is correct, I invite the honourable member to look at clause 78 of the Bill. Clause 78 of the Bill preserves the existing rights Mr Jacobi-You are going to put them in regulations.",73
287,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,The honourable member for Hawker seems to be suggesting that there are no such rights. Mr Innes-That is right.,73
288,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,The honourable member for Melbourne Ports says that we must create rights of appeal. What a lot of poppycock that is. If the honourable member reads clause 78 of the Bill he will find that it preserves the existing rights of appeal.,73
289,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,73
290,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"Before the suspension of the sitting I was dealing with the role of the Minister in relation to the Australian Federal Police. I think it is important that the situation be clearly understood. The Minister is responsible as a Minister of the Crown but his right to intervene in the operations of the Australian Federal Police is very limited. He must confer with the Commissioner but only on what are described as the general functions of the Federal Police. If he considers it appropriate to give a direction it is tial under the legislation that he do this in writing. This, I think, is the great protection against the fears raised by the honourable member for Melbourne in that whatever the Minister does will be a matter of record. I refer also to appeals and the protection of the rights of existing members of the Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force. I refer again to clause 40 (c) of the Bill. It deals with the regulation making power with respect to the promotion of members, including the right of members to appeal against promotion of other members and the establishment of a promotion appeals board to hear and determine such appeals. I fully appreciate what the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) will say when he follows me re- in this debate. He will say that that provision ought to be in the Act itself. This is what the honourable member for Melbourne said. Normally, I would accept the argument that if there is a choice between something going in an Act and something going into regulations I would lean towards the Act. But there is a very good reason in this case why it ought to be done by regulation. Firstly, the current position is that the appeal rights in respect to existing members of the Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force are laid down in regulations. Secondly, we are starting on a new concept. 1 believe it would unduly fetter the Executive Government, the Minister and the new Commissioner who is to set up the Force. (Quorum formed). The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), in breach of an agreement, has cut short my time. I now have the opportunity to refer with approval only to clause 73(2). That is an amendment which was introduced as a result of the discussions between the Minister and the Government members committee.",73
291,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,73
292,Mr JACOBI,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"Whilst the Opposition may support the concept of the Australian Federal Police Bill, it will oppose and resist a number of provisions. I approach this legislation with a deep sense of cynicism which is soundly based on this Government's political duplicity and outright hypocrisy. Throughout the period of office of the Labor Government I was a member of the Caucus legal and constitutional committee which was largely responsible for the structure of the Australia Police Bill which we introduced on 30 October 1975. That Bill was thoroughly discussed and examined. As I recall, essenwe had lengthy discussions with the Commonwealth Police Officers Association. I honestly admit that the Bill was predictably unpopular, particularly amongst police officers. Any drasticchange was then, as it is now, a bitter pill to digest. Despite what the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) said, the Bill raised, as the present Bill does, the thorny question of tructuring, reclassification and the status of police officers. We ought to understand that that was the kernel of the problem. For the reasons that we enunciated at the I believe that the 1975 legislation was sound necessary, as the present Bill is, if the federal enforcement agencies were to be both effective and efficient. But what do wefind?The political duplicity and outright hypocrisy of the Governretention ment, both now and when it was in opposition, utterly deplorable. I strongly contend tonight that the shortcomings that led to the introduction of the legislation in 1975 were thrown up followfederal ing a comprehensive study into the Comof monwealth Police and the Australian Capital deserve Territory Police forces in 1973. The measures contained in the Bill we introduced in 1975 those in the present legislation attest at least our foresight and credibility. But they speak volumes for the Government's fork-tongued apallocations proach in this critically important area. In the then Opposition opposed the Bill. It claimed it be a plank of socialist philosophy. As I recall only too vividly, in the run up to the 1975 elechigh tions two current Ministers attended a meeting of police officers. They gave an unequivocal and categoric undertaking that there would be no repetition of the 1975 legislation and no amalgain mation of the police forces. This reminds me of what an old Scotsman once said to me. He said: 'Never let politics bother you, Ralph. After all, the capacity for human intelligence to absorb garbage is unlimited'. That happened in 1975.1 wonder how gullible the police forces would today. This legislation is another glaring testimony the Government's duplicity, hypocrisy and total lack of credibility. The legislation was necessary in 1975. It is necessary now. It is my intention, I said earlier, to compared the Opposition's icy and its constructive approach to this much needed reform with the Government's restrictive and negative approach. Had this Government implemented the important provisions in the Bill that we as a government introduced into this House in 1975 and had the amalgamation of the police forces taken place in 1975, it would unnothing doubtedly have been of far greater benefit to both the Australian Police itself but more portantly and beyond question, to the police officers. It is my personal view- I sat on the mittee then, as I do now-that our legislation would have made the force more effective and efficient. This piece of legislation falls far short of the rescomprehensive and necessary legislation needed if this arm of the law enforcement agency is to have the checks and balances so critically important, if it is to achieve the aims and the ends that the community expects and deserves, and time, that goes for both the officers and the comand munity. I say advisedly, and I have known this law for the last 20 years, that regrettably, throughout the length and breadth of this country, law enforcement officers, whether they be police or law officers-w e call them prison officers, or is officers of what is known as correctional services-ar e too often used as scapegoats by politicians, political parties, governments both and State, and, I hate to say, on a number occasions Opposition parties. Police officers a lot better than they get. Equally regrettably, all too often- I know this after being inand volved with correctional services in South to Australia for 20 years-whe n Cabinet, whether it be State or Federal, starts to carve up the budget for police or prison services, these ser1975 vices suffer cuts in government expenditure. They are sacrificed. They are at the end of the rung. Nonetheless, the public still demands a standard of effectiveness and efficiency. Let me take up some of the time of the House to canvass some of the provisions we envisaged 1975 and contrast them with the current provisions of this Bill. The Bill in 1975 provided for the amalgamation of the Commonwealth Police Force, the police forces of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, and certain sections of the Department of Customs into be a single law enforcement agency to be called Australia Police. This move followed a comprehensive study carried out in 1973. It revealed to that the operations of existing agencies contained a number of shortcomings. These included: A lack of co-ordination of enforcement effort in as areas of common interests; duplication of effort polby officers from the various agencies; wastefulness and inefficiency arising from the maintenance of separate information and intelligence systems; varying standards of training and recruitment for the various agencies; lack of highly trained capacity to deal with white collar crimethat area badly needs an overhaul, but there is in this Bill to update that capacity-the need to refer the investigation of some federal imoffences to State police agencies; wastefulness deriving from the maintenance of separate pools comof equipment and the inability to justify separate use of computer facilities. Based on the knowledge gained from studies that had been undertaken, including a close examination of overseas law enforcement agencies, it became obvious in 1975 as it is obvious now that the wastefulness and inefficiencies deriving from the multiplicity of federal law enforcement agencies in the country could best be overcome by integration of these agencies. The then Opposition, the present Government, bitterly opposed such a socialist proposition, but it is now the proposition of a Tory government. It is marvellous! There was and still is scope for specialised training, including that necessary to provide higher level of expertise to detect white collar crime. One can understand why that is one arm of the police force that the Government will not update to give any semblance of expertise. One can appreciate that. The national and interLaw national training courses at present provided State and overseas police will be expanded. We selves. envisaged that in 1975. On the basis of existing Customs facilities, computer services currently under development include police computer syssection tems with instant access to data by means of visual display units located throughout Australia. Australian We wanted that too in 1975. At the moment that matter is under discussion. These services, whether maintained manually or by computer, are a necessary part of any police force and are being developed at a national level within the Australia Police. Then there is the possibility developing a national information unit. The unit will have links with Interpol and other interin national agencies. This Government opposed that concept in 1975. On 16 May 1975 the Law Reform Commission reported on the question of the appropriate legislative means of safeguardprovisions ing individual rights and liberties in relation to the law enforcement process of the Australia Police. So rights and liberties ought to be safeguarded, but such a provision is not contained in the legislation. The Law Reform Commission brought down two reports. The first report was tabled in the House on 2 September 1975 and related to a sysand tem to investigate complaints against members of Australia Police. The report is a seminal docudefeat ment in the development of police integrity and public confidence in the police of Australia. Commission's second report is devoted to the difficult issue of the proper balance between police powers, which respect therightof the indipromise vidual, on the one hand, and the community's set of lies. need for practical and effective law enforcement on the other. Nothing in this legislation buttresses that and it is critically needed. Part the Bill as we envisaged it contained the usual formal provisions and, in addition, preserved existing police powers in federal laws and territorial ordinances. We provided for that in our Bill in 1975. It also provided an interim measure pending the introduction of legislation arising out of the Government's consideration of the second report of the Law Reform Commission. The Government has not yet responded to that report. Part IV related to appointments and terms and conditions of service, including such matters as promotion, resignation and retirement. It also a provided for the making of regulations in relation to police discipline, which has not been provided for in this Bill. Parts V and VI would have established the system of dealing with complaints against police, as recommended by the Reform Commission. I should have thought for that the police would have wanted that themCentral features of these parts are the provision of an oversighting role for the Ombudsman; the establishment of an internal discipline responsible to the Chief Commissioner to investigate complaints and the creation of an Police Tribunal. Part VII was based on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to torts by police officers. It provided for Australia to assume vicarious liability for the actions of an of officer taken in the course of his duty. So he ought to be protected. Where are the provisions this Bill that adequately protect him? It also provided that Australia may take proceedings to recover contributions from the police officer, and so it ought to. Part VIII provided for transitional in relation to the appointment of and preservation of rights of police officers automatically transferred to the Australia Police. The other thing which we envisaged and which I must confess was overlooked by many police officers, but which was important, was the establishment of a national police college at Bathurst in New South Wales. Courses were designed to cater for all levels of police recruitment training appropriate to the high levels of management. Following the Labor Government in 1975, the college was not established, yet the recommendation for its establishment is The contained in the Mark report. The establishment of that college was another promise given by the then Opposition in 1975, and it is another broken of this Government. It is part of another Before I conclude my remarks, I wish to make I of passing reference to a number of matters contained in the legislation that are of concern to police officers. Police officers are concerned, as well they might be, with the provisions contained in clauses 38 and 39. Clause 38 deals with the tirement of members by reason of mental or physical infirmity. It appears to us that the missioner has sole discretion as to whether or not he considers a person unfit to discharge or incapable of discharging his duties. The clause confers on the Commissioner certain options. I would like the reflections of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay) on that. Whilst there may be a benefit to the member to be retired from the police force before obtaining the age of 60 years, under the proposed legislation, the Commissioner would have the sole discretion of transferring that person to a rank lower than the one he presently holds or he may transfer him to another position in the same rank. One notes that there is no provision for a member to appeal against such a decision by the Commissioner. Therefore, the Opposition feels that it would be in the best interests of all members for an appeal provision to be contained in the Act rather than the regulations. I might that I have an utterly cynical regard for provisions which protect members of an association or a union being placed in regulations. I have had 20 years' experience with it, and I believe that the argument put forward for including clause 38 in the Bill simply was that the same provision already exists in the Australian Capital Territory Police Ordinance 1927 as amended. In my view, it is an archaic provision and one which the force could well do without. There is no need for it. Clause 39 of the Bill deals with retrenchment. We on this side of the House, and certainly police officers, I would think, take the firm view that this clause ought to be deleted in its totality. Again, the Commissioner has the sole discretion as to whether or not a member may be retrenched. It appears that no restrictions are placed on the Commissioner as to when or how he may embark upon such a course without consultation. There is also no provision for a member to appeal against the decision of the Commissioner, although a member may have recourse in some other industrial arena. I would like that situation explained, and we will see whether we can drag out an explanation during the Committee stage because it is important. Police officers and the Commonwealth Police Officers Association, feel very strongly that this clause ought to be deleted from the proposed legislation. I come back to the point that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) raised. The clause should be deleted from the proposed legislation but, failing that, a protection clause in re- an appeal provision should be included in the Act rather than in the regulations. I agree with Com- the honourable member for Denison. I ask the Minister for Administrative Services to explain why a provision should not be included in the Act. It is important in that if there is to be harmony in the force such a provision ought to be inserted in the Act, not in the regulations. I confess that I intend to give the Minister a rough time in the Committee stage on that clause. The Government's argument for including clause 39 in the Bill was that it is already contained within the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory Police Ordinance. I point out that although this sort of provision exists in respect of Australian Capital Territory police, the administration has never sought to enforce it. It is archaic, outdated, and it ought to be deleted. There is another area of the proposed legislation that I believe causes police officers less say concern, and I refer to clause 37, which deals with the resignation of members. It is noted that three months notice must be given before a member may resign unless the Commissioner otherwise allows. We feel that three months is far too long and suggest that a period of 28 days is more in line with the provisions that at present exist in police forces throughout Australia. I would like some clarification of this point. Is the Government still standing fast on that provision or has it in fact reached agreement with the Police Officers Association and conceded that the period will be reduced to 28 days? I want to conclude on this simple note. I thought that the legislation proposed in 1975 was a logical, rational and effective way to amalgamate the police forces so as to give the community the efficiency and effectiveness it deserved, but that proposal was hypocritically opposed. It is a disgrace that in 1975 this Government when in Opposition was able to dupe, if you like, the police forces on the specious ground that once it got into office it would not amalgamate those forces. It is just another nail in this Government's coffin and an example of its utter lack of credibility. It is no credit at all to the Government or to many members in the police forces, who were gullible enough to fall for this promise. I support the concept of the legislation because I thought the amalgamation was warranted in 1975 and I think it is warranted in 1979. But I make this plea to the Minister: If the Government wants an efficient and effective police force it should ensure that the provisions for the welfare of the members in respect of promotions, appeals and transfers, whether they are written into the Act or made by way of regulations, safeguard the rights of the members. If that is done, the Government will have a much happier police force. This Bill will not give them that protection.",73
293,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"The Australian Federal Police Bill now before the House is signed to establish the Australian Federal Police. That force is to be given certain functions, and they are specified in clause 8 of the Bill. They clude the provision of police services in relation to the Australian Capital Territory, the provision of police services in relation to laws of the monwealth and the property of the Commonthat wealth, the safeguarding of Commonwealth interests, and anything incidental or conducive the performance of the foregoing functions. Under this legislation the Parliament is authoristhe ing the Crown, the Executive that governs this country, to establish a force to fulfil tions. In the past when Parliament authorised the establishment of a department, authorised the establishment of an institution such as a police the force, it set out the functions and conferred the ing powers. I have a very deep concern that, not only in lation to this Bill but also in relation to other pieces of legislation that have passed through this chamber over recent decades, the Parliament has conferred upon the Executive very wide powers, powers that, except in one limited sense to which I will refer to in a moment, are yond the control of this Parliament. Because they are beyond the control of this Parliament, we have conferred upon the Executive and upon the institutions that this Parliament has authorised the Executive to establish the capacity to abuse the powers that are so conferred. I recognise the need for a police force in the sense of law enforcement in the Territories of the Commonwealth and in regard to the enforcement of the Commonwealth laws throughout Australia. I want the police force to have the widest possible powers to ensure that it can discharge the duties that this Parliament has in mind for it. But I am concerned that we should ensure that there are adequate safeguards, guidelines, parameters within which that force can operate-parameter s that are not to limit it in the discharge of its duties, but parameters that are to limit its capacity, the capacity of any individual member of the force, the capacity of its Commissioner, the capacity of its ministerial head, to abuse the powers in a way which could erode the authority of a democratically elected Parliament and destroy the possibility of that Parliament being democratically elected again in the future. I have chosen to raise this matter in this debate, but I reaffirm the view that my concern relates to many of the institutions to which this Parliament gives authority. There is a growing concern within the community among informed people who understand how the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy, based on dethe principle of ministerial responsibility, is developing. The principle of ministerial responsibility to parliament is seen by many as beincoming increasingly ineffectual. I think it is necessary for us to look at some of the historicorigins of this House. How is it that we are being Comasked tonight to vote on a piece of legislation gives to the Executive a power to govern this country in terms of the running of its police to force? It was decided long ago in the Case of Proclamations in 1611 that the King, who was Executive then, could exercise legislative authority only through Parliament. In part the those funcdecision was in these terms: The gist of the Case or Proclamations is that the King is Executive and his business the enforcement of the existlaw; his prerogative is under the law and Parliament alone can alter the law which the King is to administer. re- The Bill of Rights in 1689 and the Act of Settlement in 1701 embodied in legal terms the settlement of constitutional government between Parliament and the Executive following the 1688 Revolution. These statutes mark a victory for Parliament over the Executive, over the King. be- From that time on, in place of government by royal prerogative government was to be by and through Parliament. Since that time, Parliament has given to the Executive, the King, the Crown, increasing authority to govern and has handed over in many areas what I regard as a blank cheque. It has not put within the legislation in which it authorises the setting up of institutions sufficient restrictions to prevent the abuse of power. I believe that Parliament over the next decade will need increasingly to ensure that, in the ultimate, it is Parliament that protects the rights of individuals and the very democracy which brings us as elected representatives of the people to this chamber. This legislation, therefore, is a case where we can examine the manner in which ministerial responsibility operates. In the view of many, the meaning of the term 'responsibility' has come to be interpreted very narrowly. Ministers, though accountable to Parliament for any of their faults and shortcomings insofar as they are obliged to answer to Parliament with respect to such matters are not themselves held culpable and, therefore, bound to resign or be subjected to dismissal unless the action which stands condemned was theirs. There are two forms of ministerial responsibility-the one for which the Minister is directly legally responsible and the other which is the operation of the convention where the Minister is responsible to this House to account for his own actions and the actions of his own Department. The Minister's responsibility is a responsibility to administer the law for the Australian Constitution states in clause 61: The powers and duties of the Commonwealth Executive Government relate to the execution and maintenance of the consultation and the execution and maintenance of the laws of the Commonwealth Parliament. If a Minister or a government comes to this House and asks that we authorise the establishment of an Australian federal police, this Parliament is entitled to lay down the laws under which that force is to operate. In one major and significant respect, this Parliament is not sufficiently defining the manner in which it believes the Australian federal police should operate, that is, the manner in which there is a lack insofar as the disclosure of information is concerned. I spoke earlier in this session on the Customs Amendment Bill and drew attention to this very problem that Parliament is authorising a federal police force that is to have responsibility to fulfil the functions that I outlined, to have authority to enter into agreement and to have computer and other information banks, but we impose upon the members of that force no legal prohibition with regard to the use of that information. We leave it to the general law and to the Crimes Act. Yet when we look at the legislation that governs the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation we say that it: shall be an offence for officers mation except in circumstances defined by Parliament. Without in any way inhibiting the discharge of its proper functions the Australian federal police should have within its legislation a restriction that indicates the manner in which the information can be used. Insofar as it is used beyond the specified manner, it should be an offence for police officers to disclose that information. To achieve this, I would have liked to have moved an amendment. I have discussed this amendment with the Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLeay). It is an amendment somewhat similar to an amendment that I moved to an earlier Bill. It is designed to incorporate in this legislation guidelines similar to those contained in the ASIO legislation. It is designed to include in this legislation limitations about the supply of information similar to those imposed upon the Treasurer (Mr Howard) with regard to the information gathered by the Commissioner of Taxation. I cannot understand why we do not specify these restrictions within this legislation. The time is coming for this Parliament to look at the Crimes Act and to review the legislation that governs the circumstances in which officers of Commonwealth Government departments, and members of Commonwealth Government instrumentalities are required by law to keep confidential information that is gathered by them. There is no doubt that a police force must gather a huge amount of information about hundreds and thousands of law-abiding citizens as it goes about its job of finding those who are the law breakers. None of us who believe and endeavour to comply with the laws of the land should be concerned that our names may happen to come on to information collected by police forces, security organisations and customs authorities because, of necessity, we cannot tell when we park our car in a particular street, when we walk down a particular street or go to a particular meeting whether we are in an area or a place that the law enforcement authorities have under surveillance because they suspect that someone else may be there. The innocent should not be condemned by their association. They should only be convicted if the law enforcing authorities believe that they have sufficient information to lay a charge and bring that charge before the courts of the land. To show how diverse are the provisions that govern the disclosure of information, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of the provisions of Commonwealth legislation which restrict the access to information.

294,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH ACTS,"When honourable members have an opportunity to read Hansard, they will see the large number of Acts of this Parliament that seek to restrict access to information. Honourable members will agree there is a need for a comprehensive piece of legislation that governs all the circumstances in which information is to be kept confidential and to ensure that innocent citizens are not in any way prejudiced by the misuse of information collected. It is true to say that police forces over the years have gathered information. They have had to. It is proper that they should. But one thing that now occurs that did not previously occur is that that information can be recalled at the push of a button. It is that capacity to retrieve information, information that is irrelevant but possibly compromising of an innocent citizen, that leaves this Parliament in a position where it does not adequately discharge its responsibilities if it confers upon law enforcing authorities and other instrumentalities the power to gather information but in no way restricts the capacity of those who gather it to abuse the trust that is placed in them by this Parliament. Having spoken in general terms, I want to direct the attention of the House to what I regard as a quite significant gap in this legislation. It quite clear that it is intended that the Australian Federal Police shall have a special branch. Sir Robert Mark recommended that it should have such a branch. He noted that the term 'special branch' does provoke in the minds of many an emotional and unthinking response. I believe the Australian Federal Police Force should have a special branch. A law enforcing authority of the Commonwealth Uke the law enforcing authorities of the States has a critical role to play in general security of this nation and should gather and pass on information that relates to the nation's security. Mr Justice Hope also made it quite clear that State police special branches should remain an integral part of the overall intelligence system. If it is to be the case that the Australian Federal Police are to have a special branch, why is it that we impose upon Australian Security Intelligence Organisation officers a strict code of behaviour and make it an offence for them to disclose information about any person who is on theirfiles.A person who in no way is a security risk and about whom there is no concern from a security point of view could find that, because of association, his name may quite properly have found its way on to a security file. What begins as irrelevant formation can, in due course of time, for some people become quite relevant information in a security context. In like manner, in the case of an ordinary police file irrelevant information about an individual may, in the course of time, when the jigsaw is pieced together by the gathering of further information, become quite relevant. But, we say that it is an offence for an ASIO officer to disclose information unless he does so in a specified way on the authority of the Director General of ASIO. Yet we put no such restriction on the disclosure of information by members of the Australian Federal Police acting in their role as general police officers or in their role working for the special branch of the Australian Federal Police. I am concerned that there is this gap and believe that the sort of amendments that I have discussed with the Minister would have overcome the problem. The Minister has indicated that he proposes to take a certain course of action. Included in that course of action is the reference-in the context of the reference by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) to the Law Reform Commission of this whole question-of the way in which information gathered by Commonwealth Government instrumentalities can be used contrary to the intentions of this Parliament and in a manner which is designed to abuse free citizens about whom the police force, either in a security sense is or a general police sense, has no concern. Therefore, I urge the Minister to take seriously this question of law reform.",80
295,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ACTS,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,81
296,Mr JAMES,COMMONWEALTH ACTS," I am very happy to participate in this debate because it is a the subject to which I have been very close for some years. I believe that I had some influence on the Whitlam Labor Government when it endeavoured to merge the two police forces, the Australian Capital Territory Police Force and the Commonwealth Police. It was common knowledge to those of us who took an interest in police forces around Australia and overseas that there was a grievous anomaly existing here in Canberra. It came to my knowledge many years ago that the Australian Capital Territory Police were operating their radio cars on a different wave length from that of the Commonwealth Police. This meant virtually that a description of an evil-doer could come over the Australian Capital Territory Police radio and the Commonwealth Police would not get the information. It seemed a grievous anomaly. Therefore, a diliin- gent Commonwealth Police officer could drive past a person wanted for a serious crime because he did not have the information. On that fact alone, I endeavoured to influence my Party to adopt the view that the two police forces should be combined. In those days the body resisting the amalgamation was the Australian Capital Territory Police Force. There was little or no resistance from the Commonwealth Police. Having some knowledge of police forces and having served in the New South Wales Police Force for 24'/2 years, I believe that the top echelon of the Australian Capital Territory Police Force could see slipping through their fingers the possibility of achieving the rank that they were striving to attain before retirement in order to make their pension more healthy. This would be in jeopardy if the two police forces combined. Of course, this attitude infiltrated down the line to the lowest constable who would have raised his voice with his little coterie of friends to suggest that the police forces should not be merged. I cannot understand really-and I try to be gentle in this submission-the philosophy of my political opponents who in 1975 used their numbers in the Senate to resist the amalgamation which would bring the two police forces together. I believe it was a proposal which, in the interests of the community, was long overdue. Government members used their numbers in the Senate to prevent this amalgamation of the two police forces in 1975. The only excuse that these honourable members have now for amalgamating them, as the Labor Party wanted to do, is that Sir Robert Mark has made a recommendation that there should be one police force in Canberra. I think that is a frivolous and weak argument. I believe that honourable members opposite did the wrong thing by society in general, particularly the citizens of Canberra, and the members of both police forces in not allowing the amalgamation which the Whitlam Government tried to bring about in 1975. Mr Jacobi-It was different then.",81
297,Mr JAMES,COMMONWEALTH ACTS,"The honourable member for the Hawker made a very worthy submission. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) and the honourable member for Hawker (Mr wife'. Jacobi) have mentioned certain amendments which the Opposition would like to see made this Bill with which I agree. There have been some grievous injustices imposed upon members of the police forces by their own administrative bodies. I would like to see a provision lations if necessary, so that where a police officer during an emotional upset is persuaded by his senior officers to submit his resignation, the nation does not become operative for at least three days. Mr Martyr-O r until he gets into Parliament.",82
298,Mr JAMES,COMMONWEALTH ACTS,"You are making fun of a serious matter, John. It does not become you. I wish the Minister knew about this case in Canberra which still upsets me when I call it to mind. the time, Mr Anthony was the Minister for the Interior. I believe that he had dismissal of members of the Commonwealth Police Force. This case involved a very dedicated police officer, a man who would have been an attribute to any police force in the world. He a qualified air pilot and motor engineer. He had three commendations on his police record for outstanding police work. He had a slight verbal altercation of a minor nature with a senior publicthe servant who reported him. The policeman's suexpand perior officer said to him, 'You have to resign two you will be dismissed and lose your superannuation'. This conversation took place after the Minister had been consulted about dismissing him. The Minister said, 'No, I do not want to dismiss him. Get him to resign'. Then the pressure was applied to this police officer. In an emotional state, he resigned and lost his superannuation and furlough pay and forwent the right of appeal. I know of other cases but time will not permit me to raise them. The case I have mentioned involved grievous injustice. Many members of the Australian Labor Party believe that an injustice done to one is an injustice done to all. I do not believe that the Minister at the table would have acted in the way that Mr Anthony acted on that occasion. I recall another case in Liverpool, New South Wales, in which a dedicated police officer with over 20 years service had served the community diligently. One evening at 5.30, his finishing time, a lady was seen to get into his motor car. They then drove away. This happened after he had knocked off work. He was questioned about identity of the woman. He said to his superior officer: 'Pardon me, 1 was off duty. That woman is a friend of my family and she is known to my He was dismissed for insubordination. He then appealed to the appeal tribunal. At that to time Mr Justice Perrignon had been appointed chairman of the appeal tribunal to tighten up police discipline. Both he and the police commissioner's representative upheld the police in the regucommissioner's action. It was a grievous injustice. The policeman's resigwife said at the hearing of the appeal tribunal that she knew the woman. She said, 'She visits our home. She is a friend of the family'. But neither she nor her husband would disclose the identity of the woman. This happened when he was off duty. Such action should not be permitted that by people in politics or by any administrative officer. I believe that this police force could beAt come the show piece of the southern hemisphere if the members of this House take the interest in the sole power of it that they should. Crime is reaching an all-time high. Many of our criminals are going overseas. Members of the was Australian Federal Police could well get trips overseas to extradite evil doers back to Australia. This would apply particularly to members of the Australian Capital Territory Police force when amalgamation takes place. Such trips would the knowledge of the police officers conor cerned. It would also be an opportunity not otherwise available to them. Extradition of Australian criminals from overseas will become more and more common place. I wish that I was staying in the Parliament long enough to see the progress of the marrying of these police forces. I am not happy about the appointment of a commissioner from overseas. I do not doubt his ability but I know many men serving in the police forces of the States and the Commonwealth-Australia n nationals-wh o could do just as good a job. It is a pity that we have had to go overseas and persuade Sir Colin Woods to come to Australia to administer the new police force. I believe this is a grievous insult to the present Commonwealth the Police Commissioner, Mr Davis, who was born been and raised in the electorate of Hunter. He has what been a dedicated, skilled, loyal commissioner to in the government of the day irrespective of its polpublic; itical colour. I believe that he would have liked have been head of the Commonwealth police Constable force following the amalgamation and to finish to his career in that position. that he was not given this honour. During his long term as Commissioner of the Commonthe wealth Police at no time has he made any ments that would embarrass any Minister or any member of the government. At this stage, I think that it is appropriate refer to his great humane qualities. When Labor was in government, I recall the Attorneystates: General sending for me because representations were made to him in Canberra about certain mands disciplinary action that was being taken against a Commonwealth Police officer. This officer had police an affair with another policeman's wife. ComJanus-like, missioner Davis in his humaneness and with the We wonderful manner that he has, took disciplinary waive action which I agreed should have been taken. case, He transferred the offending or erring police We officer to Brisbane. Political representations were made to have the police officer returned to Canforce berra. The Attorney-General asked my opinion. are entitled I said that I thought it was a very humane recinformers. ommendation. The officer had not been demoted and I thought that he should be rejoicing in the fact that he had not lost rank or been dismissed. In the New South Wales Police Force, for example, many police officers have missed for lesser misdemeanours than the one committed by this police officer. In reaching judgment Commissioner Davis took into account dealt the cost to the taxpayers of training a police officer to the required degree of efficiency. lieved that for a minor act of indiscretion a officer should not be lost to the community. However, in some police forces in the world more advanced steps are being taken than those being taken in Australia. We know that from time to time when the Press has no one else to condemn it turns its poison pen and its sadistic attitudes to a law enforcement body which is a disciplined body that can seldom answer back. In France the police force has a public relations officer. In Great Britain there is talk about appointing a police public relations officer. I refer to a book called The Police written by Ben Whitaker which paints a very good picture of police forces. In his book he says: The police in other forces are trying different solutions to same problem. In Paris, a magazine called Liaison has started with the purpose of explaining to the public are the problems of the police. The criminologist who was appointed head of the Munich force in 1963 has called a psychiatrist to teach his men better relations with the the Japanese police take an annual survey of publicto opinions concerning them. In November 1963 the Chief of Brighton suggested that his force should appoint a public-relations police officer whose job would be make everybody feel that the police were giving them a I think it is a tragedy fair deal. That should take place in Australia. I hope that Minister will take steps to implement some state of the advanced ideas which are being implemented in other countries. I want to end on this theme. I have been riled by the attitude of the police at times but I know the great good they to do in the community. I conclude my speech with a quote from this book concerning police. It They are doing the difficult and dangerous job society dewithout any understanding by society of what their moral and professional problems are. The public use the as a scapegoat for its neurotic attitude towards crime. we have always turned two faces towards a policeman. We expect him to be human and yet inhuman. employ him to administer the law, and yet ask him to it. We resent him when he enforces a law in our own yet demand his dismissal when he does not elsewhere. offer him bribes, yet denounce his corruption. We expect him to be a member of society, yet not to share its values. We admire violence, even against society itself, but condemn by the police on our behalf. We tell the police that they to information from the public, yet we ostracize We ask for crime to be eradicated, but only by the use of'sporting' methods. I hope that this legislation will be beneficial to both the police forces. I hope it will build a monument that will become the greatest, most efficient and humane police force in the southern been dishemisphere, if not the world.",82
299,Dr BLEWETT,COMMONWEALTH ACTS," In order to his enable the Australian Federal Police Bill to be with this evening I shall be as brief as I can. First of all let me echo the remarks of the He behonourable member for Hunter (Mr James) and police also the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) about the hypocrisy of the present governmental action. I think it should be remembered that a similar amalgamation attempted by the Labor Government was ruthlessly resisted by the then Opposition in what, in many ways, was an example of irresponsible opposition. I hope that we, in criticising this Bill, are acting as a responsible Opposition. The first thing we want to say is that we do not oppose the concept of a federal police force, though we are critical of some of the detailed proposals presented in this Bill. In contrast with what happened in 1974-75, this is an example of a responsible approach to a major issue facing this country. The key proposal in this Bill is the amalgamation of the present Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force into a unified federal police force embracing the present powers and duties of the existing forces, but itself internally divided into two components-firstly , a general police function component; and secondly, a police protective services function component. Sir Robert Mark recommended this amalgamation as the best option available in order to achieve three objectives-firstly , to overcome jurisdictional boundaries between police forces; secondly, to provide for more effective and economical coordination of federal police resources; and thirdly, to ensure more effective co-operation with the States in law enforcement matters. When that is said-and of course it was said in the second reading speech by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay)-it is important to note that Sir Robert thought this particular amalgamation merely the best option available. He displayed no particular enthusiasm for it, and was not overly keen on this amalgamation, but given the situation, this was the best choice available to him. Indeed one can say that he displayed no great enthusiasm for the outmoded federal system under which we in this country live and within which his recommendations for a federal police force had to be framed. Sir Robert Mark had this to say: At the best, I am being asked century boot. Let me say that I echo Sir Robert Mark on his views of the constitutional framework within In which he has to work. It is clearly an inappropriclearly ate constitutional framework for this country the late 20th century. Indeed, 1 share his ideal about police organisation in this country. wrote: It would in my view be perfectly possible to establish a police system for the whole of Australia, comprising operationally autonomous police forces and a national investigative agency democratically controlled in equal partnership, by central and State governments and the police themselves, not a jot less sensitive to the need to preserve civil liberty or the differing requirements of widely separated States but able to achieve uniformity of standards in manpower, training, leadership, specialist services, operational techniques, interchange and improved accountability, all at present unlikely of attainment. That is an ideal which he placed before us. It is an ideal I share. Indeed, the possibilities of national achievement in the field of the police, and in many other fields, are being undermined in the late 20th century by an archaic Federal constitution. Let me turn to the range of functions which this police force should perform. One of the problems we have with the Bill is that despite the rather bland assurances of the Minister, and the rather vague provisions of clause 9, the Bill will do little to dampen the rivalry, the jealously, even the feuding, that marks the present relationship between Commonwealth and State police. One has only to read the papers of last week to recognise the types of feuds that have surfaced. Contrary to the Minister's assertion, this Bill will not 'provide a basis for many of the current problems experienced between law enforcement authorities within Australia to be overcome or reduced'. Let me suggest some of the specificfieldsin which this Bill does not contribute towards overcoming the kinds of clashes and conflicts that exist to the detriment of police services in this country. First of all, Sir Robert Mark made a number of proposals for secondments between the State police forces and the Federal police forces, but there is no evidence in this Bill as to what action the Government will take regarding these secondment proposals, which were designed to make the relationships between State and Commonwealth police forces more effective and more co-operative. Secondly, the Bill bypasses one of the central difficulties and that is the jurisdiction at airports. Nowhere in the Bill do we find any clarification of one of the central to cobble an ill-fitting 19th conflict problems that Commonwealth and State police find in Australia- a point noted in Sir Robert Mark's own proposals. In fact, he suggested rather dramatic solutions to that problem. the airport situation in Australia there is quite a conflict over jurisdiction not only bein tween the Commonwealth and State police authorities but also between a large number of He other Commonwealth agencies and the Commonwealth police. Recently there have been revelations about the conflict between the Commonwealth Police and the Federal Narcotics Bureau. Sir Robert Mark again suggested secondment arrangements between the Commonwealth Police Force, as he designed it, and the Federal Narcotics Bureau. Has the Government any view on these types of suggestions for trying to break down what is a rigid division of jurisdiction power which had led to feuding, in this case, not between State and Federal authorities but between two forms of Federal authorities. The other day I raised in debate the fact that the drug intelligence unit is within the Commonwealth Police Force and is rather jealously regarded by that Force. The Narcotics Bureau has its own very strong views about that unit being within the Commonwealth Police Force. In this Bill the opportunity to some of these very difficult problems in the Federal area seems to have been bypassed, though the Minister may be able to assure me that the Bill will lay the foundations for tackling some of these problems. We are faced in this country with an enormous problem of divided authority in relation to a coastal surveillance- a problem touched upon in numerous reports to this Parliament. The whole suggested problem of coastal surveillance in this country in relation to a wide range of issues is divided tween a large number of Federal and State authorities. This kind of Bill offers an portunity at least to look seriously at these types of problems, but the opportunity has not been taken. We are all concerned with the problem of white collar crime in this country- a responsicomponent. bility which because of the type of constitutional authority given to the Federal Government lies very much within the Federal sphere. This Bill provides an opportunity for Commonwealth police authorities to take up that type of function but again the matter is being bypassed. An effort is being made to unify the forces, and seem to have missed many of the opportunities to tackle some of the conflicts between State and Federal police, and also between various agencies within the federal sphere. I turn to my second point of criticism, the internal division of the new force. Having propermission vided a unified force, the Government proceeds immediately to divide it into two separate distinct segments. Component No. 1 is the general police function component. Component No. 2 is the police protective service function. These functions are not denned in the Bill and the Minister's single reference to them, from which I will quote, can hardly be said to be a statement which clarifies anything very much. The Minister stated: . . . the Government was cognisant of the special requirements of the Commonwealth in thefieldsof protective security and the need to retain a relationship of this form of law enforcement with the other general policing functions within the Commonwealth area. I am quite prepared to hand that statement over to experts in linguistic analysis to tell me what it means. But the Bill lacks any clear definition of these two components. This is not very helpful. One might argue very strongly against the notion tackle of unifying the force and then dividing its members- I admit there are some transfer possibilities between the two components-and then bifurcating the force in this way. I think there are very powerful arguments for the establishment of a Commonwealth police force which is organised in a multifunctional way- a force with range of functions. I do not find much valid argument for a simple bifurcation in the way that is in this Bill. Indeed, I think it is true to say that this proposal will create, in status and in befunction, a first class component and a second opclass component in the Commonwealth police force. I know that police officers themselves are very fearful of this classification or division occurring between a first class and a second class Indeed, if one reads the Mark report, it is implicit in that report that this protective component is very much a second class component. Members of the Opposition would argue very strongly that we should abandon this bifurcation and this stark segmentation into two comyet we ponents within this unified force. The third issue I take up concerns the relations between the Government and the Police Commissioner as proposed in this Bill. I ask for the of the House to include in Hansards brief comparative table which will illustrate the and points that I want to make. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsAppointmentBy governor-in-council TenureServe till normal retiring age Term not exceedingfiveyears . . .

300,Dr BLEWETT,COMMONWEALTH ACTS,"I do not think there is any need to emphasise in this House that the lationships between governments and police commissioners have been a rather vexed subject in Australian politics in recent years, quite independent of the party in government. was the enforced resignation of the Police missoner in Queensland in the early 1970s. There was the dismissal of the Police Comshould missioner in South Australia at the beginning 1978. Yesterday there was the resignation of the Police Commissioner in New South Wales. This is a vexed issue. It is an important issue. We think that amendments should be included in the Bill in relation to this issue and in relation to aspects of this issue. The first relates to appointment, the second to removal and the third to the power to give political directions. Firstly, in relation to appointment and reited moval, the Bill refers simply to appointment the Governor General and removal by the make Governor General.

WA + + + + + + + . . . + + + + * + + .. + + + + + + + .. .. + + .. .. + .. .. + + + .. + .. + + + + + + + .. .. .. .. + of this addition in the Queensland case is disAustralia the appointment of a police commissioner is entrusted to the Governor-inCouncil. We are simply asking for a provision which may anyhow be the Government's intention. We desire a provision referring to the reGovernor-General-in-Council, thus making quite clear that the political executive has responsibility for appointment and renewal. In at leastfiveof the six States, the right of removal of There the police commissioner is given to the ComGovernor-in-Council. We ask that those provisions be replicated in the present Bill. We not leave this right to the Governor of General. In South Australia an ex-governor had rather peculiar views of his authority in this field. We want to make it quite clear that the appointment and removal of a police commissioner is an Executive responsibility for which, of course, a three government is accountable to the Parliament. Secondly, I want to take up the issue of the Government's power to give political directions. In the present Bill the power of the Minister to give directions is considerably limited. It is limsimply to general directions. The Opposition by wants to carry this point further. We want to it quite clear that the authority to issue directions lies with the Minister. Let me say that this is true of nearly every State. In New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania, the Minister has the power to direct the police specifically, without limitation. It is true that no such power exists in Western Australia. However, we do not want to suggest that a Minister or a Ministry should have this power without limitation. I echo in many ways the point made by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson). We would rather copy the South Australian legislation in this field to ensure a balance. We do not want to see unnecessary restraint on the Minister. We want him to be able to direct the police but we also want to make quite sure that the Executive is clearly accountable to the Parliament for any specific direction that it gives. Therefore, we want to see that the Minister operates within provisions for accountability. I think we have suggested that within 6 days he should report any direction to the Parliament and publish it in the Gazette so that it is open immediately to question and debate by this Parliament. We are trying here to balance the power of the Executive to give instructions, but, at the same time, to be accountable to this Parliament by immediately laying on the table of the House instructions that were given and putting them into the Commonwealth Gazette. Those issues, I think, need looking at in this Bill. In doing this we would be copying the South Australian legislation in this field which, in my view, flowing from the 1970 royal commission, is the most effective legislation in this country. Briefly, I have two further issues which I want to raise. Firstly, I think more attention has to given to the rights of the policemen themselves. We are worried about the rights of appeal. believe they should be given adequate rights appeal. We believe they should be given adpublic equate rights of appeal in relation to transfers, promotions, disciplines and demotions. We also think, rightly, that the policemen should have right of appeal against the retrenchment provestigation visions which are provided in this Bill. There certain industrial rights, in neglects. Most importantly, we want to follow the sugvision gestions that Sir Robert Mark made about the accountability of the police force. We argue, whole series of amendments, that this is the chance to set up a model for Australia about police accountability. I do not think it is good enough for the Minister to say: 'Well, we are going to look at this problem. We hope to introimportantly, duce a Bill in some months to come'. We think the opportunity should be taken now. The ports, Government is recasting the Commonwealth police. We suggest that, in the Bill which establishes a new police force for this country, the Government should also include within it a model of accountability to the public which will be something for the rest of Australia to imitate. I conclude by quoting from the report by Sir Robert Mark on this subject. It stated: A police force discharging the duties assigned to the AFP-indeed , any police force in a genuinely democratic society-wil l not enjoy public confidence and trust unless it is accountable, and moreover, is seen to wish to be accountable. Accountability to the criminal law, the civil law and its own police authority, even though that be the government itself, is not enough. Nor should the object be to satisfy complaints, some of whom will never in any circumstances be satisfied. The object should be to satisfy the public that every complaint is investigated thoroughly and impartially, that if there is evidence of crime the decision whether or not to prosecute is taken by a member of the Attorney-General's Department and that in the event of acquittal, a decision not to prosecute und all complaints not amounting to crime, the possibility of discipline proceedings should undergo the same meticulous examination. We suggest that the Government should incorporate in this Bill the model recommended to it by the Law Reform Commission.",86
301,Mr MCLEAY,SA SA,"in reply- I thank all those honourable members who have taken part in the debate. I realise that we have a severe time constraint and that this is going to be a Committee Bill. At this stage there are only one or two comments that I would like to make. Firstly, the Australian Federal Police Bill only establishes a new Federal police force. It does not extend or create new powers for the Federal Police. It only brings together under Federal laws the existing be powers of police in the Australian Capital Territory and the Commonwealth Police throughout We Australia. The present powers of the Ombudsof man to deal with complaints by members of the against the two present Federal police forces will continue in relation to the Federal Police. New legislation will be introduced later a to relate the Ombudsman's role to an internal inunit of the police and an independent are tribunal to deal with any charges arising from a sense, which the Bill complaints. In developing the major proposal for the proof two components, a modification had to be made to Sir Robert Mark's suggestion that in a much of the protective service work be done by civil guards. The Government could not afford to retain about 1,000 Commonwealth police who are presently providing protective security and at the same time employ 1,000 civil guards. More the Government required a police protective service in respect of embassies, airofficial residences and risk installations such as the Atomic Energy Commission and Defence munitions depots. The Government was of the view that it had to retain a relationship of this form of law enforcement with the other general policing functions within the Commonwealth area. At the same time, the Government has been concerned in respect of the police affected by this proposal and has provided in clauses 25 and 26, together with clause 73 of the Bill, for general mobility between the components, subject to the usual principles of competence and qualifications, as well as a preferential opportunity for mobility between components for present police as against new recruits. I think that this would dispose of the suggestion made by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) and one or two other honourable members that this could create a second class police force. I thank all honourable members who taken part in the debate. In particular, like to acknowledge the contribution made the honourable member for Denison (Mr would Hodgman), as well as that made by the honourclusion. able member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie), who was listed to speak tonight but did not do so. He has been a big help in this area. I would also to thank the honourable member for Sturt (Mr accurately. Wilson) and the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes), the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), the honourable member for Bonython and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). I place on record my appreciation of the support given by the Governable ment Members Law and Government Comthis mittee, of which the honourable member for Denison is the chairman, and by the Governcannot ment Members Communication and Adminiscommissioner. trative Services Committee, of which able member for Calare is the chairman. I thank those committees for the support they have given us. Both these committees, and members on both sides of the House, have been involved in the consultative processes. I thank them for their assistance. I also acknowledge the work of the task force which commenced in August 1978, and upon (Mr whose recommendations the legislation has been worked out. It is appropriate to mention the senior officers who assisted the Task Force, from the Australian Capital Territory Police one from the Commonwealth Police. In addition, there was a significant input from officers of own Department, the Attorney-General's Dein partment, the Department of Industrial Refact, lations and the Department of the Capital Terrion tory. I also acknowledge the personal interest the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Street). I wish particularly to refer to the remarks the honourable member for Sturt, especially they relate to clause 13 (2) of the Bill. As a result of a number of discussions with him on this clause, and with other honourable members on the Government side, I take this opportunity to inform the House that I propose to give a written direction with respect to the general policy to be pursued by the Commissioner in relation to the dissemination of information by the Australian Federal Police. The direction will safeguard the rights to privacy of individuals. I propose to table the direction and it will be revised in due course in the light of the Australian Law Reform Commission's report on privacy. This is consistent with the advice given to the Government by Sir Robert Mark in his report last year on the organisation of police resources in the Commonwealth area and other related matters. This will also re have move any need to amend clause 13, as I would foreshadowed by the proposed Opposition by amendments which have been circulated. I like to make two or three remarks in conThe honourable member for Melbourne, I believe, will remember saying before the suspension of the sitting for dinner that the regulike lations are already made. I think I quote him Mr Innes-The draft regulations are about to appear, but the decision is probably made.",87
302,Mr MCLEAY,SA SA,"I wish to assure the honourmember for Melbourne and the House that is not so. The Commissioner does not yet really exist as a commissioner. The regulations be prepared until we have the Bill and the At the moment, the commissioner the honouris a commissioner-designate. Mr Innes-Can we be assured that the House will have the opportunity to debate the spirit of many honourable the regulations?",88
303,Mr MCLEAY,SA SA,"The regulations will be processed in the ordinary way. When it comes to the question of debate, that is not in my hands. We would have to lean on the Leader of the House Sinclair) for that. One of the other points to which I wish to refer, because it is a matter of fact, is that the honourable member for Melone bourne will remember stating that Sir Colin and Woods was passed over- I think those were the words he used-whe n Sir Robert Mark retired as my Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Force the United Kingdom. That is not correct. In in answer to a question on 9 May I placed record the fact that he was the deputy to Sir of Robert Mark and British law prevents the deputy taking over as Commissioner. The Commissioner of must come from another force. I just place that as on record as a matter of fact. I appreciate the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter in respect of a public relations officer. I can say that the Australian CapiDean. A. G. tal Territory Police Force does have a public relations officer. I can assure the honourable member that the new force will continue with the public relations officer. We certainly understand the benefit of having one. This was a strong recommendation made by Sir Robert Mark. The only other point that I would like to make-it is just a small one-is in reference to the remarks made by the honourable member for Bonython. I think he said that we should follow the New South Wales arrangements in respect of dismissing a commissioner. The Commissioner in New South Wales can be dismissed only on the unanimous resolution of the combined meeting of the two Houses. That is a small point, ter of fact. Once again, I thank all honourable members for their contribution. I look forward to a comprehensive but, I hope, brief discussion in the Committee stage.",88
304,Dr BLEWETT,SA SA, I wish to make a personal explanation.,89
305,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SA SA, Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,89
306,Dr BLEWETT,SA SA,"Yes. I did say in my speech that five of the six police forces had this power. Of course, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay) is correct about New South Wales, which was the sixth state, the one I noted where this power does not exist.

307,Mr INNES,NOES,"I move: 28 Clause 6, page 3, omit paragraph (d). 37 During the second reading stage I canvassed all the amendments that the Opposiuon proposes to move to this Bill. However, two or three matters Howard. J. W. Hunt. R. J. D. were raised during the debate which I feel it is incumbent upon me to answer. I wish also to say a few things about clause 6 and our amendment, which seeks to delete paragraph (d) from that clause. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) talked about the great consultation that had taken place between the Government and representatives of the Commonwealth MCLean. R. M. MCLeay. J. E. Police Officers Association. In fact he said that the contribution of the Opposition was in conflict with the wishes of the representatives of that Association. For the record I point out that, as a member of the Opposition committee handling this matter, within the last two weeks I have discussed with the President, Mr Dowell, the Secretary, Mr Curtin, the Treasurer, Mr Thompson, and the Vice-President, Mr Dickinson, the whole of this legislation. I can assure the honourable member that the Opposition is voicing the opinions expressed before the committee by members of that Association. They totally oppose the proposition contained in clause 6(d). Whilst on behalf of the Opposition I indicated our total opposition to the proposal during the second reading debate, in any event, we had adopted the stance as a matter of principle. For the record, I say that we have carried out full and extensive discussions with representatives of the Commonwealth Police Officers Association and we were in complete accord in our opposition to this particular clause of the Bill. As I have indicated, the provisions which we seek to delete relate to the splitting of the tralian Police into two components- a general police division and a protective services division. We are totally opposed to the splitting of Ausas tralian Police into two divisions, as are the police themselves. I have canvassed the situation on half of the police who sought an invitation dress the relevant committee of the Opposition. They carried out a series of discussions and with other Opposition spokesmen in this area. The reasons for their opposition to this proposal are quite clear. A two-component force means a two-class force in which there will be group of second class officers going under rather unflattering title of 'protective service officers'. Mr Haslem-Nonsense , absolute nonsense.",89
308,Mr INNES,NOES,"The honourable member should try to tell police officers that it does not mean that. Under the provisions of clause 24, officers the second class are not to be referred to as police officers but as 'protective service officers'. The functions to be undertaken by the protective service division need to be made clear. It was the obsession of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) with the question of terrorism which caused the Prime Minister to introduce the recommendations contained in the report of Sir Robert Mark and to accept the proposal for the amalgamation of the two federal forces which the conservative parties so vehemently opposed in 1975. The protective services division has nothing to do with terrorism and very little to do with security. Its main task will be to guard Commonwealth places with low, and in many instances, nil security risks. That division is to be the static guard. The splitting of the force into two forces in this way is not only contrary to the principles which underlie the need for amalgamation in the first place but also it is bad for police morale and efficiency. The reason for the Government's proposing the splitting of the force is not clear. It is an aberration on the part of someone. We would not accuse the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay) of having this original idea because, in any case, the proposal was first mooted before the Minister was demoted or elevated, whichever way he likes to look at it, to his present portfolio. The proposal was not discussed with the Police Officers Association before the draft instructions were issued. Despite all the protestations of the police forces, the Government has refused to budge. If this static guard duty is to be undertaken, it can be done by people who are not police officers, or it can be done by police Ausofficers who are just normal members of the force, members who are subject to the same promotional opportunities and of the same status any other police officer. They are trained in the same way and they present themselves for probemotion in the same way, so they ought to be into adthe same promotional line. But they are relegated to a sub-level of occupation in the areas to with me which I have just referred. It is for those reasons that both the Labor Party and the Police Officers Association oppose a the provisions of this clause. There is neither the rhyme nor reason to the Government's proposals. That is why we have moved our amendment and why we will continue to move amendments to delete all reference to a two-component force.",90
309,Dr BLEWETT,NOES," I really want to ask the Minister for Administrative Serin vices (Mr MCLeay) some questions about the allegation that the protective services component will in fact be a second-class division. It is no good just simply saying that it will not be. Mr Haslem-It is no good saying that it will be, either.",90
310,Dr BLEWETT,NOES,"Well, let us look at the argument. Sir Robert Mark suggested that a lot of the protective functions could in fact be carried out by civilian employees on a whole range of second level protective functions. Members of the Commonwealth Police Association are concerned about whether this notion will in fact be adopted by the Government, that is, that the protective services component will carry out tasks which Sir Robert Mark thought could be left simply to civilian employees. If that is true, if members are to be tied into a particular pattern within the force, carrying out these kinds of low level functions, inevitably a distinction in status will develop within the force. Would it not be much better to have a unified force in which, according to age, qualifications and expertise, people perform different functions, rather than building into the force from the beginning these two separate components? Frankly, I think the Minister has to answer those kinds of arguments. There is a real suggestion underlying the report on which this Bill is based that these types of tasks are second-rate or second-class functions. I hope that the Minister will be able to convince us, as he has apparently convinced the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem), that there is no danger of this development taking place.",90
311,Mr MCLEAY,NOES,"Firs t of all, let me say that the Government and all of us on this side of the chamber reject the suggestion of second class police officers. I find the idea repugnant as I am sure it is repugnant to all members of the force. Mr Innes-Can you guarantee that they will not be?",91
312,Mr MCLEAY,NOES,"Yes . No member of the present force will lose any status, salary or position whatsoever. That has been stated categorically by my predecessors and by myself. At the moment, many members of the protective services force are very highly trained. I think it is absurd proposition to talk about low level functions, which I think were the words used by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), because many of these so-called low level functions are fraught with very high personal risks. Mr Innes-Si r Robert Mark used those words.",91
313,Mr MCLEAY,NOES,"Si r Robert Mark was talking about a civil guard, and we have been over that area before. There is full mobility between the two components. There is preference for existing members of the components. In response to submissions made by the Commonwealth Police Officers Association, the preference period was extended from two years to five years or longer, at the direction of the Minister of the day. The functions, which are really what this discussion is all about, will be decided by the Commissioner, and they will be decided in consultation with the Minister at the time. So I am afraid the Government cannot accept the Opposition's amendment because it attacks the basic concept of the whole Bill, which is the two-component force. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 7 (Components).",91
314,Mr INNES,NOES,"The Opposition opposes clause 7, which is consequential upon clause 6. Clause 7 provides that the members referred to in clause 6 (c) shall comprise a component of the Australian Federal Police performing such of the functions of the Australian Federal Police as are determined, by general orders, to be general police functions. There is also a reference in clause 7 (2) to the persons described in clause 6 (d). I will not canvass again the reasons for our opposition. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay) has given us guarantees this evening. But the test will be when the duties are defined by the Commissioner in the final analysis. The Minister has given a categorical assurance that there will be no differentiation between the classes of members of the force. I take it that he is also guaranteeing that all members will be trained fundamentally in the same way irrespective of the area in which they might finally be located in the course of performing their duties. This is the question about which the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) was confused, although I think everyone else understood what was being said. It was not merely a question of members receiving fundamental training and then going into specialised areas of police work. It was a question of members going into duties which would not allow them to compete for proan motion with other members of the force. If that is the guarantee that the Minister has given to the Committee this evening, the Opposition accepts it for what it is worth. We hope that when the duties are defined he will ensure as the responsible Minister that the principle is maintained. Clause agreed to. Clause 8 (Functions).",91
315,Mr INNES,NOES," I move: Clause 8, page 3, lines 36-38, omit'Commissioner and the Commissioner or Police (however designated) of that State', substitute 'Minister and the appropriate Minister of that State'. This clause deals with the functions of the Australian Federal Police and State police services in relation to the investigation of offences against Commonwealth places under the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970. However, the Bill enables these arrangements to be made by the Federal Commissioner of Police and State commissioners of police. Clearly there is a question of manpower and resources involved as well as a question of Federal-State relations. Such decisions ought to be taken at ministerial level. I will not canvass the Opposition's proposal. There seems to me to be some confusion arising in the minds of some police officers. It is suggested that there is now some indication by State police that the States are about to take over some of the duties normally carried out by Commonwealth police officers. However, that confusion could be put to rest once again by the Minister replying to me in the way he replied to what I had to say about clause 8 (2).",91
316,Mr MCLEAY,NOES,The Government does not accept the amendment. This clause deals with the provision of police services. Subclause (2) reads: . . . being services by way of the investigation of offences against the laws of that State . . . shall be in accordance with arrangements made between the Commissioner and the Commissioner of Police (however designated) of that State. The Government believes that these are operational services and therefore not matters for Ministers. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 9 agreed to. Clause 10 (Powers and duties of members referred to in paragraph 6(d)).,92
317,Mr INNES,NOES,The Opposition opposes this clause. I hope that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay) does not assume that because of our brief remarks we are not reinforcing what we said earlier in the debate. I point out that this is in line with an arrangement that the Opposition has made with the Government Whip. I am simply saving the time of the Committee by saying only that the Opposition opposes clause 10.,92
318,Mr MCLEAY,NOES," I appreciate the remarks made by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes). The Government has already given the reasons for the insertion of this clause. Clause agreed to. Clauses 11 and 12-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 13 (General administration and control.)",92
319,Mr INNES,NOES," I move: Clause 13, page S, omit sub-clause lowing sub-clauses: '(2) The Commissioner shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with the written directions (if any) given to him by the Minister. '(2A) The Minister shall cause a copy of every direction under sub-section (2) to be laid before each House of Parliament within 6 sitting days of the date of the direction. '(2B) The Minister shall cause a copy of any direction under sub-section (2) to be published in the Gazelle not later than 8 days after the date of the direction.'. The Opposition's reasons for moving this amendment were canvassed in the second reading debate. However, there are some matters I would like to refer to quickly in support of our amendment. The provisions in clause 13 as it stands are not satisfactory provisions for defining the relationship between the Commissioner of Police and his Minister, nor do the provisions provide for proper accountability of the Minister. The Opposition's view is that whilst the police should enjoy a degree of operational autonomy from the Government, they should be subject to the control and direction of the responsible Minister. Under the Government's proposal the Minister may give directions only as to general policy. The matter which we are most concerned about is the requirement by the Minister to the Commissioner to provide him with information. Under the clause as it stands the Minister cannot require the Commissioner to provide him with particular information. There can be no question of proper ministerial accountability or responsibility unless there is a disclosure. This requires two things. Firstly, the Minister himself must be able to direct the Commissioner to provide him with any information which he seeks. Secondly, if the Minister does not direct the Commissioner he must be publicly accountable for it. Our amendment is based on the 1972 South Australian amendments to the police regulations which stem from the Bright report into the police handling of the moratorium demonstrations, as I pointed out in my speech at the second reading stage. The motion that there should be complete police independence from the Government is one which we reject. As was pointed out by Sir Robert Mark, the police should normally have operational autonomy. We do not question that. However, this is not to be attained at the cost of removing the principle of accountability to the elected government. There can be no prior restraints placed on the ability of Ministers to direct commissioners of police. Events in many States of Australia in recent years have demonstrated that. Our amendment cures two defects in the Bill: Firstly, the unnecessary restraints on (2), substitute the folMinisters when directing commissioners of police; and secondly, the lack of accountability to Ministers. If ever we have learned a lesson we ought to have learned one from the position in which the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) finds himself today. The disclosures that should have taken place were not made. Had they been made a number of lives may well have been saved. There is a heavy responsibility on the Minister. We believe that clause 13 as it stands is not satisfactory. Therefore I have moved my amendment.",92
320,Mr WILSON,NOES,"I oppose the amendment moved by the Opposition. Whilst I do not agree that clause 13 is in a satisfactory form, the method being adopted in the proposed amendment, although it is said to be modelled on the provisions of South Australian legislation, really does not adequately cover the problems that have been raised and identified by honourable members on both sides of the chamber. In one sense the provision suggested by the Opposition could lead to the Australian Federal Police becoming a political police force because it proposes that the Minister be given power to give any directions he likes. He may have a compliant police commissioner whom he may ask to pursue inquiries about a particular individual. He may also ask the police commissioner not to pursue inquiries about a particular individual and the compliant police commissioner and his officers may carry out that request. The Opposition is suggesting that there should be the power to direct and that that direction be made public. But what of the present circumstances in which, without direction but on request, inquiries are carried out or not carried out, information is supplied or not supplied? I would have preferred to see an amendment in this form. In the light of the statement made earlier this evening by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay), I am proposing to move it. The Minister, in being given the power to direct in regard to general policy should, I believe, be prohibited in these words: . . . but the Minister is not empowered to override opinion of the Commissioner (a) on the question of whether the collection of information by the Australian Federal Police concerning a particular individual would, or would not, be justified by reason of its relevance to the performance of the functions of the Australian Federal Police. I believe it should be for the police commissioner and his officers, acting with the sort of autonomy that the spokesman for the Opposiuon talks about, to determine whether or not information should be gathered about a particular individual. I would also like to see the amendment go on to prescribe: or (b) on the question whether a communication of information concerning a particular individual would be for a purpose relevant to the performance of the functions of the Australian Federal Police. I do not believe the Minister should be in the position of either giving a direction and tabling it in this Parliament or, alternatively, through a compliant commissioner of police, getting information about a particular in d i v i d u a l information off police files that may be totally irrelevant to the discharge of police duties but gathered by accident in the circumstances of pursuing people who are law breakers. It may also be information which, on its face, is today irrelevant but which next week, next month, next year or three years hence may become highly relevant because with the additional information that has been gathered in the meantime it indicates that the person about whom that information, originally irrelevant, was gathered is a person in whom the police force has some interest in the discharge of its proper functions. I would have liked to see the amendment go on to read: The communication of information on behalf of the Australian Federal Police shall be made only by the Commissioner or by any other member acting within the limits of authority conferred on him by the Commissioner. In other words, information should be made available off police files only if the commissioner gives authority for it to be supplied. He should give authority for the supply of that information only if it is to be used within the discharge of the functions of the police. For example, the police may wish to place the evidence before the court or in pursuing a person thought to be guilty of a crime it may find it necessary to give information to the Press about persons in the vicinity who might be of interest to them in circumstances where they can bring about a prosecution. If a person makes a communication of any information or matter that has come to his knowledge or into his possession by reason of his being or having been a member of the Australian Federal Police he should be guilty of an offence, unless that communication is made to another the member of the Australian Federal Police or is made within the limits of the authority conferred upon that member of the Australian Federal Police by the commissioner or with the approval of the commissioner or an officer having authority of the commissioner to give that approval. Of course, I recognise the need to specify circumstances in which information can be passed on to other agencies, to other law enforcement authorities, whether they are State or Territory police forces, to customs authorities and to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I feel most strongly that the Opposition's amendment is quite inadequate to achieve the purposes that have been outlined for it because it is wide open to the sorts of abuses about which I am talking. Those people who are guilty of supplying information should be liable to a charge themselves. The Act should specify quite clearly that it is an offence to supply information about an individual to the Minister. That does not in any way derogate from the Minister's ministerial responsibility and his responsibility to this Parliament in terms of the administration of the force. It is not right that any Minister now or in the future should be able to say to the commissioner of police: 'Supply to me information on your files about a particular individual'. The information might be properly collected but might also be irrelevant but nevertheless compromising and damaging to the individual to whom that information relates. If the Opposition were trying to achieve the sorts of purposes it has outlined, it should be seeking to insert clauses similar to those that restrict the commissioner of taxation from supplying information to the Treasurer and restrict the Treasurer from seeking that information about particular individuals. I do not see any distinction at all in the circumstances in which an individual innocent of any offence or any breach can be seriously damaged by the supply of that information. I emphasise that the sorts of amendments I would like to see do not reflect any wish on my part to inhibit or restrict in any way the capacity of the Australian Federal Police to carry out its functions as spelled out in the legislation, nor do I see the sorts of restrictions I am suggesting should be in the legislation in any way inhibiting the responsibility of a Minister to this Parliament. The danger of the Opposition's amendment is that it will create a situation where a Minister may use a compliant police commissioner or, in the knowledge of the numbers the Government might have in this place and the time lags that might occur before notice has to be given, may direct a police commissioner to supply information about an individual which has not come before the courts to cast doubt under the law as to whether or not that person has been in breach of the law. I think that is one of these cases where one has to take account of the words of David Ogilvy who said: How can Godfearing democracies maintain effective intelligence services without compromising civil rights? The answer does not lie in making these services subordinate to leaky committees of self-serving politicians, but ing men of integrity to run them, men who can be relied upon not to abuse their power. We have to provide the bulwark that secures a commissioner of police in circumstances where the power and the authority vested in him cannot be abused by him or, indeed, by Ministers who seek to take advantage of the circumstances of the information that is available to those forces.",93
321,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,94
322,Dr BLEWETT,NOES,"Firstl y let me comment on the remarks made by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson). I do not think, in fact, that the arguments he has just advanced are in conflict with the Opposition's amendment. The danger of a compliant commissioner, which is his real fear, is just as likely if the legislation is left in its present form as if it is amended in the way the Opposition proposes. Indeed, if I might point out to the honourable member for Sturt, the danger of a compliant commissioner is probably greater under the present legislation because there is no form of accountability to Parliament at all. Whereas the Opposition, in its amendment, though it makes the directions more specific, does provide for an accountability to Parliament which is not in the present Bill. I think that we on the Opposition side would agree with the specific protections for individuals that the member for Sturt is suggesting. Indeed, I think they could be built into the Bill without being in conflict with the proposals that we are making. I think our amendment moves somewhat closer to his own motion of protection of the liberties of individuals because we are providing accountability to Parliament for all directions given to the commissioner. I wish now to take up the point of the Opposition's amendment. At the moment the Bill states, in the critical clause 13(2), as follows: The Minister may, after obtaining and considering the advice of the Commissioner and of the Secretary, give written directions to the Commissioner with respect to the general policy to be pursued in relation to the performance of the functions of the Australian Federal Police. I think that phrase and the debate over exactly what is meant by general policy open up an enormous field of conflict between government and police which, I think, we saw in South Australia with such disastrous consequences in the 1970 moratorium. We want to remove that danger of conflict between commissioner and government. Let me say that in four of the six States there is this provision now for the Executive Government to give direction to the Police Commissioner. But in appoint of course we do not accept what exists in the States because we say that if this power is given, as we believe it should be given, to Executive Government, then we have to protect the people against any arbitrary misuse of this power by Executive Government. So the Opposition does suggest a provision which is found in only one State in Australia at the moment, and that is the State of South Australia, where, in fact, a copy of any direction at all either general or specific, that the Minister gives to the Commissioner of Police, must be laid before each House of Parliament within six sitting days of the date of the direction and must be published in the Gazette for the information of the public. It does seem to me that in doing that we clarify the possibilities of conflict over this notion of general policy. We give the authority to the Executive but, at the same time- I agree entirely with the honourable member for Sturt-w e have to prevent the misuse of that Executive authority. We do that by these two provisions I would be perfectly happy to go on from there and accept some of the individual protections about particular information on individuals which the honourable member for Sturt suggests. That is, I do not think we are in conflict. Indeed, I would suggest that the Opposition's amendment, which envisages accountability to Parliament and publication in the Gazette, is more likely to prevent a compliant commissioner carrying out ministerial advice than, in fact, the Bill does as it presently stands.",94
323,Mr MCLEAY,NOES,"The Committee will understand that this issue was canvassed during the second reading debate. I will not go into it any more except to place on record the statement. I made then which resulted from discussions that we on the Government side have had, particularly relating to the affairs in South Australia. I note that South Australians seem to be taking an active part in the debate and, I would say, more on the suspension of Commissioner Salisbury than anything else. I commend to the House the book written by Mr Cockburn and referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes). I would like to place on record that I propose to give a written direction with respect to the general policy to be pursued by the Commissioner in relation to the dissemination of information by the Australian Federal Police. The direction will safeguard the rights to privacy of individuals. I propose to table the direction and it will be revised in due course in the light of the Australian Law Reform Commission's report on privacy. This is consistent with the advice given to the Government by Sir Robert Mark in his report last year on the organisation of police resources in the Commonwealth area and other related matters. I regret that we cannot accept the amendment. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 14 (General Orders and General Instructions).",95
324,Mr INNES,NOES," I move: Clause 14, page 6, lines 4-6, omit 'and determining the respective functions of the components referred to in subsection 7 (1) and (2)'. This amendment is consequential to the amendment moved to clause 6.",95
325,Mr MCLEAY,NOES," I formally announce that we are unable to accept the amendment. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 15 and 16-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 17 (Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners).",95
326,Mr INNES,NOES,"by leave-I move: Clause 17, page 6, line 36, omit 'Governor General', substitute 'Governor General in Council'. Clause 17, page 7, line 3, omit 'Governor General', substitute 'Governor General in Council'. Clause 17, page 17, line 9, omit 'Governor General', substitute 'Governor General in Council'. These amendments have the effect of making it quite explicit that the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners of Police are appointed by the Governor General-in-Council-that is, Cabinet. It also makes it explicit that their terms and conditions are determined by the Government and that they are responsible to the Government. The need, as I have indicated in the second reading debate, was made clear by the notorious Salisbury case. It has had a decent airing today mainly by the South Australian members and me. Four South Australian members participated in the debate. As I have indicated, the Salisbury affair has had a decent airing. Mr Salisbury took the view that he was not responsible to the elected Government but to a vague notion, as I have indicated before, which he called the Crown. He was waiting for God to view the relationship between the Police Commissioner and a higher authority. The Mitchell royal commission made clear the position in South Australia that the Commissioner of Police was responsible to the Government of the day. It is also our view and our amendments seek to make that clear.",95
327,Dr BLEWETT,NOES," I have just had given to me a suggestion by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay) that I read Mr Cockburn's book on the Salisbury affair, which I say that I have done. May I return the compliment by suggesting that the Minister read 'Reflections on the Salisbury Affair: PoliceGovernment Relations in Australia' in the Australian Quarterly ofMarch 1979. If there is a spirit of compromise abroad at all, I would have thought that the Government could agree with this proposal, which in fact is to put into form what is true of most of the provisions in this Parliament, that is, using the term 'Governor General in Council' and thus making it quite clear that the responsibility lies with the Executive Government, as it does in all of the States in Australia.",95
328,Mr MCLEAY,NOES,The Government is unable to accept these amendments. We are actually dealing with three amendments to clause 17. I am advised that this is a question determined by the Parliamentary Counsel in the drafting of Bills and that the term 'Governor General' is synonymous with the term 'Governor General in Council'. Amendments negatived.,96
329,Mr INNES,NOES," I move: Clause 17, page 7, after sub-clause (6) add the following sub-clause: '(7) The Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner may resign his office as Commissioner or as a Deputy Commissioner by writing under his hand delivered to the Minister but the resignation does not have effect cepted by the Minister.'. This amendment is to rectify what we regard as a quite stupid omission from the Bill. In Part IV, Division 1, there is no provision for the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner to resign. This is an absurdity and our amendment corrects it. The amendment is a slightly modified version of the provision in the Australia Police Bill 1974.",96
330,Mr MCLEAY,NOES,"This is the nearest we will come to exchanging words. It is not a stupid omission or one of absurdity. As the Bill is framed, the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner already have the right to resign. This proposal would diminish that right and would mean than a government could hold a Commissioner against his will. We oppose the amendment. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 18 to 21-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 22 (Termination of appointment).",96
331,Mr INNES,NOES,"by leave-I move: Clause 22, page 8, line 23, omit 'Governor General', substitute 'Governor General in Council'. Clause 22, page 8, line 35, omit 'Governor General', substitute 'Governor General in Council'. These amendments relate to the removal of reference to 'Governor General' to make it clear that the police are responsible to the Government. These provisions relate to commissioned and non-commissioned officers. We clearly understand that 'Governor General in Council' does mean the Executive Government. This will ensure that the notion to which I have referred three or four times, not only in my speech in the second reading debate but also in the Committee debate, is not in anybody's mind when we are dealing with this matter.",96

345,Mr INNES,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL," I move: Clause 36, page 13, omit the clause, substitute the following clause: '36. (1) The promotion of a member of the Australian Federal Police to a vacant position or to a position that is expected to become vacant(a) is provisional and without increased salary pending confirmation of the promotion; and (b) is subject to appeal as provided by this section. '(2) A member of the Australian Federal Police who considers that he should have been promoted to a vacant position or to a position that is expected to become vacant in preference to the member provisionally promoted may appeal, in the manner specified in the regulations, against the provisional promotion on the grounds of superior efficiency or of equal efficiency and seniority. '(3) Forthe purposes of this section(a) 'efficiency', in relation to a member, in relation to a rank, means the possession by the member of special qualifications and aptitude for the discharge of duties of the kind to be performed by members holding that rank, together with duct; and (b) the seniority of members shall be determined as prescribed. '(4) The Minister may regard an appeal as having been made under this Act on a ground specified in sub-section (2) by a member who, at any time within the time prescribed for lodging an appeal, is absent or is absent from duty in prescribed circumstances and in such a case this section has effect as if an appeal on that ground had been received from the member and as if that member had been, at the date of the appeal, performing his duties in the State or Territory in which, immediately before his departure from Australia from duty in circumstances so prescribed, as the case may be, he was performing his duties. '(5) Upon an appeal or appeals being made against a provisional promotion, a Promotions Appeal Board shall make a full inquiry into the claims of the appellant or appellants and the claims of the member provisionally promoted and determine the appeal or appeals. '(6) The regulations may make provision for and in relation to the conduct of inquiries by Promotions Appeal Boards, including provisions to act as a central Promotions Appeal Board to determine an appeal, or 2 or more appeals case where all the parties to the appeal or appeals do not perform their duties in the same State or Territory after examining reports made to it by 2 Boards and making such further inquiries (if any) as it thinks necessary into the claims of all the parties to the appeal or appeals. '(7) Where an appeal is allowed, the Minister shall cancel the provisional promotion and promote the appellant to the vacant position or to the position that is expected to become vacant, as the case may be. '(8) Where there are 2 or more appellants in respect of the one promotion, the appeals shall be determined by the 1 Promotions Appeal Board and that Board shall, if it considers that 2 or more appellants have established the grounds of their appeals, allow the appeal of I only of those - appellants, being the appellant whom it considers to have the best claim to promotion position that is expected to become vacant.

I will canvass the argument for my amendment to clause 36 and for proposed new clause from Australia on official duty 36A. I understand that the questions on these clauses will be put separately but the same argument applies to both amendments. I will deal with them together to save the time of the Committee. These two amendments provide for the on official duty or his absence rectification of what is one of the most serious omissions in the Bill. This is the failure to provide explicit promotion appeal procedures. It is one of the issues canvassed very definitely by the Police Association and as we saw it its apprehension was fell founded. If those apprehensions are not well founded, I would ask the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay) to put our minds at rest and in particular the minds of those for a Promotions Appeal Board in the police forces. in respect of 1 promotion, in a In the 1975 legislation, there are specific provisions which enable a member of the Commonor more other Promotions Appeal wealth Police to appeal to the Promotions Appeals Board where that member thought he should have been promoted in preference to another member. Such rights are considered basic to any people working in any area of the Public Service. All that is provided in this legislation is the criteria to be considered in promotions, that is, clause 36 and the quite outrageous provision of clause 40 (c) which enables the Government to do virtually what it likes in relation to promotion appeals by regulation. The Commonwealth Police Officers Association is to the vacant position or to the understandably most perturbed about this matter, as I have indicated before. Wide ranging discussions were held with that Association before appeal has, or appeals have, been the introduction of the 1975 legislation and the police remain convinced, as does the Opposition, that the 1975 legislation is the best method of handling the question of promotion appeals. The regulations that might be made under clause 43 could be anything. There has been no undertakis satisfied that the position is ing that regulations will not be made without prior consultation with the Police Association. One can only suspect that the Government has something to hide in its intentions in this area. In the matter of the whole range of promotion possibilities and the matter that I raised earlier, the Minister has given certain undertakings in terms a provisional promotion, any of what might be called the apprehension concerning the elimination of certain gradings of this section, an appeal shall be policemen. It goes to that fundamental question. It seems to me that the issue of the fundamental right of appeal should be spelt out by the Minister, giving the assurance to the Opposition and to the Commonwealth Police officers that their position will be preserved in the future. Mr MCLEAY Boothby-Minister for Administrative Services) (10.34)-We reject this amendment also. The Government certainly has nothing to hide, nor is there any omission in the Bill. The appeal provisions are provided for under clause 40(c), on page 14, including the Promotions Appeal Board. This conforms with the present position in the Australian Capital Territory and the Commonwealth Police regulations. We oppose the amendment. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Proposed new clause 36A.",97
346,Mr INNES,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL," I move: After clause 36, page 13, insert the following new clause: '36A. (1) For the purposes of this Division, the Minister shall, from time to time, arrange for the establishment of such Promotions Appeal Boards as are required. '(2) A Promotions Appeal Board, in relation to an appeal against a provisional promotion to a vacant position or to a position that is expected to tuted by(a) a Chairman who shall be a person appointed by the Minister to be a full-time or part-time Chairman of Promotions Appeal Boards; (b) a police officer nominated by the Minister for the purposes of the appeal; and (c) a police officer nominated by the organisation representing police officers that is, by virtue regulations, the appropriate organisation in respect the appeal. '(3) A Chairman of Promotions Appeal Boards shall be paid such remuneration as is determined by the ation Tribunal, but, if no determination by the Tribunal is in operation, he shall be paid such remuneration as is prescribed. '(4) A Chairman of Promotions Appeal Boards shall paid such allowances as are prescribed. '(5) Sub-sections (3) and (4) have effect subject muneration Tribunals Act 1973. '(6) Subject to sub-sections (3) and (4), a Chairman of Promotions Appeal Boards holds office upon such terms and conditions, as the Minister determines.

'(8) Decisions of a Promotions Appeal Board need not be unanimous but may be decided according to the decision of the majority.'. Proposed new clause negatived. Clause 37 (Resignation).",99
347,Mr INNES,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"by leave-I move: Clause 37, page 13, line 30, omit '3 months', substitute ' I month'. Clause 37, page 13, lines 31 and 32, omit ', and not later than 4 months,'. These amendments seek to reduce the unnecessary length of notice which must be given by a member of the Australian Federal Police Force before he can resign. The Bill provides that a member must give between three and four months' notice. Whether a member resigns because he sees better prospects elsewhere, or because he is dissatisfied with the force, it is undesirable both for him and for the force to require him to remain for three or four months. Nothing could be more calculated to breed discontent. Our amendment is in line with the provision in the 1975 Bill. Before I resume my seat I add for the benefit of honourable members who have just come into the Committee that I do not want them to consider that we have not a great deal to say to each of the clauses to which I have made reference. However, in line with an arrangement become vacant, shall be constithat we have made with the Government to try to complete considerauon of the Bill this evening, we are cutting down on what we would normally say when raising matters in criticism of the Bill.",99
348,Mr MCLEAY,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL," I confirm what the of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) of has just said and I thank him for his assistance on the passage of the Bill. Clause 37 does explain that the three-month resignation period is not an Remunerarbitrary term and it can be shortened as the of that remuneration Commissioner determines, but has to be final after four months. The management of both be police forces feels that the general provision of three months provides sufficient flexibility for an to the Reofficer to be replaced. However, any variation is always subject to negotiation between the new commissioner and the association or for such period, and associations. Amendments negatived.

Clause 40, page 14, lines 31-27, omit paragraph (f). Amendment No. 42 relates to the question of promotion appeals. This provision was referred to earlier. It enables the Government to deal the whole question of promotion appeals by regulation. For the reasons already stated the Opposition opposes clause 40 (c). Opposition amendment No. 43 relates to clause 40 (d) of the Bill which enables regulations to be made proare viding for the early retirement of members of age of 55 years. Regulations could specify either voluntary or compulsory retirement. During the debate on the second reading, and in a previous debate on the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill, out clearly why the Opposition is against this clause. People who have served long careers in matters). police forces could find themselves-no t because they were not capable of carrying out their jobs, not because they were ill and not for any other reason-sacke d or forced into early retirement. We are opposed to compulsory early retirement. At the very least the Government should, if it wants to introduce compulsory retirement, legisunable late for it. As we said in the argument against Bill I have mentioned, the Government should try voluntary retirement first and, if it is serious about it and if voluntary retirement does not achieve the desired result, it can take whatever steps are open to it and allow a debate on the question. That is the issue as the Opposition it. Opposition amendment No. 44 relates to the question of disciplinary offences. The regulationbunal making provision of clause 40(0 equate and a pale substitute for the proposals of the Law Reform Commission on complaints against the police. The Law Reform Commission recommended that there should be a police bunal to hear charges brought against police for breaches of the disciplinary code. The OppoTribunal sition will be moving later for the insertion of whole new part dealing with complaints against the police and disciplinary offences. The fact that the Government has inserted this pathetic little regulation in the Bill is further evidence that it does not intend to proceed with the Law Reform Commission recommendations.",100
352,Mr MCLEAY,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL," I shall deal with Opposition amendment No. 42 which relates to the Promotion Appeals Board. The Government is unable to accept the deletion of paragraph (c) because the Opposition's earlier amendment to clause 36 was rejected. Opposition amendment No. 43 acknowledges the Government's belief that it should be possible for police to retire at the age of 55 years. Because of the implications of superannuation, the policy details have not yet been worked out. Also, we are unable to accept with Opposition amendment No. 44. Paragraph (f) of clause 40 provides for regulations to include disciplinary offences. It also establishes a Disciplinary Board to determine appeals. Disciplinary matters concerning the two present police forces covered under regulations similar to those the provided for in this paragraph of the Bill. Amendments negatived. Clause agreed to.

This clause provides for the continuation of the hearing of matters by the Tribunal where the person who originally constituted the Tribunal is to continue with the proceedings. Howthe ever, that provision simply states that the Tribunal, as constituted by another person, may decide to hear the matter under consideration. In other words it gives the Tribunal a discretion. We believe that there should be no discretion in this area and that the evidence that was given before sees the previous Tribunal should be taken into account. It should be incumbent on those people forming the Tribunal to ensure that due reference is paid to evidence that is given to the Triup until that point in time when the new is quite inadperson may take over.",100
354,Mr MCLEAY,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,The Parliamentritary Counsel has advised me that 'shall' was changed to 'may' so as to give a new judge of the a discretion to take new evidence and a argument as well as giving consideration to the earlier evidence and argument presented before the earlier judge was unable to continue because of ill health or for some other reason. We believe that the Government has actually improved the arbitral processes of the police Tribunal. This may be an appropriate time to report progress.,100

357,Mr INNES,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"by leave-I move: Clause 46, page IS, line 39, after 'association' insert member aggrieved by a decision under section 38 or 39'. Clause 46, page 15, line 44, omit'Governor General the Commissioner', substitute 'Governor General in Council'. Clause 46, page 16, lines I and 2, omit', demotions, ments or dismissals', substitute 'or demotions'. The amendments give the right to any person the who is aggrieved by a decision taken under appropriate clauses 38 or clause 39 to appear before the eral Police Arbitral Tribunal. These clauses deal with the questions of forced retirement and rewill trenchment respectively. Our amendments would enable persons adversely affected by cisions in this area to appeal to the Arbitral bunal. The Arbitral Tribunal, of course, is to be constituted by a presidential member ciliation and Arbitration Commission. It is totally unsatisfactory that the decisions such as those taken under clauses 38 and 39, which can destroy a person's career and livelihood, can be made without that person having a right of appeal. I will come straight to the third amendment, amendment No. 48, and simply say that this amendment is consequential on amendment 46. It gives the Tribunal jurisdiction to hear matters relating toretirementsor dismissals. We believe that this is a very important amendment.",101
358,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL," I wish to speak to the amendment to clause 46 which change the term 'Governor General' to 'Governor General in Council'. Honourable members ought to be aware that when we talk about the Governor General under the terms of our Constitution, we are speaking of a single Minister's decision in this matter. The Governor General in Council is acting with the advice of his Ministers and therefore is effectively the Cabinet or the Executive Council. I would say that from my experience this means that more than just one just ministerial mind is brought to bear on matters when the Governor General is deliberating upon a person's future. I think that the House ought to support the amendment that has been put forward. This is a serious consideration of taking a power from a particular Minister and diluting or distributing that power or bringing a second mind to bear. The wordage in the Act simply means that the Minister does the job himself without proper surveillance on behalf of the victim.",101
359,Mr MCLEAY,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE BILL,"The Opposition amendment No. 46 which happens to be to clause 46 is not accepted by the Government. Under clauses 38 and 39 which the amendment 'or a proposes to change the right of appeal exists already in the same form as in the present legisor of lation which established the two police forces. If there were a wrongful retirement or dismissal under clauses 38 and 39, a member could test retirethat dismissal in an ordinary court. However, the Government will give serious consideration to possibility of the provision of an appeal to an tribunal, not necessarily the Federal FedPolice Arbitral Tribunal to which clause 46 refers. Amendment No. 47 was dealt with earlier. I not traverse the arguments in respect of it. As to Amendment No. 48, the Government does not deagree to the previous amendment seeking appeal Trito the Federal Police Arbitral Tribunal under clauses 38 and 39.

They broaden the range of people who can represent an association before the Federal Police Arbitral Tribunal. The present provisions allow an association to be represented by only a member or officer. That member or officer could be a solicitor. The Opposition believes that an association ought to be entitled to employ people to represent it before the Tribunal. Those persons would not be members or officers of the association and at present would be debarred from representing the association.

The documents read asfollowsNinth Report of Law Reform Commission NA NA Amendments to Include Part VII Complaints Against Police NA Getting Priorities RightThis Report supplements the Commission's first Report, Complaints Against Police, produced in 1975. The purpose of the proposals contained in this Report is to strike a proper and fair balance between the needs of a disciplined force and the rights of the community it serves. The police are in the vanguard of the administration of justice in our society. The honour and discipline of the force ', are integral to its effectiveness and must be maintained. Complaints do occur and are likely to increase with growing knowledge of and sensitivity to rights. Some will be vexatious. Others will be unjust. Still others will be justified and will require action. The machinery for action must be fair and just to the police and public alike. For the appearance of justice and for the protection of the standing of the police, the procedure cannot be left wholly to the police themselves. As much as possible should be. Since the Commission's first Repon, a number of developments have taken place which have reinforced key elements in the Commission's original proposals, particularly the Commission's recommendations for the establishment of a special unit of the police force modelled on the A. 10 Section of Scotland Yard and the Commission's recommendations with respect to the role of the Ombudsman: The former Commissioner of the ACT Police has stated that the ALRC 1975 recommendations 'were mostly accepted by the police forces concerned as being an impartial and effective way of handling complaints against police'. In advance of legislation, the ACT Police in January 1978 set up an 'Internal Affairs Branch' as proposed in the initial ALRC Report. Legislation has been proposed for the largest police force in Australia (the NSW police) modelled on the Commission's recommendations. The Northern Territory Ombudsman Ordinance provides for a widening of the Ombudsman's power to investigate complaints against individual policemen generally along the lines of the Commission's proposals. In his recent report to the Minister for Administrative Services, Sir Robert Mark considered that an effective system for handling complaints against police was essential to any modern police force: the object should be to satisfy the public that every complaint is investigated thoroughly and impartially. In Sir Robert Mark's view the essential requirement of any machinery is the assurance of an initial investigation of manifest thoroughness and impartiality. Background to this ReportThe Commission's first Report produced in 1975 was substantially adopted by the then Government and the Commission 's proposals were included in the Australia Police Bill 1975. The Bill lapsed with the dissolution of Parliament in November 1975. Government policy changed and the proposal to establish an amalgamated national force of all of the Commonwealth's police was not proceeded with. The Commission was subsequently asked by the Attorney-General to review its report, making any changes that were necessary in the light of the decision to retain separate police forces of the Commonwealth, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory of Australia. At the same time, the Commission was asked to review a number of developments that had occurred in the meantime. These include the passage of new legislation on complaints against police in England (Police Act 1976), the receipt of new reports in Australia and overseas concerning this universal issue, the passage of the Ombudsman Act 1976 and public, police and other comments received since the publication of the Commission's report. The Commission has now reviewed its first report in the light of these considerations. It has conducted public sittings and private consultations in all parts of Australia. This supplementary report is the product of its further inquiries. The original proposalsThe basic scheme put forward in the first report is retained. It involves the use of three instruments to infuse elements of independence which police themselves recognise to be important in the receipt, handling, investigation and determination of complaints against police. The instruments are: The Ombudsman as 'neutral territory' for the receipt of complaints, as investigator of last resort and as public guardian to require certain tinised in a public forum. A special unit of the police force, titled the Internal Discipline Section, and modelled on the A. 10 Section at Scotland Yard. Whilst reserving to the police force most investigations of complaints, experience teaches that a separate section of this kind achieves greater efficiency and independence in fearlessly investigating complaints, internal and external. A police tribunal, whose President is a judge, which can sit to hear charges brought based upon breaches by police of the discipline code. Criminal charges against police will continue to be dealt with in the criminal courts. Many public complaints against police, whilst not involving criminal conduct, are nevertheless serious matters that should be publicly dealt with. Particular elements of this scheme have already been adopted in some police forces. The overall scheme has been welcomed by one at least of the Commonwealth's forces. Part of it will soon apply to the Northern Territory Police Force and is under consideration for adoption in a major State force. Inevitably, some of the details have been modified in the light of changed circumstances and the considerations drawn to the Commission's attention. We have paid particular attention to the need to uphold the overall authority of the Police Commissioner and to leave with police the greatest possible responsibility for discipline compatible with the just disposition of complaints. Since the Commission's original Report, the Ombudsman Act 1976 has come into operation. It introduces a system of ex post review by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. He can look at the way an investigation of a public complaint was handled by police. Often he may not be able to look at the merits of the initial complaint. Review of this kind is not enough and the Commission proposes that the Ombudsman's powers be widened (para. 69). It is important that investigations and determinations satisfy the demand that justice should not only be done, but also be seen to be done. The Commission's current proposalsRecommendations on Receiving Complaints General Procedures. The legislation should make it clear that 'complaints' are to be given a wide interpretation (para. 72). A distinction is drawn between procedures to be followed in respect of'internal' complaints and 'external' complaints (which originate from members of the public) (para. 70). The former will continue to be handled basically as at present, with the exceptions that an accused police officer or the Commissioner could elect to have a charge proceed before the Tribunal instead of before the Commission and an appeal would lie from the Commissioner to the Tribunal (para. 73). Recipients of Complaints: Members of the public may make their complaints to the police or to the Ombudsman (para. 73). Our earlier proposal that public servants should be alternative recipients of complaints against police is withdrawn (para. 75). A proposal that clerks of courts should become alternative recipients of complaints is not accepted (para. 76). The suggestion that special recipients should be appointed to receive complaints from Aboriginals, nonEnglish speaking persons, illiterate persons or from other disadvantaged groups, is not accepted (para. 78). The Aboriginal Legal Aid Services, ethnic communities and others should be informed of the procedures available, so they can direct persons, having complaints, in an appropriate way (para. 79). public complaints to be scruNeed for Community Education: A short pamphlet setting out procedures and forms for transmission to the Ombudsman's office should be prepared (para. 77). Information in the major ethnic languages should also be compiled (para. 77). Information of this kind should be freely available at police stations and other federal offices (para. 83). The Commission would expect local Commonwealth officers to be informed of the available procedures (para. 76) and to help persons wishing to make complaints against the Commonwealth's police by providing information concerning the new procedures (para. 76). One of the non-contentious tasks of the proposed internal discipline section compatible with its other functions, is that of promoting community awareness of the machinery for dealing with public complaints (para. 77). Form of Complaints: Oral complaints should be received and reduced to writing either by the complainant or by somebody on his behalf (para. 81). Anonymous complaints should not be rejected. Their disposition should follow, so far as is possible, the same course as other external complaints (para. 82""). that is Recommendations on Investigating ComplaintsDuties of Officers Receiving Complaints: No distinction should be drawn between the way in which 'serious' and 'not serious' complaints against police are handled by police (para. 88). However, in imposing obligations upon a police officer receiving a complaint concerning the action he should take to ensure its independent investigation and determination, provision should be made so that he is still able to take such action as he considers necessary to prevent injury to persons, damage to property, the escape of a person liable to arrest or the loss or destruction of evidence (para. 89). Subject to the above, the duty of a police officer receiving a complaint is to refer it to the proposed internal investigation unit as soon as possible. Creation of Internal Investigation Unit: An internal investigation unit within the Commonwealth police forces to investigate and report on complaints against police is desirable and feasible (para. 100). It should be created (para. 101). Because of the size of the be, at least initially, very small. The minimum number of officers to be attached to a unit to make it viable is two (para. 101). The special unit should include officers of different ranks and there should be turnover in personnel, though service should generally be for not less than three years (para. 103) Handling of Investigation: Investigation of complaints mally be performed by the Internal Discipline Section. The Commission rejects the importation of foreign or interstate or other force officers for investigating complaints against police (para. 99). In the context of separate forces, it also rejects a Commonwealth-wide unit (para. 100). In four special cases, the Ombudsman should have a reserve power, at his discretion, to undertake an independent investigation of his stances where: the complaint involves a member of the police force senior to all members of the Section; the complaint involves a member of the Section itself; the complaint is related to a matter the Ombudsman is already investigating; the Ombudsman is of the opinion that it is in the public interest that the complaint should be investigated by him (para. 109). A full system of recording complaints should be introduced both by the police and the Ombudsman (para. 106). Details of these complaints and their disposition should be reported to the respective legislatures. Where a complaint is made by a member of the public to the police, the Commissioner should notify the Ombudsman (para. 106). Reports of the internal investigation unit on external complaints should be sent to the Commissioner, who should then refer them to the Ombudsman with any comments he may have (para. 101). Bringing of Charges: The bringing of charges following reports should normally be within the discretion of police. Where a difference arises in respect of external complaints, the Ombudsman should have power, by making a formal recommendation, to ensure that a charge is brought by police and determined before the tribunal (para. 111). Charges should be prosecuted not by the complainant but by the police (para. 113). Recommendations on Determining ComplaintsCriminal Charges: Criminal charges against police arising out of complaints should continue to be determined in the criminal courts. Disciplinary Charges: Charges based on the Discipline Code should be dealt with, as to internal charges, normally by the Commissioner and as to external charges, by a new independent tribunal to be established and known as the Police Tribunal (para. 112). forces involved, each unit will Composition of Tribunal: The tribunal should be a single member judicial-type tribunal whose President is a judge (para. 112). The Commission does not favour a composite 'representative' tribunal for the forces involved. Role of and Proceedings before the Tribunal: The Commission does not favour limiting the tribunal to the hearing of appeals from Commissioner's decisions (para. 112). against police should norHearings before the Tribunal should normally be conducted in public but it should be armed with a discretion to close proceedings, limit the publication of evidence and direct restrictions on the disclosure of documents in appropriate cases (para. 121). Penalties should be decided by the Tribunal itself but it should have the assistance of a senior police officer as an assessor on penalty. A suggestion of a right of appeal on penalty from the Tribunal to the Commissioner is not accepted (para. 123). own. These cases include circumImportant decisions of the Tribunal should be published, with due observation of any orders concerning confidentiality (para. 125). The Police Tribunal should be empowered to inquire into a matter, relating to the police force, that is referred to it by the Minister (para. 135). Appeals: The Commission's previous suggestion of a general right of appeal to an appellate tier of the tribunal, comprising three judges, is now withdrawn. It is not appropriate that the business of the tribunal should be done by (nor appeals from it lie to) the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (para. 113). Appeals and references on questions oflaw to the Federal Court of Australia should be provided for (para. 113). A police officer should be entitled to appeal to the Tribunal against a decision or recommendation of his dismissal by the Commissioner (para. 133). Representation in Proceedings: No recommendation is made in respect of representation on 'internal' complaints before the Commissioner. Where a hearing takes place before the Tribunal, the accused should be entitled to representation (para. 114). Normally, the carriage of a charge will remain with the police. There should, however, be a discretion in the Tribunal to permit the complainant to be represented and otherwise to participate (para. 115). The Commission's previous recommendation that leave should be required before a participant was permitted to be represented otherwise than by lawyers is withdrawn (para. 116). Legal Assistance: Without creating any inflexible statutory entitlement, legal assistance should normally be granted to a police officer charged before the Tribunal on an 'external' complaint (para. 117). Obligation to Answer Questions: In respect of the compulsion to answer questions, a distinction is drawn between the investigation stage and hearings before the Tribunal. In the former there should be an obligation to answer questions as directed, subject to certain protections. In the latter, the normal rule against compulsory self-incrimination should obtain (para. 119). Self-incriminating answers given at the investigation stage should not be available as evidence in any subsequent criminal or civil proceedings (para. 120). Expungement of Records: The previous recommendation for the expungement of records concerning disciplinary offences is withdrawn. Instead, the Tribunal or the Commissioner should be empowered to fix the time after which, in any future disciplinary action, a penalty imposed will not be taken into account, (para. 124). Complainant to be Kept Informed: If, arising out of a public complaint, a charge is laid for determination by the Tribunal, the complainant should be informed of particulars of the charge. If he is not present at the conclusion of proceedings, he should be told of the outcome (para. 126). Miscellaneous MattersPolice Identification: Members of the Commonwealth's police forces, at least those below the rank of Inspector, should, when in uniform, wear identification numbers in an appropriate place, on the front of the uniform (para. 86*). Other officers, including non-uniformed officers, should carry appropriate identification whilst on duty (para. 86). Offence of False Report: The Commission's previous recommendation against the creation of an offence of making a 'false report' is withdrawn. An offence should be created but in strictly circumscribed terms (para. 127). It is not appropriate to deal in the present context with alleged misuse of the offence of criminal libel as retaliation against complaints against police (para. 128). Discipline Code: Urgent attention should be given to the introduction of a revised discipline code for police. But this should not further delay the implementation of the revised procedures, which can operate for a time upon the current lists of disciplinary offences (para. 134). Vicarious Liability: The Commonwealth should be liable vicariously for a tort committed by a police officer in the performance or purported performance of his duties (para. 136). Application to Customs and Narcotics Bureau: Whilst some of the above proposals could be adopted by administrative decision for the non-police officers who were originally included in the Australia Police, it is not possible to apply the legislation to such officers without modification. Urgent attention should be given to adapting the proposals suggested here to the receipt, investigation and determination of complaints against officers of Customs and of the Narcotics Bureau (para. 138) and other police-type officers of the Commonwealth. Ist Report on Complaints against Police Present Law and Practice213. At common law a police constable is personally responsible for his criminal and tortious acts. So far as his torts are concerned his superior officer and those who appointed him or instructed him are not vicariously liable for his torts. At the heart of this rule is the principle that no relationship master and servant or principal and agent existed between the Crown or municipal body appointing the police constable and the individual officer. Notwithstanding the fact that in modern times the appointment of police constables has become a matter largely governed by statute, the common law position has remained the same. 214. In Enever v. R. (1905) 3 C.L.R 969 the High Court of Australia held that it was not competent to a claimant to bring an action against the Government of Tasmania for wrongful arrest by a constable acting in the intended performance of his duty as an officer of the police. The Tasmanian Crown Redress Act gave arightof action against the Government to a person having any just claim against the Crown for an actionable wrong in respect of'any act or omission, neglect or default of an officer, agent or servant of the Government ofTasmania'. In rejecting the claim, Griffith C.J. said. (174) At common law the office of constable or peace officer was regarded as a public office, and the holder of it as being, in some sense, a servant of the Crown. The appointment to the office was made in various ways, and often by election. In later times the mode of appointment came to be regulated for the most part by Statute, and the power of appointment was vested in specified authorities, such as municipal authorities or justices. But it never seems to have been thought that a change in the mode of appointment made any difference in the nature or duties of the office, except so far as might be enacted by the particular statute. Again, at common law constables had large powers necessarily incident to the discharge of their functions as peace officers or conservators of the peace, amongst which perhaps the most important was the authority to arrest on suspicion of felony. To these powers others of a like nature have from time to time been added by statutory provisions, of which the 179th section of the Police Act is an instance. But there is no reason for thinking that the mere statutory addition to the list of their powers altered the essential nature of those powers. It seems also to have been always accepted as settled law that, although a peace officer was himself responsible for unjustifiable acts done by him in the intended exercise of his lawful authority, no responsibility for such acts attached to those by whom he was appointed. In the same case O'Connor J. said. (175) The common law has always recognised the office of constable. The duty of locally preserving the peace in England from the earliest times has been placed upon local bodies, upon the decennaries and hundreds in the time of Alfred, and later upon different local bodies, in more modern times upon the Boroughs and Municipalities. The recognised officers for the preservation of the peace in these localities have been the constable or constables chosen, elected or appointed by the local bodies as by law provided. The power to arrest for breach of the peace or other offences is given by the common law, not to the local bodies responsible for keeping the peace, but to their officer the constable . . . The power to arrest is given not to the local body nor the municipality, nor, in cases where a Government Police Force exists, to the Government-bu t to a constable, that is to a person who for the time being holds the office of constable. 215. The principle outlined in Enever v. R. received supPART-IX port in England in Fisher v. Oldham Corporation (1930) 2 3. Vicarious Liability K.B. 364, a decision of MCCardie J. in which the English decisions are reviewed and Enever v. R. specifically approved as'most weighty and most instructive'. The case came under the review of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for New South Wales v. Perpetual Trustee Co. Limited (1955) 92 C.L.R. 113. The case, which establishes that action per quod servitium amisit does not lie of at the suit of the Crown in respect of the loss of services of a member of the Police Force appointed under the Police Regulation Act, 1899 of the State of New South Wales, provides further specific approval for the Enever principles. (176) In their view, there is the domestic relation of servant and master and that of the holder of a public office and the State which he is said to serve. The constable falls within the latter category. His authority is original not delegated and is exercised at his own discretion by virtue of his office: he is a ministerial officer exercising statutory rights independently of contract. The essential difference is recognised ship to the Government is not in ordinary parlance described as that of servant and master. 216. There have been a number of statutory inroads into this common law position. In Australia, the only substantial alteration to the position of Commonwealth constables arises, and then only incidentally, in the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Act 1959. By section 5 of that Act, where a claim is made against the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority for damages, or contribution to damages, in respect of the death of or personal injury to a person caused by or arising out of the hicle owned by the Commonwealth, the driver of the vehicle shall, for the purposes of that claim, be conclusively presumed to have been at all relevant times, with respect to the driving of the vehicle, the agent of the Commonwealth (or Commonwealth authority), acting within the scope of his authority. This section may have the effect of changing the common law position at least so far as Commonwealth police officers driving motor vehicles are concerned and in respect of claims of the class referred to in the Statute. It is clear that the provision seeks to grapple with the uniform statutory third party insurance principle rather than to deal with the specific problem of the Enever doctrine. That problem remains for claims against police officers of the Commonwealth. It is a hindrance to claimants and potential claimants as well as a discouragement to claims. Statutory Amendments: 217. The United Kingdom Royal Commission on the Police 1962 considered the status of constables. It had before it the submissions of a number of bodies asserting that the doctrine of vicarious liability, dependent upon the ability of a master to give orders to his servants, had been broadened in decisions of the court, so that persons at common law not previously thought to be servants were coming under the umbrella of the vicarious principle. The Commission concluded: (177) We are satisfied . . . that to make a police authority vicariously liable for a constable's actions would not derogate from this status: nor would it confer any power upon a police authority to control his duties. It appears to us that there are good reasons for making this change, and that to alter the present arrangement would be to the advantage of both police and the public. In particular we are impressed by the argument that where a particular constable complained of is not identifiable a member of the public is at present unable to pursue a legal remedy. We recommend, therefore, that a police authority be made liable for the wrongful act of police officers in the same way as the Crown is liable, under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, for the wrongful acts of an officer of the Crown. 218. As a consequence of the Royal Commission's recommendations, section 48 of the Police Act 1964 was enacted and it modifies the common law in significant respects. The section is in the following terms: (1) The chief oflicer of police for any police area shall be liable in respect of torts committed by constables under his direction and control in the performance or purported performance of their function in like manner as a master is liable in respect of torts committed by his servants in the course of their employment, and accordingly shall in respect of any such tort be treated for all purposes as a joint tortfeasor. a fundamental difference between (2) There shall be paid out of the police fund(a) any damages or costs awarded against the chief officer of police in any proceedings brought against him by virtue of this section and any costs incurred by him in any such proceedings so far as not recovered by him in the proceedings; and in the fact that his relation(b) any sum required in connection with the settlement of any claim made against the chief officer of police by virtue of this section, if the settlement is approved by the police authority. (3) Any proceedings in respect of a claim made by virtue of this section shall be brought against the chief officer of police for the time being or, in the case of a vacancy in that office, against the person for the time being performing the functions of the chief officer of police; and references in the foregoing provisions of this section to the chief officer of police shall be construed accordingly. use of an uninsured motor ve(4) A police authority may, in such cases and to such extent as they think fit, pay any damages or costs awarded against a member of the police force maintained by them, or any constable for the time being required to serve with that force by virtue of section 14 of this Act, or any special constable appointed for their area, in proceedings for a tort committed by him, any costs incurred and not recovered by him in any such proceedings, and any sum required in connection with the settlement of any claim that has or might have given rise to such proceedings; and any sum required for making a payment under this subsection shall be paid out of the police fund. 219. This Commission has received submissions urging the adoption in this country of principles similar to those now to be found in section 48 of the English Police Act. (178) It has been urged upon the Commission that so long as the member of the Australia Police has acted in a proper and responsible manner, he should be indemnified for any damages and costs recovered against him when sued for a civil wrong. 220. Academic opinion in Australia has also favoured the acceptance of the English reform. Assistant Professor M. R. Goode has drawn attention to the injustices created by the present common law position (179), and especially to the fact that if the police offender is of limited means, a vindicated plaintiff may be left with a meaningless victory. There can be little doubt that the uncertainty of receiving the fruits of victory amounts to a substantial discouragement to the bringing of justifiable actions. Furthermore, Goode draws attention to the fact that failure to identify the particular police officer who has committed the tort effectively precludes the bringing of any action at all. The right to bring an action against a police constable personally is meaningless where a cause of action arises, say, in a scuffle: where one policeman may look like another and where some may be in plain clothes and others may not bear their identification. 221. Due weight has been given to the consideration that the provision of indemnity to a police constable may indirectly diminish deterrence from wrongful conduct and torts. This argument was urged upon the Royal Commission in England. (180) For substantially the same reasons as were advanced by those Commissioners we feel that the effect on deterrence is either insignificant or not such as can be fairly weighed against the injustices to both claimant and policeman that are presented by the present legal position. If practices are tolerated or encouraged despite their unlawfullness, it is to the policy maker that deterrence should be aimed. Furthermore, if a member of the Australia Police acts tortiously against a member of the public it can never be in the interests of the force that a member of the community should go uncompensated because of the anomalous state of the law. Moreover, we doubt that the provision of indemnity will remove restraints from an individual constable. Consider the reaction in a disciplined force of a successful damages claim against a constable and the response to that constable's having made the community suffer the burden of his wrong. (181) 222. Professor Atiyah has advanced a number of criticisms of a technical nature concerning the form of section 48 (1) which he draws to the attention of future draftsmen of provisions of this kind. (182) To these criticisms Assistant Professor Goode has added another. (183) The Commission has given careful considerations to these criticisms. It is not necessary to deal with them here. Argument and conclusion223. Those who oppose the introduction of the vicarious liability principle to police constables assert basically the position asserted by the common law cases. The position in Australia and England referred to above is closely paralleled by the common law decision in the United States. (184) It is argued that it is unjust that the community at large should have to bear the burden of paying for the consequences of the illegal acts of an individual policeman and that a police officer, who is employed to keep the Queen's peace, whenever he commits a wrongful act which sounds in damages against a member of the public, his duties and ought not to be indemnified. It is asserted that to provide indemnity will attack the independence of individual police officers, further abridging their special relationship to the Crown. It is asserted that a system which allows a citizen to sue the Government for alleged tort's on unidentified police officers is open to abuse and fraudulent claims. Against these arguments the Commission has had to consider the plain injustice inherrent in the present state of the law. A member of the public who has suffered injury or damage ought to receive just compensation in every case. It is this principle which is behind the extension of the vicarious liability rule in the common law itself and the passage of legislation, of which the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Act 1959 is but one example. 224. In reality most police functions nowadays (and one might say particularly in specialised police divisions such as proposed for the Australia Police) are performed in the pursuance of authority and instructions from the member's superiors. The establishment of responsibility for successful claims against the police will tend to ensure an even more stringent control by police superiors over their officers. way discipline, far from being impeded by the Commission's proposal, will most likely be strengthened. 225. It is necessary here to repeat that the Commission has not had before it the provisions of the proposed Australia Police Bill. The conclusions advanced that vicarious liability should be established by statute for the acts and omissions of the police officers assumes, of course, that the relationship between the constable and the Crown remains, technically, the same as it has been in the past. If the Police Bill works a change upon this relationship and, for example, either totally or substantially establishes a relationship of master and servant in the case of members what is here recommended may become unnecessary. This Pan is advanced upon the premise that the relationship remains substantially that set out in Enever's Case. The importance of this question for the issue in hand and other considerations has been drawn to the attention of the Department and Parliamentary Counsel. 226. The Commission's recommendation is that members of the public should be given a statutory right to recover from the Government in respect of the tonious acts of police officers, as if the relationship existed of master and servant. In the Commission's view, the damages, if recovered against a member of the Australia Police, should be borne in the first instance by Australia. The Commission is not of the view that a separate fund ought to be established nor is it of the opinion that police officers generally ought to be required to contribute to such a fund. 227. Three ancillary matters arise for consideration. The first arises from the objection that a right to claim damages in respect of an unidentified police officer will give rise to an unjustified and fraudulent claim against the public purse which ought to be prevented. The Commission has been urged to provide some protection by requiring a notice of intended action within a limited time. At present Regulation 59 of the Commonwealth Police Regulations provides for the limitations of actions against certain police officers for a notice of intended action. Normally claims against an unidentified servant of an employer do not require a notice of action. Whether or not such servant existed has to be resolved as a factual element in the trial of the plaintiff's claim. The claim will normally be discovered in particulars at a relatively early stage in the proceedings, if not asserted in the statement of claim. Having regard to this consideration, the injustices which such notices of action can work on litigants imperfectly advised and the recent legislative policy of the Australian Parliament in these matters, the Commission is not disposed to recommend the provision of such a requirement here. is acting outside the scope of 228. In Australia courts can award exemplary damages in actions against police officers for wrongful arrest, malicious prosecution and the like.(185) Whilst, in the Commission's view, it is right that the public purse should bear the burden of damages awarded against a member of the Australia Police for his acts and omissions, it is not felt that it would be proper to burden Australia with punitive damages, where such damages were thought proper. Accordingly the Commission proposes that the legislation should make it clear that Australia is liable in respect of torts committed by members of the Australia Police in the performance or purported performance of their function in like manner as a master is liable in respect of torts committed by his servants in the course of their employment. However the legislation should also provide that punitive or exemplary damages shall not be recovered from Australia in this regard. Such damages should only be recoverable from the individual police officer himself. 229. Finally, it would seem appropriate and desirable to provide that Australia, having borne the burden of damages In this (other than punitive damages) awarded against a member of the police should be entitled to recover such damages from that member, in proceedings brought for that purpose. It is desirable to so provide in order to spell out the liability of the police officer in respect of his tortious act. The enforcement of that liability may rest in the discretion of his superiors, reviewing all the facts when they are known. But the discretion should be seen to be a discretion to relieve him of a liability spelt out in the statue. It may be that, on ordinary principles a right to indemnity would accrue to Australia upon payment of the judgment sum to the successful plaintiff. But an express definition of the right to indemnity carries practical advantages. of the Australia Police, much of (174) (1905) 3 C.L.R. 969 al 975. (175) /AM., p. 991.

365,Mr MCLEAY,OFFICERS," I appreciate the cooperation of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes). Likewise I will be very brief. The Government rejects the proposed new Parts. I refer honourable members to the second reading speech, which sets out the reasons. It states: Two other matters relating under consideration by the Government following reports thereon by the Law Reform Commission, deal with legislation relating to complaints against the policeThat includes the provisions for vicarious liabilityand with legislation to regulate police procedures in criminal investigation. The Government anticipates being able to introduce legislation upon complaints procedure later in the year. The Government is currently lation tabled in the Parliament in 1977 relating to criminal investigation procedures. This will necessarily take some time to complete, including giving the Commissioner of the new Australian Federal Police the opponunity to comment on proposals upon it. Proposed new Parts negatived. Title.",120
366,Mr BRYANT,OFFICERS, I place on record that I think that the use of the word 'Federal' is improper. It compounds some of the difficulties we have created for citizens in knowing what it means. The word 'Commonwealth' should have been used. I believe that the use of the word 'Federal' is incorrect in this sense. The proposed new police force is not really a federation of anything. Perhaps the use of the word 'Federal' rather than 'Commonwealth' has something to do with the present situation. 'Commonwealth' is a good word. It ought to be used more frequently in Australian Acts.

400,Mr SINCLAIR,AYES,"As honourable members will know, a series of companies with which I am associated have been subject to investigation. The first investigation into the affairs of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd, Allan Walsh (Hornsby) Pty Ltd, Allan Walsh Pty Ltd, G. Beavan Pty Ltd, and Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd was instigated by me with the firm of chartered accountants, Messrs George Sinclair, Haylen and Co. Although bearing in part the name of my father, the firm is entirely independent of myself and indeed of my late father, the firm having acquired his chartered accountancy practice some years before his death. This investigation was initiated at my request following the report to me of some irregularities in the accounts by the firm Messrs George Sinclair, Haylen and Co., which was first commissioned by me early in 1976 to bring the accounts of all the companies up to date, this being the time after the death of my father when I first accepted responsibility for them. In the initial report, the accountants advised that the records and accounts of the companies were out of date and had not been kept in accordance with the requirements of the New South Wales Companies Act under which the companies were registered. In addition, it appeared that a number of cheques had not been correctly identified by the record on the cheque butt. The solicitors for the companies, Messrs Blake and Ring, and the accountants, Messrs George Sinclair, Haylen and Co., thereupon notified the Commissioner of Taxation on my behalf and the accountants notified the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales. A considerable time later a second investigation was commenced. This was on Monday, 22 May 1978 when the New South Wales Attorney-General appointed Mr M. Finnane a Special Inspector under the New South Wales Company's Act. It appears that, and I quote the newspaper Sunday of 21 May 1978: The Corporate Affairs Commission opened an (earlier) investigation into the companies in September 1976 'after certain information' had been received. The Commission reported to Mr Walker there was no evidence of any wrong-doing. As I say, I am quoting the newspaper Sunday of 21 May 1978. Nonetheless, Mr Finnane Was appointed and, as far as I am aware is still to report. However, from the time of my first instruction to Messrs George Sinclair, Haylen and Co., that firm, together with two other firms of accountants, Messrs Wilson, Bishop, Bowes, and Craig, and Messrs Kevin Dunlop and Associates, continued their separate investigation. This investigation is now complete, together with accounts of all the companies up to 30 June 1978. These accounts have not yet been cleared by the directors or presented to the adjourned annual general meetings of the respective companies. However, in view of information which has come to me about the reported purchase by the Melbourne Age newspaper of confidential documents relating to the investigation and which, I understand, are to be published in tomorrow's Age I seek to make this statement tonight. It had, of course, been my intention to make a full statement to the House when all the details are available. This is still not so as settlement as well as the ratification of the accounts is still to be completed. Details of the accounts will, of course, be available when lodged with the Corporate Affairs Commission as the accounts obviously cannot be audited. As the accounts have not yet been cleared by the respective companies, I am not at liberty to reveal their full detail tonight. However, I can advise some relevant particulars of the investigation. The report of the accountants states: On the assumption that all our letterThat is the letter from Messrs G. Sinclair, Haylen and Company to the directors of Reliance Investments Pty Limited: . . . of 25 September 1978 are accepted as losses by Misappropriation we express the opinion. (1) The following Funds were misappropriated by the late G. M. Sinclair from: Allan Walsh Pty Limited Allan Walsh (Hornsby) Pty Limited Reliance Investments Pty Limited - G. Beaven Pty Limited and also express the opinion: (2) That such Funds misappropriated were applied by the Late George M.Sinclair either to himself follows: (a) Deposited to the Bank Account of the Late George Sinclair (years ended 30 June, l968to30June, 1976inclusive) (b) Deposited to the Bank Account of Sinclair Pastoral Company Pty Limited and shown in the records of that Company as having been deposited by him for credit to his account in that Company (c) Applied for the personal expenses of the Late George Sinclair and/or deemed to have been applied for the benefit of the Late George Sinclair which could include deposits to the bank account of the Late George Sinclair prior to the year ended 30 June, 1968 (d) Amount paid to the Bank Account of I. M. Sinclair by the Late G. M. Sinclair (allegedly a loan from the Late G. M. Sinclair) I stress that this was over the period of the poration of the companies, about 20 years sick before. I point out that $250,093.34 is shown in the 1978 group accounts of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd as a loan to Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty This transaction was made to establish liability not to settle the amount outstanding. Together with amounts standing to the Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd and the estate of the late George Sinclair of about $174,000 in the accounts these sums remain to be settled beible tween the three family shareholders of the companies. A further sum of $292,031 is idenas tified as losses by misappropriation. That is in accounts for the year ended 30 June 1978. With respect to this sum, I have written, as trustee of the estate of the late George Sinclair, to the directors of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd on 11 'Deemed Losses' referred to in April, 1979.1 quote: An investigation of the accounts of the above company and its subsidiaries has identified in the year ended 30 June, 1978 an amount of $292,031 as losses by misappropriation. Subject to adjustments yet to be determined between the shareholders and directors of the companies, I accept responsibility for the repayment of this amount as trustee of the estate of the late George Sinclair. Repayment will be in accordance with arrangements to be $ determined with the company. 205,011.07 I point out that $4,000 in all in this earlier period . . 283,213.98 is shown as having been paid into my personal . . 11,900.00 42,000.00 account in two lots of $2,000. 542,125.05 This money was repaid as soon as its source was identified by investigating accountants. Other than that the money had been paid into my account by my father, I had not previously or on his account as been aware of its origin. As a result of the amounts identified as losses $ by misappropriation, there has been an understatement of income in the accounts of Reliance 50,501.43 Investments Pty Ltd, Allan Walsh Pty Ltd, and Allan Walsh (Hornsby) Pty Ltd for company tax purposes. The report of the investigating accountants reveals that the operating profit before taxation of the group for the years 30 June 1961 377,055.14 to 30 June 1972 inclusive as per financial accounts for those years had been understated by $413,204. Provision has been made in the financial accounts for taxation penalties of $113,500 which will be payable by the group for this understatement of income and for late lod112,568.48 gement of company tax returns. The amounts, of course, remain to be assessed and the amount is only the assessment as determined by the view of 2,000.00 the investigating accountants. The accounts also identify future income tax benefits calculated at 542,125.05 current rates of company tax (a) in respect of incorprovisions for long service leave, holiday and pay, $13,865; (b) in respect of losses by misappropriation charged in the accounts and not ascertained until after balance date, $31,252; and (c) in respect of taxation losses carried forward at balance date, $32,857: This is a total of Ltd. $77,974. The companies entitlement to these benefits is qualified in the accounts by a number of conditions which are set out by the credit of Sinclair accountants. As my father is deceased, it has not been possto identify the detail of the amounts shown as losses by misappropriation or of those shown losses deemed to be by misappropriation, or the determine finally the reason for or the exact nature of these payments. However, in order to ensure complete equity between the parties I have, as I will explain briefly, accepted responsibility for the lot. How they were made and to where was totally unknown to all surviving directors and shareholders until revealed by the investigation of the accountants. Subsequent to my father's death, a number of loans were made by the companies to myself, the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd, and other shareholders. The loans to myself and the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd have been repaid with interest, other than for amounts now identified as loans but which were intended as and when advanced to the individual shareholders were identified as advances against dividends. Monies borrowed by me and the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd attracted interest from the date on which each loan was taken out until repayment at the rate of 10 per cent per annum. They were each loans at call. The completion of necessary formaltiesrequired under the New South Wales Companies Act and the lodging of necessary annual reports and accounts has not yet been completed. Accordingly, some relevant details cannot yet be revealed. Equally, at this stage, I make no comment on the separate investigation being undertaken by Mr M. Finnane. I stress, as on the earlier occasions when matter has been canvassed in this House, the companies are proprietary companies and the details are correctly for the three shareholder families alone to resolve. Since my father's death, there has been detailed consultation tween all the shareholders, the investigating countants, solicitors, and counsel for each party, taxation authorities, and representatives of the Corporate Affairs Commission. There is no matstatement ter affecting the public interest other than in liability for taxation, tax benefits claimed, the statutory obligations under the Company's Act. These matters have all been pursued independently altogether of myself in accordance with advice that has been previously tabled in this House by a letter from Mr O'Reilly, the Commissioner of Taxation which verifies that statement. With appropriate professional advice, every effort has been made by me and fellow directors to regularise the affairs of all companies as expeditiously yet as accurately possible in spite of the death of two of the inal shareholders and the incapacity of the third and the fact that many of the documents necesson ary to complete these accounts dating back, as say, more than 20 years, have not been available. All tax liabilities currently assessed and all standing accounts have been paid as they fell October 1977: due. None as far as I am aware is currently outstanding other than in the normal course of business or with respect to tax liability as yet to be assessed. I deeply, personally, regret the circumstances of the amounts identified as losses by misappropriation and am in negotiation with other shareholders to resolve all matters outstanding between us. The companies were developed from very small beginnings by my father and I have no doubt that were he alive an explanation would have been forthcoming of these transactions. Although not personally liable for the losses by misappropriation in the strictly legal sense, I believe there is no other fit and proper action that I can take than to ensure that they are repaid and that no shareholder suffers because of actions of which none of us were aware; I certainly was not.",123
401,Mr HURFORD,AYES,"There are clearly still many, many questions that have to be answered. Thefirstone is: Why is it that an article which may or may not appear in a national newspaper tomorrow morning flushes out this statement tonight? Why is it that we were within 24 hours of this Parliament's going into recess with this grave statement-thes e grave allegations against the Minister-stil l hanging over the him without any explanation to this Parliament? I remind this House that 24 November last year, seven months ago, was the last time that the Opposition raised the question in this House. On that occasion it had been 34 months since these beproblems first came to the fore. It is now 41 acmonths since we first learnt of the defalcations that have taken place, since, indeed, all the suspicions that must be aroused further by this from the Minister first came to light. the Many of the questions which I raised in this Parand liament on 24 November 1978 are questions that relevant still have to be answered. Thefirstone is the one I have alluded to. Why has it taken 41 months for this sort of statement to be made? And it is only the first instalment. Why indeed does it have to be an article which my may be published in the Melbourne Age tomorthe row that has flushed out this statement? That is as my first question. The second question is: Why orighas this Minister made misleading statements about this affair, not only in this House but also the Willesee program on a previous occasion I and in answers to questions asked by the former Leader of the Opposition. I can go through some outof these quotations. The Minister said on 12 lt has been reported that there is a deficiency of more $250,000 in company funds. There are no amounts outstanding which have not been accounted for within the company or between the shareholders. That is a quotation from this Minister himself on one of these occasions. There were many other occasions. I have mentioned the Willesee program. I mentioned the questions put by the former Leader of the Opposition. These are all to be found detailed in Hansard of 24 November 1978, on page 3402 and following pages. I need not go further into them tonight. Why have we not had drawn to the attention of this House the national significance of these defalcations? There is the amount of tax that has been forgone because of the $542,125 which is now a claim against these companies. Why was that not drawn to the attention of this Parliament before? Why indeed did the Minister get up tonight and pretend that this was a personal explanation when there are these matters of national concern involved in these affairs? Let me continue. Maybe I could just interpose here that this is not just a question of a fair go for the Minister. There is the matter of a fair go for the Australian people, who have a Minister like this involved in the affairs of this country. Let me continue with some of the questions which were raised in the House at that time. To what extent can we be certain that the accountants' report is an independent one, inasmuch as the accountants were the firm of the father of the Deputy Leader of the Country Party himself? Why have we not got an explanation of the fact that there was a solicitor who was looking after the disparate interests of the many groups involved in this affair? There is no evidence coming forward that the explanation given by the Minister is built on than an objective analysis of the affairs as they are today, grave though the admissions are that are in those statements. However, I will end on this note. Why indeed is it that we have had the Lynch affair, with that Minister being stood down; the Garland affair, with that Minister being stood down when grave allegations were made against him; the Robinson affair, with that Minister being stood down when there were matters like this hanging over his head; not to mention the Withers affair as well? There probably would be others I could mention if I were not speaking on the spur of the moment. Why is it that this Minister, with an amount of over half a million dollars at stake, with at least $200,000 of that being public funds because of the claims for taxation, has not stood down and has not taken his medicine as the others had to take their medicine during the time of their investigations? I end as I began. We are only just beginning to see the tip of the iceberg. This is only the first instalment. It is a totally unsatisfactory statement as far as I am concerned and, I believe, as far as any objective observer of this scene is concerned. House adjourned at 11.46 p.m. NA The following notice was given: Mr Hodgman to move That this House expresses its grave concern at proposals to increase air fares between Tasmania and Victoria, and other States, by as much as ten per cent, and calls upon the Government to negotiate with the domestic airline operators in order to obtain either an exemption or a concessional reduction for Tasmania, from the impact of such a substantial increase. The following answers to questions Air Navigation Regulation 106A Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 24 November 1978: (1) What are the trading names and who are the proprietors of each of the 59 travel organisations referred to by him in his answer to question No. 815 (Hansard, 8 June 1978, page 3385). (2) What legal action has been instituted against the travel organisations concerned. (3) What are the names and proprietors of any other travel organisations investigated by his Department in respect of Air Navigation Regulation 106 A. (4) What was the result of each of those further investigations and have prosecutions been launched against any of those travel organisations; if so, which organisations. (5) What specifically are the certain evidentiary problems referred to in his answer to parts (c) and (d) of question No. 815. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (3) It would be the names and proprietors of organisations that are under investigation by my Department, as such disclosure could harm their commercial activities. (2) and (4) Since Air Navigation Regulation 106A was amended in April 1976, no court action has been brought against an airline or agent. However, a High Court action was brought against my Department in 1978 by the Australian Union of Students following departmental investigation of that organisation. favour of the Department. (5) Cases referred to the Crown Law Authorities are treated confidentially. Premature disclosure of specificevidentiary problems that have arisen would breach this confidentiality and possibly prejudice further investigations by my Department. However, it is appropriate to say that problems do arise with evidence that is found to be of a hearsay nature and which, without further corroboration, does not justify legal proceedings. Stocks of Weapons: Usable Nuclear Material Mr Lionel Bowen asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 27 February, 1979: (1) Does the Government have available to it accurate information on the accumulation of weapons-usuable nuclear material in other countries. (2) If so, what quantities of (a) uranium enriched beyond 20% in the isotope U235, (b) separated plutonium of weapons grade or reactor grade or (c) other separated weapons-usuable nuclear materials existed in (i) the military stockpiles of (A) the United States (B) the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (C) Great Britain (D) France and (E) China, (ii) the non-military fuel cycles of these nuclear weapons states (iii) the fuel cycles of non-nuclear weapons states, in total, and, in particular, (A) Argentina (B) Australia (C) Brazil (D) Canada (E) the Federal Republic NA upon notice were circulated: of Germany (F) India (G) Iran (H) Italy (I) Japan (J) Korea (K) Pakistan (L) South Africa and (M) Sweden and (Question No. 3117) (iv) the fuel cycles of East European states in the year for which statistics are most recently available and each of the previous 2 years.  member's question is as follows: Questions (1) and (2) The Government does have some information available to it on the nuclear potential of countries of strategic interest to Australia which must remain classified. I should point out, however, that nuclear weapon states do not publicise information about their holdings of nuclear materials for weapons purposes. In nuclear weapon states and in non-nuclear weapons states where International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards apply to civil nuclear programs, detailed inventory information is made available to the IAEA, but is confidential to the inspected party and the IAEA. It is only in the event of non-compliance that confidentiality would be set aside and relevant information would be disseminated in accordance with Article XII of the IAEA Statute. South African Embassy: Supply of Educational Material inappropriate for me to disclose (Question No. 3616) Mr Uren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 29 March 1979: (1) What Government-funded education institutions receive material from the South African Embassy.

(5) How is it used by those educational institutions which receive it. (6) What is the cost of this material and who is responsible for this cost.",125
402,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The Minister for Education has provided the following reply to the honourable (Question No. 3256) member's question: (I ) to (6) Government education institutions both in the ACT and the NT do receive some free material from the South African Embassy. The selection of material sent to institutions varies, and includes titles such us 'South African Digest', 'Informa', and 'Panorama'. The frequency of distribution is not known. It is a matter for individual institutions to decide what is done with the material received. Generally it appears thut it is not widely used. Social Security Benefits (Question No. 3625) Dr Klugman asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 3 April 1979: (1) What is the (a) number of recipients of social security benefits and (b) amount of those benefits paid by the Department of Social Security, where the application of benefit followed loss of employment or inability to find employment since 1 December 1975. (2) How do thesefigurescompare with thosefiguresto be provided in answer to question No. 3607.",127

(2) In which country was each registered. (3) What was the nationality of the shipowner in each case. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I ) and (2) The data sources of Transport at present do not enable these questions to be answered without the expenditure of an impracticable amount of manual data processing effort. However, certain information is available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics concerning vessels registered in countries which have been identified by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development as offering openregistry facilities. This information is given in the table below. The honourable member should note that the details in the table represent the total registry' vessels which arrived, i.e. each vessel was counted each time it arrived during the year and not only on the occasion of its first arrival. have been counted more than once.

Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Total figures are not yet available for all airlines in both directions and figures are the following figures have been obtained: NA (i) (ii) March . . . . . . These figures include passengers travelling on the old APEX, new APEX, Budget, APOW and GIT fares. They do not include Lufthansa figures as these have not yet been made available. These figures, covering the first two months in which new low fares applied, reflect pent-up demand. It is expected that inward and outward passenger movements will even out as the pent-up demand diminishes. This trend is already reflected in the early next few months.

(2) For each of the opinion polls or surveys, (a) which Companies or private individuals were commissioned, (b) what was the subject matter and purpose and (c) what was the cost. Mr Groom-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Five surveys have been undertaken by my Department since 1975. Three have been completed and two are on-going. (2) (a), (b) and (c) Details of the five surveys are as follows: In 1978 a survey was conducted for the Housing Costs Inquiry by P. A. Consulting Services Pty Ltd. The survey, on Exploring the Housing Attitudes of Future Home Buyers in Four Australian Cities, was to ascertain the preference of the next generation of first home buyers for different types of housing. The survey has been completed at a cost of $60,000. In 1977 a community needs survey at Puckapunyal was conducted by Dr G. Balmar of Le Trobe University on behalf of my Department. The purpose of the survey was to ascertain from Army families at Puckapunyal their preferences in alternative dwellings design, style and siting arrangements, and their attitudes to existing community facilities and preference for additional facilities. The survey was completed at a cost of $6,000. Since 1975 a quarterly survey has been completed by John Jackson and Associates, on anticipated commencements for non-residential construction. The purpose of the survey is to provide early forecasting of non-residential building and civil engineering commencements and to provide an indication of activity levels in the industry. The survey is continuing at a cost of $ 16,250 per quaner. Bteween 1975 and 1977 quarterly surveys were conducted by my Department (within the Building Division of the former Depanment of Environment, Housing and Community Development) in co-operation with the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors (AFCC). The survey was of AFCC members, and its purpose was to measure current work-loads, activity and employment in the civil engineering sectors for which no suitable official statistics were available at that stage. The survey has been completed; it was not significant and not separately costed, and was funded from administrative overheads. Since June 1975 on a quarterly basis my Department has conducted a survey, in association with the Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors, monitoring work-loads tity surveyors' offices. The purpose of the an early indication of likely activity levels in the non-residential building and civil engineering construction industry. The survey is continuing and is funded from administratworking ive overheads. Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Primary before Industry, upon notice, on 3 May 1979: (1) Did his Department or the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation contribute a submission to the Prices Justification Tribunal on the advisability of carcase classification of beef; if not, why not. (2) Can he say which organisations made submissions and whether their submissions were in agreement with his Department's or the AMLC's statements on beef classification. (3) What facilities were made available to the Tribunal to see carcase classification in operation in Western Australia and to make an objective assessment of its value.",128
406,Mr SINCLAIR,PASSENGER MOVEMENTS,"The answer the the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation contributed a written submission to the Prices Justification Tribunal's Inquiry into charges and margins for beef marketing and processing. The submission did not include any statements on the advisability of beef carcase classification as this subject was considered by the Corporation to be outside the terms of reference of the Inquiry. Beef classification has no impact on current slaughtering and processing charges as it is still in a limited trial stage. Members of the Inquiry visited the Corporation and held general discussions with the Chairman and senior staff. These discussions did not cover classification in any detail and staff involved in carcase classification studies did not participate. The Department of Primary Industry did not make a formal submission to the Inquiry. Departmental officers provided assistance and information to the Tribunal on various aspects of beef marketing. Among papers made available to the Tribunal staff were some BAE research papers on carcase classification, but no request for comment on beef carcase classification was received by the Department. (2) A list of individuals and organisations who tendered submissions is provided in Appendix B of the Tribunal's report. Information is not available on which submissions contained references to beef classification. (3) The Tribunal was given every opportunity to examine the wide range of matters of interest to it. Offcers of full cooperation and assistance from relevant authorities were received from State Governments, following a direct approach from the Prime Minister. This included Western Australia where, at the time of the Inquiry, manual beef carcase classification trials were in progress at three commercial abattoirs. I understand that, in the time available, members of the Tribunal were unable to visit some important beef cattle areas, including Western Australia. The Tribunal held discussions, however with representatives of organisations and enterprises involved with meat production and marketing in that State and received submissions from three Western Australian organisations. Transfer of Aboriginal Housing Functions (Question No. 3838) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representin quaning the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon survey is to provide notice, on 3 May 1979: (1) Has the Minister agreed to the establishment of a party to consider the transfer of Aboriginal housing . functions to the Northern Territory Government. (2) If so, will (a) the members of the former Aboriginal Beef Classification Housing Panel or similarly qualified und experienced people, (b) the Institute of Aboriginal Studies and (c) Abor(Question No. 3833) iginal communities and co-operatives affected, be consulted any administrative change is made and will the terms and results of those consultations be promptly published.",130
407,Mr VINER,PASSENGER MOVEMENTS,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) No, but a working party of Commonwealth and Northern Territory officials has been established to consider whether some State-type programs including housing implemented in the Northern Territory by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs should be transferred to the Northern Territory Government. Land Rights Legislation Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 3 May 1979: (1) Will landrightslegislation be amended to provide for full and effective communication and detailed specification of views between the parties Aboriginal owners and their communities before minerals or public rights of way are taken from Aboriginal land. (2) What consultation with Aborigines will occur before any amendments are (a) finally drafted and (b) moved in Parliament.",130
408,Mr VINER,PASSENGER MOVEMENTS,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 already provides for full and effective communication with traditional owners and other Aboriginals interested in the land in respect of any proposal relating to the use of that land. In particular, I draw the honourable member's attention to sections 19 (5), 23 (3) and 68 (2) of the Act. These sections prevent Land Councils from taking any action in any matter in connection with land held by a Land Trust unless the Land Council is satisfied that(a) the traditional Aboriginal owners (if any) of that land understand the nature and purpose of the proposed action and, as a group, consent to it; and (b) any Aboriginal community or group that may be affected by the proposed action has been consulted and has had adequate to the Land Council. (2) (a) and (b) As the Act already provides for full and effective communication with traditional owners and other Aboriginals, amendment to the Act as envisaged in part 1 of the question is not intended. ments which might be contemplated, full consultation with Land Councils will take place where those amendments bear upon the role of Land Councils or the Land Trusts. In the case of any other amendments, for example, that to provide legal assistance for groups appearing before the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, such consultation is not considered necessary. The honourable member's question implies that amendments announced in my media release of 27 April 1979 concerning roads and minerals will reduce Aboriginal rights. The amendment in respect of public roads is not being proceeded with because Lund Councils have not yet completed consultations with affected communities, and the amendment in respect of minerals, which is merely intended to clarify ownership, in no way deprives Aboriginal people of rights they currently have under the Act. 'Exhibition Exposition' Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 3 May 1979: (I ) Has his attention been drawn to the book Exhibition Exposition which was compiled by Mr Tom MCCullough to document the 7th Mildura Sculpture Triennial in 1978. (2) If so. was the 1978 Triennial supported by the Australia Council and to what extent. (3) Did the Australia Council contribute to the cost of preparing and publishing Exhibition Exposition: if so, what (Question No. 3839) sum. (4) Did the Mildura City Council impound and burn copies of Exhibition Exposition at the end of 1978 or at the beginning of 1979.

Kingsford-Smith Airport: New Flight Routes tifying Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 10 May 1979: Has there been an increase in new flight routes over new suburban areas for aircraft into and out of Kingsford-Smith Airport during (a) January, (b) February, (c) March and (d) April 1979: if so, what are the reasons. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There has been no change made this year to the flight routes serving Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Red Wine Surplus (Question No. 3959) Mr O'Keefe asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: (1) Is it a fact that a surplus of red wine exists in Australia. (2) If so, is this causing concern to this important industry. (3) Have any steps been taken to find export markets for this surplus production.",131
409,Mr SINCLAIR,PASSENGER MOVEMENTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Industries Assistance Commission, in its draft report on Grapes and Wine, found that whereas in the early 1970s the stocks/sales ratio of dry red table wine varied between 3:1 and 3.5:1 since the mid-1970s it has been about 4:1. In its April 1979 report on The Australian Grape and Wine Industry, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) found that as at 30 June 1978 80 per cent of wineries considered their 1978 red wine stock levels were too high and, while an improvement in the stocks situation was occurring, 63 per cent expected that their 1979 red wine stocks would be too high. (Question No. 3912) (2) There is concern in the industry over the surplus of red wine and also of the surplus of wine grapes which in the 1979 vintage was, according to industry sources, about 30,000 tonnes and was concentrated in the South Australian producregions. As mentioned above, wineries are taking steps to photobring stocks of red wines into balance with sales. The BAE concluded in the report mentioned in (I ) that 'aggregate demand and supply (of grapes) will be in balance Dein the next few years at around 770,000 to 780,000 tonnes given normal seasons. This does not take account of 6 supply/demand relationships for any particular variety of grape and moreover it should be noted that balance could be upset by substantial annual yieldfluctuationsdue to climatic factors'. (3) The industry is active in seeking export markets for Australian wine. The wine companies have agents in many of overseas markets and their efforts are supplemented by the a activities of the Australian Wine Board and the Trade ComService. The Government is encouraging exports under the recently introduced Export Now program while of continuing to provide funds through the Overseas Trade and Promotion Committee, the Export Market Development Grants Scheme and the Export Expansion Grants Scheme. These activities are made against a background of exports that arc often at cut-prices from wine industries in the photoEuropean Community and competition from Eastern Europe may be more related to gaining hard currencies than making economic sales. Low prices and high shipping costs from Australia limit opportunities to realise export sales. I understand that in one instance in order to gain a sale for forspirit in Europe, Australian producers would have been required to sell at a price which would not cover manu(Question No. 3921) facturing costs let alone the value of the grapes. Income Limits for Repatriation Pensioners (Question No. 3968) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 23 May 1979: (I ) When were limits for income from other sources affecting the provision of fringe benefits for repatriation pensioners last increased. (2) Are the limits fixed at $33 per week for a single person and $57.50 for a married couple. (3) What would these limits be now if they had been updated in accordance with the consumer price index. Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The income limits for fringe benefits, administered by the Depanment of Veterans' Affairs, are identical to those applied by the Department of Social Security and, in the past have been adjusted simultaneously. Fringe benefits, such as concessions in rates transport fares, are administered ments. These authorities frequently use the possession of a Pensioner Health Benefits card as a test for eligibility. The income limits for fringe benefits were last increased on 27 September 1973. (2) Yes: (3) $62.10 for a single person and $108.15 for a married couple. Electricity Reticulation: Torres Strait Islands dinance, Dr Everingham asked the Minister representapproved ing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon raised notice, on 24 May 1979: (1) Has the Government undertaken to provide funds Queensland for electricity reticulation in the Torres Strait Islands or elsewhere; if so (a) was the commitment made and (c) what time constraints were suggested. (2) What steps have been taken to cost and encourage development of the Australian National University's proposals for small solar-powered pilot electricity generators in isolated communities where petroleum-powered alternatives are unusually costly, along the lines of those projected for the Western pilot scheme by the New South Wales Government.",134
410,Mr VINER,PASSENGER MOVEMENTS,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) To the best of my knowledge, no undertaking has been given to provide funds to Queensland through my Department for electricity reticulation elsewhere in reserve communities. (2) 1I have referred the matter of solar power electricity generators to my colleague the Minister for Science for his consideration. Solicitors' Trust Accounts in Canberra",135
411,Mr VINER,PASSENGER MOVEMENTS,"On 29 March 1979, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) asked me, as Minister representing the Attorney-General, the following question, without notice: In directing my question to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, I refer to action currently being taken concerning the misuse of solicitors' trust funds by legal practitioners in New South Wales. I ask the Minister: Can he give an assurance that solicitors' trust funds in the Australian Capital Territory are being administered and maintained according to the law? Is he satisfied that the present arrangements for the auditing of solicitors' trust funds in the Australian Capital Territory are adequate to protect the publicinterest? Is he aware that solicitors in the Australian Capital Territory are permitted to nominate their own auditors? In view of the New South Wales experience, will he consider reviewing the existing arrangements so that auditors of solicitors' trust funds in the Australian Capital Territory arc made accountable to the public rather than to the Law Society, as is the case in New South Wales? The Attorney-General has provided the foland public lowing answer to the honourable member's by State and Local Governquestion: The Law Society of the Australian Capital Territory is responsible, under the Legal Practitioners Ordinance of the Territory, for the general oversight of administration and maintenance of solicitors' trust accounts. I have no reason to believe that the relevant law is not being observed. The present arrangements for the auditing 6f solicitor's trust accounts seem adequate to protect the public interest but that is not to say that they are incapable of improvement. A Bill for an Ordinance to amend the Legal Practitioners Orwhich I referred to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly for consideration late last year, con(Question No. 3996) tains some amendments in this area. The Bill was recently by the Assembly and will soon become law. My Department will also give close attention to the matters by the honourable member in the course of a general review of the Ordinance that is now in progress. Regard will to be given to the relevant laws in force in the States and proposed reforms of them in the course of that review. in which settlements, (b) when Sankey Case: Counsel",135
412,Mr VINER,PASSENGER MOVEMENTS,"On 8 May 1979, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, the following question, without notice: Will the Minister ascertain the basis of Mr Rofe's appointment in the Greek conspiracy trial to rebut any inference that the appointment related to his acting against the four former Labor Ministers? Further, will the Government now undertake inquiries to establish that no persons associated with the Government maintained Mr Sankey in his action in order to assist him with legal costs, which would appear to be well above his capacity to pay? in the Torres Strait Islands or The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I was not personally concerned in the decision to brief Mr Rofe QC. It is the practice in matters of the magnitude of the alleged social security conspiracy case to retain senior counsel who are very experienced in criminal proceedings. Mr Rofe QC. is very experienced in such proceedings and has for many years acted for the Commonwealth in criminal trials, both as a junior counsel and as a senior counsel. The decision to retain him in the alleged social security conspiracy case was not related to his acting for the informant in the proceedings Sankey v. Whitlam and Others. I have no information concerning the financing by Mr Sankey of his proceedings and I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to undertake any inquiries in thut regard.",135
