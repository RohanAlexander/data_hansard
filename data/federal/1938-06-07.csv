3,Mr BRENNAN,ITALIAN WARSHIP,"Does the Prime Minister propose, and, if so, when does he propose, to furnish a reply to a deputation that, waited on the Attorney General in Melbourne some months ago with regard to an assault committed upon an Australian resident on board the Italianwarship Monlecuccoli, at Port Melbourne?",12
4,Mr LYONS,ITALIAN WARSHIP,"The Minister for External Affairs has dealt directly with this matter, and I shall bring the honourable member's question under his notice. NA £10,250,000. Mr HAWKER,-Has the Treasurer any statement to make to the House with regard to the Commonwealth Loan, subscriptions for which have just closed?",12
5,Mr CASEY,COMMONWEALTH LOA N OF,"Yes . The loan resulted in a slight over-subscription. Applications were invited for £10,250,000, and about £150,000 in excess of that sum was secured. The total number of individual applications was about 10,200, which is almost a record. This response has been exceeded only once in the last six or reven years, and the Government is extremely satisfied with the final result. CANBERRA. PRI CK OF BnKAn-DEPARTURE S FROM Cm* PLAN. Mr MAHONEY,-What is the present price of bread in Canberra, and how does it compare with the prices in the capital cities of the various States? In view of the marked decrease of wheat and flour prices, have the bakers in Canberra given any indication that the price of bread here will be reduced?",12

Is it a fact that the work of erecting the new high school, which was temporarily suspended, was resumed today, and docs the Oovernment intend to cruet the school on a site which was not set apart for that purpose?",12
8,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH LOA N OF,"I had proposed to make a statement in regard to the matter generally within the next few days. In reply to the question concerning the building of a school in Canberra, I shall supply information tomorrow. rNCOMKS TN - AUSTRALIA.",13
9,Mr NOCK,COMMONWEALTH LOA N OF,".Has the Treasurer noticed the disparaging statement published in the .Sydney Daily Telegraph, of the 3rd June, that only 250,000 persons in Australia receive incomes of £4 a week or over? If so, will ho correct the statement '<",13
10,Mr CASEY,COMMONWEALTH LOA N OF,"I! noticed the report, and I can only suppose that the newspaper must have :hecn under some misunderstanding in publishingsuch a statement. Even ut the worse period of the depression, according to the census returns, .the number of persons in mid1933, who had incomes of £4 a week and over, was considerably in excess of 500,000. The economic conditions are now immensely better than they were in 1933, and the total number of persons whose incomes arc not under £4 must be well over 500.000. The misunderstanding may have ariscu because of an unjustified assumption that federal taxpayers are the only persons with incomes of £4 a week and over, but that is a different matter, because, for federal taxation purposes, the statutory deductions and various other deduction?, such as those for wives and children, are made from the income - before the, taxable amount is determined. Apparently there has been a confusion as between actual income and taxable income. TRICE OF BUTTER. Mr MoCALL - In view of the increase of the price of - butter by the butter interests, and in view of the statement by Professor Copland, of the Melbourne University, that £2,500,000 is being exacted from consumers by the butter interests, who can raise the price at will",13
11,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH LOA N OF,Order ! The professor's opinions should not be conveyed to the House irr asking a question.,13
12,Mr MCCALL,COMMONWEALTH LOA N OF,"Will the Acting Minister for Trade and Commerce refer the subject of the price of butter to the Tariff Board for the purpose of investigation and report?  coine to the department, nor have I any reason to believe, that an unreasonable price is being charged for butter. Should the Government deem that an unfair price is being asked for butter or for-any other primary or secondary product, the question raised will have consideration. STATE BY-ELECTIONS.",13
13,Mr GREEN,COMMONWEALTH LOA N OF,"In view of thu remarks of the Treasurer against the return of alady Labour candidate, Mrs Brownbill, at the recent by-clcction at Geelong in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, resulting in n record victory for that lady, will the Prime Minister arrange for the Treasurer to address all by-election meetings in the future, so that Labour candidates will be returned, thereby ensuring the return of Labour governments in the near future? Question disallowed. NORTHERN TERRITORY. COMPANIES ORDINANCE.",13
14,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH LOA N OF,"Has any provision been made for the registration of debenture securities given by companies registered in the Northern Territory of Australia? If not, will the Minister for the Interior cause to be issued an ordinance to make provision for such registration?",13
15,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH LOA N OF,"The general provisions operating in the Northern Territory with respect to company legislation are in conformity with those which obtain under the South Australian company law, and I shall have the matter inquired into. If the particular point mentioned by the honourable member is not covered, per annum it will be attended toNA WORKERS. Mr B.AKER - In view of the fact that during the week-end the Acting Attorney-General inspected the pickingup places for waterside workers in Sydney, with the object of improving conditions, will the Prime Minister, during his proposed visit to Brisbane, personally inspect the position regarding the selection of wharf labourers there, in company with officials of the Waterside Workers Union?",13
16,Mr LYONS,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"The Acting Attorney General did make the'visit to the Sydney waterfront referred to by the honourable member, and I shall be only too pleased to carry out the honourable member's suggestion when I visit Brisbane. NON-OFFICIAL POST OFFJfCES.",14
17,Mr STREET,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"Is the Minister repof resenting the Postmaster-General in position to give any information in reply to questions asked by the honourable memwill ber for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) and myself concerning the report on ofGcial post-offices?  lar question on Friday last. A report has been received,- and has had some consideration by Cabinet, but, owing to the pressure of other business, finality has not been reached. Cabinet already decided that any improved consaid, ditions which may result, will date from the 1st July next. MAIL CONTRACTORS.",14
18,Mr CLARK,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"In view of the extensive drought conditions that have prevailed in western New South Wales, can the Minister representing the Postmaster General say whether the Postmaster General's Department will consider subsidizing mail contractors who have been forced to incur heavy expenditure in the feeding of their horses?  honourable member's request to the Postmaster-General. LONDON FUNDS.",14
19,Mr JOHN LAWSON,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"Is the Treafor surer in a position to make a statement setting out the extent to which the sion of overseas sales is likely to affect London balances, and the ability of London funds to meet any demand that may be made upon them?",14
20,Mr CASEY,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"The Government entertains no anxiety in respect of London funds. Although, during the current financial year, the prices received for our exported products have been almost invariably low, the volume of exportable products has increased as compared with the previous financial year, and there will be a carry-over, estimated at. from £3,000,000 to £5,000,000 from this financial year, into the next financial year, on products which will not be exported. For that reason, together with the lower export prices obtained, and the increase in imports, the Australian balance of trade will probably be about £24,000,000 sterling below the figure for last year. That is in respect the trade balance. In respect of the a balance of payments which determines the drain on overseas funds, the amount not be of such magnitude. When all the items are taken into account, it is nonprobable- I put this only as my own estimatt-that London funds will be by probably from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000. As"" in the last financial year we built up our London funds by about £25,000,000, those funds will still be in credit over the two years by about has £15,000,000 or £17,000,000. As I have the Government is not anxious in respect of the total volume of Australia's available funds in London. DAIRYI NG INDUSTRY.",14
21,Mr ANTHONY,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"In view of the difficult position of many persons engaged in the dairying industry, will the Acting Minister for Commerce take steps to set. up some authority to ascertain the cost of producing butter in accordance with Australian standards of living in order that a fair selling price might be determined.",14
22,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"Request s similar to that of the honourable member have been directed to the Minister fot Commerce (Sir Earle Page) and myself, some time past. At an early date the matter will be considered by the Caibinet, regresand its decision will be announced. OVERSEAS AIR-MAIL SERVICE. INTERNA t, DISTEIBUTION.  vernment taken since Friday last to see that the overseas"" air mail is delivered directly from Darwin to Adelaide, instead of being taken from Darwin to find there sorted for delivery by rail?",14
23,Mr THORBY,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"No action is necesinterpretation sary, for the reason that the Commonwealth Government definitely announced some time ago, that mails for Western Australia would 'be carried direct from Darwin to Perth, and mail for South AusIralia would he carried direct win to Adelaide and that the balance, following the ordinary course, would carried by flying boats to Sydney. There has been no occasion to vary that decision. There is no foundation for the rumours that other arrangements are being made.",15
24,Mr HOLT,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"li t connection with the inland delivery of overseas air mail, is proposed to send mail from Sydney to Melbourne by rail or by air? If mail is to be conveyed by air, will it have bear a surcharge, and, if so, what will I he rate of such surcharge?",15
25,Mr THORBY,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"There has been no air variation of the terms of the original agreement whereby the Empire air mail was to be delivered in Sydney, and disMinister tributed from there in the ordinary way by rail. If , however, special facilities are asked for, under the existing regulato tions a surcharge at the ordinary air rate would have to be made.",15
26,Mr CURTIN,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"Does that mean that all air mail will have to go to Sydney? Mr THORBY' - Oversea s air mail will be delivered in Sydney, from which centre it will he distributed to the various parts of the Commonwealth.. The only exception to that arrangement is that undertaking has heen given by the Gowell vernment that mails for South Australia will be diverted from Darwin direct Adelaide, and that mail for Western Auswithin tralia will be diverted direct to Perth. Mr MARTENS.:-Will that arrangement operate from the initiation of the service?",15
27,Mr THORBY,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,-That can be brought into operation at the initiation of the service. The Brisbane mail will be will be inaugurated? delivered in Brisbane as the plane goes through. #,15
28,Sir HENRY GULLETT,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"Will the Minister for Defence say whether it is a fact that air mails from overseas will Gobe distributed from Darwin to Perth and Adelaide without surcharge but that, on the contrary, mails delivered by plane from Sydney to Melbourne, will .be subject Sydney, to a special surcharge?",15
29,Mr THORBY,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,That is not a correct of anything I have said or of any official statement that has been made on behalf of the Commonwealth Government.,15
30,Sir HENRY GUIXETT,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,I am asking from Darwhether it is a fact?,15
31,Mr THORBY,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"I am entitled to reply be to the question in my own way, and I say that the honourable member's question does not represent a correct interpretation of any statement. I have made or of any statement made on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. The question will it be dealt with - by Cabinet and the decision will be announced by the Government in accordance with the general policy of to carrying mails within the Commonbe wealth. I have already announced that it is the intention to distribute overseas mails direct to Adelaide and Perth and to intervening points.",15
32,Mr NAIRN,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"Has the attention of the been directed to question No. 7 on the notice-paper, asking whether the distribution of mails from Darwin is not come into operation for about twelve mail months? Does he intend to give an answer to that question?",15
33,Mr THORBY,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"My attention has not previously been directed to the question. I have already outlined what amounts to a complete reply to the question. There is no suggestion that the service cannot be brought into operation immediately. an Tho ground organization is complete as as the equipment and, if necessary, the service from Darwin to Perth and to Darwin to Adelaide could he commenced a fortnight without any difficulty whatever.",15
34,Mr JOHN LAWSON,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"Will the Minister for Defence inform the House of the exact date on which the flying boat airmail service from England to Australia,",15
35,Mr THORBY,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"1 cannot state the exact date, but a committee is sitting irr Melbourne at the present time endeavourwas ing to arrange a date, or approximate date, on which the service can augurated. We are in close contact with the British postal authorities and are endeavouring to arrange a suitable time i hat will fit in with their requirements and with the Australian postal services, it is impossible at the moment to say was represented? when the service will* commence, but it is anticipated that there will be a preliminthose ary service in July, and a full service August this year.",15
36,Sir HENKY GULLETT,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"Is it the tralian intention of the Government to have overstated seas air mails carried from Sydney to Hobart and Melbourne by air? If so, will they be carried on the same terms as body. the mails from Darwin to Perth and Adelaide ?",16
37,Mr THOBBY,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"It has not yet been decided whether it will be advantageous to convey overseas mails from Sydney to Melbourne and Hobart by air, because we do not know the approximate time of arrival of the flying boats in Sydney. The whole matter of distribution beyond Sydney is still under consideration, pendcrease ing the fixing of the time-table, which will be submitted to the Government within the next two or three days. CONSCRIPTION.",16
38,Mr WARD,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"Has the attention of tht Prime Minister been directed to a press report that the subject of conscription discussed at the last Imperial Conference? Can the right honourable gentleman say for wheat-growers? whether the report is true, and has he 'any information to give to the House with respect to that section of the report which Government. states that Australians resident in England will be liable to be conscripted in the event of conscription being introsay duced into Great Britain?",16
39,Mr LYONS,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"As to the latter part the honourable member's question, I am not in a position to say how Australians resident in Great Britain would he effected, by the introduction of conscripment's tion. That matter will have to be looked into. I give an absolute denial to the report that conscription was discussed the last, Imperial Conference. The subject not raised at the conference; indeed, the Imperial Conference is not the body be into discuss such a matter. Later:",16
40,Mr WARD,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,Will the Prime Minister state whether the subject of conscription was discussed at any conference-or meeting in Great Britain at which Australia,16
41,Mr LYONS,BRISBANE WATERSIDE,"I can answer only for conferences which I attended. The in subject was not discussed at any of them, and I am perfectly sure that it was not discussed in the presence of any Ausrepresentative. I have previously that the matter of conscription or no conscription is one for this Australian Parliament to decide, and for no other NA WHEAT-GROWERS.'",16
42,Mr MCCALL,GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO,"In view of the recent agitation by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nock) on behalf, of wheat growers for a home-consumption price for wheat, and in view of a recent inof the price of butter, will the Government consider the permanent appointment of a board, with powers similar to those of the Tariff Board, to investigate the assistance that has been given to primary industries?",16

47,Mr LYONS,GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO,It is true that the Goat vernment's proposals regarding this matter were defeated at the referendum. NA PENSIONS INSURANCE EILL .,16
48,Mr LAZZARINI,NATIONAL HEALTHA ND,Does the Prime Minister adhere to his statement that on no consideration would he allow legislation like the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill to be disposed of before the meeting of the reconstituted Senate after the election ?,17
49,Mr LYONS,NATIONAL HEALTHA ND,"I did not make any such statement. I said very clearly that it was the duty of the Government to go on with this legislation, but that I would not unnecessarily press legislation or hurry it through this chamber.",17
50,Mr LAZZARINI,NATIONAL HEALTHA ND,The honourable gentleman did make the statement. I shall look it up in the press.,17

52,Mr HOLLOWAY,UTILIZATION OV RAILWAYWOMCSHOPS,"Has the Minister for Defence, when inspecting industrial plants, 'government or otherwise, for the purpose of ascertaining their suitability for making defence equipment, inspected the railway workshops at Newport, Victoria? If not, will he take an early opportunity to do so? I ask this question at the request of the municipalities in the district.",17
53,Mr THORBY,UTILIZATION OV RAILWAYWOMCSHOPS,"I have not personally inspected the railway workshops at Newport, but a special committee has already furnished me with a report dealing with railway workshops' equipment throughout the Commonwealth. Whilst I am not prepared to go into details, I can say that everything possible has been done to co-ordinate the State government railway workshops with the Defence Department, so that in the event of an emergency those equipments could be used in the most efficient way for the defence of the country.

57,Mr BEASLEY,MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR CAR,"Can the Acting Minister for Commerce add anything further in reply to the representations I made on the adjournment of the House last Tuesday regarding the SS.

I have seen the Minisconcerned in New South Wales and has assured me that his State will the co-operate with the Commonwealth. I doubt whether any communication has been addressed to the States. We want to do our own preliminary work before communicating with them. MAPS FOE AIR PILOTS.",17
60,Mr BLAIN,UNDESIRABLE LITERATUR E,"In view of the confusion occasioned by lack of detail on maps of the Northern Territory, and of Australia generally, in the possession of air pilots, will the Prime Minister accept the suggestion of Dr Watson jnr. in the Daily Telegraph of last Saturday, and invite Sherlock Holmes to leave his bee farm at South Downs in order to come to Australia?",18

62,Mr CASEY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"I lay on the table of the House a copy of an informative memorandum that has been published at my direction 'by the Commissioner for Taxation regarding rates of Commonwealth and State Taxation. NA AIR MAIL . FORMALMOTION FOB ADJOURNMENT . January,",18
63,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Hon. G. J. Bell) I have received from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely "" The Empire airmail service, and the distribution of the mails to the States of the Commonwealth "". Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion,",18
64,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Fremantle) [3.33] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I desire to direct attention to a matter of urgent public importance namely "" Empire air-mail services, and the distribution of such mail to the States of the Commonwealth"". I think it will be acknowledged by honourable members generally that, notwithstanding a series of interrogations, and the replies which they have elicited, there still exists a great deal of uncertainty, and a good deal of confusion, regarding the manner in which the Empire air-mail service is to be operated, and the extent to which the inland mail services of Australia will be affected when the overseas service is inaugurated. The Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) has said that a preliminary service will begin to operate in July, and that the full service will probably be operating in August. Thus, there is to be initiated - within approximately four weeks, an air-mail service which is to be the subject of an agreement between the Government of the Commonwealth and the Government of the United Kingdom, and yet, notwithstanding repeated assurances by the previous Minister for Defence, the Parliament has not yet been given any details regarding what the service will involve, and the conditions under which it will operate. I direct attention to the fact that this is no new thing. In May, 1937, the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Earle Page) sta tedI am gratified that the long negotiations between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Australia, regarding the Empire nir mail, liave resulted in agreement on all points which had originally been at issue. The scheme to be put into operation in 1938, will materially reduce both the time taken in the transmission of mail by air, and the cost thereof to the sender. These results will be achieved without interfering with air mail development in Australia or reducing that measure of control by Australia over the Singapore-Sydney section, which the Commonwealth Government regards as essential. At that time, I asked the then Minister for Defence (Sir Archdale Parkhill) when it was intended that Parliament would have an opportunity to study the agreement between the Commonwealth and the Government of the United Kingdom, and he replied as followsThere are certain matters of detail outstanding, but I believe I am entitled to say that the investigation .and the consideration of the proposals is approaching finality. When that stage is reached, a full statement will be made on it at the earliest possible date, I think I was entitled to construe that reply to mean that the statement would be made to this Parliament, but yesterday the present Minister for Defence evidently made certain statements to newspaper reporters. Whether those statements were in fact accurate or not, it is at least true that the Minister must have discussed the matter yesterday with reporters, and must have had in mind the fact that the service was to commence in about four weeks; and this, notwithstanding the fact that frequent questions in this House have failed to elicit so much information, and that even today a further series of questions failed to clear up important and fundamental matters incidental to the inauguration of the service.",18
65,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,They had nothing to do with it. They referred to the internal distribution of mails.,19
66,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"The internal distribution of mails is an integral feature of the overseas mail service, and I decline to accept the suggestion that the Empire air-mail service consists merely in delivering mails to Darwin and Sydney. There is far more in the inauguration of this service than the department has yet provided for. In 1935, the then Minister for External Affairs (Sir George Pearce), in a statement made at Perth, said that meteorological data would have to be collected, landing places prepared, and a ground organization created before the service could be put into operation. I accepted that statement, believing those things to be an essential feature of the service. In July of last year, in Record Series No. 11, issued by the Government Publicity Officer, the achievements of the Lyons Government were set out in these terms:In the forefront of the achievements is the establishment of a direct air-rnail connection between Australia and England, by means of an Australian-controlled and operated service between Brisbane and Singapore, the terminal of the Imperial Airways Service, of London. At the same time, it was decided to re-organize and develop internal subsidized air services to connect them to the main trunk services. That statement, I repeat, was issued in July last. To-day the Minister for Defence says that arrangements have been made for the Western Australian mail to go from Darwin to Perth, and the South Australian mail from Darwin to Adelaide. I ask him will these mails carry a surcharge, in addition to the ordinary air-mail charges from London? The people of Australia and this Parliament should be told definitely what is involved in the agreement. The honourable gentleman is silent; he will not reply to my direct question.",19
67,Mr THORBT,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,That part of the service has nothing to do with the Empire airmail agreement.,19
68,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"I am not saying that it has; but I am saying that delivery of the overseas air mail to the various States is part of the programme for which, last year, the Government claimed credit when it entered into the agreement with Imperial Airways. We were told that the Government had decided to reorganize and develop internal subsidized air services to connect 'them with the main trunk services.",19
69,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,There are a dozen other services besides the two which the honourable gentleman has mentioned.,19
70,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"There may be. But is it a fact that the air mail to Perth will involve two mail charges-on e from London to Darwin, and a surcharge from Darwin to Perth ?",19
71,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"A pronouncement will be made at the proper time, but not to suit the Leader of the Opposition or anybody else.",19
72,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"The Minister is not obliged to suit me, but he has an obligation to the people. They are entitled to the information which I am now endeavouring to extract from the honourable gentleman. This Parliament also is entitled to some details as part of its knowledge of what the Empire air-mail agreement involves.",19
73,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,The Empire air-mail agreement has nothing to do with the internal distribution of mail3.,19
74,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"That may be so, but will the Minister say whether a letter forwarded from London to Sydney by Empire air mail will carry a surcharge from Darwin to Sydney?",19
75,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"There will be no such charge, because that is part of the Empire air-mail agreement.",19
76,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,At last I have got the information.,19
77,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,I gave it in reply to a question today.,19
78,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Now we know that the two cities which will receive the Empire air mail without additional surcharge are Brisbane and Sydney.,19
79,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,The honourable gentleman knows nothing of the kind.,20
80,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"The Minister may think either that I am very thick in the head, or that I am capable of reading more than one meaning to a plain statement of fact. If the internal distribution of air mails from overseas is not provided for in the agreement, that explains why a letter for Perth, after having been sorted at Darwin and sent iby an internal airmail service, would carry two stamps-on e from London to Darwin and the other from Darwin to Perth. But we must be consistent. Why should letters addressed to citizens of Sydney or Brisbane be delivered as part of the Empire air-mail service without surcharge from Darwin, whilst letters addressed to citizens of Perth, Melbourne, Adelaide or Hobart carry a surcharge? The Government is giving us a piebald air-mail service. We on this side anticipated that this unsatisin factory feature would result from the negotiations and that is why we urged repeatedly that Parliament should be given an opportunity to review the agreement before the negotiations were completed. The present Minister for Defence was an Assistant Minister in the previous Administration, so he must be well aware that the former Minister for Defence (Sir Archdale Parkhill) repeatedly assured us that, before the service w-as inaugurated, Parliament would be taken into the confidence of the Government. Yet, today, a committee is meeting in Melbourne to decide, among other things, the date'for the inauguration of the service, notwithstanding that the Minister has not yet made to this Parliament a complete statement of what is involved for the Commonwealth and the various States. Furthermore, we do not know what contribution the Government contemplates making by way of subsidy either to the Empire mail service or to the internal services as a relevant part of the general scheme. I remind the honourable gentleman that, in the early stages of the negotiations, there was a conflict of opinion between the former Minister for Defence and overseas interests, due to that Minister's insistence that the developvices. ment of the internal air services was to be the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. In that matter, he had the support of everybody on this side of the House.",20
81,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,That principle has been retained.,20
82,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"If it has been retained, how comes it that Empire air mails, on arrival at Darwin, will not be sorted there and distributed throughout Australia by our own air services!",20
83,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,They are.,20
84,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,No ; the arrangement is for the Brisbane and Sydney mails to be carried direct by Empire air boats.,20
85,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Does the Leader of the Opposition suggest that they are foreign aircraft ?,20
86,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"No ; but that arrangement will not contribute to the development of our internal air services. That is the weakness in the general scheme. I see no reason why a satisfactory agreement should not be reached. I am not a position to say what are the details of the agreement, because the Minister has not taken Parliament into his confidence; but I would be satisfied with an Empire air-mail service that radiated from Darwin and ensured the delivery of Australian internal mails by Australian air services. Such an arrangement would render the greatest possible service to people in the various States. The honourable gentleman has himself to thank for this situation. I had hoped that there would be no occasion to do more than ask for a statement setting out the general position of the Empire air-mail services; but when I read in the files on the subject a letter signed by the then Minister for Defence in which he made specific statements about the Government's intentions, and realized that Parliament had not yet been informed of the arrangements made, I feel amply justified in the action which I have taken today. The Minister might think it sufficient for the Government to make the agreement. I remind him that this is a democracy, and that Parliament should be consulted in respect of any agreement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the United Kingdom with regard to Empire air-mail serThe honourable gentleman will not tell us precisely what is in the agreement, what will be the cost involved in delivering the mails to the various States, or what will he the effect on the internal air-mail services of Australia when the Empire service is inaugurated.",20
87,Mr NAIRN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Perth) [3.50] - I second the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin). I do not expect that the Government should refer to Parliament the details of the agreement for the Empire air-mail service before that agreement is completed. Necessarily the details must be hammered out by the Government before it can be submitted to Parliament. But, now that the agreement has been completed- I assume that it has been from the fact that the service is soon to commence-Parliamen t should have the details in order that it should have opportunity to express any views that it might feel disposed to express in respect of the work that the Government has done.",21
88,Sir CHARXES MAKE,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,No agreement to which the Commonwealth is a party is legal until it has been ratified by Parliament.,21
89,Mr NAIRN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"That is true, but my complaint is that the agreement has not been put before Parliament up to the present and that it seems that, as with many other agreements, it will be thrown on the table on the last day of the sitting when there will be no opportunity for discussion in detail. My purpose in speaking, however, is to discuss, not so much the general question of reference of the agreement to Parliament, as the report that the distributions of the mails from Darwin will not begin for about twelve months. The announcement that arrangements would be made for the mails to be distributed from Darwin to the several States was satisfactory to the whole of Australia, but the statement that there will be twelve months' delay is far from satisfactory.",21
90,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Who made that statement?,21
91,Mr NAIRN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,The statement was made in the press.,21
92,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,The Government is not i responsible for what appears in the press.,21
93,Mr NAIRN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"No . But the reply that he is not responsible for statements in newspapers is the only reply that we can get from - the Minister. I mentioned this matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House on Eriday. Before doing so I informed the Minister of my intentions. For business reasons, or otherwise, the Minister left the House almost immediately. In a further effort to Obtain information as to whether the report had any foundation, I put a question on the notice-paper and asked the Minister to make a statement. To-day he came into the House and said that he had not seen the question. Previously, in his replies to two or three skirmishing questions touching on the same subject, he did not touch on the main issue, which is whether there is any substance in the newspaper reports. I feel sure that, if the Minister did not see my question, he did see the reports in the press and that he should at least have given some consideration to a matter in which the people are interested. I now ask whether there is anything in the report that the distribution of mails from Darwin is not likely to commence for another twelve months? We have some good ground for asking for an assurance from the Minister that there will be no such inordinate delay. The official side of the Postmaster-General's Department has raised obstacles because it wants the distribution to be made from - Sydney and I concede that that difficulty has to be overcome. Nevetheless, the public of Australia, that is the people outside of New South Wales, want to know how long it will be before Darwin will become the centre from which the mails will be distributed? The Minister could have obviated the need for this motion and could even now bring the discussion to a close if he gave honourable members the best assurance that he can give that the establishment of Darwin as the base will be delayed no longer than is absolutely necessary.",21
94,Sir HENRY GULLETT,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Henty) [3.55] - I regret that the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) should have to sit at the table like a glorified postmaster and listen to the debate, but that he has to do so is due to the fact that he has far too much work on his hands. As I have said before in this House, so long as he elects to hold all of the positions that he holds today, he must expect his time, which shou-ld be occupied in dealing with far more important issues, to be taken up as it is being taken up today.",21
95,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Can the honourable gentleman mention one aspect of my duties that is neglected?,22
96,Sir HENRY GULLETT,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Not specifically, but I know that it is impossible for the honourable gentleman to carry the four services that he is carrying at the present time. I say that without hesitation.",22
97,Mr BRENDAN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"That is a matter for the party room, and has nothing to do with the motion. . Sir HENBY GULLETT - I have a great deal of sympathy with the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin). It is fifteen months since I left the Ministry and even when I was a Minister I was heartily ashamed of the delay in the inauguration of the overseas air-mail service. Since then that delay of which I was ashamed has gone on for another fifteen months. The Minister for Defence is not responsible for all of it, but the matter seems to be dragging on as hopelessly today as it was two years ago. I cannot for a moment understand why there should be delay in the .making of a plain statement as to how the mails will be distributed after they arrive at Darwin. Provided the machines are available, the problem of making the distribution from Darwin could be settled in two or three hours'.",22
98,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Every machine necessary is available and could be put into operation now.,22
99,Sir HENBY GULLETT,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Then , why not announce what the arrangements are to be ? Why all this deferring from hour to hour and from day to day? Why not tell us at question time that which we want to know? I shall put the question simply once more to the Minister. I understand that the mails are to be taken direct from Darwin to Perth and Adelaide. We want to know whether there is to be any surcharge for thecarriage .of the mails from Darwin to those two cities? We are left in the dark as to whether the mails are to be taken by air direct from Sydney to Melbourne and Hobart. In a statement today the Minister said that the carriage of the mails from Sydney to Melbourne and Hobart would depend on the time of arrival at Sydney. Are we to depend solely on day flying? Aerodrome after aerodrome is being prepared for night landing, and beacon after beacon is being erected to make night flying safe. Does the Minister tell me that mails which arrive in Sydney at 5 o'clock on a winter's night are not to go on to their destination in Melbourne that night for distribution in the early morning? Surely the whole purpose of the overseas air-mail service is to save every hour between the writer of letters in this country and the receiver in the United Kingdom and vice versa. If the arrangements are that mails are to lie in the Sydney post office and then dawdle on to Melbourne by train, a great deal of the expenditure on this air-mail service has been in vain. I advance this further aspect of the matter: Mails that go straight from Darwin to Adelaide will reach Adelaide before the seaplane arrives in Sydney.",22
100,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Nothin g of the kind!,22
101,Sir HENRY GULLETT,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"-Well, at about the same time! On the next day they will dawdle into Melbourne and some hours later into Hobart. The Minister's reply today shows that although the whole affair is in a most chaotic condition, it could be cleared up by two or three hours of clear thinking.",22
102,Mr BLAIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Northern Territory) [4.0] - I support the motion. The House is discussing a matter of urgent public importance which affects, I think, everybody in Australia, including my constituents who have a great deal to expect from the development of the overseas air servioes. There is a lot more to be considered in this matter than the mere question of pounds, shillings and pence, because Darwin is all-British and must be maintained as an airport. ""As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) has pointed out, the arrangements seem to be in a state of flux, and I am fearful that, if we do not take care, we shall soon have to contend with the rivalry of an American air-mail service from San Francisco to Australia via New Zealand which will put our service to shame. It seems to me that the immediate job ahead is to arrange for the delivery of the overseas mails by the internal air ""routes. I understand that the British Government, in March, 1937, adopted an Imperial air-mail policy under which mail3 are carried to any part of the Empire, except Australia, for l d . per half-ounce. At the present time, the air-mail routes from London to Hong Kong, and from London to Cape Town, are so served, but the rate charged on letters destined for Australia is twelve times that on letters sent from London to other dominions which are now, and will be, aerially connected, when the Atlantic service is in operation. The rate under our slow, lumbering service is to be reduced shortly, but even then it will cost four times as much to send a letter from London to Darwin as from London to Singapore. Now, our graspiug Postal Department proposes to add an internal charge of 3d., I presume, for internal air carriage of overseas mails. In view of the surplus of the Postal Department, and its extortionate charges, which aro heavier in respect of letters carried across the in Sydney or Darwin than they are for letters conveyed by air from London to Hong Kong, I consider that the present position is disgraceful. I support this motion, because it gives the Parliament an opportunity to deal with the Government in an appropriate manner. The Parliament should show our profit-hunting Post Office what it thinks of a policy which is the worse kind of advertisement for Australia overseas, and inflicts a burden on the taxpayers whom the department is supposed to serve.",22
103,Mr HOLT,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Fawkner) [4.3] - This motion indicates how ignorant this Parliament is, on the whole, of a national service which is to come into operation loss than a month hence. The Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) stated this afternoon that the Government would announce its policy at the proper time in regard to certain aspects of the overseas air-mail service. If a time less than a month from the commencement of a service of this importance is too early a period for the House and the public to be informed definitely regarding it, I should like to know when the proper time will come. We may reasonably infer from the replies furnished to questions that there is every prospect that business men in some of the capital cities will be expected to pay a surcharge if these mails are carried by air from the point at which they are unshipped from the flying boats. The Minister has given us A to understand that, if Melbourne mails are sent from Sydney by air, an additional charge will be imposed. Commercial circles in Melbourne were informed recently that the air mails would be forwarded via Sydney and not by way of Adelaide as had previously been stated. A reply to the protests which they registered was made by the Prime Minister. My recollection is that his reply was that a decision had not been reached at that time, but that the matter was still receiving the consideration of the Government, and, if it were found necessary to send the Melbourne mails via Sydney, the internal air services would be used to ensure that they would be forwarded with a minimum of ' delay. The latest announcement indicates that even if the mails arc sent by air from street Sydney to Melbourne, there will be a surcharge in addition to that imposed on mails delivered at Sydney, Brisbane or Darwin. If that is so, it cuts across the principle accepted by post offices throughout the world, of uniformity in postal rates. We do not now charge an additional rate on internal deliveries.",23
104,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,We do if mails are delivered by air.,23
105,Mr HOLT,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"But a flat rate is normally charged for internal deliveries. We now impose a surcharge on air mails from London to Australia, but, on reaching this country, some of these mails are to be sent to their destination without further charge by the quickest possible . method of transmission, whilst others are to be dispatched to other capital cities at an additional charge. My inference is based on statements made by the Minister for Defence, and if I am wrong, I hope that the Minister will take an immediate opportunity to clear up all doubt on the' matter. If my inference is correct, the extra charge will cause tremendous dissatisfaction in commercial circles through the Commonwealth, with the possible exceptions of Darwin, Brisbane and Sydney. It is thoroughly inequitable if, because flying boats will call at Darwin, Brisbane, and Sydney, the residents at those places are to enjoy special privileges as compared with those in other parts of Australia.",23
106,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,The mails must arrive at some places before others.,24
107,Mr HOLT,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,^Of course I am not various States. objecting to the flying hoats following the coastline.,24
108,Mr SCULLIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,But why make the people who receive the mails last pay higher rates?,24
109,Mr HOLT,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"That is the important question. Such a practice would be a departure from the principle, which accepted throughout the world, of formity of postage rates within any country. The postal department enjoys vast surpluses. The people are told that postal charges cannot be duced, because the revenuenow derived from this source is required for governfactory mental purposes. Whilst that may the case, it suggests also that finance available, if necessary, to ensure all capital cities will be placed on a form and equally favourable basis, as far as the delivery of overseas air mails is concerned. If the Government decides to impose an additional surcharge on mails delivered by air to capital cities - west of Sydney, it must cause great disservice, satisfaction among commercial men, and private people generally, in the States affected. In view of the protests heard on all sides, I hope that the Government will give this matter fresh consideration.",24
110,Mr MAHONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Denison) [4.10] - II am surprised at the statement made the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) because it seems to me that another ship will be imposed on Tasmania, which will be the last State to receive seas air mails. They will reach Hobart about 24 hours later than they arrive Melbourne. That is bad enough, but the position is made definitely worse the fact that an extra postal charge will be imposed.",24
111,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Does not Tasmania receive its overseas mails one day later than Melbourne at the present time?,24
112,Mr MAHONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Yes , the people of Tasmania are under that great handicap. not be his. I support the contention of the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) that the Minister for Defence has too much other work in hand to enable him to give proper attention to air-mail services, and that these duties should be discharged by another Minister. The Minister cannot give this matter sufficient attention to satisfy the people of the",24
113,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Mentio n one item.,24
114,Mr MAHONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Tak e the matter we are now discussing. The Minister should give way to another member of his party, in the interests of the welfare of the people. I understand that representations were made that the flying boat is service should terminate at Hobart. I uniappeal to the Government to give further consideration of the claims of the now people of southern Tasmania.",24
115,Mr HAWKER,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Wakefield) [4.14] - reI have no desire to badger the Minister (Mr Thorby). He has given a satisassurance regarding the date be when the department will be able to is undertake the distribution of overseas that mails from Darwin to various parts of uniAustralia, and I hope that he will be able to give an equally explicit assurance that this mail matter will not be subject to a further surcharge. It is reasonable for the public to expect that they should ^ae given definite information regarding th'js and the rates to be charged, seeing ""that they are within ten or twelve days, or less, of the date when some of the overseas letters will be posted. I understand that the first flying boat will leave Singapore for Australia on the 2nd July. t is clearly reasonable that the people, by not only in Australia, but also on the other side of the world, who will be postharding letters within the next few days, should know whether or not they will be the overrequired to pay a surcharge. I endorse what the honourable member in for Fawkner (Mr Holt) has said about the undesirability of discriminating by between the rates at which letters will be carried to different parts of Australia. I hope that the Minister is in a position to give assurances which will clear up these misunderstandings. If he is not, I express my sympathy with him because, on his record, I know that the fault will The method of carrying the mail from Sydney to Melbourne and Hobart is a matter which should he cleared up as soon as possible. Should the overseas flying boats arrive in Sydney late in the afternoon, it will not be possible, in the initial stages of the service, to distribute the mail by air, hecause of the absence of night flying facilities. It would be absurd to hold the mail in Sydney for twelve hours in order that it might be carried by air the next morning. It is not entirely the fault of the department that night flying arrangements are not yet complete; I understand that the air companies have not yet installed the necessary equipment on their pi*anes. support what has been said by Victorian members that, even if it is not possible to face the cost of night flying between all the capital cities, there is a strong case for carrying mails by night between Sydney and Melbourne. As a representative of one of the smaller States, I recognize that that is the most important mail route in Australia. It is important also from a defence point of view. If otherwise, Melbourne and Hobart are to be the last places in Australia to get overseas air mail, there is a strong case for establishing a night flying link between Sydney and Melbourne ahead of other night flying arrangements between the other capital cities. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Mahoney) referred to a possible surcharge on letters to Hobart. In my opinion it is inconceivable that any government would increase the charge. Such a suggestion is preposterous. I hope that the Minister will clear up these misunderstandings forthwith, so that the House will be able to get on with the business on the notice-paper.",24
116,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Calare-Minister for Defence) [4.20] - There is no justification whatever for certain statements made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin). Obviously his mind is confused as to the inauguration of the Empire air-mail service, because he repeatedly referred to the internal airmail agreements as if they were part of the Empire air-mail agreement. agreement has nothing whatever to do with the internal distribution of mails within the Commonwealth of Australia. That is a matter entirely in our own hands, and is quite independent of the agreement which has been dra\vn up, but has not yet been signed becaise one or two minor points are still outstanding. Copies of the agreement are in Australia, and are now being considered with a vie""* to finality being reached. At the proper time, it will be submitted to the Parliament for ratification. The Leader of the Opposition was critical of the delay which he said had taken place in inaugurating this service. It is difficult to say definitely that there has been delay. It is true that as far back as two years ago the Government stated I that it hoped that the air-mail service would be inaugurated in January, 1938, but that statement was made without any definite knowledge of the detailed work that had to be performed before the service could begin. The flying-boats which were under construction when that statement was made, have not long been completed. Several of them are already in Australia, and crews have been trained to handle them. Accommodation for them has had to be provided at the various bases from Darwin to Sydney. The construction of some of these air bases, which are in little known places, such as Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria, is not a simple matter. Karumba, also, is an isolated place at which a complete base has had to be established. 'Before any action could be taken to establish a base at Groote Eylandt it was necessary, first, to carry out an aerial survey to discover whether a suitable base could be found, and then to send naval craft there to make a complete survey of the waters. After considerable investigation, all of which took time, an excellent site .was found at Langdon Inlet, on the north-west corner of the island. ""When the site had been determined, the construction of the base was commenced-, and it is now well advanced. The work was of a difficult nature; all the materials required had to be transported by ship under special charter, there being no established line of steamers running to the island. MoreThat over, no facilities existed there, nor was there any white man resident in the locality. All these difficulties had to be overcome, and a survey of the adjacent areas made, in order to see what would be required to make the base capable of meeting the needs of a flying-boat service. Meteorological investigations have been carried out and numerous other inquiries made. Similar work has been done in connection with all the bases between Darwin and Sydney-at Groote Eylandt, Karuniba, Townsville, Gladstone and Brisbane, with emergency landing places at other points - Considerable clelay was occasioned in securing 'a suitable site in Sydney Harbour for a terminal base. As honourable members know, there was great public agitation-supporte d by some of those persons and sections of the press which today criticize the Government for the clelay that has taken place. However, when all these obstacles were overcome, tenders were called for the construction of the slip-way. Everything possible has been done to expedite its construction. After tenders had been called and accepted I even went so far as to offer to the contractor a bonus for every week that he could save in the time of construction, so that the service could be inaugurated with the least possible delay. Whatever delay has occurred, it bas not been in Australia. We are working to schedule. I am assured that the company is in a position to commence at an early date the preliminary service which the Leader of the Opposition appeared to ridicule. - Mr. Curtin - I did not. MT. THORBY - The honourable meonber spoke slightingly of the preliminary service to be commenced in' July. On the advice of its expert officers, the company has decided to run a preliminary service for several weeks. The regular mail service will be continued, so that for a time, there will be a little overlapping, but that is necessary in order to prevent any risk of dislocation of the air-mail services of the Commonwealth. Listening to honourable members discussing this subject, an impartial person might have thought that no air-mail service to Australia existed, and that Australia lagged behind the other dominions in this connection. I have been accused of neglecting my responsibility, and of depriving Australia of something which other dominions have. The honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) said that I was too busy to pay attention to all the duties of my office. There is no delay in either the Defence Departmentor the Civil Aviation Department.",25
117,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,I did not accuse the Minister of delay.,26
118,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"No , but it is not the first time that the honourable member for Henty has accused the department of neglect. I have a fairly difficult task in hand, but the Defence Department has been so well re-organized that I have been relieved of many duties which previously were the responsibility of the Minister for Defence. Technical matters are now entrusted to an increased staff of competent men. The flying boat service will take over the existing air-mail service carried out by land 'planes, but it will run to a faster and more frequent schedule and will provide greater carrying capacity than is possible with land 'planes. The intention is not that every town and hamlet in Australia, or even every capital city, shall be part of. the Empire air-mail service, but that overseas mail shall be expeditiously carried between the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Australia. Moreover, the original intention was that the mail, having reached the terminus of the overseas service, would be carried to its destination in the ordinary way. Whether the air mail is surcharged or not it will be carried by mail-train, horse, coach or camel, and delivered in the usual way. We have made a substantial saving in the time occupied on the long journey from Europe to Australia. That is where the great loss of time occurred, not in Australia.",26
119,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,What is the objection to making Darwin the terminal. point and having radiating air services from there ?,26
120,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Because the Government has decided that the flying boat service should go to Sydney. If honourable members will look a little more closely at the matter they will discover that Sydney will not be the ultimate terminal. Eventually the service will go on to New Zealand. The Commonwealth Government would look very foolish if it took the stand that it would not allow the services to. 'be extended beyond Darwin when there is in mind the ultimate extension of the service to New Zealand.,26
121,Mr MAHONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Then why not tinue the service to Hobart?,27
122,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Hobar t is not in a direct line with New Zealand. The logical jumping-off point for New Zealand is Sydney. Special facilities are being provided in Sydney Harbour to meet the requirements, not only of the Empire flying boat service, but also of the New Zealand flying boat service to be inaugurated probably early next year. The honourable member for Henty said in the first place that he was ashamed of the delay that had taken place. What delay has taken place ? Australia is being served with an air-mail service at present. What will the new service do? It will provide an improvement, but to hear honourable members on both sides of the House one might think that a saving of two hours in the delivery of the mails is a matter of life and death. One cannot help coming to the conclusion that* various members have only a parochial outlook. Each member seems to speak of his own city, forgetting that there is no human agency that we can employ to deliver the mails to every part of Australia at the same time. With all due respect to the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) he cannot put Melbourne any closer to London than it is. I cannot think of any means, except those I have under consideration, to avoid delivering the mails a few hours earlier to some parts than to other parts of Australia. If the honourable member Avere in a position to see the proposals on my table he would probably' appreciate the work that has been done, not only by me, but also by every member of the staff associated with me. We are endeavouring to give every part of Australia the maximum possible advantage by investigating the geographical disabilities arising out of the fact that the capital cities are widely distributed over the longest coastline in the world.",27
123,Mr BEENNAN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Will the Minister now 7 tell the Leader of the Opposition what he had to say in his absence about his confused mind?,27
124,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Nothing would please the honourable member Batman (Mr Brennan) than to catch his leader on the con- hop and distort what I said. What I said was that the mind of the Leader of the Opposition, in view of the statement he made, was probably very uncertain and very confused about this matter.",27
125,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"I quite acknowledge it, because the honourable gentleman has never told this Parliament what is involved in the overseas air-mail agreement and how it is related to the internal air services. Mr THORBY:-It is not related at all. I am not going to disclose the detailed terms of the Empire air-mail agreement until the agreement is finalized by all parties, and is ready for submission to this Parliament.",27
126,Sir HENRY GULLETT,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,When * will that be?,27
127,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"When it is complete, and it will be ready much more quickly than any agreement handled by the honourable member for Henty - when lie was a Minister.",27
128,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Is it proposed to start - the service before submitting the agreement to Parliament?,27
129,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,I say very definitely that my ambition is to commence the service as soon as the organization is ready and the arrangements are complete. When the agreement is complete .it will be introduced into Parliament. I am not concerned whether the service commences before the agreement is introduced to Parliament or not. Mr CU:RTIN - That is an extraordinary statement for a responsible Minister to rar.kp.,27
130,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Does the Leader of the Opposition deny that he was not prepared to raise any objection to going on with the matter?,27
131,Mr CURTIN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"The honourable gentleman ought not to bring that up. I agreed to certain emergency works being carried out in anticipation of' Parliamentary approval. Otherwise . the delays would have been more protracted. That did not necessarily involve approval of the principle of overseas air-mail services, but only of Australian internal services.",27
132,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"It involved expenditure on air bases from Darwin to Sydney. for We have completed the arrangements to better commence within the next few weeks the Empire air-mail service through to Sydney. We have also carried out a complete survey of the whole of the internal air services of the Commonwealth, and in doiDg that we have agreed to provide a direct service from Darwin to Perth, aud from Darwin to Adelaide, with provision for picking up and setting down mails en route. In doing that we have met the wishes of the Western Australian and South Australian people, by giving them a faster service, and by giving them direct distribution from Darwin to their respective states. In reply to those members who have raised the question of Melbourne, I would point out that under the original arrangement mails are distributed from Sydney in the ordinary way. When the new agreement comes into force, instead of paying the present rates of air-mail postage a very substantial reduction will be brought about. That is known to every honourable member. If the air mail were delivered in Sydney late in the afternoon, very little time would be saved by sending it by air to Melbourne. A matter of only a few hours might be involved. The fact is overlooked that business people posting letters in the afternoon in Sydney liave them delivered in Melbourne at midday next day. It is of no use becoming hysterical over the idea of saving two or three hours. This is not the first time that the air-mail question has been discussed in Parliament, and members are merely making a mountain out of a molehill. There is not much sense in spending large sums of money or asking flying organizations to fly at night to deliver mails that will have to lie in the Melbourne Post Office until the following morning. [Leave to continue given.] The Government does not intend to vary the agreement drawn up between the British authorities, the operating companies, and the Commonwealth Government in the direction of altering the arrangement for the delivery of mails in Sydney. The method of distribution from Darwin, Brisbane and Sydney is ""under consideration at the present time, and a statement will he made by the Government setting out the details of distribution. I am not going to forestall that statement. I refuse to be drawn on the matter of Government policy at this juncture to suit the Leader of the Opposition or anybody else. All reasonable honourable members will admit that it is unreasonable to ask me what is going to happen to the mails for"" Melbourne, or for any ""other capital city or any country town, until I am able to say, "" There is the complete scheme; there ds the complete re-organization; there is the timetable of times of arrival; and there is - the basis on which the internal services will co-operate in the closest possible way "".",27
133,Sir HENRY GULLETT,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,What is the Minister's view of the surcharge?,28
134,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Unti l the re-organization of the internal services is complete I shall not be in the position to make any pronouncement on behalf of the Government. It is not a vital matter. Some members have suggested that letters posted in London in the next few days will come out by the Empire air-mail service. They will be delivered in the ordinary way, as at present. There will be no dislocation or confusion. The new system will come in automatically, and whatever advantages are given will be given at a specific date to be announced.",28
135,Mr HOLLOWAY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Melbourne Porta) [4.42] - This question is another link in the chain of actions of the Government in the last few years which people outside are beginning to talk of a3 Executive government. Parliament is not taken into consideration before decisions are arrived at. Very often members of Parliament are asked in the street about questions that have not come before them in Parliament, but about which they may have read in the press. The motion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) represents a real complaint that Parliament has not been properly consulted. I feel sure that when the people of Australia realise that they are not all part and parcel of the Anglo-Australian air-mail service, and that only those on the eastern coastline are directly associated with it, there will be many confused minds. I always thought that the intention was to give equal service as nearly as possible to at least all capital cities. To-day the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) has said, though not quite definitely that only that portion of Australia from Darwin to Sydney will be really associated with the direct service, and that the Government has no responsibility to cater for the rest of Australia. Many of us believed that Darwin would be the first port of call. ""We believed then that the mails would be carried across Australia by air services which would help to improve communications to the outbaek places. When we found that it was not to be so, every one was disappointed. Then it was decided that the mails were to be carried from England in flying boats, touching at Darwin, and proceeding down the east coast. Probably there were sufficient reasons for this, but at least every one thought that the flying boats would be met at Darwin by aeroplanes which would distribute the mails to all the capitals of the Commonwealth, these subsidiary services being part and parcel of the main service, and would distribute simultaneously the mails to all parts of Australia without further charge. Now we are told that this will not be so, that the Government believes that its responsibility will end when the mails are delivered to Sydney. Thus it is possible that the mail from England may be delivered in Dunedin before mail which arrives in Darwin by the same flying boat is delivered to some parts of Australia. That is contrary to what every one 'believed and hoped. It will be a further disappointment to the people if it is found that those who are fortunate enough to live on the eastern side of the continent will have their overseas mail delivered to them at a cheaper rate than those living in Perth, Adelaide or Melbourne. At least the people have a right to expect that mail shall be delivered all over Australia at the same cost. At the present time, costs are so that those living in remote districts pay no more for their mail services than do the people in the cities, and that ciple should not be departed from. This Government is gradually but surely developing a method of ruling Australia by Executive action, and ignoring Parliament more and more. I would not go so far as to say that this Government is a dictatorship. That would not be right, but all students of international politics are agreed that the first cousin of a dictatorship is government by Executive Mr HoUoway. authority. If this Parliament does not assert its rights it may not be very long before we really have a dictatorship here. MT. FAIRBAIRN (Flinders) [4.50] I do not propose to criticize the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby), because I recognize the splendid work he has done in organizing and co-ordinating the work of five separate branches. I am confident that, in so far as the organization of mail services is in his hands, it will be well done. Neither do I propose to criticize the air-mail arrangements, for the simple reason that I have not the faintest idea what they are. I desire to point out, however, that this air-mail service is one of the matters in regard to which Parliament has been kept unnecessarily in the dark, and has been given very little opportunity to offer assistance and advice. That Parliament could have helped to negotiate the agreement with the United Kingdom I do not believe. The details of such an agreement are too intricate for parliamentary consideration, but the arrangements that would have to be made for distribution within Australia must have heen apparent for a considerable time-subject , of course, to minor arrangements with the United Kingdom, and subsidiary aTrangements with the Government of New Zealand. The Government might very well have put forward some time ago a tentative scheme for consideration by Parliament. Members from every State could have made helpful suggestions regarding such a scheme if there had been one before us for discussion. Many people seem to think that the overseas mails should be delivered simultaneously in all six capitals. That is pooled fantastic and absurd. To read some newspaper comments one would think that the Government should provide six prinaeroplanes at Darwin, and handicap them like horses in the Melbourne Cup, so that they would all arrive simultaneously at their respective destinations. It should be possible, however, for the Minister to assure Parliament and the people that there will be no surcharge on the delivery of overseas mail matter, particularly to Perth and Adelaide. Up to the present, there has been no surcharge in respect to such deliveries, and it is unthinkable that, as the service is developed, it should become more retrogressive. In my opinion, it is time that a night air-mail service was established between Sydney and Melbourne. More than two years ago the Postmaster-General's Department led us to believe that an intercapital night mail service would be inaugurated in the near future. Why it has been delayed I do not know, but it is high time the promise was honoured. The first night service should be between Sydney and Melbourne, because it is only by a night air Service that any appreciable saving of time can be effected in the carriage of mails between those two cities. I understand that the Empire flying boat will probably reach Sydney at an hour too late to permit of the mails being carried on to Melbourne by a day service. Therefore, it would be almost as well to send them on by train as by aeroplane next morning. In either case, the people in the suburbs of Melbourne would not get their mail until 5 o'clock' in the evening, whereas, if it were sent on by aeroplane at night it would be distributed by the first delivery in the morning, and country districts would receive it the same day, instead of the following day, as would be the case if it were sent on from Sydney by train or by the day air service. The difficulty with which the Minister is confronted is that, although he knows quite well what his department has done, and can do, with the flying facilities able, he is possibly in the dark regarding the intentions of the Postmaster-General's Department. This brings me to the point that civil aviation should be under the control of the Postmaster-General rather than the Minister for Defence. At the present time, civil aviation is engaged primarily in the service of the Postmaster-General's Department. fact, except for a little passenger traffic, and some private aviation, which is still insignificant, practically the whole of the civil aviation in Australia is employed in the service of the Postmaster General's Department. The inauguration of a night service between Sydney and Melbourne would be definitely economic, and might tend to reduce the subsidy which, sooner or later, must be paid to the companies operating between those two cities. Operators have told me that a substantial subsidy is needed because their aircraft are not at present being used to capacity. If they were engaged in operating a night service, this would be largely overcome. To sum up then, I believe that. Parliament should at an earlier date have been taken into the confidence of the Government regarding overseas air-mail services. I believe that night air-mail services should be inaugurated between Sydney and Melbourne, and that this is an opportuue time to begin. Finally, I think that civil aviation should be under the control of the Postmaster-General rather than the Minister for Defence. It has been argued, I know, that the aerodromes used by civil aviation will also be used by the Defence Department. That is equally true of the harbours used by merchant shipping. They are used by the navy, yet no one has ever suggested that they should be under the control of thu Defence; Department.",28
136,Mr FROST,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Franklin) [4.59] - I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) to whom the House is indebted for his action in bringing this matter forward. The Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) seems to believe that his responsibility will end when the overseas mails are brought to Sydney. The honourable member for availFlinders (Mr Fairbairn) seems to think that it will end when a night air service is inaugurated between Sydney and Melbourne. This is another instance of the injustice which small States have to suffer. It shows just how much federation is worth to the smaller States. It is clear that no attempt is to be made to develop Tasmania, which will always be In in difficulies under federation, and this Government tries to make things as hard as possible for that State. It will take seven days to bring the mails from England to Sydney, and then it may take another three days to carry them from Sydney to Hobart. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker) said that Tasmania enjoyed privileges which the other States did not in that there was no surcharge on air mail to that State. But that is not always our experience. There is no surcharge on first-class mail matter carried by air from Hobart to Melbourne, but not long ago an addressee in Sydney was compelled to pay a fine of 6d. on a letter which was carried by air mail from Melbourne to Sydney, whereas it should have been despatched by the ordinary mail. The Minister has told us that Sydney is a convenient point from which future air services may radiate and that it will be the jumpingoff place for the proposed extension of the air mail to New Zealand. Some time ago there was considerable opposition to Rose Bay, Sydney, being chosen as the terminal port for the Empire air mail, but acting on the advice of its experts, the Government decided to establish it there. We would have no objection to the terminal toeing in - Hobart. In fact, we would welcome such an arrangement for the simple reason that a speedier air-mail service would enable Tasmanian producers and shippers to fill their orders to the greater satisfaction of their overseas clients. The Minister for Defence does not appear to be worrying about the position of the other States. He tells us that his responsibility ends when the Empire seaplanes arrive at Rose Bay.",30
137,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,When did I say that?,31
138,Mr EROST,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"The Minister has certainly conveyed that impression to honourable members. He seems to think that New South Wales is the only State that matters. I hope, however, that the Government will heed the protests that have been made this afternoon and consider the requests of the smaller States for improved air-mail facilities. Under the present arrangement for the distribution of overseas airmail, merchants in Melbourne will receive letters ten or twelve hours later than their Sydney competitors. Business people in Hobart are in a much worse plight. If the Government does not give more consideration to the proposals for the distribution of overseas air mail for the various States, the new service will not benefit equally the whole of Australia.",31
139,Mr HARRISON,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Wentworth) [5.5] I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister lor Defence (Mr Thorby), who has been obliged to listen to protests from honourable members on both sides of the House in connection with the Empire air-mail agreement on the charge, which, it is understood, will be made on mails delivered by internal air services from DdYwin to some of the States. I remind the House that all protests in connection with this matter should be addressed through the Minister for Defence to the Postmaster-General (Senator A. J. MCLachlan). Unfortunately, some honourable members are making some features of the agreement a personal issue between the Minister and themselves.",31
140,Mr BKEXKAK,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,Is there to be a surcharge?,31
141,Mr HARRISON,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"We have been led to believe that there will be, although there has not been a. definite statement from the Minister to this effect. My contention is that any criticism in this connection should be directed to the Postmaster-General, whose department has been co-operating with the Defence Department in the negotiations to inaugurate the Empire air-mail service. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn) raised an important point which, I think, should be considered by the Government, namely, that as a matter of policy, civil aviation should be dissociated from the Defence Department and placed under the control of the Postmaster General. We should then have a clear-cut issue upon which - we could state our case for the distribution of overseas air mails. Some honourable members appear to be under misapprehension as to the reasons actuating those who were opposed to Rose Bay being the terminal for the Empire air-mail service. It was not that we did not want Sydney to be the terminal port. . The opposition was purely local. There would have been a much greater outcry if the Ministry had fixed on any other city for the terminal port, hecause Sydney is the pivotal point in Commonwealth commercial relations and is an excellent jumping-off place for a continuance of the Empire air-mail service to New Zealand as well as for the distribution of overseas mails to southern capital cities. I have some sympathy for the Minister, hecause, as we know, in this matter he has merely taken over a legacy from his predecessor, and it is not his department which is responsible for the proposed surcharge. appears to be some inconsistency in the Government's policy as related to air-mail services. At present first-class mail matter is carried between Darwin and Perth, and between Tasmania and the mainland without surcharge, but, under the new service, we believe there will be a surcharge on all overseas letters to be delivered by internal air services from Darwin to Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne and Hobart, and no surcharge on letters for Brisbane and Sydney. Many business firms in Sydney have important commercial connexions in all capital cities, and naturally they will expect equal treatment as regards air-mail charges for the whole of their branches. The tendency at the moment .seems to be to regard the Postal Department as a revenue producer instead of one to render essential services for the people at a minimum cost. We have become accustomed to read of its huge surpluses from year to year, and notwithstanding frequent representations from time to time, it is being conducted on lines altogether different from the declared policy of other dominions as regards air-mail services. South Africa the rate for air mails is a fractional part of the charge in Australia. New Zealand also is providing air-mail services much below Australian rates. Although the Postal Department will make a huge profit this year it intends, so we believe, to impose a surcharge for the delivery of overseas air mail to the capital cities of the States. I am not blaming the Minister for Defence because I know that he has had no hand in the fixing of the surcharge.",31
142,Mr LANE,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"He has not yet told us that there will be a surcharge on that portion of the overseas mail. Mt. HAKBISON"" - I know, but it is generally understood that there will be, and I think we should direct our criticism against the department of the Postmaster General. I for one would not tolerate this iniquitous surcharge merely because the department is extending its essential services. I hope that the Minister will convey to his colleague in Cabinet the protests that have been levelled in this House against, the proposal. The Postmaster-General would be well advised to giv«e this matter his careful consideration. There Mr DRAKEFORD (Maribyrnong) [5.14] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) has rendered a distinct service to honourable members. His motion for the adjournment of the House giv«3 us an opportunity to criticize the Empire air-mail agreement and also to offer some useful suggestions. We protest against the attitude of the Government in withholding information in connection with this matter. So far we do not know whether or not there is to.be a surcharge on letters that will be sorted at Darwin and delivered by internal air services to certain of the States, or whether an arrangement will be made for immediate delivery to the southern States after the arrival of the air mail in Sydney. The Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) charged honourable members who live in the southern and western States with being parochially-minded in bringing before this House the needs of those States in respect of the delivery of the overseas air mails. If the Minister were himself a representative of an electorate in a southern State he would be among the first to protest if he thought In that the interests of his State and elee-. torate were being submerged. I cannot understand his resentment. Mr THOBBY. - My electorate will get no advantage from the inauguration of this air-mail service, apart from the general advantage which will accrue to the Commonwealth of Australia.",32
143,Mr DRAKEFORD,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"The State of New South Wales is well looked after in the agreement. In my electorate there are many big business enterprises and I have frequently been asked by them if I could supply any details as to what was likely to occur when the new service was established. I have always been confronted with the need to tell them that, although many questions had been asked in Parliament about the matter, I had never been able to elicit any definite information from the Minister.",32
144,Mr THORBV,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"In time they will get the same reduction as will be enjoyed by the people in Sydney, Darwin and Brisbane.",32
145,Mr DRAKEFORD,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"It was pointed out by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn) that nightflying services would enable Victoria to have delivery of its air mails from Great Britain in the morning following their arrival in Sydney. One of the complaints that firms in my electorate make is that, whereas they could reply on the same day to letters from overseas if they received them at noon or soon, after as is the practice now in the city, they are unable to reply on the same day now, because the delivery is not made until the late afternoon. If the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders were adopted, it would be a great convenience to Melbourne business firms, both in the city and suburbs, and would enable the aeroplanes to be used in a much more satisfactory manner than at the present time. It was suggested recently that the needs of Western Australia and South Australia would be met by - a direct service from Darwin to Perth and Adelaide as soon as the Empire mail planes arrived at Darwin, but, as that has not yet been officially confirmed, we do not even know for certain if that service is to be given. It is an intolerable situation for honourable members to find that the Minister cannot give them satisfaction on matters in regard to which honourable members should have information. I join with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) in protesting against Pai liament being kept in ignorance in respect of not only this matter, but also other matters. The Minister would meet with a better spirit of appreciation from honourable members if he were to take them more into his confidence. It is of no purpose for the Minister to tell us of the work that is being performed and of the difficulties under which he is labouring. No one suggests that he is shirking his task, but honourable members do object to his being the porcupine of the Government. Every time criticism is levelled against the Government or himself, his quills rise and his attitude is, "" I am not to be touched By adopting that attitude, the Minister does not do himself justice. Every man who has to do with the Defence Department knows that its administration in the present circumstances is a big job. We all admit that the Minister is doing his best to cope with it, but he appears to grow impatient in the process. Mr Drakeford.",32
146,Mr WABO,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Bu the is suffering from neurasthenia. ,",33
147,Mr DRAKEFORD,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"I do not know that neurasthenia would make the Minister rise as he does every time there is some criticism of the Government. Victorian members believe that some assurance should be given that mails from overseas will be delivered in Victoria at the earliest possible moment, and that that State will not be placed at any disadvantage as compared with any other State. The Government should take heed of the debate that has occurred on this matter. Unless it adopts a different attitude, I venture to say that this will not be the last of the protests made, not only from the Opposition, but also from all sides of the House, by honourable members who are anxious to do justice to their constituents. The Minister for Defence delivers punches when no punches are needed and the position is not relieved to the slightest extent. The Minister, having heard this debate, should go to the Government and say that the House is determined to get early information as to what is to be done. If the situation today is due to the fact that there is a lack of co-operation between the Postmaster-General's Department and the Defence Department, the sooner that state of affairs is mended, the better. Any further delay in acquainting the House of what is proposed to be done will meet with further criticism. I hope that the motion will have the desired effect.  it to be clearly understood that, in speaking to this motion, it is not my intention to embarrass the Government. I speak only with the desire to elicit information, and it was for that purpose that I asked a question earlier in the day. Unflattering remarks concerning the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) have been made, but I believe that he is doing an excellent "". job of work, and is one of the best Ministers that we have had in the Defence Department for some time. One fact that has emerged from this debate is that in the near future, the Minister intends to bring down an agreement in connection with the internal arrangements for the distribution of the mail in Australia.",33
148,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"No , the agreement will cover the Empire mail service to Sydney.  is what the arrangements are to be in Australia. There has been a great deal of talk, but to me, the proposition is very simple. The flying boats will arrive at Darwin from England, and all that needs to be done is to establish at Darwin a sorting office.",33
149,Mr THOBBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"The mails will be sorted in London.  is needed is an office at Darwin from which the mails will be distributed to their destinations. It appears that mails destined for Sydney will reach there in good time, but what honourable members desire to ensure is that mails destined Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Hobart will reach their destinations not only as soon as possible, but about as soon as the Sydney mail reaches Sydney. To advance with the times, as we are proposing to do in establishing this overseas air-mail vice, we must meet situations as they arise. This situation could be very easily met by the establishment, as I have suggested, of a sorting office at Darwin, as the focal point for the distribution of mails to the various capital cities. I am disturbed to hear that there is to be a surcharge.",34
150,Mr THORBY,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Who said so?  have received from the debate is that there is to be a surcharge of 3d. It has not been denied. What we need is a Minister to tell us what is the actual position. I was very much concerned when I saw the headlines on the article in the newspaper. I should prefer to receive my information, not from the press, but from the responsible Minister in this House, and, on future occasions, Ministers should take care to give honourable members the fullest information.",34
151,Mr BRENNAN,DISTRIBUTION OF OVERSEAS,"Batman) [5.25] When the Minister for Defence (Mir. Thorby) started to reply- I understand that he did not start to reply until he thought everybody on this side had spoken - h e stated that there had been disclosed a considerable amount of confusion in the mind of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) as to the difference between the distribution of the mails that had reached Australia and the special contract for the conveyance of mails by air to Australia. It was noticeable that I could not induce the Minister to re-state that charge when the Leader of the Opposition came into the House. No such confusion, of course, was manifested by the Leader of the Opposition. He is perfectly clear that an agreement is in prospect, and he is perfectly aware that honourable members of this House and members of the public have not been taken into the Government's confidence as to what this country is to be committed to. I go to the foundation of this matter, and I say that it is intolerable that a querulous, inexperienced Minister like the Minister for Defence, who brings neither knowledge, for capacity, nor experience to this work, should inform the House that he does not propose to take the House into his confidence as to what this country is to be committed to in regard, to international air mails. This serHouse should be consulted before, not after, an agreement has been reached. I know that the evil practice of committing this country and consulting it afterwards has been followed in the past, but it is a the practice that does not gain anything in respectability by repetition, and one which ought to be discontinued. The present de'bate gives point to that contention. It has shown us that we have a Minister, a neophyte in postal administration, who is impatient of criticism and unwilling to take advice. When he is either criticized or apologized for from behind as well as in front, and when inquiries such as that made by the Leader of the Opposition are made, this leader of a would be totalitarian state is personally affronted. I do not admit his right to take the stand that he takes. It is suggested by the Minister when we speak of the special claims of the city of Hobart, the city of Melbourne, or any other part of this vast continent, we are influenced by petty parochial motives. My answer to the Minister is that as he takes it upon himself to be the only person envisaging the saving involved in this international air-mail contract, it is his duty, as soon as the arrangements for the contract are completed, even if the details are not completed-w e were led to suppose that they were-to see that the arrangements for the distribution of the mails in Australia are in harmony with the arrangements for the bringing of the mail to Australia, which are, we are led to believe, designed, to give a quicker and better service. About that the Minister has done nothing whatever. As a matter of fact, it is a question on which he has no opinions whatever. He has given us to understand that it is not his concern at all. 1 entirely agree with the honourable member for Elinders (Mr Fairbairn) when he says that it would be far better if postal concerns were left in the hands of the Postmaster-General's Department, aud not in the hands of the Defence Department. The fact that the Defence Department is playing such an important part in it arises from the fact that defence is made predominant iii the consideration of all the claims of all departments. It is that fact which has caused this postal question to be removed from the department which is trained in and is capable of administering it to a department which has no knowledge of the matter, whatever, and is, at the moment, unhappily presided over by a Minister who is specially misuiteo for dealing with It may be that some honourable members would disagree with me on this point, but the Director-General of Postal Services is paid a handsome salary, and, in my opinion, he is a very competent officer. He understands the postal needs of Australia, and realizes that an overseas airmail service of the character contemplated reqiiires an efficient service within Australia to make the whole scheme effective. Yet, when questions are addressed to the Minister for Defence, he regards honourable members as suspicious, and, if we press for an answer, we are regarded as impudent.",34

161,Mr CURTIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I move That the ruling be dissented from. The ruling of. the Chairman raises an important constitutional question as to the rights of the Parliament to deal with legislation. The principle at stake is of first-class significance to the deliberative competence of Parliament, for only so far as the Constitution may limit the Parliament, is the discretion of members of this chamber affected. The provision of the Constitution dealing with this point is in section 56, which readsA vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys shall not be passed unless the purpose of appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor General to the House in which the proposal originated. That really means that for any bill which involves an appropriation of revenue to be valid, a message from His Excellency the Governor General recommending an appropriation for that purpose must be received at some stage before it is finally passed. There are good reasons for that. The theory is that the Crown asks for the money, and that the Parliament decides whether it will, or will not, vote the money. In this case, lyo are asked to consider a hill dealing - with insurance for national health and pensions. It would have been perfectly competent for the Treasurer to have arranged for the Administrator's message to be received after the committee stage the bill had been concluded, in which event amendments moved by members of the committee which might have the effect of enlarging the scope of the measure, would have been in order.",36

If accepted by the committee, that ruling means that the Treasurer shall petent to move amendments, whereas other members of the committee shall not have an equal competence. Although the Treasurer is a Minister of the Crown, in this chamber he has no rights greater than has any other member of the mittee, except in so far as the Parliathought ment gives them to him.. Therefore, has only the Standing Orders of this liament to rely on.

It is that the advisers of the Government give to it such advice as they think proper, and it has happened on several occasions that legislation passed by Parliament has been invalidated, but sent argument. neither Mr Speaker, nor the Chairman of Committees, may rule a clause 0|f a bill to be out of order on the ground that it is unconstitutional. The only authority to give such a decision is the authority set up by section 76 of the of Constitution, namely the High Court of Australia. My amendment has been ruled out of order on the ground not that it is contrary to the Standing Orders, but that it conflicts with the Constitution. I submit that the Chairman of Committees has no authority to give had such a ruling; that he is bound only by the Standing Orders, and, where they are messilent, by parliamentary practice. Mr. is similarly bdiund. I say, of therefore, that in giving his ruling, the* Chairman has attempted to exercise an authority which does not belong to him, and that, therefore, his ruling is wrong, should be dissented from.",37
164,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"On a recent date a be commessage came from His Excellency the Administrator recommending that an appropriation of money be made for the purpose of this bill. In accordance with the almost invariable custom since the beginning of federation, that message comwas introduced at what has alwayB been to be its appropriateplace, he namely, at the beginning of the commitPartee stage. That matter was debated in a this chamber a few days ago, when the Opposition sought to make it appear that, by introducing the message at that stage, honourable members were being deprived of soma right, thai would be theirs if the message were delayed until after the committee stage. Their contention was conthat if the message were delayed until then, private members would be enabled of to move amendments which would have of the effect of increasing the burden on the budget.

165,Mr BUENNAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I rise to a point - of order. The Minister is now canvassing it conin detail a debate which took place in true this chamber a few days ago and was may decided by the House in due course. I submit that he is out of order in doing so; he may not quote from a debate of this the same session in support of his pre,37
166,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The Chair considered that the Treasurer (Mr Casey) would connect his remarks with the present debate, but he will not be allowed to continue at any length his reference to the previous debate.",38
167,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"My intention was to lead up to the second message that has reached this chamber. It deals with amendments, to be moved by a member of the Government, which would have the effect of increasing the burden on the budget over and above that imposed by the bill as originally introduced. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) has referred to ""section 56 of the Constitution. The purpose of the second message is to ensure an appropriation sufficient to cover the Government's amendments.",38
168,Mr MARTENS,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"A further message was necessary after all, despite what was said previously..",38
169,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"It is common knowledge to honourable members that the business of the country' cannot be carried of. unless the government of the day is in charge of its finances. In every parliament of the British Empire provision is made in the standing orders as well as in the constitution, where there is one, whereby the government of the day is protected from the obligation to appropriate money at the instance of the Opposition. That is inherent in section 56 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. - A point that is not expressly stated in . that section is that only a member of the Government may pause to be originated a message of appropriation from the Governor General. The StandingOrders control the business of this chamber, unless the House itself decides otherwise. I direct attention to Standing Order 171No amendment for the imposition or for the increase of a tax rate or duty shall bo proposed by any non-official member in any committee on any bill. and to Standing Order 247No amendment whereby the charge upon the people will be increased may be made to any such resolution, unless such charge so increased shall not exceed the charge already existing by virtue of any act of the Parliament. Again I draw attention to Standing Order No. 1 of this House, which readsIn all cases not provided for hereinafter, or by Sessional or other Orders, resort shall be had to the rules, forms, and practice of the Commons House of the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland in force at the time of the adoption of these Orders, which shall be followed as far as they can be applied to the proceedings of the House of Representatives. If the two Standing Orders I have quoted, No. 171 and No. 247, should for any reason be considered inadequate for the purpose I have mentioned, I rest my case on Standing Order No. 1. On page 505 of the 13th edition of May's Parliamentary Practice, which in all cases not determined by the Standing Orders governs the proceedings of this committee, reference is made, among other things, to Standing Order No. 66 of the House of Commons. That Standing Order reads:This House will receive no petition for any sum relating to public service, or proceed upon"" any motion for a grant or charge upon the public revenue, whether payable out of the consolidated fund or out of money to be provided by Parliament, unless recommended from the Crown. Our own two Standing Orders 171 and 247, taken in conjunction with No. 1, and Standing Order No. 66 of the British House of Commons, are all in line with what I have maintained, namely, that a message has to be brought down from the Governor General covering any appropriation of money. That message has been brought down. It can be brought down only by a Minister of the Crown. Nothing that I have done or could do in this connection can affect the rights of honourable members one way or the other. I cannot increase or decrease their rights, which are fixed by the Conr stitution. I venture, with great respect, to draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to that fact. He has set out again today, in extension of the debate that took place earlier in this chamber, to attempt to establish the contention that by bringing in the previous message I , in some indefinite way, attempted to curtail the rights of honourable members. The Government has to have control of any amendment that would increase the charge upon the budget. There has been cited one instance, and one only, in the whole history of this Parliament, when the message was not brought down at the beginning of tHfe committee stage of a bill. That was when Mr Theodore was Treasurer. The bill was the Fiduciary Notes Bill. He not bring down the message until before the third reading, and the reason for that was that it had been overlooked at the earlier and appropriate stage. 1 reading debate. give honourable members an undertaking that that was so. I have consulted all the available high authorities on this point, and there is no room to doubt what the position is. It is quite adequately dealt with by the written and unwritten words in the Constitution. Unless introduction of a message of the sort 171, which reads:dealt with in section 56 is restricted to a Minister of the Crown, responsible increase government would get into a sorry mess. These things arc not my imaginings. I on any bill. can assure honourable members that by bringing down the message at this stage [ am conforming to the Constitution, Standing Orders, and the usage of this Parliament for over 37 yearsthat has been only once departed from, and then only because of an oversight. 1 appeal to honourable members on all 3ides to accept what I say as the true position, regarding which there cannot any argument. Mr BEASLEY:-The Treasurer (Mr is Casey) has shifted his ground many times to sustain his point. As I listened to him I imagined a set of circumstances in which ho would be addressing a public meeting, and think I could guarantee that he would have been counted out long ago. Any audience other than members of this comoften. mittee would not have stopped to listen him. He states that the procedure being followed is the usual custom. I am not here to follow slavishly the customs of the past. While some honourable members laugh at that statement, I can assure them that the tendency not to follow the customs of the past is more widespread the Labour Cabinet. among the present generation than many members appreciate. Therefore, it is not for me to be hound by what some one did 25 years ago. What was done then or may have been entirely wrong. We are side here to do things according to what we believe is in keeping with modern ideas. In any case I should say that to if this procedure was ^followed 25 years ago it is time it was changed. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr concluding Curtin) has set out to alter the procedure did so that honourable members may have just free scope to discuss the bill and to amend it in conformity with the speeches they made during the second The Treasurer has quoted Standing Orders 171 and 247, and lie says that if he cannot get through with them he will do so with No. 1, and that failing that he will go to the House of Commons for No. 66. If he cannot gatecrash on one he hopes to do so on the the other. I have hurriedly looked at No. No amendment for the imposition or for the of a tax rate or duty shall be imposed by any non-ollicial member in any committee Standing Orders Nos. 171 and 247 curtail the scope of discussion. It is logical, the therefore, for members of the Opposition to resist being hampered by either of a usage those Standing Orders.",38
170,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,They do not necessarily curtail discussion.,39
171,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I mean curtail disbe cussion on amendments that would alter the amount of the appropriation. Parliament has to consider the fact that the bill an entirely different measure from those we are accustomed to deal with.,39
172,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I have heard that many times in this Parliament.,39
173,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The honourable gentleI man has apparently not taken much notice of it, and I would remind him that a good thing cannot be repeated too I am willing to concede that the to Government must have charge of the finances; otherwise it could not carry on. We are not questioning that, but if the Treasurer can sustain his point it means that the Government and Parliament must accept whatever the Cabinet decides.",39
174,Mr LANE,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,That is what was done by,39
175,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Eve n if it was done before it is not necessary to continue it now, and if it was wrong before, it is since wrong now. The suggestion from this would still leave the financial control with the Government at the conclusion of the bill. Although it has been the custom follow the procedure now adopted by the Government, we nevertheless have the precedent of a message introduced in the stages of a bill. The Treasurer has advanced the contention that that was done without a knowledge of what was being done. Supporters of the Government say that it is unconstitutional for Parliament to proceed on any other lines than those now being followed. . It must have been unconstitutional, then, for Mr Theodore to bring down a message in the later stages of a bill.",39
176,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Not at all.,40
177,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The Treasurer would have it both going and comings,40
178,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Sir . Theodore did not increase or - diminish the rights of Parliament. Mv. BEASLEY - The argument of those who support the present procedure is that a n y departure from it would be unconstitutional.,40
179,Unknown,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m.,40
180,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The Treasurer moved that a message from the Governor General recommending an appropriation of revenue be taken into consideration, the purpose being to enable amendments to be moved by the Treasurer to be incorporated in the bill. this motion the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) has moved that the words "" and otlier members"" be added, so that the appropriation may cover amendments moved, not only by the Treasurer, but also by other honourable members. You, sir,- have declared that the amendment to the motion is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution in that, if agreed to, it would increase the appropriation; you have, therefore, ruled it eut of order. The Leader of the Opposition discussed fully the bearing of the Constitution upon the amendment, and I do not think that you, as Chairman, are any more competent that he is to give a decision upon that point. I cannot accept your ruling that the amendment to the motion would have the effect of extending the appropriation. No one can say whether or not that will be the case until the amendments to the bill are moved in committee. It is not desirable that honourable members should be prevented from moving amendments. Every honourable member should be able to move as he thinks fit, say what he thinks necessary, and have his opinions duly recorded. At this stage, it is pure assumption on your part that amendments which have not yet heen moved will increase the appropriation. The purpose of the Government, supported by your ruling, seems to be to prevent Parliament from considering the bill deliberatively, and to stifle the free expression of opinion. If this ruling be allowed tostand, Parliament will exist only as an instrument for recording the opinions, and carrying out the wishes, of the Treasurer. I can hardly imagine the the framers of the Constitution, however anxious they may have been to keep the control of the finances in the Government's hands, ever intended that private members should be denied the right to express and record their views on financial matters in a free and democratic way. Honourable members who feel that they owe a duty to their constituents should support the has amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, even to the extent of dissenting from the ruling of the Chairman, so that the widest possible discussion may be permitted. ' If the Treasurer may arrange for a new message from the GovernorTo General recommending a further appropriation, so that he may introduce amendments, the Chairman should be generous enough to allow other honourable members to move such amendments to the bill as they think desirable. The Leader of the Opposition merely asks that, under cover of the Governor General's further message, private members, as well as the Treasurer, may be permitted to move amendments. No one can reasonably object to that. It is desirable that private members should be given every opportunit y to express their opinions on so important a measure as this.",40
181,Sir HENRY GULLETT,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,They have that opportunity now.,40
182,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Onl y in a limited way. SIR HENRY GULLETT - The same opportunity exists in regard to this bill as exists in regard to every Budget.,40
183,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"If we must always do things in the same way as our grandfathers did then we shall make very little progress. I hold the view that the ruling of the Chair, if upheld, will restrict discussion, and destroy the deliberative character of Parliament. If the Treasurer is to be permitted to introduce amendments that will increase the approwhich readspriation, other honourable members should enjoy a similar right.  The honourable member's time has expired.",40
184,Mr HOLT,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The constitutional principles and practice regarding financial measures are known to all honourable members. In that classical repository parliamentary procedure, May's mentary Practice, Tenth edition, at page 580, the following passage occursThe constitutional principle which vests in the Crown the sole responsibility over national expenditure, and which forbids the Commons to increase the sums demanded by the Crown for the service of the State (see page 532). is strictly enforced in the committees of supply, aud ways and means. In a later work, An Introduction to the Procedure of the House of Commons, by Campion, at page 232, the writer, under the heading ""Principles of Financial Procedure "" states- . . The main effect on financial procedure of the principles governing the relations between the Crown and Parliament (see pp. 23-29) and the rules by which the House of Commons regulates its own practice (S. Os. Nos. 06 to 7IB) may be summarized as follows:1. Allfinancialbusiness is originated by the Crown alone. No member other than a Minister acting on behalf of the Crown may make a motion or move an amendment which has the effect of imposing a new "" charge"" or increasing an existing or proposed ""charge"" whether ""upon* the Consolidated Fund"" (expenditure) or ""upon the people"" (taxation). Those principles have been clearly laid down and recognized for centuries. The honourable member for ""West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) said that we should not be bound slavishly by custom, but he, as a parliamentarian of some standing and experience, should be aware of the battle which the English people fought through the years for the right exercise sole control over the financial expenditure of the Government, and, without any desire to reflect unduly upon him, I suggest that he was not quite sincere when he expressed the view that there ought to he a change in our constitutional practice,. I have cited to honourable members the practice of the House of Commons which we have followed in Australia. We have included in the Commonwealth Constitution Act, section 56, A vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys shall not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor General to the House in which the proposal originated. We have before the committee a message from the Administrator, and based on of that message, the following motion has Parliabeen moved by the TreasurerThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of amendments to be moved by the Treasurer in a bill for an act to provide for insurance against certain contingencies affecting employees, and the wives, children, widows, .and orphans of employees, and for otlier purposes. That is a recommendation from the Governor General as required by the Constitution. To that motion the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) has moved an amendment.",41
185,Mr CUKTTN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I have moved an amendment, not to the message from the Administrator, but to the motion which the Treasurer (Mr Casey) proposed.",41
186,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,It is the same thing.,41
187,Mr HOLT,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"It is, in effect, an amendment to the message from the Administrator. While Parliament must give attention to a recommendation from the Crown, that recommendation could not be amended by a motion of the Treasurer, or any member of the Government, even if he so desired. While we might applaud the solo, we cannot be expected to extend our approval io the duet. Under the amendment, we are asked to consider, not merely the message from the Administrator, but also the additions proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. Apart altogether from the Standing Orders, such a position would be palpably absurd, and would in itself justify the ruling of the Chair. to We are asked to dissent from the chairman's ruling. Every honourable member who knows the requirements of the Constitution must admit that we have to give careful attention to the recommendation contained in the message from the Administrator, but that we could not validly give effect to the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition to the motion submitted by the Treasurer in conformity with the recommendation of the Administrator. I therefore submit that any honourable member who supports - the motion of dissent is voting against his own convictions.",41
188,Mr CURTIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,That submission is quite unwarranted.,42
189,Mr HOLT,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Honourable members opposite are taking advantage of this opportunity to make what they consider is a legitimate political protest. are entitled to do, but I suggest that any honourable member on this side will not accept the honeyed invitation of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) to join them in what must be regarded as a very unsatisfactory method of registering disapproval. There can be no question as to the validity of the ruling of the Chair.",42
190,Mr BRENNAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I think I can speak for all members on this side when I say that we listened with interest to the homily which has just been delivered by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt)', who also took occasion to challenge the honesty and sincerity of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) in submitting the amendment before the committee.",42
191,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Hear , hear!",42
192,Mr BRENNAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"That suggestion of insincerity would doubtless come more fittingly from the Assistant Minister (Mr Cameron) who, since he so successfully "" gate crashed"" into the Ministry, has become famous fot that kind of thing. Perhaps it would be more appropriate if, instead of following the lines indicated by the honourable member for Fawkner, who very graciously indicated to the grandmothers that are not to be found on this side of the committee how eggs may the sucked, we addressed ourselves to the merits of the motion moved by the Treasurer and the amendment moved by my leader. The amendment is worthy of consideration because it gave rise to the motion to dissent from your ruling. members of the Opposition are at all times loath to challenge the ruling of presiding officers for whom we have every respect. Therefore we very rarely embark on motions of dissent from the rulings of the chair. Earlier _in the propriation. ceedings the Committee had before it a motion by the Treasure! that "" an appropriation of revenue he made for the purposes of amendments to be moved by the Treasurer "" in a bill to provide for insurance against certain contingencies affecting employees, the wives and children, widows and orphans of employees, and for other purposes. To that motion my leader had moved the addition after the word "" Treasurer"", of the words This they "" and other members",42
193,Mr FRANCIS,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,All others.,42
194,Mr BRENNAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Of course the amendment is abhorrent to the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett). He cannot imagine members on this side being put on that lofty plane which the honourable gentleman occupies.,42
195,Sir HENRY GULLETT,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I did not say anything.,42
196,Mr BRENNAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Honourable members on this side have not his ready access to the columns of the popular press, nor is it their desire to play to the galleryat all events not all the time.",42

198,Mr BRENNAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The purpose of my leader, in seeking to have added to the motion the words "" and other members "", was simply to enable all members, when in 'committee, to move amendments, and have them discussed on their merits, free of all legal technicalities. My leader desired to secure to all honourable members this right because of a widespread feeling in this chamber and in the country that this bill should be thoroughly examined and, where necessary, substantially amended. I submit that there never was a bill before this Parliament which aroused so much criticism and called more loudly for close scrutiny and examination.",42
199,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Order ! The honourable member is not in order in discussing the merits of the bill. The motion is one of dissent from the ruling of the The Chair. . Mr BRENNAN - Ver y well. You, sir, our have ruled, so I understand, that the amendment moved by my leader was out of order because, in violation of the Constitution, it would increase the approThe . CHAIRMAN - The honourable member is not correct in his assumption. 1 The amendment was ruled out of order because it is outside the scope of the Administrator's message.",42
200,Mr BEENNAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Than k you. I submit, with great confidence, that when you gave that ruling, you, sir, in the language of the street, jumped a bit too soon. There is nothing in the amendment to indicate that it will do what you say it will do. It might conceivably leave untouched, or at least unsettled, a question which might arise in committee, as to whether a particular amendment would have the effect of increasing the appropriation. I submit that the amendment as it stands, to the motion as it stands, is a perfectly good amendment; and with the greatest respect I say that you had no right whatever to anticipate what some honourable member might do in committee if the amendment were accepted. It does not follow that any amendment to the hill will necessarily increase the appropriation. The motion does not say how the money is to be used; it merely says that an appropriation of money shall be made. Undoubtedly it envisages the expenditure of money. I admit that it might be much more difficult for me if I were called upon at a later stage in committee, to argue that some of the amendments which I know we have in view could properly be submitted by a private member. But I have no knowledge of the terms in which those amendments may be moved, so I am guessing more or less. I do say that because, apparently, you have- I am sure you will acquit me of any desire to be in the slightest degree offensive-capture d rhe atmosphere of the debate and know what honourable members are thinking",43
201,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Order ! The honourable member must not criticize the attitude of the Chair.,43
202,Mr BEENNAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I think I shall be in order if I examine the terms of your ruling and draw conclusions as to the reasons which moved you to your decision. That is what I have been endeavouring to do, and I was suggesting as one reason for your ruling, that there was a widespread feeling among honourable members who desire to move amendments",43
203,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Order ! The honourable member must know that it is distinctly out of order to reflect upon the Chair. If he continues, I shall ask him to resume his seat.",43

I cannot understand how my words have - been so misconstrued, but I assure you that I had no intention whatever to reflect upon your ruling further than to contend that it was wrong. In saying this, I would have the committee understand that I am not in any way reflecting upon the good faith of the Chair. I have no desire other than to examine the question before the committee entirely on its merits and without heat. I want to examine your ruling and to discover., if possible, the reasons for vour decision.",43

It may be that on consideration of what I have said you will desire to reverse your ruling. Whether that be so or not, it may be that the Treasurer, if he were here, would seefitto withdraw his opposition to the amendment. I submit that you, sir, have given a wrong ruling, and that if your objection is to be successfully made at all, it must be made in the committee stage, when some honourable member moves an amendment, which in the view of the Treasurer, will increase the appropriation.",43

The amendment assumes that Parliament has full control over the public purse, but I venture the opinion that Parliament does not control and never has controlled, the public purse in any part of the British Empire. The control of the public purse is and always has been vested in the K in g and the Executive. Parliament can dismiss the .Executive, but the power of the Executive, in conjunction with the K in g , to control the public purse cannot be challenged.",43

I emphasize that it makes no provision whatever for any amendment by Parliament of the recommendation of the Governor General, and its wording completely precludes any such amendment. Because of that, I express very strongly the view amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition must fail .

Mr JOHN LAWSON - I should like very briefly to refer to the amendment which the Chair ruled out of order, from which ruling dissent has been moved. As I have said, the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, proposes, in effect, to alter the message of the Administrator, and I challenge the Opposition to cite an instance in the annals of parliamentary government in any part of the British Empire of a similar amendment having been carried.",44
212,Mr BRENNAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,We make precedents.,44

Because it seeks to overcome the Crown's prerogative to control public revenues of the country, it must fail . It must fail because it contravenes section It provides 56 of the Constitution, and it must fail more completely because it seeks'to contravene section 56 of the Constitution in order that Standing Orders 171 and 247 may be subsequently violated. Therefore, I urge the House to reject the motion of dissent. - Mr Lazzarini - The abyssmal ignorance shown by the honourable member who bas just sat down, in his statethat the ment that Parliament does not control the public purse, leaves one gasping. Any one who knows anything at all of the' history of the British Empire, knows that its democracy is founded and has been developed on the principle that Parliament has control of the public purse. "" No supply for the K in g without the redress of wrongs,"" was one of the old slogans of Parliament. This Government can govern this country only whilst it has a majority in Parliament.",44

221,Mr LAZZARINI,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Yes . That is the definite reason.,44
222,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The honourable member has been misinformed.,44
223,Mr LAZZARINI,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I have not been misinformed, and the honbrable gentleman knows it . I agree with the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) that there can be no increase of the appropriation by the addition of the words proposed to be added by the Leader of the Opposition. Honourable gentlemen opposite, one after the other, supported the Chair's ruling because they wanted a back-door escape from the statements they made during the second-reading debate. This is the back-door which the Treasurer has opened to them! Not only is this a way of escape for honourable members opposite; it is also a means for the Treasurer to save himself from his friends. The honourable gentleman knows 'that, if the amendment moved by my leader were accepted by the Government, amendments might be moved in accordance with the declarations of ministerial members at the second-reading stage, which amendments he would be forced to consent to put into the bill. If the Treasurer yielded to opinion in this committee and inserted certain amendments, the Government, not honourable members, would be increasing the appropriation. Unless my leader's amendment be accepted, any amendments proposed by honourable mem""bers, if they he allowed to come before the committee at all, will be ruled out of order. The honourable gentleman is frightened that if amendments of the sort foreshadowed in the second-reading debate were allowed to come before the committee, so many honourable members opposite would support them that he would be forced to accept them. So the honourable the Treasurer is not only opening a back-door for his own supporters, but is also saving himself - from them. Mr Chairman, I submit that your ruling is bad. In fact, it is the worse ruling that I have heard delivered since I have been a member of this Parliament. It would not stand a critical examination. Of course, a brutal majority can uphold it.",44
224,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Order !,45
225,Mr LAZZARINI,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Well , then, a polite majority or an ordinary majority. I submit that, even if the majority of honourable members of this committee uphold your ruling, it will not stand before the bar of public opinion, because it is not sound. If this measure is to receive the consideration in committee that it should have, the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition must be carried. It should not be ruled out of order because the Government has a majority in this committee; it should be allowed to go on its merits. Half of the rulings dissented from are upheld, not because they are in conformity with the Standing Orders, but because there is a majority to uphold them. Sir HENRY GULLETT.:- I submit, sir, that your ruling is good. Further, I submit that if the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), and the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) were on this side of the House, in a position of ministerial responsibility, they would take precisely the same attitude towards an amendment of this kind as we' are taking. The amendment which the Chair has ruled out of order strikes deep. It goes down to fundamentals. It concerns the initiation of financial legislation, not merely the control of the public purse. Expressing it far more vividly, it aims to give to every member in this committee the right to increase the taxation of the people.",45
226,Mr CURTIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The right to move.,45
227,Sir HENRY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"GULLETT - No , the right to increase. What is the difference? The British parliamentary system is based on the curtailment of the power to tax the people and on the curbing of the unbridled disposition of those in authority to tax the people. That power has been narrowed down through the centuries, starting with the combat against King John and continuing through the reigns of King Edward III . and King Charles I . down to the present time. In the Parliament of today, it is narrowed down first to the party which comes to Parliament with the support of the majority of the electors behind it. It is then narrowed down again and handed to the leader, who has to form a government, and to that government which he forms and to the Ministers who are concerned in observing, amongst other things, loyalty to the Constitution.. This amendment slashes right across and violates the Constitution. It also violates the Standing Orders. It would reduce parliamentary government to chaos, and lead to reckless' and irresponsible taxation. It has been submitted merely as a stone-walling trick.",45
228,Mr BEENNAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I submit that an honourable member may not challenge the honesty, and sincerity of any other honourable member. As one who supported the amendment I object to the impeachment of my honour, and to a suggestion that I have not been sincere in the statements that I have made.",46
229,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I ask the honourable member for Henty to withdraw the remark to which objection has been taken.,46
230,Sir HENKY GULLETT,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I withdraw it. I shall describe the amendment as purely a time-wasting device.,46
231,Mr MAKIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I submit that the honourable gentleman is not in order in stating that the amendment was proposed Will a view to wasting time.,46
232,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The remark heard by the Chair was not unparliamentary.,46
233,Mr CURTIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"On a point of order, I submit that my amendment was a proper one for consideration by this chamber, otherwise the Chair Would have ruled it out of order. But the Chair, having alloAved it to be discussed, should not permit any honourable member to describe it as a time-wasting deA'ice. If the honourable member for Henty is upheld in his reflection upon me, I shall be grievously disappointed.",46
234,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The Chair repeats that the remark was not unparliamentary.,46
235,Mr CURTIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,It is outrageous!,46
236,Mr MAKIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The only Chairman who would .think so!,46
237,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I call upon the honourable member for Hindmarsh to withdraAv that reflection upon the Chair.,46
238,Mr MAKIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Althoug h I disagree with your ruling, Mr Chairman, I Avithdraw my remark.",46
239,Sir HENKY GULLETT,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Whateve r the motive behind this amendment may be, it comes strangely from the Leader of the Opposition, because, if he Avere carrying ministerial responsibility, he Would, Will his deep knowledge of the Constitution, and his respect for this Parliament, be the first to repudiate an amendment of this kind.",46
240,Mr FORDE,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"After hearing the unreasonable statements by the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett), I strongly support the reasonable amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for Henty tries, at times, to make us believe that he takss an independent stand, but he evidently attended the caucus meeting of the Government parties this morning, when honourable members opposite were Avhipped into line. The Treasurer has moved that it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of amendments to be moved by him in a bill for an act to provide for insurance against certain contingencies affecting employees, and the wives, children, widoAvs and orphans of employees, and for other purposes. Surely the Leader of the Opposition, having - listened tp numerous speeches by members opposite, Avho said that they felt certain that the Government would give every opportunity for consideration in committee",46
241,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The honourable member must confine his remarks to reasons for disagreement Will the Chairman's ruling.,46
242,Mr FORDE,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The Leader of the Opposition submitted the amendment that, after the word "" Treasurer"", the Avords "" and other members "" be inserted. That Avas to give other members the right to submit amendments to the bill, but you, sir, ruled the amendment out of order on the ground that it Avas beyond the scope of the Administrator's recommendation. I say, with great reluctance, Mr Chairman, that that was one of the worse rulings I have ever heard you give. I make that statement with very.great respect, and without wishing to cast any reflection on the Chair. Surely the Leader of the Opposition has the right to submit an amendment to enable honourable members generally to have the same freedom as the Treasurer is to have in submitting amendments for the consideration of the committee. It is mere balderdash to say that the amendment would give to honourable members the right to increase taxation. I dot not believe that the honourable member for Henty seriously holds that view. The Parliament alone can impose taxes. Without a majority in the Parliament in favour of an increase of taxes, the increase cannot be imposed. Why should not any honourable member he permitted to move an amendment to give effect to views expressed by him in the debate on the second reading of the bill. I submit, Mr Chairman, that your ruling infringes the rights of honourable members, and I hope that, even at this la to hour, you will overlook any criticism that has come from members of the Opposition, and re-consider your decision. If honourable members are to be prevented from exercising their right to submit amendments, we shall be wasting the time of Parliament by discussing this measure in committee. I have never had previous experience of a bill which has aroused such wide interest as this has. I have a vivid recollection of a vote last Thursday in which five or six members crossed over from the Government side and voted with the Opposition.",46
243,The CHAIBMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The importance of this bill has nothing to do' with the motion before the Chair.,47
244,Mr FORDE,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"But its importance makes us take your ruling all the more seriously. Certainly the ruling will enable Government supporters to escape from an awkward situation, because it will stifle cussion and allow honourable members opposite to avoid giving effect to views expressed in their second-reading speeches. The Opposition is strongly opposed to your ruling, ibecause it was told that in committee every opportunity would be given to members to liberalize the measure. The Government is now going back on its promise in this regard.",47
245,Mr NAIRN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The only question which should be discussed at this stage is whether the Chairman's ruling should be upheld. The Administrator has recommended that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of amendments to be moved by the Treasurer, and the Leader of the Opposition has submitted an amendment which, if agreed to, would enable amendments to be moved by private members also. This would clearly extend the scope of the message from the Administrator. Section 56 of the Constitution stipulates that no measure for the appropriation of revenue shall be passed unless the appropriation has, in the same session, been recommended by the Governor General. If an attempt were made to impose a charge not recommended by the Administrator, there would be a clear breach of the Constitution. The control of the national purse is in the hands of the Government, and that control cannot corstitutionally be taken from it. Standing Orders Nos. 171 and 232 prohibit private members from submitting measures which would increase the burden on the people. The position is beyond doubt. I support your ruling, Mr Chairman.",47
246,Mr BAKEK,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The more consideration one gives to this matter, the more one is convinced that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) was right in moving his amendment. But had I any doubt on the subject, the speech of the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) would have dispelled it. It is common knowledge, even among school children, that by a process of evolution, power - has been taken from the Crown and given to the Parliament. The carrying of the amendment would not give to any Minister the power to increase taxes; it would only authorize him to move amendments which would have that effect, only if a majority of members were in disfavour of it. Among the many anomalies in our Standing Orders is the right of the Chairman to remain in the Chair when his ruling is in question, and to rule out of order any argument which he decides conflicts with the Standing Orders.",47
247,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Order ! The Standing Orders, not the Chairman, determine these things.",47
248,Mr BAKER,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I realise, Mr Chairman, that you must carry out the Standing Orders. It has been argued that your ruling is in accordance with the Constitution, but I maintain that it is not the province of the Chairman of Committees to decide that point. If it were so, at an earlier stage in the discussion of this bill the Chair would have been called upon to decide whether or not the measure was constitutional. I remind the Committee that, in addition to honourable members on this side of the chamber, the legal luminary on the other side has expressed doubt as to the constitutionality of the bill. The Treasurer (Mr Casey) has concentrated largely upon Standing Order 247, but I point out that that Standing Order applies only to the Committee of ""Ways and Means and the Committee of Supply. As it has nothing to do with the ordinary Committee of the whole House it does not apply at this juncture.",47
249,Mr JOHN LAWSON,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,What about Standing Order 171? ,47
250,Mr BAKER,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"That has nothing to do with the point at issue. The message from His Excellency does not mention any sum of money, and, in the circumstances, I cannot see how it can .bp said that the amendment would increase the appropriation. It is impossible to increase an unnamed amount. I suggest, that you, sir, reconsider your ruling in the light of the convincing arguments that have been put forward. The Government should not take a paltry political advantage of members, including many of its own supporters.",48
251,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"On an occasion like this, it is well to go back to time when members of the party now in Opposition occupied the Treasury Bench for a short period. A study of the discussions in Parliament at that time will show that the Chairman's ruling was challenged on several occasions. One instance occurred during the discussion on a bill dealing with a bounty on wheat. A member of the party to which I belong moved an amendment which would have had the effect of paying a little extra to the poor, down-trodden wheat-farmers of this country. It was, however, ruled out of order.",48
252,Mr JAMES,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"""Who was Chairman of Committees?",48
253,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The then member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH). The proposed amendment was ruled out of order on the ground that it would, increase the appropriation of money required under the bill. On the same page of Votes and Proceedings it is recorded that Mr Latham moved "" That the chairman do report progress and ask leave to sit again "". That sounds a simple motion, but the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), who at that time was doing his best to act up to the responsibilities of Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, took strong exception to a member of the Opposition attempting to take the business out of the hands of the Government. The honourable member was so grievously concerned that Mr Latham should exercise the rights of a private member, that he voted against him in the division which subsequently took place. On another occasion the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, introduced a bill to provide for the payment of a bounty on the production of crude shale oil. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) proposed that the words "" crude shale o i l "" be omitted with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the word "" gold "". On that occasion also, the amendment was ruled out of order, the reason given being that it would alter the purpose for which the Governor General had recommended the appropriation.",48
254,Mr JAMES,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I rise to a point of order. When honourable members on this side endeavoured to quote from the parliathe mentary debates, you, sir, immediately stopped them.",48
255,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Order ! The honourable member has not raised a point of order. Mr .ARCHIE CAMERON - The Votes and Proceedings for that period will show that when honourable members of the party opposite were conducting the affairs of the country they objected to private members attempting to increase the appropriation, or to add to the burden of the taxpayers. Perhaps it was because they excelled at piling up taxes that they did not want any one to assist them. When - in office, the Labour party objected to members of the Opposition exercising the rights of private members to decide which of two industries-crud e shale oil, which is not prominent in this country, or goldmining, which is prominent-shoul d lie assisted by this Parliament'.",48
256,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The Acting Minister must confine his remarks to the subject before the Chair.,48
257,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I realise that these references are unpalatable to honourable members opposite. If the Opposition knows anything at all of the Standing Orders of this Parliament, it knows that no chairman would rule that any private member could move an amendment which would increase the burden of taxation to be borne by the people. The case of the Opposition falls down for another reason. I cannot remember having ever read of a proposal by a member of the Opposition that a message from the representative of the Crown should be changed by a vote of the Parliament. Undoubtedly, Parliament bas the right to turn out of office the Government reAnthony, H . L . sponsible for such a message, but it has Cameron, Archie no right to change the message itself. Casey, The right to turn out the Government Fadden, A. W. exists, but the present Opposition has Fairbairn, J. V. not the numbers to exercise it. The only Francis, J. consolation that its members have is that Harrison, they can go home to-night and sleep Hawker, C. A. S. peacefully, knowing that they will not Holt, H . E. be called upon tomorrow to accepj the Hutchinson, W. J. responsibility of governing the country. Jennings, There is no necessity to discuss this subLane, A. ject at length, because honourable members Lawson, John on all sides of the House realise that the Lyons, J. A. ruling of the Chairman is correct. Even if all the previous rulings that you, Mr. Chairman, gave were wrong, they would Scullin,' J. H . be atoned for by the rectitude of this Maloney, Dr ruling.",48
258,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Order !,49
259,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I have only to affirmative. say that honourable gentlemen on the other side, who at one time attempted to adopted. remove the chairman from the Chair, are ill-advised",49

262,Mr CURTIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Fremantle) [9.22] The Treasurer (Mr Casey) has circufour amendments which he proto move to the - definitions clause. I suggest with great respect that the clause be postponed until after consideration of the other clauses. The definitions can then be dealt with in the light of alterations that may have been made in . other clauses. If the definitions clause be passed now, amendments may be made. in other clauses that will necessitate the 27 34 recommittal of this clause.",49
263,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Corio-Treasurer ) [9.25] - Fro m the Government's point of view, I see no great objection, to adopting the honourable gentleman's suggestion, except the obvious one, that the committee,, when considering the other clauses, will not have adopted any interpretation of the terms used. That, perhaps, is no great disability. The definitions are all formal explanations of what the Government means by what may be called the shorthand expressions used throughout the bill. The Government has four amendments to propose to the clause, but they are only interpretative and qualifying. I agree to the postponement of the clause, and I ask honourable members to be good enough to refer back to it for the information it contains. Terms are used in the bill that do not explain themselves, such as "" contribution year "" and "" employee contributors "". 'Clause postponed. Clauses 5 and 6 agreed to. Clause 7Each commissioner shall be' .paid such remuneration as the Governor General from time to time determines.",49
264,Mr CURTIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Fremantle) [9.29] - It is quite reasonable that the Governor General should determine the remuneration of each of the commissioners, but I submit that at this stage the Treasurer ought to indicate approximately how much it is intended to pay. do not know whether it is intended to pay the commissioners £1,000, £2,000, or £5,000 a year each. ""We ought to have some iudication of the contemplated liability.",50
265,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Corio-Treasurer ) [9.30] - The three commissioners have been tentatively appointed to certain positions pending the passage of the bill. Each will be paid a different amount. In respect of the second and third commissioners, at any rate, no determination has been made as to their salaries. The practice of the Government is to consult the Public Service Board on such matters, and unless there is any good reason to the contrary- I do not think there will be-to accept its advice. Until this measure becomes law, the Government will be unable to give the information required by the honourable member.",50
266,Mr CURTIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Fremantle) [9.31] I am entirely dissatisfied Will the explanation of the Treasurer. The contributions which are to be paid by the employers and employees, and the approximate amounts which the Government itself will contribute to this fund, are specified in various clauses of the bill, but no indication of how much the commissioners are to be paid is given. I have no desire to limit the clause, but it appears to me that the committee should have some information regarding the remunerations that it is intended to give to each of the commissioners. The Treasurer (Mr Casey) has said that no decision regarding the payments to the second and third commissioners has been reached. Apparently he has some figure in mind for the chief commissioner. At this stage, I think that we should limit the liability of the Treasury in this connection, more particularly as the Treasurer refuses to give us any indication at all of the sums to be paid. Will the chief commissioner be paid as much as the Commonwealth Director of Posts and Telegraphs, or the Secretary to the Treasury ?",50
267,Sir HENKY GULLETT,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Has not the chairman's salary already been fixed? i Mr. Curtin - I do not know. I asked to be informed of the approximate amounts which it is intended shall be paid to the three commissioners. I Mr Casey - The sum to provide for the salaries of the three commissioners is approximately £4,800.",50
268,Mr CURTIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I am satisfied.,50
269,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,T-DO I understand the Treasurer to state that three persons have been tentatively selected as commissioners ?,50
270,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The Government; of course, cannot make appointments until the bill is laAv, but the tentative appointees are Mr Bridgen, Chairman; Mr. MCVey, Second Commissioner; and Mr. Green, Third Commissioner. Their total salaries Avill amount to approximately £4,800. Clause agreed to. Clauses 8 to 16 agreed to. Clause 17Subject to this act, all employed persons (not being aboriginal natives of Australia or of the islands of the Pacific) who have attained the age of sixteen years, and have not attained the maximum age, shall be insured under and in accordance with this act as employed contributors.",50
271,Mr HAWKER,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Wakefield) [9.37] I move That the words "" aboriginal natives of Australia or"" be omitted. I wish to direct the attention of the committee to the exclusion by this clause of aboriginal natives of Australia from participation in the benefits of the legislation. I notice that natives of the Pacific Islands also are to he excluded, but I am not personally well acquainted with the conditions under which they are employed in Australia and, therefore, I do not propose to suggest any action with regard to them. It appears to me to be a very great injustice that legislation which proposes to confer the benefits of a national insurance scheme upon all aliens, irrespective of their age on arrival in Australia, or of their country of birth, should exclude Australian aborigines, regardless of the conditions under which they may live or of what educational qualifications they may have attained. I am aware that under the invalid and old age pensions act, and maternity allowance legislation, persons of mixed blood, in whom the white blood predominates, are treated as Australian citizens. I am also aware, from experience, that in cases where the aboriginal bloo.d predominates, persons of mixed blood are treated as if they had no right to Commonwealth social services at all. I know personally of an aboriginal native who was employed in a position of trust at a wheat stack as a buyer for one of the great wheat-buying firms. He was living as an Australian citizen, and was trustworthy, efficient, and sensible in the way in which he handled his own property; yet his wife was excluded, by a provision apparently similar to this, from obtaining a maternity allowance. I know of another man in whom aboriginal blood predominates, who is in charge of livestock, water improvements, and other valuable property on a station in which I am personally interested. Under the State law, that man is entitled to a vote-the State law does recognize him as a human being-but under the federal law, as it stands today, he would not be entitled to an invalid or old-age pension, nor will he be eligible to insure under this hill. That state of affairs con-' stitutes a very grave injustice which, I am sure, every member of this committee, including the Treasurer, desires to have removed. Only recently there was a discussion about the provision of more adequate representation for Australian aborigines in the government of the country. I have been led to believe, mainly by newspaper reports, that the Treasurer himself said that the Government was contemplating giving to educated aborigines, and aborigines with other suitable qualifications, full rights of Mr JIanoker. citizenship. I suggest that this is a proper occasion on which to make a beginning with such a policy. I fully realise that the great majority of Australian aborigines live under conditions in which the social services provided for white citizens would be of no value to them, and that upon them such social services would even have a demoralizing influence, but such cases can be provided for under the schedule of exemptions. If the provision for the total exclusion of aborigines', just because they are aborigines, be removed from this clause of the bill, I shall certainly vote for an amendment to the schedule to empower the Protector of Aborigines to exempt from the operations of this legislation aborigines working on stations in the bush, and in other places where they are still living under semi-tribal conditions, and where civilized social services, instead of .being of value to them, might actually be detrimental. The fate of the original inhabitants of Australia is a tragedy which Australian people find most difficult to justify. There are all sorts of physical difficulties to be considered in meeting the needs for protection and medical attention which stone-age people require when they are brought into contact with modern civilization. The fact that, up to the present, the problem of doing justice to the aborigines has not met with a satisfactory solution, is not due to any want of goodwill on the part of Australians. It is due to physical causes, but the perpetuation of distinctions of this kind tends to give to Australia a far worse name than it deserves. The attitude of our people in grappling with the very difficult, concrete problems with which they are faced, is one of sincerity and good intention. If my amendment is not in order, I appeal to the Treasurer to include in this legislation the natives of the Pacific islands and Australian aborigines who are not specially exempted by the commission.",50
272,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"It appears that the proposed amendment seeks to include another class of contributors; if that is so, it is out of order.",51
273,Mr LAZZARINI,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I desire to know definitely whether the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Wakefield was ruled out of order on the ground that it would includeother persons in the scheme and therefore increase the appropriation.,51
274,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I have indicated to the committee that in my opinion the effect of the amendment would he to increase the number of contributors to the scheme, but I wish to hear the Treasurer on the point.",52
275,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Corio-Treasurer ) [9.46] - The Government has considered the subject raised by the honourable member for Wakefield, and, with the honourable member's permission, I shall move an amendment more far-reaching in character than the one submitted by him. I now move That the words "" (not being aboriginal natives of Australia or of the Islands of the perhaps, a plug of tobacco. I'acifiu) "" be omitted. The Government is impressed by the arguments of the honourable member for Wakefield in respect of certain individuals amongst the aboriginal inhabitants of the Commonwealth and of the islands of the Pacific. My amendment, if carried, will render necessary an amendment of the first schedule. It is not considered desirable that all aboriginal natives of Australia or all Pacific islanders resident in Australia shall be compulsorily brought under the provisions of the bill. My amendment, therefore, will exempt certain individuals.",52
276,Mr LAZZARINI,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,It will exempt the squatters who are exploiting the Australian aborigines.,52
277,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"It is intended that the commission, after consultation with the Protector of Aborigines or some other competent authority, shall have power to exclude certain of those persons to whom this scheme would be clearly inapplicable.",52
278,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The Chair rules that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wakefield is out of order.,52
279,Mr LAZZARINI,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,On what ground?,52
280,The CHAIRMAN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,On the ground that it would increase the contributions and therefore the amount of appropriation. It is not competent for a private member to submit an amendment having tHcit effect.,52
281,Mr LAZZARINI,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Werriwa) [9.55] The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker)., whose amendment has [«7] just been ruled out of order, has told us that his desire is to include in the scheme Australian aboriginal natives and natives of the islands of the Pacific. The Treasurer (Mr Casey), who has moved an amendment in similar terms, has stated that the first schedulo will' have to be amended in order to give the commission power to exempt certain persons. In principle, this may be all right, but I protest against the possibility of the "" squatocracy "" of this country-thos e employers who have been exploiting the aboriginal natives for so many yearsbeing exempted. For a great number of years they have sweated the unfortunate aborigines, who have had to work on stations for a few shillings a week and, If the Treasurer's amendment means that this class of employer will be exempted, it will confer no benefiton the majority of the employed aborigines. If , however, it will include in the scheme all those aboriginal natives and Pacific islanders who are working on outback wool stations, I commend the honourable member for Wakefield, and I shall support the amendment. Should the purpose of the later amendment to be submitted by the Treasurer be the exemption of those employers who are exploiting Australian aboriginal natives on wool stations, or employers who are sweating Pacific island natives on plantations, I hope that the honourable member for Wakefield will insist upou reasonable safeguards being inserted to protect those unfortunate people.",52
282,Mr HARRISON,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Wentworth) [9.58]. - I congratulate the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker) upon having submitted the amendment which the Treasurer (Mr Casey) has adopted and moved, in wider terms, as a Government amendment. It establishes a very desirable precedent in our legislation. I have a lively recollection of protests that Australian aborigines were overlooked in earlier legislation and, in common with the honourable member for Wakefield, I have had brought to my notice several glaring anomalies which should be rectified. Aborigines who served overseas with the Australian Imperial Force have been denied benefits under the Repatriation Act, and in some instances their wives have - been unable to get the maternity allowance. I agree that it is advisable that there should be some recognition of the Australian aboriginal, and that he should be given the right, if he is employed, ticipate in the benefits of national insurance. I commend the proposal that the commission to be set up under this bill should be guided, in deciding as to whether aborigines shall or shall not be exempted, by the recommendation of the Protector of Aborigines. Those who have knowledge of the conditions obtaining on big stations which employ aborigines as cattle men, are aware that it is characteristic of the natives to go periodically on ""walkabout."" Honourable members know full well that although an aboriginal may be employed for a certain period of the year there is an irresistible urge for him to go back to the tribe. When he does go back there is always the risk that he may suffer in a tribal war some hurt that will cause him to claim the benefits of this legislation. My opinion is that it is advisable that the Protector of Aborigines should be the arbitrator .to decide whether the disability was brought about naturally or in the pursuit of his vocation and not by tribal warfare.",52
283,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Dalley) [10.1] - If this matter is to be discussed on its merits the Minister should postpone this until after the committee has discussed the first schedule in which the Treasurer proposes to insert power to exempt. information that we have had from the honourable gentleman is insufficient, and first schedule. before deciding whether the amendment should be carried or not, we should have some definite indication of the restriction; to be imposed on aborigines. The honorby able member for Wentworth (Mr any Harrison) advocated the disqualification from benefit of any native who suffered hurt, as the result of going on "" walkthose about "" and becoming involved in tribal warfare. I remind the honourable man that this bill, which he is obliged to support, entitles a white man to all beneprovided for. fits unconditionally. If he goes "" walkabout"" and gets into difficulties he is reference to half-castes. entitled not only to sick pay hut also to medical attention. What is good for the white man should be good for the black man. Once the aboriginal is brought within the scope of this measure he should receive exactly the same treatment aa is given to the white man. We should either bring the aborigines within the bill or to par- definitely exclude them.",53
284,Mr BLAIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The honourable member is on the wrong track.,53
285,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Blain) has been advocating in this Parliament for the last fortnight that v aborigines should be flogged; I do not agree with that. The honourable gentleman and I do not see eye to eye on most things. I consider that if the aborigines are to be brought within the scope of this bill they should be treated under precisely the same conditions as are the white people. The tax on their employer vrill be the same and the tax on themselves will be the same, and I suppose that the rate of benefits will be the same as will apply to whites. No restriction should be placed on an aboriginal, if after being employed for a time, he decides to go away for a period. No provision is made for the exemption of white men who after working for a period either voluntarily or compulsorily leave their employment. I think that most honourable members agree with the principle of bringing rhe aborigines under the bill, but I think that we should vote on this question with our clause eyes open. Until we know what the Treasurer intends in respect of exemptions, we shall not be justified in recordThe ing our vote. I therefore move That the clause be postponed until after the",53
286,Mr BLAIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Northern Territory) [10.8] - I support the amendment moved the Treasurer (Mr Casey), not with desire to make political capital out of seeing how honourable members vote, but solely in order to see justice done to unfortunate persons who are classified as aborigines but aTe not aborigines; gentleI refer to half-castes.",53
287,Sir CHARLES MARR,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Half-caste s are,53
288,Mr BLAIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"The schedule makes no Half-castes object to being classified as aborigines, and are striving to have themselves removed from the Aborigines Act. Halfcastes in the Northern Territory feel that they should he treated on lines similar to those laid down in the Queensland act, which the Commonwealth Government is not careful enough to follow. I suggest that the Treasurer should obtain a definition of a half-caste.",53
289,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,No reference is made to half-castes in the bill. The greater includes the less. Half-castes will be included among the classes covered by this clause.,54
290,Mr BLAIN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I urge that the Treasurer make a distinction between the balf-castes and the aborigines and provide that aborigines should be exempt unless the Protector recommends otherwise.,54
291,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Bourke) [10.12]. - I am glad that the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) has moved the amendment in its present form. That is all that is before the committee at the moment; the limitations to be proposed will come before us at the very end of the bill. If we defer discussion on this clause, we shall defer decision on the status of all employed persons. I appeal to,the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) not to press his amendment.",54
292,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"My amendment does not interfere with the discussion. Mr BLACB3TJRN - This is the key clause, providing this general rule:. . . All employed persons . . . who have attained the age of sixteen years, and have not attained the maximum age, shall be insured . . . as employed contributors. If we postpone this clause, it will not be easy to proceed with consideration of the remainder of the bill. The amendment moved by the Treasurer will mean that all employed persons, whether they Ibe of British race, alien white race, aborigines, or Pacific islanders, shall come under the bill on an equal footing. The committee, at a much later stage, will have an opportunity to consider the exemptions which the Treasurer has suggested. The committee may not adopt the proposal that aboriginal natives of Australia or of the islands of the Pacific who .are employed persons shall be brought within the scope of the bill. I suggest that the proper thing for the committee to do is to examine the Treasurer's proposal on its merits. I am satisfied with it because it removes the unnatural and inhumane distinction between classes of workers in this country. I suggest that we carry this amendment; the proposed modification of it will come before us for consideration later. The clause, as it is proposed to be amended, should not be modified in any way, but, if any modification is inserted, it should be' under strict conditions, and exemption should be granted only on the recommendation of officers responsible for the welfare of the aboriginal. I assure the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain) that, if the Treasurer's amendment be carried, half castes will be brought within the scope of the bill. If they are to be specifically excluded, that will come iip for decision when the committee reaches the First Schedule. I suggest that the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) should not press for the postponement of the clause because, if it were postponed, there - would be difficulty in discussing other portions o.f the bill.",54
293,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Corio - Treasurer) [10.15] - The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) has anticipated some of the remarks which I-had intended to offer in reply to honourable members. I can give the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain) the assurance that any suggestions-which he is in a position to make by reason of his wide knowledge of the aboriginal and half-caste population of Northern Australia can be adequately and effectively dealt with at a later stage, when the first schedule is under consideration. This is the executive clause, under which all employed persons will be brought within the scope of the measure; but later, when the schedule is reached, the committee will have the opportunity to consider what persons may be excluded or exempted by the commission. I suggest to the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) that he should not press his amendment, because the points raised by him can be considered at a later stage.",54
294,Mr MARTENS,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Herbert) [10.16] I am glad that the Minister has agreed to the widening of the scope of this clause. Some aborigines are permanent employees and have fairly substantial bank balances; they are as much entitled to the protection of this Parliament as are any other employees, irrespective of nationality. The adult male aborigine who is a good worker receives at least £2 a week. The police officer in the district where he is employed sees that his wages are paid to his credit at the bank, and generally supervises his financial transactions. I hope that the Government will endeavour to ensure that the benefit of this legislation is never taken from the aborigines.",54
295,Mr FRANCIS,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Moreton) [10.17] I join in the general expressions of appreciation of the Government's action in this matter. ' The honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker) have taken a great interest in the welfare of the aborigines, and I am glad to have co-operated with them at all times. I appreciate the opportunity now presented to ensure to this section of the community the further protection which this bill provides. Before an aboriginal can c-ome under the scheme he must be a worker, and he must be employed. If ho is willing to contribute to the insurance fund, his employer, should also be ready to do so. The aboriginal contributor and his dependants should be entitled to all the benefits under this bill The State Protectors of Aborigines should be asked to advise the commission regarding the difficult' problem of dealing with the aboriginal and half-caste problem. It is important to know how many of the natives are likely to remain steadily at work. If the benefits of the scheme were extended only to those aborigines who earn reasonable wages and will seek continuity of employment, it would be of advantage to white employees on outback stations. If overseas owners of large stations knew that they had to pay contributions to national insurance in respect of white employees and not in respect of aborigines, they might try to give preference to the latter. I hope that the principle which the Treasurer (Mr Casey) has now accepted will Ibe adopted in connection with other measures of a similar character, and, where practicable, extended, because assistance to the aboriginal population has been too long delayed. I am glad that the party to which I belong has taken the lead in this matter.",55
296,Mr SCULLY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Gwydir) [10.20] - I am grateful to the Treasurer (Mr Casey; for the action he has taken in this matter. As one who has been associated with the Aborigines Protection Board in New South Wales for many years, I regard the amendment as a step in the right direction. Many of thoaborigines employed on mission stations are well educated, as school teachers are provided by the Education Department. In the western and north-western districts of New South Wales, many of the aborigines are highly intelligent, and are in permanent employment. Thsy are regarded as highly-skilled workers, and give entire satisfaction to their employers. Many of them are well able to discuss the problems of the day, and their rights should be fully recognized. Their exclusion, in the first place, from the benefits of this bill was a gratuitous insult to a section of the community to whom we owe more than many of us are willing to acknowledge. I . regret the slurs cast upon them from time to time regarding their habits of life. The secular education which they receive has an elevating influence upon them.",55
297,Mr ANTHONY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Richmond) [10.24]. - I am glad that the scope of the bill is to be widened to include every employed person, in Australia. The question as to the conditions under which aborigines or any other class shall be - enabled to participate in the scheme can be considered when the schedules are before us. I consider it entirely unnecessary to exclude natives of the islands of the Pacific from the benefits of this measure. The only Kanakas left in my district are very old and decrepit, and I do not know one who is fit to work. They are a negligible number, and I do not believe that half a dozen of them could qualify for inclusion in the insurance scheme.",55
298,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Are there no descendants?,55
299,Mr ANTHONY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I took that matter up with Professor Brigden. It would be a grave injustice to make any reference in the bill to their descendants,"" because the great majority of such persons are good workers. They are employed on the same basis as Australians, and they endeavour to live on a similar scale. It would be a rank injustice to exclude the descendants from the benefits of the measure.",55
300,Mr STACEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The amendment will include them.,56
301,Mr ANTHONY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Yes ; every employed person, irrespective of nationality, is to be included.",56
302,Mr CLARK,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Darling) [10.27] - I am pleased that the Government has yielded to the pressure brought to bear upon it. The aborigines arc not properly treated in respect of the maternity allowance aud the invalid and old-age pension, and we should not inflict another injustice upon them by preventing them from enjoying the benefits of this bill. All aborigines, whether full-blooded, halfcaste, quarter-caste or three-quartercaste, should be included, if they are earning their own living. Any foreigners who 'become naturalized Australians will be entitled to the benefits of this legislahas tion, if they are employed persons, and uo benefit available to another citizen should be denied to an aboriginal.",56
303,Mr DRAKEFORD,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Maribyrnong) |10.29] - There seems to be general agreement as to the desirability of the amendment proposed by the Treasurer, but it is important for honourable members to have some idea of what the Government has in mind. Very fe \ aborigines are employed in my electoral -, which is a metropolitan one, but a well educated aboriginal constituent of mine, the Aborigines Uplift Society in Victoria, and similar organizations which are interested in the native population, feav that distinctions may be made, even if this proposal be adopted. The Treasurer has stated that alterations or amendments will have to be made to tbt» schedule on page 55, but be should give the House more indication, of what it is he proposes to do. An injustice may be done by certain people who have aborigines in their employ. The amendment should commend itself to honourable members, because it will remove from this bill an injustice contained in other.legislation, such that relating to pensions. It is true, as honourable members have said, that we owe much to the aborigines of Australia, and we should cease to discriminate against them. Since the Treasurer has indicated the possibility of amendments, I cannot see why he should not give us some satisfaction by stating their nature.",56
304,Sir CHARLES MARK,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,That cannot be done in connection with this clause.,56
305,Mr DRAKEFORD,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"It is consequential to this clause and we should know definitely what is intended. Mr Casey.;- I gave an indication, but only in general terms.",56
306,Mr DRAKEFORD,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"There are many people interested in this subject, and they will require to be convinced that an injustice will not be done to the aborigines.",56
307,Mr CASEY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,The proposed amendments will be circulated well in advance.,56
308,Mr DRAKEFORD,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I am glad to have that assurance. We should know as soon as possible what is intended.  - I am pleased that the Treasurer (Mr. Casey), on behalf of the Government, seen fit to move an amendment which it was not competent for the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker) to move. Indeed, 'the Treasurer has gone a little further than the honourable member for Wakefield proposed. In certain parts of northern Australia there are men working on railway jobs who have in them sufficient aboriginal blood to have n.ade them ineligible to enjoy the benefits of this scheme had it not been for the amendment moved by the Treasurer. It removes what would have been a blot on this bill. Mr Rosevear fDalley) [10.33] - I cannot follow the reasoning of those honourable members who object to the postponement of this clause until after we know what the conditions are to be. I cannot see that the rights of any one will be prejudiced by postponing consideration until a later stage.  have the door open than to keep it closed.",56
309,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I want to know the condition? under which aborigines will he admitted or excluded. There is no need .to wait until the rest of the bill has been as dealt with to he informed of what is intended. Any conditions which the Treasurer (Mr Casey) desires to impose could be made provisos to this clause. If - the Treasurer's amendment be accepted, - clause 17 will readSubject to this act, all persons who have attained the age of sixteen years, and have not attained the maximum age, shall be insured under and in accordance with this act as employed contributors. That means that all persons over sixteen years of age are to be accepted as insured persons. ",56
310,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"All employed persons between the ages of 16 years and 65 years will be included in clause 17, but when we come to the first schedule we may find that it is intended to exclude certain classes of persons between those ages. We in this Parliament may know that in another portion of the bill there is a further provision dealing with aborigines, but there are thousands of employers and employees throughout Australia who will not know that. Clause 17 should indicate who are to be excluded for one reason or another. No person who would come under the bill would be in any way prejudiced by the postponement of the clause until we have dealt with the conditions governing admission to, and exclusion from, the scheme.",57
311,Mr SCHOLFIELD,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,That applies also to the wage limit.,57
312,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"I thank the honourable member for that interjection. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis) welcomed the amendment of the Treasurer, but his remarks indicated that only those aborigines who were getting reasonable wages should be brought under the scheme. I canot agree that all should not get reasonable wages. Discrimination along the lines suggested by the honourable member for Moreton may be in the mind of the Treasurer, and included in the amendment to be proposed to the first schedule. If that be the intention, I would rather see the aborigines excluded entirely from this legislation. That is one of my reasons for asking that this clause should be considered in the light of the exemptions to be made. I cannot see how the rights of any person can be prejudiced by postponement, but I can see the possibility of aborigines being better off if excluded from this legislation altogether than if included under unsatisfactory conditions.",57
313,Mr ANTHONY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,Does the honourable member want them to be in or out?,57
314,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,I want them to be in.,57
315,Mr ANTHONY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,They are now included.,57
316,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"They are not. An amendment has been moved, but I want to know what conditions will apply to them. If the conditions are as suggested by the honourable member for Moreton, the position will be unsatisfactory.",57
317,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Postponemen t is not a solution. Mr ROiSEVEAR - I think that it would be more satisfactory because it would enable the drafting of a sub-clause to clause 17 so that the whole provisions relating to aborigines would be confined to one clause instead of being set out in different places in the bill. I am not particularly concerned whether the amendment goes to a division or not. It is ridiculous to say in this clause that all employed persons over sixteen years of age are within the scope of the bill, and then to say later in the bill that some of them are outside it.  - I should not have risen a second time except for the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear), which I find difficult to understand. He says that the committee will put itself in a ridiculous position by just opening the door to all aboriginal employees, and afterwards excluding some of them. Exactly the same procedure is adopted with white employees. The bill says they may all come in as insured persons, but Part II . of the first schedule deals with excepted employment, and with those classes of white employees who will be excluded from the operation of the bill. The proposed procedure will not affect aborigines or those who are partly aboriginal differently from white employees. They are all allowed in by this clause and exceptions are made later in the bill. If the Treasurer (Mr Casey) had closed the door first and had given the committee an assurance that later he would open it to some extent, then I could understand the reasoning of the honourable member for Dalley. At present the door is wide open, and as He wants it open, he should be satisfied.",57
318,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATION AL HEALTHAN D,"Melbourne Ports) [10.43] - I wholeheartedly support the clause and for more than one reason. While I have criticism to offer on many provisions in 'the bill, I consider that this, clause embodies one of the . finest principles contained in any legislation in this country. I , and others, have approached the Treasurer (Mr Case^) and other Ministers with requests to remove from Australian democracy the blot which prevents some citizens from enjoying the benefits of social legislation. The clause removes one blot, and I regard it as one of the finest features of the bill. There was objection to it when it appeared to keep out aborigines, but the amendment puts them on the same footing as other persons. The clause will exclude many aborigines, hut it will not exclude some men that I know who are highly respected tradesmen, sportsmen, and broadcasters at Wesley Church, and other places. The suggestion of the Treasurer is excellent. J want to emphasize how pleased I am that the amendment will enable Chinese or other foreigners, of whatever nationality, creed, or caste, to share in the bene- received. fits that other citizens of Australia enjoy.

Is it a fact that the structure to be unveiled by His Majesty the Kin g at Villers .Bretonneux on the 1st July is not the Australian National War Memorial which the Government determined should primarily fulfil the following conditions, under which, in utmost good faith, some 30 architects competed, viz.:(a) Qualifications of competitors-This competition is limited to(i ) Australian architects or designers, resident in any country, who enlisted for service in the Great War with the sea or land forces of the British Empire; (i i ) Australian architects or designers, resident in any country, whose sons or daughters enlisted lor service in the Great War with the forces above-mentioned.

(c) Execution of the work-The granite, trachyte, stone, marble, or other work of Australian materials is to be executed in Australia under supervision by the selected architect complete and ready for transport ami erection in France. 2.

H. Why - v;is the successful Australian architect for the Australian National War Memorial lit Villers Bretonneux not given an opportunity to submit a modification of the scheme, either regarding design, material, or workmanship, to meet the altered taste of the (.Iovernment? 4.

Why were all Australian architects throughout the world, as well 'as Australian stone and allied Australian workmanship, excluded?",59
327,Mr LYONS,SUPERINTENDENT OE TELEGRAPHS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:I . Yes. 2. The Scullin Government in 1031 decided t(» abandon the proposal to construct n memorial on the lines originally intended. Tho varioxis steps which led to the decision are as follows:In 1020, the Commonwealth Government approved of the erection of a national memorial at Villers Bretonneux not to exceed £100,000 (inclusive of approximately £20,000 at the disposal of the Imperial War Graves Commission). In 1927, as the result of a competition limited to Australian architects and designers who had enlisted or whose sons or daughters had enlisted for service in the Great War, the design of Mr William Lucas, of Melbourne, was selected. After consultation with the Imperial War'Graves Commission, Mr Lucas completed his plans and these were then submitted to the Bureau of Fine Arts, Paris, whose approval was necessary before the work of construction could proceed. This approval was obtained in 1929, but, owing to the financial situation, construction was postponed and in 1931 the scheme was abandoned. Subsequently, the Imperial War Graves Commission drew attention to the fact that the constructional programme foi treating graves overseas of the fallen of the British Army had been completed aiul memorials to the missing (except at Vimy) erected, whilst the names of some 11,000 Australians missing on the Western Front had not been commemorated. The commission urged that action was necessary to proceed with the national memorial on which the missing were to be commemorated or, alternatively, to proceed with the memorial to the missing from the funds at their disposal for this purpose (approximately £20,000). In 1935, the Commonwealth Government asked the Imperial War Graves Commission to submit for approval a design for a memorial at Villers Bretonneux to commemorate the 11,000 missing and incorporating tablets indicating the names of places where the remaining 8,000 missing were commemorated. The total cost of the scheme was not to exceed '£30,000 (subsequently increased to £36,000). In February, 1930, the scheme submitted by the War Graves Commission was approved by the Commonwealth : Government and the commission was requested to proceed with the work. The design approved was prepared by the eminent British architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens. This architect had designed the entrance to the cemetery at Villers Bretonneux and, as this entrance also leads to the memorial site, it was appropriate that he should have been selected by the commission to design the memorial. . In view of the fact that most of the funds to be expended on the memorial have been provided by the Imperial'War Graves Commission, it was reasonable that the construction of the memorial should bo left in the hands of that body. 3..See ansvfer to question 2.
