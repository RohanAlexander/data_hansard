Employees weeks for some time because of the lack of availability and that the local Department of Immigration manager knew and passed that information on to the possibility of looming riots and escapes contended that hundreds of incident reports and, potentially, child abuse were lodged with even in part, it means that the Howard government fiasco in relation to the Woomera Deis no answer to these allegations for Minister we need a full and independent judicial inquiry, continues to fail to do so, the only conclusion If your record is clean and allegations are happy to have those allegations investigated into publicly clear your name.

Having started with that down Howard government should then call an inquiry. that the Australian Federal Police are investilast night, that is not true: the Australian about having an investigation. That is full and independent judicial inquiry for which allegations, Minister Ruddock dismissed them truth. As we stand here today, ACM remains in is that? That is because, even though the Howard Australia's detention centres and selected anACM five months ago, the Howard government Group 4.

Therefore, staffed, with all of the uncertainty many staff many are on sick leave as they have been working officers resigned from Villawood in one fortnight-that staff. Villawood currently has a high number staff.

I now seek to raise another matter that fundamentally On 12 March 2003, the Minister for Immigration announced that he had signed a memorandum in relation to immigration matters. Australia and Iran have agreed that their first priority triation of those Iranians currently in detention those who do not volunteer to On 2 May 2003, a letter was sent to Iranians package. The letter included the following and Iran: The agreement also allows for the involuntary standing protection applications.

In addition, a existence and terms of the memorandum of unIranian government. Labor believes that it is such an arrangement and then seek to keep its have nothing to fear. I call on Minister Rudto release the memorandum of understanding the memorandum deals with forced removals in a cruel strategy of pretending that it can about failing to put this agreement in the public have something to say about that. I am sure they consent should be sought. As a matter of course treaties entered into by the Australian govNA ernment are put before a relevant parliamentary their terms.

While it has been said that are nonetheless some concerns about what exthe concern is that people who decide that they shooting-either because some of the pistols that handed in and will be compensated for or because for accreditation-should be compensated no longer participate in the sport because of the I believe, good policy-to fully compensate NA them for getting right out of pistol shooting, still legal if you carry the right licences. That brings me to the second point. With who may be sent out of business. Consultations less than 10 dealers Australia wide, but nonetheless first port of call will clearly be the governments date the state governments have been fairly been very tardy-in admitting Another point is that ammunition for guns longer have any value in Australia. It makes Apart from anything else, we all know that weapons will still be circulating in the community, clearly find a home if it were not brought back It is important to recognise that, through black market. It is also significant to note that ticularly hand guns, relates to the tardiness South Wales-to deal with relevant issues. Hand in Victoria, for example, were going across New South Wales law, it is suggested that gested-just disappeared on to the black refused to take the hint when it was told this fused to change its laws. This avenue for people People could sell them into New South Wales. New South Wales they disappeared It is also important to keep some perspective hand guns have been strictly controlled in Australia ognise that, notwithstanding that, we still changes to the law. I now come to the question of how we might firearm regulation. In its annual report on Australian Institute of Criminology noted homicides during the period 2001-02. That point is that it was one registered hand gun. used. Of 48 offenders using a firearm to licensed to own a firearm-in other words, 10 and one offender actually used a firearm that one of the registered firearms used to commit rifles or double-barrel shotguns. The institute also made the point that licensed majority of firearm related homicides. In over the offenders were not licensed and the weapons market is thriving; the people who live on the ing 90 per cent of the offences. Not one hand was used by a licensed owner. even if that means getting rid of firearms that are the change in the law there will be some dealers with people involved suggest that it would be they will need to be compensated, and the of the states where those people operate. To tardy-certainly the Victorian government has that they have any responsibility. that are going to be prohibited clearly will no good sense for there to be compensation for that. many of these prohibited hand guns and other albeit illegally, and that ammunition would in. I think there is a very important point there. this legislation, we still are not dealing with the part of the problem with illegal firearms, parof some state governments-particularly New guns that were being taken out of circulation the border in parts and being reassembled. Under thousands of hand guns-about 8,000, it is sugmarket because the New South Wales government was going to happen. It refused to act and rewanting to get rid of these pistols was there. It was quite legal to do it in Victoria, but in and were no longer on the register. on this. One of the points to remember is that since 1926. It is equally important to rechave tragedies; that is why we have had these get some balance in this whole question of the National Homicide Monitoring Program, the that only one registered hand gun was used in was the year before the Monash incident. The It does not say that hand guns were not being commit homicide during 2001-02, only five were per cent. Only four used a registered firearm, was licensed and registered to the victim. Only a homicide was a pistol. The rest were rim-fire firearm owners are not responsible for the 90 per cent of the firearm related homicides, were not registered. In other words, the black other side of the law are the ones who are causgun used in a homicide between 1997 and 1999 NA I make that point because I want to compare faced lies from some of the people who claim nity. Let me give one example, the National Samantha Lee said on radio ‘that most of our censed shooters'. The facts from the Australian that that is patently false. It is an utter lie, away with it. Let me look at the work that has been done at an article called ‘Australia: a massive buy-back Mouzos. The statistics are quite interesting. dropped from about 40 per cent of all homicides words, over the last 20 years, there has been involved. I also want to refer to a chart about suicide, to the issue of firearms. While the level of fact, tragically, it has gone up a bit-the dropped. The level of people using firearms years ago. Another point that comes from the statistics that, if you look at the proportion of armed robberies firearm involvement has been dropping and knives is considerably greater than that of any gone from a little over 50 per cent to significantly armed robberies using a firearm has dropped those figures we can see that there has been 20 years-not just in the last few years-and A press release from the Institute In 2001-2002 there was a 25 per cent decrease Further on, amongst its findings, it says: Compared to previous years, a knife or some other type of weapon used to commit homicide (36%). of assaultive force (25%). I now come to a very interesting paper written sity of Vienna, Dr Franz Csaszar, in which today. I want to quote some of his concluding about getting the balance into this debate we we also have to look at what the effort of society and not just firearms crime. In his conclusions, esting points. He talks about getting a balance far with arms reduction we will be stimulating talks about the fact that there is that with what are nothing more than bareto be concerned about firearms in the commuCoalition for Gun Control. On 16 June last year, violent crime in Australia is committed by liInstitute of Criminology show quite clearly yet it seems that some people think they can get by the Australian Institute of Criminology and of low risk guns' by Peter Reuter and Jenny In the last 20 years, firearm homicides have to little more than 15 per cent.

The use of other weapon and is rising. In fact, knives have higher proportions while the number of by half. So by any measure, when we look at a steady drop in the use of firearms over the last that trend has been going on for some time. of Criminology dated 3 April says: in the use of firearms to commit homicide. sharp instrument was consistently the most common The next most common weapon/method was the use by a professor of criminology from the Univerhe goes into considerably more detail than I can remarks because I think when we are talking have got to remember that in getting that balance ought to be to deal with crime-armed crime Dr Csaszar comes up with some fairly interand about the risks of that, and that if we go too and enlarging an illegal black market. He also considerable evidence of that and says: NA Moreover there is sufficient evidence for the possibility a radical disarmament of legal gun owners, by giving tage. And he talks about what he means by ‘advantage' … a reduction in the number of guns available is harmful events. An example is provided That is reinforced by the statistics of the Australian talk about the costs and benefits given the scarcity and the difficulty of diverting ‘scarce resources makes another point which I think is quite significant: … every single new restriction on the way towards and reasonable, in total it will amount to a serious tenet that the law abiding has nothing to fear from dency to view the very people as basically suspect. fields than the issue of private gun ownership too, and democratic society of reasonable In the long term, there is a clear warning there gun control. Franz Csaszar is certainly not against we should be looking at the right balance. I very clearly. He says: In practice, the efficiency of gun control seems to from an ever faster succession of ever more restrictions sure. Very often it is obvious that a new provision when neglect in administering existing laws is hidden for before the latest law has even come into effect. The member for Dunkley spoke about one aspect points of view, I think it is quite a valid point. There is another point that I would like 1998 and some of the statistics that came from and adapted from the Attorney-General's Department. the long arms-there were nearly 660,000 firearms see that the proportion of buyback varied quite ple, in New South Wales, the number of guns 2400, or 2.4 per cent, and in Victoria This does beg the obvious question: is South Wales and Victoria? I would have to dispute cause Victoria and South Australia both had Victoria and South Australia had firearm registration yet New South Wales did not. While one can wonder whether in fact the number of now Wales is proportionately higher. If we look somewhere in between, Western Australia was Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate Leave granted. of increased criminal misuse of guns following violence-prone criminals an ever greater advanin the paper. Another conclusion he has is: of no measurable influence on the incidence of other by the occurrence of suicides ... Institute of Criminology.

This basis suffered in most cases enacted under severe media presis far off the mark of a real problem. For instance, behind the new laws or when a new law is called of that. If we look at it from a number of to touch on in terms of the buyback that we had in that-again from the Institute of Criminology When you look at the total buyback of collected at a cost of $360 million-you significantly from state to state.
