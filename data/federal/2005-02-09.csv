1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr David Hawker) took the chair at 9.00 a.m. and read prayers. NA INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) AMENDMENT (APPLICATION) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",17
2,Mr RUDDOCK,NATIONAL SECURITY,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Act 2004. It seeks to clarify how the act applies to certain federal criminal proceedings. In particular, the bill reinforces the appliintent cation of the act to proceedings that commenced prior to 11 January 2005-that is, the day on which the main provisions of the act commenced. This amendment will ensure that the act can be applied to a number of terrorism related proceedings that are currently under way, once the prosecutor gives the requisite notice to the court and defendant. It was not intended that, simply because a person had been charged and a bail hearing had occurred before the commencement of the act on 11 January 2005, the act could not be applied to the committal or trial of the person some months or years later. However, this amendment will not give the act any retrospective effect. Rather, it simply ensures that the act can apply to the future stages of a proceeding that began before 11 January 2005. It will not affect anything that occurred before the notice was given. The bill also seeks to clarify how the act applies to any proceeding (including a proceeding which began after the act commenced) in which the prosecutor gives the requisite notice to the court and defendant after the proceeding commenced. This amendment restates the intent of the act to require a prosecutor to give the requisite notice only once, after which time the act will apply to all subsequent parts of the proceeding. It will not be necessary for the prosecutor to give notice in each subsequent part of the proceeding. Without these two clarifications, it is possible that the act may be subject to misinterpretation. In turn, this may jeopardise the underlying of the act-to facilitate the prosecution of an offence without risk to national security or a defendant's right to a fair trial. For this reason, I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCClelland) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (EXTENDED NA UNION FEES) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Andrews, and read a first time. Second Reading",17
3,Mr ANDREWS,PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.04 a.m.)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Extended Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2004 was introduced into the 40th Parliament. The bill lapsed with the dissolution of the parliament. The government is reintroducing this bill in line with the continthat ued commitment to the elimination of bargaining fees in industrial agreements. This government's commitment to the principle of freedom of association is a cornerstone of a workplace relations framework that is providing for more productive and more prosperous workplaces. The Workplace Relations Act 1996 reflects the principle of freedom of association with broad legislative recognition of the freedom for employees to join, or not to join, an industrial association. This fundamental freedom is violated by union attempts to impose so-called ‘bargaining agent fees'. Bargaining agent fee clauses in agreements purport to impose an obligation to pay a fee on an employee who is not a member of a union for bargaining services that they did not request. This means non-union workers have to pay for union negotiations at their workplaces even though their concerns may not be represented at all. Effectively, bargaining agent fees act as backdoor compulsory unionism. They are contrary to the principles of freedom of association and should not be included in any form of industrial instrument. To halt the re-emergence of compulsory unionism in the federal sphere, the government introduced the Workplace Relations (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill, which was eventually passed through the Senate with support from the Australian Democrats. The Workplace Relations (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Act 2003 amended the Workplace Relations Act and prohibited compulsory union fees in federal certified agreements. The amendments expressly provided that a bargaining services fee clause in a federal agreement is void. They also provided that a bargaining services fee clause is an ‘objectionable provision' for the purposes of the Workplace Relations Act. This means an agreement should not be certified if it contains a bargaining services fee or, if an agreement has been certified, the bargaining services fee clause may be removed. The legislative change also addressed conduct designed to compel workers to pay such fees. The compulsory union fees act prohibits the making of false or misleading representations about a person's liability to pay a compulsory fee. This was necessary to prevent unions, or employers, from using other methods to create an impression that employees are legally obliged to pay compulsory union fees. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Act 2003 has been successful in addressing bargaining agents fee clauses in federal agreements with bargaining fee provisions removed from 10 certified agreements in January and February of 2004. A further 572 applications made by the Office of the Employment Advocate are currently being considered by the commission. However, as progress is made in the federal jurisdiction, a number of unions have sought to include such clauses in agreements made under state legislation. Recent cases in state jurisdictions have confirmed that bargaining agent fee clauses can be included in state agreements. As state governments appear unwilling to prohibit compulsory bargaining fees in their jurisdictions, it again falls to the Australian government to show leadership on the issue of protecting freedom of association rights. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Extended Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2005 will extend the prohibition on the inclusion of bargaining agents' fee clauses in agreements beyond agreements certified under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to also cover any state employment agreement to which a constitutional corporation is a party. I now turn to the main provisions of the bill. This bill will amend the freedom of association provisions to provide that a bargaining agent fee clause in a state employment agreement to which a constitutional corporation is a party is void. This will apply to agreements entered into on or after the commencement of the amendments made by this bill. The bill will also extend the prohibiits tion on conduct related to the payment of such fees to the widest constitutional extent possible to protect employees from coercion or misleading conduct about their liability to pay such a fee. To achieve these aims, the bill will: - amend the definition of bargaining services to include services provided by an industrial association in relation to a state employment agreement, and - provide that a provision of a state employment agreement to which a constitutional corporation is a party is void to the extent that it requires payment of a bargaining services fee. Australian law recognises that there is an important statutory role for registered organisations and the law confers upon them significant rights and obligations. But the legal standing of unions should not come at the expense of individual employers' and employees' right to freedom of association and protection from coercive or discriminatory conduct. Unions and employer associations are service providers and should rely on the competitiveness and value of the services they offer to attract members. Trade practices legislation prevents ordinary businesses from providing someone with an unrequested service and then demanding payment for it. The same principle should apply to unions and employer associations. The government has a strong, proven commitment to freedom of association and the right of employees to choose whether or not they join a union. Bargaining agent fees are compulsory unionism by stealth and should not be included in any form of industrial instrument. The reintroduction of this bill demonstrates the Australian government's ongoing commitment to upholding employees' freedom of association rights and willingness to act to protect those rights. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCClelland) adjourned. NA INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 December 2004, on motion by Mr Abbott: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Ms Gillard moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “while not declining to give the bill a second reading, this Parliament condemns the Government for failing to: (1) ensure that private health insurance provides real choice in health care; (2) ensure that private health insurance delivers real value for money; (3) adequately address the health care needs of all older Australians; and (4) provide modelling and data about the impact of the provisions of this bill on the cost of private health insurance for all Australians, thus necessitating the referral of this bill to a Senate committee”.",17
4,Mr ADAMS,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"The Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004 is another in a series of bills by which the federal government is attempting to change Medicare. It amends the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998 and also the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. There was an election commitment made by the coalition to increase the private health insurance rebate from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 years and to 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and above. These rebates would be available on both hospital and ancillary cover. The higher rebates will apply to individuals who meet the age threshold and couples or families where one or more of the persons meets the age threshold. The bill makes provision for what should happen in the event of the death of an insurance holder or a family member, or divorce or separation. The problem is that premiums are still rising. It is no good having a system of rebates when the cost of premiums continues to rise. So all those people under 65 are virtually being told to give up their private health insurance because, in spite of the whole pile of policies supporting private health insurance, the 30 per cent rebate and lifetime cover, private health insurance premiums are on the rise. If you happen to be at the lower end of the income scale there is no way you will be able to afford the insurance and pay for all the other necessities of a working family. The Minister for Health and Ageing knows that these costs are increasing. He has not been prepared to admit it in the past and does not really seem to care; it is part of life or death, as the case may be. Although it will help older Australians, if we had a proper Medicare system which was available to all and which was developed in the way it was originally intended, there would be no need to have all these rebates. Health care would be available equally to all those who wished for additional benefits. There could have been the option of paying through private health insurance. Yet we have a government that is propping up the private health system and that is always putting its hand out for more. No matter what it is given, it seems that it has to have more. Wouldn't it be better to put the funds that are being used to subsidise private companies into our public health system to pay for more doctors, more nurses, more health infrastructure, more dialysis machines, more equipment to help cancer patients and more general health surveys? There are millions of different health issues that would benefit if those funds were used to pay for health infrastructure. It is only a matter of time before the advantage gained by raising private health insurance premiums will be overwhelmed by the dollar disadvantage caused by the rise. Back to square one. You hear this all the time from pensioners who have had a small amount attached to their aged pensions: ‘They give with one hand and take away with the other.' So in fact most pensioners and veterans are getting further and further behind in being able to afford the new Australian lifestyle. One of the biggest groups of people coming through my electorate office is of those older Australians who are sitting on waiting lists for elective surgery. It might be elective in the terms of the medical profession but it is not seen as elective for many who wait for cataract surgery or, in severe pain, for hip replacements. Then there are many who are suffering from macular degeneration. It is an insidious disease which affects central vision and can sometimes make it difficult to read, drive or perform other activities requiring fine, detailed vision. It eventually leads to complete loss of sight. The treatment for this disease costs thousands of dollars. It means the difference between an independent, reasonable quality of life in one's own home and dependence on a nursing home or a fullcare existence. Pensioners would go without the basic necessities to keep their independence and life quality, yet there is no assistance for this treatment within the public system and it is not, of course, offered under private insurance. The reality for most elderly Australians who face health emergencies is that they rely on the public health system through the emergency departments of public hospitals. Those are the places where the most up-todate and advanced equipment is available. Despite being covered by private insurance, the elderly end up being turned away from private hospitals because the facilities are not there and the hospitals just cannot deal with the crisis. At the other end of the argument, the more rebates there are for the elderly, the more those people who have the burden of providing the taxes to pay for the rebates will be charged. Judging by the comments that flow through my office, those people are not taking kindly to this and want to know how and when their bills might decrease. So, will more older Australians join private health funds if the rebates are a bit more generous? Has anyone done the figures on this? Of course they have not. Why are we, the taxpayers, giving these rebates when we do not know whether they will help the system work? Who has done the figures, and where are they? I think we deserve to have some answers. The Labor Party is planning to get those answers somehow. It proposes to get some economic modelling undertaken on this legislation through a Senate legislation committee in the hope that there will be some answers before this proposal goes into law. I agree with that. I think it is important we know how much the additional funding will change the equation. I have been trying to find some discussions on this issue and I have found that there have been quite a few journal articles recently that have taken up this topic. For instance, Stephen Duckett, Professor of Health Policy at La Trobe University, had a look at waiting times in hospitals. He tested the hypothesis that increased private activity in the health system is associated with reduced waiting times. As Tasmanians suffer some of the longest waiting times-and Professor Duckett confirms this in his paper-I was interested to see his findings. His conclusions are interesting. He finds that increased private sector activity is associated with increased public sector waiting times. He says his study does have some limitations; but, despite those, it suggests that policy makers should be cautious about pursuing policies based on expanding private access as a strategy for achieving reductions in public sector waiting times, and it correlates the findings of previous overseas studies. So those people on the additional rebate do not hold out any great hope of finding a shorter waiting list for public hospital treatment. Another study, done by Sundararajan, Brown and others, looked at the impact of private health insurance on the utilisation of public hospitals in Australia. The study suggests that the number of patients treated in Victorian public hospitals continues to grow, with the public hospitals also tending to treat patients with more severe diseases. In their discussion those who carried out the study found that it was ‘not uncommon for important changes in the health sector to have unpredictable effects'. The patterns they found in this study were predicted by several analysts. So when looking at the 30 per cent rebate they found that hospitals: ... continue to experience increases in the number of admitted patients as a consequence of many factors including increased efficiency, growing expectations, and demographic changes ... And that there would: ... continue to be considerable unmet need and therefore, if spare capacity emerged, it would quickly be filled by those who had been in waiting (whether on formal lists or not). The paper also quoted from other works which said: ... any shift to care provided under private ance, whether in private or public hospitals, cause a decline in the equity of care provision. The study also pointed out that although there is choice allowed under private health insurance for simple procedures or minor surgery, there is none when it comes to lifethreatening illnesses. The public hospitals take the emergencies. So if we are to see any change in quality of care and waiting lists in the public sector it will not come through beefing up the private sector; it will come through funding the public sector properly. I even looked at an article by Deb Richards in the Medical Observer Weekly entitled, ‘30% and rising-is the rebate really good policy?' She quotes a number of medicos who have been at the sharp end of financing private hospitals. Professor Harper argues that the rebate is a success because when private health insurance numbers went up the growth in public hospital expenditure stabilised. However, then Ms Richards quotes official data that shows growth in public hospital expenditures paused for a year and then continued to climb. Harper concludes that the rebate has saved the public purse much money. Not to be daunted, the reporter asks: If the private sector died, what would be the costs for the public hospitals to pick up the load? Interesting stuff. Professor Harper is quoted as finding that private hospitals perform $4.3 billion worth of procedures, when the costs of the rebate are $2.2 billion. The rebate is a ‘stitch in time'. The debate continues on both sides of the argument throughout the article. The OECD finding concluded that, in all the countries it has studied, private insurance provides greater choice and better access but is inflationary and leads to a two-tier system, which I believe this government is pushing this country towards. So there have been calls to subsidise private hospitals directly, insurrather than through the insurance funds, could which absorb 13 per cent in administrative fees and pay out about 30 per cent on auxiliaries for which there is no public offset. The general conclusion seems to be that the rebate distributes money the wrong way. It is not good health policy if you intend to get as many health services as you can for your dollar but part of those funds is being used to subsidise the activities of the private health insurance companies. All that being said, there is an argument for looking at how the financial models are working-or even whether they are working. The public has a right to know what the answers are, and also the differences between the government's and the opposition's approaches to finding the answers. None of this has been clear during the discussions on private health funds and how they are supposed to affect the overall funding of health care in Australia. We must know whether private health insurance really does provide real choices in health care, whether it delivers real value for money and whether it adequately addresses the health care needs of all older Australians. Therefore, this bill should go to a Senate committee in order to get some of the questions answered. Over the last three years, private health insurance premiums have risen on average by 22 per cent. As several members have said, an easier and better system might be to pay the dollars straight to the private hospitals and save some of the 13 per cent which it costs to run the private health insurance system. We need to look at the billions of dollars going into these rebates, which the government says is achieving something. Many believe that it is not and that we do not get enough for all the money that is being spent on these rebates and on what this bill does. I support the amendment.",20
5,Mr BALDWIN,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I rise to speak on the Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004. I am going to say something controversial here-it is a fact that Labor do not understand health policy. There is a myth in the community, probably perpetuated by the Labor spinners themselves, that Labor are the oracle when it comes to health. They believe they have all the answers to all the problems and that only they can have the solutions. I do not believe in their publicity the way they do, and I explain why. The New South Wales health system is proof that Labor has no idea about health policy or the management of hospitals. Waiting lists are blowing out and it can take years for an older person to get a hip replacement or a knee replacement. Doctors are resigning out of frustration with management or because they cannot get the funds to perform elective surgery. At least seven doctors have resigned from the public health system in my area over the past year. Three GPs resigned from the Polyclinic at Nelson Bay because of the shifts which forced them to work a full night and back up and see patients the next day. This sort of rostering went out with ether and masks. According to the Newcastle Herald of 25 September 2004, four gynaecologists resigned from the John Hunter Hospital due to a lack of funding for elective surgery. I am told by one of my constituents that a heart surgeon has also resigned from the public system and for that reason he cannot get his bypass operation. Labor has been in power in New South Wales one year longer than the Howard government has been in power, and the New South Wales health system is in an absolute shambles. While Labor has presided over the crumbling of the New South Wales health system, the Howard government has introduced a range of reforms to the health system to ensure the future of Medicare and the viability of holding private health insurance, including: the Medicare levy surcharge, the universal private health insurance rebate of 30 per cent and lifetime health cover, which encourages people to take out health insurance before they turn 30 and to keep it throughout their lives. The changes this bill will introduce will make private health cover more affordable right at the time it should be most affordable. shall What Labor does not understand is that we need the private sector to be sustainable to ensure that the public sector is not swamped. To date, the shadow health minister has not fully committed to the 30 per cent rebate as it currently stands. The day Labor recognises that families, singles and couples like the rebate and appreciate that it makes it easier to afford private health cover will be the day they come out and state categorically to the Australian people about private health cover: ‘We're keeping it.' Until that day, we have to assume that Labor does not understand that health cover has to be affordable for people to keep it. The rebates-30 per cent for all Australians, 35 per cent for those 65 years and over and 40 per cent for those 70 years and over-help make private health cover more affordable. When Medicare was first formed the percentage of Australians with private health insurance was around 65 per cent. When Labor established Medicare they did so on the assumption that some people would continue their private health insurance while others would need the universal free public system. Neal Blewett, the health minister who introduced the legislation to create Medicare, said at the time: Medicare provides only basic cover and they should look, if they want to do so, to the need private health insurance and its costs. I mentioned before that four visiting gynaecologist-obstetricians resigned from John Hunter Hospital in September. One of them was quoted as saying: When you come along needing a hysterectomy, bleeding half to death every month, and haven't the money to go into a private hospital, me, my next operating list is a month away. I think that if that statement says anything it is that there is a very real need for private health insurance to be affordable if the states cannot provide elective surgery. I also cannot believe that a hysterectomy is elective surgery. Former Labor cabinet minister Graham Richardson knew that keeping people in the private health system would relieve the pressures on the public system. In 1993 Senator Richardson, the then health minister, put the proposal to cabinet that high-income earners without private health insurance be given a higher Medicare surcharge. That was knocked back because-if can you believe the self-interest at play here-the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, did not want to pay it because he was a high-income earner himself. He was a self-declared person who avoided private health insurance. What was Labor's idea for easing the pressure on the public health system? It was Medicare Gold. Medicare Gold was a statement-nothing more. It was a statement of simplistic policy-making that tried to con the voters of Australia. It promised free health care for the over-75s. But they already have free health care in the public system. The other thing that they did not enunciate all that well was that Medicare Gold did not cover ancillaries such as physio, spectacles and dentistry. It did not give the over-75s choice of doctor or choice of health facility. It did not put in place one policy to create doctors, to ease the squeeze on hospitals or for to reduce waiting lists. It was like the Medicare teams idea. Labor would create teams of doctors, out of the many thousands that we do not have surplus at the moment, to visit areas where low rates of bulk-billing are evident. Again, this was a simplistic solution that did not go into depth or even attempt to understand what the work force problems are if you see in the health industry. Interestingly, it was the older voters who raised Labor's Medicare Gold policy with me, saying they did not think it could work. The first question they asked was: what about the ancillaries? What about the physio they would need after the hip replacement, or the new glasses they would need in five years time? Older people know what they need. It was a shame that Labor had never thought to ask older people what they needed. I had one or two of the more selfless in the community ask me: ‘Why do I deserve free health care over a young mother or a sick child?' Some commented that it had shades of Whitlam about it-uncosted, unfunded and unsustainable. The other flaw in Medicare Gold was that there are no public hospitals in either of the two centres which have the greatest proportion of older constituents in my electorate. Currently, my constituents have no access to state public hospital facilities. Under Medicare Gold they would still have had no access to public hospital facilities in their area. I noticed that none of the premiers supported the Labor plan. It was another case of announce first, consult later by the then opposition leader and his health spokeswoman. But the then opposition leader did ask the people. In a public meeting at Raymond Terrace at the beginning of the year, 200 people turned up to tell the former opposition leader what they thought, including one woman who asked what he was going to do to reduce hospital waiting lists. The former opposition leader, of course, did not have the answer then. His answer was to resign. Does the current opposition leader have any idea? I doubt it. Labor is a vacuum of new ideas and a policy black hole in our galaxy. There are two solutions to reducing waiting lists in the public system. The first is build more public hospitals and adequately staff them. In New South Wales, Labor continually closes wards, reduces staff and withdraws the money, particularly in regional areas like mine. The other solution is to provide incentives for people to go into private health insurance, to make that private health insurance system more affordable. As a person gets older, they are more susceptible to health problems and it is precisely as a person needs their health insurance more that we need to encourage them to maintain responsibility for their own health. This bill recognises that at 65 many Australians are not working anymore. That is precisely the time when they seek to make financial adjustments to how they live their lives. Effec- bill. tively, this will mean an increase in their rebate of about $100 to $200 per annum, and that sort of saving for a person on a limited income is not to be sneezed at. The Howard government also recognises that at 70 years of age a person is even more susceptible to health problems and may have further reduced income. Their private health insurance rebate will be increased to 40 per cent. To reduce complication only one person in a partnership needs to be over the eligible age to receive the additional rebate. Voters want choice. They want the option of going to a private hospital, getting their choice of doctor and not waiting for years for elective surgery. Two former Labor health ministers understood the need for a dual health system with a functional private system that would keep people out of the public system. But they are gone now. The current shadow health minister, who has never 100 per cent committed to the private health insurance rebate as it stands, does not understand that those who can pay should be encouraged to do so. For those who cannot pay there is a public systo tem that works and includes a safety net for out of hospital medical expenses, which Labor wanted to abolish. The time has come for politicians to put aside political interests and start to think about the health care of those in our community. If the state system will not build more hospitals, employ more doctors, open more beds or provide greater health services then it is incumbent on members of this House to provide the incentives that will allow our older Australians to contribute to private health insurance to reduce the waiting lists. I ask this question of all members: is it not the goal to provide better health services and to help reduce waiting lists? This bill in part goes a long way towards that. I support this",23
6,Ms GRIERSON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I am particularly pleased to have seconded the second reading amendment to the Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004 as proposed by the member for Lalor. These amendments condemn the government for not getting it right when it comes to balancing the service provision of the private health insurance sector with the public and private health systems and the health needs of older Australians. In fact, the legislation shows that the government continues to fail the Australian people when it comes to our health system. The Howard government, you recall, has not had a smooth record when it comes to managing its health responsibilities. After the dismal performance in the last term of former health minister Kay Patterson the government put their Mr Fixit, Minister Abbott, in charge. True to his style, we have been given the quick fix-the grab for money and the one-off vote-buying specials. What we have not been given is long-term solutions or health policy reform. As we watch our population age, our medical work force shrink, health care and medication costs escalate and levies and premiums continue to increase and we measure this against health gains for the many billions of dollars spent, everyone in Australia knows that they have a real stake in the government getting it right. But according to the Productivity Commission's draft research report Economic implications of an ageing Australia released in November last year, one-quarter of Australians will be aged 65 years or more by 2044, which is roughly double the present proportion. We know that across health services as a whole expenditure on the over-65s amounts to around four times more per person than that on those under 65, and then rises to between six and nine times more for the oldest groups in our population. As the population ages, health and aged care costs are projected to rise relative to GDP. In the absence of polthe icy responses, the fiscal gaps opened by ageing will sum to around seven percentage points of GDP by 2044, according to the report, with an accumulated value over the 40 years of around $2,200 billion. Actions to improve productivity and achieve more cost-effective service provision, especially in health care, are then of central importance. But on examination, this legislation does not measure up to the Productivity Commission's findings or respond to the economic implications for the health budget. The government's legislation puts into effect their election promise to increase the private health insurance rebate from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 and up to 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and over. If private insurance was the magic ingredient to delivering good health care, this legislation might work, but only for older Australians with enough money to buy private health insurance. The government believe that that is the way to fix the crisis in health care-get more people into private insurance, into private hospital beds, and therefore reduce the burden on our public health system. They also claim the more people who have private insurance, the lower the premiums will become. But we know that that is not how it has worked in their term of office. Professor Stephen Duckett's study ‘Private care and public waiting', published in the Australian Health Review this month, adds weight to criticisms of the Howard government's $2.5 billion annual subsidy to the private health insurance industry. This is the first Australian study to test if that 30 per cent existing private health insurance rebate is delivering for the Australian people. The study found that the government's private health insurance rebate has actually increased waiting times for treatment in public hospitals. When the Howard government introduced 30 per cent rebate, it argued that it would take the pressure off the public health system. However, this study directly contradicts the government's claim and backs up evidence from Britain and Canada that a higher take-up of private health insurance is associated with longer public waiting lists. In my electorate we know a little bit about that, as it affects us all personally. We are talking about family members and we are talking about neighbours and friends who await surgery at an age when damage can become quite chronic. Professor Duckett found that a one per cent increase in the private sector proportion of funding translates into a 46-day additional wait for public patients. Contrary to claims by the AMA and Tony Abbott, Professor Duckett is not advocating that the rebate be scrapped, but rather argues the point that, if you want to take the pressure off the public sector, you need to invest in the public health sector. Unfortunately, this government's reluctance to scrutinise the impact of private health insurance rebates on the health budget and on the public delivery of health services makes any sensible debate or informed expenditure of taxpayer funds very difficult, if not impossible. This government have tried every way it can think of to get Australians to take out private health insurance, without looking at the cost-benefits to health service delivery. They introduced the Medicare levy surcharge and lifetime health cover-measures that penalised people for failing to health insurance early in their lives. At one stage, in 2000, the take-up of private health insurance increased to a high of 45.7 per cent of our population. But since then private health insurance members seem to have discovered there just was not enough benefit for what they paid, and now the take-up has reduced to 43 per cent and is dropping. Given that over the past five years private health insurance premiums have risen by 33 per cent, about 10 per cent a year-and, dramatically, a 22 per cent increase in premiums over the past three years-it is not surprising that many people have chosen to opt out. Apparently the government thinks they need to do more to get people into private health insurance and have offered the over 65 age group some extra incentives. Research undertaken by ACOSS showed that 84 per cent of people over 65 with an income greater than $100,000 per annum do have private health insurance. But they also found that of those with incomes less than $20,000 per annum only 23 per cent choose private health insurance. The benefit of the legislation before us will flow to those who can already afford to pay for health care costs rather than to those whose health needs are greatest. But that is the government's standard process of policy selection-survival of the wealthiest. In the health domain, one would have hoped policy would be very much linked to health needs. It is unlikely that over-65-year-olds will flock to join private health insurance to gain this additional rebate, particularly given it is only between $2 or $4 a week, and more unlikely if they are joining for the first time and they are aged between 65 and 70. Under the terms of lifetime health cover, they will be paying a lot more than the premium base rate, even with this additional rebate. I quote an elderly couple from my electorate to illustake up private trate this point: Last year we applied to re-join a medical fund ... only to be told the % increase in the fees (2% for every year of age) made the cost prohibitive. We are age pensioners. All my working life we were in a fund ... but this does not count against the yearly ... increases in the fees. Even for those who are already in private health insurance, how long will it be before premium increases erode away that $2 to $4 a week handout? Not long, if precedent can be relied upon. Of course, private health insurance companies are looking for at least a 12 per cent increase in their premiums, and we will know the outcome of their bid very shortly. I quote from another of my constituents, who says: I am concerned about the increase in private health insurance. Despite the Federal government urging the public to take up private health insurance and assuring us that premiums would not rise-after 3 years they have increased beyond affordability. But even if older Australians do join up what will be the long-term consequence of that action? Given that currently over-65s make up 12 per cent of private health insurance membership but constitute 44 per cent of hospital benefits paid out by private health insurers, it may be anticipated that all those members who are under 65 may have to pay even higher premiums to absorb the extra costs to the private health industry. That is not fair and it is not sensible. So what is the real picture for private health insurance for older Australians? Just over a year ago, I surveyed my electorate about private health insurance and Medicare. A staggering 1,071 Novocastrians completed the survey and, at their own cost and inconvenience, sent their responses to me. Of those, 53.4 per cent said they had private health insurance, 68.3 per cent of those with private health insurance reported that their premiums had increased and 50 per cent advised that their fund had increased the excess payable for in-hospital services. Significantly, 65 per cent did not believe that they received value for money from their private health insurer. One older constituent commented: My health fund's attitude is entirely frivolous: for instance I could not claim a refund on my walking stick, but could claim on RUNNERS! An elderly couple also commented: As pensioners, we were unable to continue Private Health Insurance, after being members of a particular insurer in Newcastlefor approximately 20 years. We found that with increased fees, the value of service just wasn't there. Also there is no reward for being a member for so long. When asked about the ‘gap' that people with private health insurance were paying, 84.4 per cent of the Newcastle respondents said that this was continuing to increase. Again, there were strong feelings about this issue, linking back to the question of value for money. As one Adamstown constituent put it: There is no point joining a private health fund if when you pay the bill the gap is so expensive you can't afford it. I am assisting a constituent at the moment who has private health insurance, and her gap for surgery will be in the vicinity of $5,000. That $5,000 is an amazing gap amount for a pensioner already paying private health insurance to pay for surgical attention. Another couple said: We are pensioners and have had severe health problems over the last 12 months. We feel we must be involved in Private health even though we found the treatment and cover falls far short of what is expected. Another constituent reported: Paying $70 for both myself and husband with only $50.70 rebate plus private insurance premiums of $132 per month, we are finding things quite hard. We are very serious about giving up private health care after 40 years. Stephen Duckett's study must be given due consideration by this government, because the reality is that, when emergency health care is needed by older Australians, it is usually provided by the public health care system in a public hospital. That is why there is overwhelming support in my electorate for strengthening Medicare and the public health system. The opposition amendment recommends that this legislation should be tested by a Senate committee against the economic costs and benefits, the health priorities of older Australians and against the benefits of the government increasing their already massive spend on the health insurance rebate. That is the least this parliament could do. Of course, had a Labor government been elected, we would have done a lot more for the health care of all older Australians, a lot more towards reforming the health system in this country and a lot more to find cost-effective ways to manage the health budget. We would have been speaking today on legislation to put into effect Labor's Medicare Gold policy, a policy that was so inspired and creative, so lateral in its extent of operation and so responsive to the real needs of older Australians that it was a serious threat to the Treasment urer and the health minister. You can actually measure the strength of Medicare Gold by the intensity of the attack the government has launched against it. Medicare Gold reeks of reformsomething this government knows very little about-with specific benefits to older Australians and diverse cost benefits for all tralians. Although Medicare Gold targeted the over-75 population, it had potential for flow-on effects right across the health sector. Medicare Gold would have seen the up to 25 per cent spare capacity in private hospitals instantly put to use to respond to the health needs of patients over 75. What country can afford to have expensive hospital beds unused while people wait on growing lists for surgery in public hospitals? Medicare Gold promised that government would meet the costs of health care for over-75s, whether in private or public hospitals, taking out of the equation the ineffective and wasteful cost shifting across the state and federal divide and eliminating the need for people over 75 to pay private health insurance premiums for hospital care. Why would that be feared so much? With government as a monopoly buyer for that age group's health care needs, it could have been anticipated that charges may have reduced as demand increased. Market economics would suggest that private hospital management could lower their charges-and we have seen recently that charges are excessive in private hospitals due to the use of the most expensive procedures and equipment. If Medicare Gold had been introduced, there would have been some certainty of demand, allowing cuts to administration and personnel costs. They would also have had maximum occupancy rates, and, surely with demand levels constantly high, cash flows would have been assured. As the monopoly buyer of a large share of the private hospital market, governthen would have been able to influence costs and charges and quality of service delivery within the private hospital system. I think we all accept that under this government health services will be delivered more and more by the private sector, but we also accept that service delivery has to value add to everything that we want-the best that we Aus- want-in health care. That sounds like the mutual obligation I would like to see operate in the delivery of health services by the private sector. It might also have been anticipated that moving people over 75 into private hospitals' unused beds would have allowed the public hospitals to reduce their waiting lists and eventually ensure that older Australians had access to operations at the time of onset of a medical condition, rather than after considerable debilitation, with the consequential burdens of loss of independence and mobility, and the increased draw on home care and support services. If those over 75 could have those operations in a more timely way, those human and economic costs would be reduced, alleviating the terrible burden on our aged parents and loved ones that we currently experience. That makes an increase in the health insurance rebate look miserable, doesn't it? Well, it is miserable. It is small minded, limited, regressive and just plain poor policy. Medicare Gold would also have reduced the burden on private health insurers by eliminating the cost burden to private health insurers generated by members over 75 years old. By eliminating the customer group that actually costs the most, private health insurers could then have been free to be more creative with their products and services; to build in some incentives for young people to take out insurance and manage their health care at an early stage; and to build in some bonuses for preventative health care. Private health insurers could have become key players in the important work of averting a national health crisis from unchecked diabetes, dementia and the illnesses besetting a rapidly ageing population. Shouldn't the private sector also have a responsibility to help this tion tackle the health priorities as well as gain revenue rewards? It seems to me that private systems can work well to create profit, but they work best when social dividend is also part of their charter and their bottom line of outcomes. My knowledge of the board members of NIB, the largest private health insurer in my electorate of Newcastle, suggests that they really wish to continue the ethos under which NIB began-that is, BHP workers, originally, banding together and contributing financially to gain the best health benefits for their community. But, regrettably, we are not legislating to introduce Medicare Gold. Instead, we are scrutinising the government's legislationlegislation that risks rising private health insurance premiums for everyone, risks further increasing copayments for pharmaceuticals and risks stagnation of waiting lists in public hospitals for Australians of every age group, but particularly for older Australians. With the cost of the rebate already approaching $2.5 billion, this legislation also risks blow-out in the health budget necessitating the government's favourite intervention of raising more hidden taxes, taxes like the Medicare levy and perhaps even an increase in the GST to fund the ever-increasing health needs of an ageing population. That is why the member for Lalor's amendment seeks to have this legislation scrutinised by a Senate committee. Despite the strong need for the government to respond to our ageing population and to manage their health needs efficiently and effectively, and contrary to the Howard government's claim, this legislation is unlikely to encourage people aged 65 to 70 years who do not currently have private health insurance to take it out, as they would still be subject to the maximum lifetime health cover napenalty of 70 per cent. Age pensioners like those quoted above are unlikely to re-enter private health insurance, but those who are currently able to afford it, such as those on incomes over $100,000, will receive a shortterm gain-and all for a gain by the Howard government of three more years in power. Contrary to the government's claim that private health insurance reform is all about choice, efficiency and delivering better value for money, there is nothing in this bill to ensure that any of these objectives are met. The one certainty Australian families can expect is yet another substantial increase in private health insurance premiums, and that will occur very soon.",25
7,Dr EMERSON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Rankin) (9.55 a.m.)The Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004 increases the rebate for private health insurance from 30 to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 and to 40 per cent for those aged over 70. Labor is not opposing this legislation. We do want a Senate inquiry to assess its impacts, because the claims that the government has made about a this policy are mere assertion, and there is certainly value in testing those assertions. There is already rising evidence to suggest that the assertions that the government has made are not soundly based. The reality is that these increases in the private health insurance rebate are more likely to benefit those on higher incomes because the private health insurance rebate is accessed by those on higher incomes to a much greater extent than it is by those on lower incomes. One piece of evidence has been gathered by ACOSS, the Australian Council of Social Service, which has published survey data indicating that 84 per cent of those aged over 65 who have incomes over $100,000 are covered by the private health insurance rebate, but only 23 per cent of people with an income below $20,000 are covered by the private health insurance rebate. Whether or not those figures are absolutely accurate, the point remains that there is at least some evidence which coincides with intuitive reasoning that the private health insurance rebate is accessed and used more by older Australians on higher incomes than by those on lower incomes and therefore that the increase in the rebate to 35 cent for one category of older Australians and 40 per cent for another is going to benefit those on higher incomes much more than those on lower incomes. We should not be surprised about that. ter all, this is a Liberal-National Party govment. ernment, and it is its philosophic preference to reward those who are up the income scale and not to reward those who strive hard all their lives but end up without large incomes. Indeed, we saw that with the tax policy released by the coalition, where the forgotten people, those below $52,000 a year, got not one cent of income tax reduction, but those above $52,000 a year got a fairly reasonable income tax cut. So this legislation and the philosophy behind it really mirror the tax legislation that was announced in the budget and passed through this parliament late last year-that is, a system that benefits those on higher incomes more than those on lower incomes. I do not mind the idea of benefiting people on higher incomes-I do not think we should be into class envy-but why do the people on lower incomes always miss out under this government? Indeed, the legislation will reward those who can afford to purchase private health insurance, and of course it offers absolutely nothing to those who cannot afford to purchase it. As I say, they are overwhelmingly people over 65 who are just not in a situation to be able to buy private health insurance. One of the great concerns is how long any benefit from this increase in the private health insurance rebate will last. Sadly, it is likely to be not very long at all. Based on past premium increases, it is quite likely that, within a period of one to two years, premium increases will gobble up any benefits to those who take out private health insurance. I say that because over the past three years private health insurance premiums have risen by a staggering 22 per cent and over the past five per years they have risen by around 33 per cent. At those rates, any benefit that did flow to holders of private health insurance would be gone within two years as the private health insurance industry appropriated the financial Afgains that have been offered by the governTo those who receive the private health insurance rebate, I say, ‘Be happy for a short period of time, until the health minister does what he has always done as health minister: rubber-stamp premium increases.' On that form, we will see those premium increases coming forward pretty quickly, wiping out the benefits within two years. It reminds me of a statement about our health system that the Prime Minister made fairly recently. It has been pretty clear throughout his performance over the last 25 to 30 years that he wants to return to the preWhitlam health system. That is not my assertion; it is what the Prime Minister has said. In 2003, on A Current Affair, he said to Ray Martin that he liked the system that was in place before the Whitlam Labor government was elected. He said that the election of the Labor government destroyed a system that he thought was pretty good. Without going into ancient history, let us just discuss some of the characteristics of the system that was in place before 1972. One of the defining characteristics was the large number of people who were not covered by health insurance at all. You would think that in an advanced country a fundamental obligation of any government is to ensure quality health care for all its citizens, yet large numbers Australians had no private health insurance at all because they could not afford it. Often hospitals were benevolent and did not kick them out, but people who had no insurance and no capacity to pay did not have reasonable access to hospital and tended to be forced to the back of the queue. To my mind, that is not the definition of a decent health care system that provides quality health care for all. When the Prime Minister was Treasurer in the Fraser government, they systematically dismantled Medibank. The Fraser government had seven different health systems in seven years. By the end of that period, upon the election of the Hawke government, two million Australians had no health insurance. With the introduction of Medicare, a revamped version of Medibank, all Australians were covered in one decisive initiative: they had their health costs insured through Medicare. That was a great reform. Sadly this government gives lip service to the maintenance of Medicare, when in fact the overwhelming desire of the Prime Minister is to dismantle Medicare by stealth and to favour the private system. This legislation is further evidence of that. Before government ministers suggest that I am saying we should abolish the private health insurance rebate, I am not. The government has a mandate for this legislation, and that is why Labor will allow it to pass. But I note that there has been a lot of criticism of Medicare Gold by the Treasurer. He says that the problem with Medicare Gold is that we have this massive challenge-the ageing of the population-and that to provide free health cover for those over the age of 75 is unaffordable. Isn't it strange that when Labor wanted to do it the Treasurer and the Prime Minister said that it was irresponsible to provide older Australians with extra health benefits that would cost the of budget a lot, but when the coalition does it it is entirely affordable. That seems to be the argument. I think we need to be careful about committing to expenditures that will only compound dramatically over the next 40 years with the ageing of the population. I think some of the criticism of Medicare Gold is valid, and Labor is now looking at a Medicare Gold type of policy. One of the strongest features of a Medicare Gold type of policy is that it would remove the cost shifting that goes on between the Commonwealth and the states. I think that is a very great strength of a Medicare Gold type of policy. But the Treasurer cannot have it both ways. He cannot say on the one hand that it is irresponsible to load up the budget with increased costs for the health of older Australians via Medicare Gold but that it is all right to load up the budget with increased health costs from lifting the private health insurance rebate to 35 per cent and 40 per cent. I have done some calculations on this. Based on the budget forecasts, the private health insurance rebate increase for older Australians is likely to cost in the order of $150 million in 2007-08, on current prices. But, when you add that to a number of other initiatives that this government has taken over the last few years, it certainly is arguable that the government itself is not responding properly to the ageing of the population, because other measures have also been taken that will compound dramatically over time as the number of older Australians increases. To give some perspective on that, the population projections conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics suggest that in 40 years time there will be four million more Australians over the age of 65 but 200,000 fewer children. There will be only one million more Australians aged 15 to 55 and another million aged 55 to 65. What does that mean? It means a massive ageing of the population-four million more Australians over the age of 65. The whole Intergenerational Report was prepared because Treasury was concerned about the ageing of the population and, in particular, the health costs of the ageing population to the budget. Treasury concentrated on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, but that is but one component of compounding costs associated with the ageing of the population. There are other components as a result of the decisions taken by this government over the last five years. We have already identified the increase in the private health insurance rebate. What about the seniors concession allowance for self-funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth seniors card? That is likely to cost another $70 million in 2007-08. The reduction in tax-that is, the lifting of the effective free threshold for those over the age of 65is expected to cost around $300 million in 2007-08. Also, an exemption of superannuation from social security means tests for those over 55 is likely to be in the order of $90 million, and a telephone allowance for seniors healthcare card holders is rather small at $25 million. I also need to add in here that the superannuation surcharge reduction is expected to cost in the order of $385 million in 2007-08. If you add all of those up you get more than $1 billion. In some respects $1 billion may not seem to be a massive amount of money, but it is $1 billion for those who are senior citizens in this country in 2007-08. If you believe the Intergenerational Report, the ABS population projections, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister that there is a massive problem of the ageing of the population, then these costs will compound dramatically over the next 40 years. It is passing strange that the Treasurer criticises Medicare Gold on the basis that it is unaffordable but when the government implements measures that load up costs for older Australians where those costs will compound dramatically over 40 years, it seems to be saying that it is entirely affordable. A light needs to be shone on the commitment by the government to such expenditures. I know government ministers would like to say that I am therefore opposing all these measures. I am not opposing these measures; I am not suggesting that they be reversed. It is quite hypocritical of this government to criticise any Labor policy to improve the health and well-being of older Australians as being unaffordable, but, when it does it-and it is usually directed towards the private system-then apparently that is completely affordable. The reality of these increases is that the government wants to keep the private health insurance industry happy, because the tax- private health insurance industry and its spokespeople are great supporters of the Howard government. That is the political equation. But let us go beyond the political equation and look at some of the economic dimensions of these sorts of policies. The legislation we are debating here today contains costs which are part of a $66 billion spending spree undertaken by this government since the last budget and through the election campaign to secure its re-election. Over four years $66 billion has been committed by this government, not necessarily to improve the welfare of Australians and certainly not to invest in the nation's future because, of that $66 billion, as little as $5 billion can be identified as genuine investment in the nation's future, the remainder being effectively consumption spending. Late last year I expressed concerns in the address-in reply to the Governor General's speech on 17 November about the practice of the government of engaging in a consumption spending spree when Australian consumer spending was already very high. I know it is a little unusual to quote yourself in a speech but I thought I would draw some parallels between this, what I said late last year, and the Statement on Monetary Policy released two days ago by the Reserve Bank. I said, in part: Australia's consumption boom has been fuelling domestic inflation. A four per cent increase prices of non-tradables over the last 12 months has been disguised by a reduction in the Australian dollar value of tradables, keeping the overall inflation rate within the Reserve Bank's target range. The IMF, in its report last week, identified these inflationary pressures and warned that the dampening effect of inflation from tradable goods may be eroding owing to the recent easing of the Australian dollar. I went on to say: Employment figures released on 11 November indicate a tight job market, pointing to another possible source of pressure-wage inflation fuelling domestic price inflation-and, despite the slowing of the housing market, consumer confidence seems to be going from strength to strength. I warned: There is a whiff of the late 1980s about the present consumption boom. Consumers are behaving as if nothing will stop them from continuing on their merry spending way. If consumers do pull back in the new year, in response to falling housing prices, there will be an economic slowdown. If they do not, as seems more likely at present, the Reserve Bank will be forced to hike interest rates, causing a sharper slowdown. I asked: Where is the Howard government in all this? I said: ... the government is spending on consumption, fuelling the consumption flames. To avert damaging interest rate rises, the federal government should have been reining in Commonwealth spending instead of engaging in this consumption spending spree. The longer it waits before displaying some fiscal responsibility, the harder the landing will be. The Reserve Bank Statement on Monetary Policy, released two days ago, says this, in part: Most economic data in Australia have continued to suggest strong conditions recently. The monetary policy talks about the performance of the labour market and consumer in confidence being close to record levels. It states: ... the range of other available information suggests that the economy was in a strong condition through last year and is likely to have maintained a good pace of growth entering 2005. It talks of capacity constraints becoming more important and of the disappointing performance of our exports to date, which I did mention in my speech last year. It states: For the past couple of years, underlying inflation has been held down by the lagged effects of the exchange rate appreciation that took place during 2002 and 2003, but the maximum impact from that source has now passed. Hence it is likely that underlying inflation has now reached its low point and that it will start rising during 2005. Domestically-sourced inflation has been running faster over the past couple of years ... And so it goes on. I have to say that there are pretty striking similarities between what I said last year and what the Reserve Bank said two days ago, in trying to warn of the consequences of the spending spree that this government has engaged in. Yet what did the Treasurer say at the end of last year? On the last day of parliament he said: I hope ... that we will have a good retailing season this Christmas. So we have the Treasurer saying: ‘Spend away! Go for your life!' And why wouldn't the Treasurer be saying that, because the government is going for its life with a $66 billion spending spree. There is a consumption boom in this country and now the Reserve Bank is finally warning that, as a consequence of it, it may have to raise interest rates because the government will not act. Enough of the government's hypocrisy on health policy; enough of the government's hypocrisy on economic policy. The government is asleep at the wheel. It should wake up and start managing this economy. Otherwise, we will be in for a hard landing.",30
8,Mr ABBOTT,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"In summing up the Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004 and closing the second reading debate, I wish to thank all members who have participated. As you would expect on a topic such as health, there have been some strong views expressed and some good arguments put. I thank members for their interest in this area. This bill demonstrates the Howard government's commitment to a strong private sector in health as an essential complement to a strong public sector in health. We cannot have a strong and viable Medicare system without a strong and viable private health care sector as well. As members should be aware, more than 50 per cent of all surgery today takes place in the private hospital system. If the private hospital system were, for whatever reason, unable to continue, we would immediately have far greater problems in our public hospital system than we currently have. Without a strong private sector we cannot have a strong public sector, and we cannot have a strong private sector without a strong and viable system of private health insurance. The private sector in health rests upon private health insurance, and that is why this government has always been determined to try to ensure the continuing strength of the private health insurance industry. The government has considerable achievements to its credit. Back in the midto late-nineties private health insurance coverage had dropped to about 30 per cent of the population. Today, thanks to Lifetime Health Cover and the private health insurance rebate, private health insurance coverage is about 43 per cent of the population. Some nine million Australians have private health insurance cover, including one million Australians with incomes of less than $20,000 a year. Most of those low-income Australians with private health insurance are older people, and most of those older people have had their private health insurance for many years. Their private health insurance predates Lifetime Health Cover and it predates the private health insurance rebate. They have paid and paid for their private health insurance cover and, in so doing, they have helped to bear the burden of the health costs of all Australians over the years. The government believes it is right and proper that those people should have a modest but significant additional incentive to maintain their private health insurance cover. The last thing we would want is for older people, at precisely the time in their lives when they are most likely to need additional medical attention, to drop their private health insurance cover because they are finding the financial burden prohibitive. This bill will provide, thanks to the 35 per cent and 40 per cent private health insurance measures for people over 65 and over 70, a benefit of $100 or $200, on average, to these people. Perhaps it will lead to some modest increases in private health insurance cover for older people, but certainly it should help to ensure that older people do not drop out of their private health insurance cover. I want to thank members opposite for the indication that the ALP will not oppose this legislation. I think that is an indication that members opposite have learnt something from recent political history. I think members opposite have learnt that people want to be able to have that little bit of additional control over their lives that private health insurance brings. There are still some confusing signs coming from members opposite; there are still some signs of ideological confusion from members opposite. Are they or are they not committed to the Medicare Gold policy? Will they or will they not really embrace the private health sector as a positive good, rather than as a necessary evil? I think that shades of the former Leader of the Opposition still inhabit members opposite. I think the ghost of Mark Latham still haunts this debate. As you will remember, the former member for Werriwa did say of the private health insurance rebate that it was the ‘maddest piece of public policy' ever to come out of this parliament. But members opposite are starting to move on, and that is to their credit. I am pleased that they are getting over it. Nevertheless, I think there is still some way to go. One of the issues that has arisen since this policy was announced in consultation with the private health insurance sector is what might happen to people who are not over 65 but who are currently covered by a policy which includes someone who is over 65 and therefore attracts the higher rebate. I want to make it very clear that the government's intention is that nobody should be kicked off their cover as a result of this legislation. It is possible that these new arrangements will need finetuning after practical experience of their operation. The government will monitor the implementation of the seniors' rebate, review its operation after the first six to 12 months and, if necessary, make any legislative finetuning that is desirable. This is an important piece of legislation. It will significantly strengthen the private health sector in this country. I am pleased that it is not going to be opposed by the opposition. I commend it to the House, and I think that older Australians can be confident that their future, their health security, is in good hands with the Howard government.",35

11,Ms ROXON,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the bill on behalf of my colleague the member for Sydney, who is currently on maternity leave, and I do so with great pleasure. It is interesting that the bill that I will be speaking on is the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004, obviously something of interest to all of those who have families. At the outset I can indicate that Labor do support the passage of this bill, but we do note that this bill has only been necessary to correct the flaws in the indexation provisions of the Family Assistance Act 1999 that arose as a result of changes made under the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families-Increased Payments) Bill 2004, which introduced the $600 per child family tax benefit supplement. Labor said from the start that the government had either made a major blunder or sneakily changed the formula for calculating fortnightly family tax benefit A payments so that it could recover or claw back the value of the per child supplement over time. The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, and her former colleague Larry Anthony responded by claiming that the government was fully committed to maintaining the real value of the per child supplement over time. But neither Senator Patterson nor Mr Anthony ever addressed Labor's key charge that the government had deceived families by fiddling with the formula for the fortnightly FTBA payments when it introduced the per child supplement in the 2004 budget. After two months of insisting that there was no problem, Senator Patterson belatedly conceded in August last year that she and Mr Anthony had botched the original legislation and that it needed to be changed yet again. So here we are. Senator Patterson then of course broke her promise to fix the problem before the federal election. The government finally introduced this bill into the House on 18 November, six months after it created the mess in the budget legislation. Debate on the bill was then delayed until this session, well after Senator Patterson's promise to correct the problem once and for all. The bill itself, as members of the House might be able to tell, even from that brief history of it, is a technical bill. It seeks adjust the indexation provisions of the Family Assistance Act 1999 so that the detrimental impact of changes made by the government as part of its 2004 More help for Families legislation is reversed. The bill amends the family tax benefit adjustment provisions in schedule 4 of the Family Assistance Act 1999 that apply in relation to the family tax benefit A under-13 and age 13-15 child rates. Under the new arrangements provided for in the bill if the FTBA under 13 child rate, as indexed by the consumer price index, is less than the amount worked out using the formula of the combined pensioner rate times 16.6 per cent-where the combined pensioner rate refers to combined pensioner couple-then the FTBA under-13 rate is increased to the amount determined under the formula. The position is the same for the family tax benefit A age 13-15 child rate, except that the multiplier is 21.6 per cent. Collectively these tests are more simply known as the safety net benchmark provisions. These provisions had been introduced by previous Labor governments to ensure adequacy of fortnightly payments to Australian families. The arrangements provided for in this bill are the same as those which applied to FTB payments prior to the passage of the budget legislation last year. The bill does not make any changes to the future indexation arrangements for the supplementary FTB payment, which will continue to be adjusted by the CPI. Since the per child supplement was introduced, Labor has pointed out that the effect of other changes made in that same legislation was that the supplementary payment would be fully recovered or clawed back by the government over time. This was because changes in the budget legislation to the formula for calculating fortnightly FTBA payments compromised the existing safety net benchmark and the value of the per child to supplement would be eroded within a fiveto seven-year period. This position was supported by the Australian Council of Social Service, which noted in its press release on 21 June 2004: ... the new indexation rules will see Family Tax Benefit rise more slowly than it would have under current rules. The value of the $600 increase be washed away The safety net benchmarks which were introduced by Labor and carried over in the Family Assistance Act 1999 have not influenced FTB payments recently because those payments have been well above the benchmarks since the FTB system was introduced. However, this will change in the future when the benchmarks catch up with FTB fortnightly payments. The effect will be that the fortnightly FTBA payments will then start to increase at a lower rate than would have been the case prior to the changes to the formula that were made in last year's budget legislation. Labor argued that, after five to seven years, the value of the foregone increase in FTBA payments would have been greater than the value of the supplementary payment to families. So the government would have clawed back the value of the supplementary payment by reducing the normal fortnightly payments. As I have said, despite denials at the time from Senator Patterson and former junior minister Larry Anthony, the changes made when the supplementary payment was introduced did alter the formulas used to calculate the benchmarks. Under sections 6 and 7 of schedule 1 of the budget legislation, while 16.6 per cent or 21.6 per cent of the annualised combined partnered pension rate was still calculated, the result of that calculation was reduced by the FTB supplement. These new formulas therefore resulted in lower benchmarks. While the lower benchmarks would still increase in line with movements in male total average weekly earnings, they would take longer to rise to match the CPI indexed FTBA rate. It would only be at that time that the benchmarks started to influence the FTBA rate. So the new benchmarks, which are lower than before because the supplementary payment is deducted, would eventuwill ally produce lower rates of FTBA than the original benchmarks. Hence Labor's claim, supported by ACOSS, that the effective value of the $600 supplement would be eroded over time by this detrimental change to the formula for calculating fortnightly FTBA payments. Obviously Australian families were going to miss out. Eventually, on 4 August 2004, two months after the flaw in her legislation was exposed, Senator Patterson rather ungraciously conceded the need for legislative amendments to ensure the maintenance of the full value of the supplementary payment into the future. It has taken a further six months for the government to bring on the debate about this bill. It has only been through Labor's persistence that the government has belatedly acknowledged the need to make the changes contained in this bill-and we are pleased that Australian families will reap the benefits of our persistence. However, as late as 17 November last year Senator Patterson was still criticising Labor for daring to find fault with the budget legislation, rather than owning up to her own failure to ensure that Australian families were not made worse off over the long term by the legislation. Senator Patterson has continued to try and hide behind what she said was an unintentional change to the safety net benchmark provisions. She cannot bring herself to acknowledge the blunder that she alone has made. If the change really was unintentional, we are at a loss to understand why Senator Patterson took so long to admit that the provisions needed changing. Senator Patterson also criticises Labor for what she describes as ‘scaremongering' about the problem that she created through her own faulty legislation to introduce the supplementary FTB payment. But if Labor had not raised the problem, we would not be debating this bill today, because Senator Patterson would never have admitted to her mistakes and would never have sought to fix the problem-and Australian families would have been the losers. Senator Patterson should actually stand up in the Senate when this legislation is debated there and acknowledge that if Labor had not identified and exposed this blunder Australian families would have been the losers. If the government had continued to ignore Labor's concerns then the value of the supplementary payment would have been washed away through the dodgy change to the formula for calculating fortnightly FTBA payments that Senator Patterson included in the budget legislation. Labor's main concern through this whole debate has been to ensure that Australian families who are eligible for the per child supplementary payment are not duped by the government once again. Consistent with the decision by Labor in government to introduce the safety net benchmarks in the first place, Labor now want to ensure that the integrity of the system is maintained, and that it is not undermined by mistakes or backdoor attempts to erode the value of other payments that are made to Australian families. This is why Labor are pleased to finally support the passage of this bill through the House of Representatives today. We hope that it gets quick passage through the Senate and that Australian families will be better off as a result. We note that now is the time for Senator Patterson to admit to her mistakes and move on for the future settling of appropriate payments to Australian families. I thank the House.",36
12,Mr RICHARDSON,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the real value of fortnightly payments of the family tax benefit part A is maintained in the future. This bill is essential in guaranteeing that the real impact of these payments to families is not lost, by ensuring that fortnightly payments of the family tax benefit part A will be indexed to either the CPI or a percentage of the combined pensioner couple rate. This government is dedicated to ensuring that families are better off under the Howard government and are not disadvantaged following the 2004 budget. With that aim in mind, this bill ensures that fortnightly rates of payment will be adjusted at the same time and for the same amount as would have occurred before the budget. As part of this government's budget initiatives, legislation was passed providing an additional ongoing supplement of $600 per child. My colleagues from across the floor have continually stated that this $600 increase would evaporate over time and would not provide any real benefit to families. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify what is obviously a misconception held by the opposition. At the time the legislation providing for the $600 supplement was passed, provision was included which ensured that the supplement would be indexed each year in accordance with increases in CPI. That legislation, like the bill I speak in support of today, was aimed at providing real and genuine support to families. Together they do so, by ensuring that the funding initiatives put in place by this government are not eroded by increases in the cost of living. Not only are families better off under the Howard government but, on average, Australian families now receive $7,000 in family tax benefit. The successful passage of this bill provides a guarantee to Australian families that the real value of their family assistance will be maintained. I am heartened to see in the recent policy principles document released by the Labor Party that they are finally willing to recognise the significant benefit the $600 per child payment has provided to Australian families. I trust, therefore, that we will hear no further claims coming from the opposition that this payment and the benefit it provides to families is not a real one. The cost of the amendments contained in this bill will be $25.9 million from 2006 to 2008. There is no doubt that funding initiatives like this are only possible because of the responsible economic management provided by the Howard government. This government has worked tirelessly to ensure that its strong economic and financial management provides genuine assistance to Australians who need it, while at the same time providing the best possible foundation for future generations of Australians. This bill aimed directly at achieving both those vitally important goals by providing funding to families while aiming that funding directly at the children who are Australia's future. In conclusion, I am pleased to be able to support this bill and I commend this bill to the House. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (10.38 a.m.)-The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004 that the government has before the House will be supported by the opposition. We have heard in this debate some excellent arguments on both sides of the House on this particular matter of health. We on this side of the House have a very long history of involvement in this particular area. Labor was the architect of the great universal public health scheme that gives every Australian, by right, access to quality health care in this country. Sadly, under conservative governments down through the eons the public health system has been run down-and the Howard government is no exception in that respect. Yes, we do see a place for private health insurance in the vision of health care for Australians, but it ought not to be at the expense of the public health system in this country. I will not speak for too long on this particular bill because many of the arguments that I would make in this debate have been covered by other speakers and no doubt will be covered by the member for Gorton when he enters the debate. But, suffice to say, on the issue of health care Labor has form both in government and in opposition. We have seen the chaos created in the past by conservative governments in power. On this occasion we do intend to support this particular measure, but I think the Australian electorate has it right: Labor in government and in opposition has always put the health of Austrais lians front and square in the policies that it has put before them.",39
13,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I thank the member for Corio for foreshadowing some of the comments I wish to make. It is true that we support the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004, but of course this bill should not have had to happen. I think it is an example of law made on the run. As we know, the government, in its efforts to buy votes at the last election, decided to create some policy or law in an attempt to bribe Australian voters. There are all sorts of questions about the way in which we should dispense the contents of the public purse in order to look after people in need. Indeed, the whole area of family tax benefits is open to question as to the best way to do that. But I do not think it is the case that the government thought through clearly the implications of its initial act announced in the budget last year by the Treasurer. I am aware that the Treasurer was initially against the $600 payment and lost in cabinet. pro- We are very well aware that he saw that it might be perceived as an attempt to buy votes at the next election. I also think we should be aware that the $600 bonus was indeed welcomed by households, because of course any money that provides relief to families in need will be welcomed by the community. There is no doubt that, because the money was announced in a rushed manner and because it was not foreseeable by the recipients of that $600 bonus-or, indeed, more than $600, depending upon how many children there were in each household that was eligible for the payment-it came as a great surprise. I am very confident that it welcomed by people in need, as I said. But I do not think that is going to be the case with future payments, because what the government has effectively done is to foreshadow that you can now expect to receive $600, $1,200 or $1,800 at the end of the financial year. You will be able to calculate that sum and then plan for it. Compared with what has occurred to date, where most recipients received a sum of money which they had not planned for and therefore they welcomed it-they had not spent it or factored it into their household budget, because it was not something that they knew about until the Treasurer announced it last year-we are now going to be in a situation where the families that are eligible for the payment be factoring in the payment well in advance of receiving it. The problem of reconciliation, however, is not resolved. That is the one thing we have to really be clear about. The issue of reconciling whether there is a surplus or debt for those recipients eligible for family tax benefits is not resolved by providing lump sums a year down the path. As we know, you have to calculate your own income 12 months in advance. If you are lucky enough to have calculated that sum of income for the household very well, you are not going to be in debt. But, as we know, approximately one-third of recipients of family tax benefits had some form of debt. Indeed, the average debt was in excess of $600. It is true to say that, if you did not foresee $600 being received at the end of year and then you received it, it would be some relief. If you are going to be in debt in excess of $600, $600 or more is going to help relieve the amount of debt. However, as I say, the difference now, as opposed to last year, is that families now in receipt of such moneys will be calculating that into their budget. It says to me that we do not yet have a fix. We was do not have an answer as to how to work out the reconciliation of one's income and eligible family tax benefit. That is the conundrum that most households find themselves in. Now, because they foresee the $600 or more in their household income, it seems to me that they will already be spending that-or be happy to go further into debt because they will be in receipt of it. But that does not remove the fact that a huge proportion of families were in debt at the end of the financial year because of the system that we operate. There is also a question of good public policy about providing lump sums. There is no doubt that for many households money amounting to $600 extra would be welcomed or that in some instances it would be the will largest amount of money they would see in any given year. I understand why people would want to be in receipt of such sums. But, as decision makers, in dispensing the public purse, we have to consider whether the lump sum payment at the end of the year is the best way to look after children in this country, to provide for them and to assist in the provision of services for them. From looking at the policy and talking to families about the way they tend to budget in the household, the conclusion I have drawn is that it is not the best policy. It might be the best incentive to vote for the government that provides the money, but it is not the best policy for the country for looking after children. There is a whole debate to be had about the way in which the family tax benefit should be paid. This bill is a cautionary bill. It was introduced into the House because the government was rushing its law. It was rushing its policy; it was forcing through a law; and in Senate estimates it found that it had a flawed act. It had to introduce this bill, which we support, in order to rectify the deficiencies in the preceding bill relating to this matter. We know that this is a bandaid to fix a problem. As I say, I do not think the initial bill fundamentally alters the problem of reconciliation that occurs in the system. I accept that we need to support this bill, but there would have been no need for it if there had been proper and decent consideration of the matters involved rather than rushing to pay out large sums of money before a federal election. If it were not for that, we would not have this bill. I say it is a cautionary bill cause we know that very soon the government will have unfettered powers in two chambers-the greatest level of power any Australian government has had since 1981and therefore, I would say, a greater inclination to rush through legislation that is flawed. We support this bill, notwithstanding the comments made by the minister, who said that we were just scaremongering. It was Labor that highlighted the flaws in the system last year. But we say this to the government: do not hurry if you want to make good law; indeed, listen to the critics and provide the capacity for this chamber and the Senate chamber, the chamber of review, to consider bills in this term. If the government fails to do that, we will find ourselves in the same position over and over again-the position we find ourselves in this morning. I wish to say a number of things on the broader question of family tax benefits and the way in which the government has responded, but I will not do that this morning. However, I do warn the government to reconsider its approach and to focus on the policy, not the politics. Then we might find ourselves in a better position all round.",40
14,Dr EMERSON,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Rankin) (10.51 a.m.)The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004 could just as easily have been titled the ‘Honey, I stuffed it up (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004'. The government made an error in the announcements that were first made, and for some considerable time it denied the claims by Labor and the Australian Council of Social Service that over time its legislation would have the effect of clawing back the $600 payment per child. Only when it got over its indignation about any suggestion that Labor might have it right did the govbeernment examine this. It then realised that in fact it had made a bad error. As a consequence, we are debating this legislation today because it seeks to rectify that error. To put a monetary figure on the dimensions of the error, this legislation in 2007-08 involves extra expenditure of almost $25 million, which is not an insignificant amount. That is just the beginning of the impact of the error that the government made; that error would compound over time with the erosion of the benefit. So the government has finally admitted its mistake and here we are rectifying that mistake. I join with the member for Gorton who said that now that the government will be controlling the Senate from 1 July it should take note of its capacity to make errors such as this and not seek to rush legislation through. A temptation for ministers will be to try to get their legislation through the House and Senate very quickly and to not agree to Senate inquiries, which often have the beneficial impact of identifying unintended consequences of legislation. Quite often, Labor approach those Senate inquiries with the objective of improving legislation, whether or not we fundamentally agree with it. The reality is that the government is elected and, if it is going to put legislation through the parliament, let us make sure it is the best possible legislation. Ministers could take note of the lesson that is provided in this legislation-that is, rushing legislation through due to arrogance is going to end up in humiliation at some point, particularly after 1 July if legislation is rammed through the Senate and the minister has to sponsor the fixing up of errors in it, which no doubt he or she would want to deny until it became a statement of the bleeding obvious. I point out that the $600 per child payment is one component of the $66 billion spending spree in which this government engaged to secure its re-election. It is astonishing that, a time when the economy has been growing strongly and consumer spending has been growing at almost unprecedented rates, the government has seen fit to pour petrol on that consumer spending fire through increasing the call on the budget to the extent of that $66 billion. Only around $5 billion of it could be categorised as investment spending; the balance of $61 billion over four years best fits the description of consumption spending. It is precisely the wrong time for a government to be fuelling consumption when consumption is already going at such a cracking pace. That is why the Reserve Bank has finally belled the cat in its Statement on Monetary Policy released the day before yesterday, where it identifies very strong consumer confidence, which is close to record levels; very strong labour market conditions; and a range of other available information suggesting the economy was in strong condition through last year and is likely to have maintained a good pace of growth entering 2005. There were some suggestions that the housing bubble was deflating-that is in fact true. But there are now some indications, as identified by the Reserve Bank, that perhaps that deflation has run its course. Page 3 of the Reserve Bank statement says: More recently, there have been some signs of prices and finance levelling out, or possibly rising. If Australia is confronted with that house price bubble re-inflating, given that it has not deflated by very much, we are in for very tricky and challenging times. But you would not know it, because the government, absolutely committed to its re-election rather than to good economic management, has added $66 billion to demand in Australia. We are in a situation where domestic demand is growing rapidly but exports are performing terriat bly. Imports are surging, which is associated with that domestic demand. We have the best terms of trade since 1972 but appalling performance in export volumes. In parliament yesterday the Minister for Trade said, ‘What is the problem? Exports are larger than they were a few years ago.' On the back of record terms of trade anyone could have achieved a growth in export values in nominal terms. But the minister was very keen to blame everything and everyone but himself and the government for the stagnation of export volumes, which mean that Australia has put in its worse export performance since the Second World War. Why is this relevant to a debate on a $600 family payment? The answer is that the surge in consumer spending in this country and our terrible export performance are creating a large external imbalance. Trade deficits have now been going on for 37 consecutive months with no end in sight. The current account deficit, according to the Statement of Monetary Policy, is approaching 6.75 per cent, which the Reserve Bank itself identifies as a record. The Treasurer, who was asked about the current account deficit yesterday, is behaving like a character from The Life of Brian-always look on the bright side of life! ‘What is the problem with a 6.75 per cent current account deficit?' Yesterday he was asked about his statement in 1995 that a six per cent current account deficit is unsustainable. He said that in unequivocal terms, not referring to the composition of the current account deficit or the extent to which it was associated with a budget deficit. He said flatly that a six per cent current account defispending cit is unsustainable. If a current account deficit, cit of six per cent of GDP is unsustainable, why is a current account deficit of 6.75 per cent suddenly sustainable? The answer is that it is not. It is not sustainable. In its country report on Australia late year the IMF pointed to the growing current account deficit and began questioning its sustainability. Economic commentators in this country and, I fear, economists within the government bureaucracy, have overinterpreted the Pitchford thesis to regard it as ing that the current account deficit does not matter. That is in fact not the case. The current account deficit can matter, especially when it is financing rampant consumer spending. We have had 37 successive trade deficits and record current account deficits, which are adding to Australia's foreign debt. When the present Treasurer and the present Prime Minister rolled out their debt truck in 1995 Australia's foreign debt was $180 billion. They said that was completely unsustainable, that it was selling out Australia's future and that it was $10,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. The net foreign debt is now $406 billion, or $20,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. If it was selling out Australia's sovereignty and Australia's future when it was $10,000 for every man, woman and child in the country, what does that say about a debt of $20,000 for every man, woman and child in the country? Again, back in 1995 when Labor in government pointed out that a very substantial proportion of that foreign debt was in fact private foreign debt, the current Treasurer said, ‘Look, the only thing that one needs to get one's mind around is the size of the foreign debt of $180 billion.' The Treasurer ought to get his mind around the size of the foreign debt now of $406 billion. Every day that this government is fuelling consumption spending through its $66 billion spree it is adding to the trade defiit is adding to the current account deficit and it is adding to net foreign debt. But the government is so blasé about this; it does not seem to be concerned. It might not be concerned but the Reserve Bank is concerned. If last you read that Statement on Monetary Policy issued two days ago, you will see it has a chilling warning for those households who are receiving the $600 payment that we are debating today. The Reserve Bank appears to be preparing the Australian public for an insaycrease in mortgage interest rates. What the government gives with one hand, the Reserve Bank has to take away with the other because of the government's economic mismanagement. What comfort is it to the Australian families who receive this $600 payment per child if mortgage interest rates go up? Australian borrowers have borrowed to the hilt. Even a one-quarter of one percentage point rise in mortgage interest rates can mean a very substantial addition to repayment obligations. Before the election the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were trying to create the impression that interest rates would not be a problem if the Liberal-National coalition was re-elected. Yet here we are, just months after the election, and the Reserve Bank bells the cat and basically says that the government's economic mismanagement and its failure to rein in budget spending-in fact, it is adding fuel to the fire-has put the Reserve Bank in a situation where it may have no alternative but to increase mortgage interest rates. It result of the government's economic mismanagement. The government knew what it was doing; this was not negligence. It was adding almost $66 billion to already rampant consumer spending for one purpose only: not to manage the economy but to organise its re-election and then worry about the interest rate rises later. On the last day of parliament last year the Treasurer said, ‘Let's hope we have a happy retailing Christmas.' In the same answer he talked about how maybe you should give love for Christmas and not a Christmas present. Then at the end of that answer he said: ‘Let's hope we have a happy retailing Christmas'-in other words, let us hope it goes on and on and everyone enjoys this consumption boom. Now the Treasurer and other ministers are in the parliament saying that this consumption boom is creating a few problems-that there is a shortage of skills and that is going to create wage pressures, as identified by the Reserve Bank two days ago. The government's response to the wage pressures is: ‘We'll have more industrial relations reform.' What for? To stop wages rising? The problem is that there is an excess demand for skilled people. Industrial relations changes, government style, will not mean that those skilled people will command, in a market economy, lower wages. How is further deregulation of the labour market going to ease wage pressures when the problem is that there is already very strong excess demand for skilled employees in this country? The answer is that it will not solve the problem. All it does is give the government another excuse to say, ‘Everything would have been all right if we had just been able to deregulate the labour market a little bit more.' Instead of trying to create political scapegoats out of the Australian trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party, the government ought to accept its economic is a responsibilities and implement policies such that mortgage interest rate increases would not be necessary. Through buying its way back into government the coalition has dramatically increased the likelihood of those interest rates rising. I now want to make an observation about the family payment system. The family payment system has quite a history. Conceptually, it is a good approach because it does seek to redistribute income to those who have less financial and private market capacity. But it has been augmented year after year to the point where it has become a very expensive system indeed. One measure of that expense is that the total collection of personal income tax in 2004-05 is estimated by the budget at $102 billion but total spending on social security and welfare is estimated at $82 billion-that is, around 80 per cent of all the personal income tax collected in this country is then sent back out in the form of family and other payments. That suggests a large amount of churning-that is, the government taxing people, taking the money off them, having it collected by the tax office through often high effective marginal tax rates and then going around and saying: ‘What jolly good fellows we are. Here's some family payments back.' Here is a radical thought for a coalition government: maybe it would be better not to tax them so much in order to be jolly good fellows and give some of it back in family payments. To the extent that the family payments system provides a genuine redistribution I would support it, but there must be many billions of dollars of revenue collected through the tax system that is returned to the same taxpayers. So the radical thought is: maybe we need to have a look at the whole tax and income support system and see whether we can simplify it. Maybe we could use some of the proceeds that are just being recycled to the same families by the government so that it can get the accolades of saying, ‘Here's some money in the pocket for you'-money that it took out of the other pocket. Maybe it is time for a fundamental look at that. I understand that the government is looking afresh at these ideas. My belief is that over the last 15 or 20 years the tax system and the family payments system have grown incrementally, not necessarily rationally, and often in order for a government to be re-elected. In 2000 it was increased very substantially as compensation for the GST, because the government recognised that it was not going to be able to compensate people properly for the GST through the tax system alone and that it would need to do so through the family payments system. We have a higgledy-piggledy system that has been built up with some rationality in it but a very large amount of irrationality-of political opportunism-in it. Maybe this is the time to have a good look at the interaction of the tax and family payments systems. Labor brought a policy to the last election which sought to reduce effective marginal tax rates for particular income groups and households. That policy had a lot to commend it. It is interesting to note a report by Gillian Beer of NATSEM as to where-this was in 2002, so there have been some changes-the high effective marginal tax rates are. It is revealed that only eight per cent of individuals face effective marginal tax rates above 60 per cent. Of individuals with earnings, only 11 per cent face effective marginal tax rates above 60 per cent. Fifteen per cent of couples with children face high effective marginal tax rates, defined as effecdragged tive marginal tax rates above 60 per cent, and 23 per cent of sole parents face them. They are the two types of households that face these high effective marginal tax rates. Interestingly, there is a concentration of these high effective marginal tax rates in the middle income ranges. This report and the work of NATSEM is important in forming a proper reform process for our income tax and social security systems. Let us look at it afresh, let us rebuild it, let us make it a rational system and reform the higgledy-piggledy system that has been built up through successive governments seeking re-election and making in many cases very irrational decisions.",42
15,Ms HALL,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"We are here today because the government has been caught out. The government was caught out with its sleight of hand where it was trying to hoodwink Australian families with the $600 family tax payment and the yearly payment that was a provision of the legislation last year. It hoodwinked them through the indexation process that was introduced at that time. Let us get this straight right now: there would have been absolutely no change whatsoever to the original legislation had the government not been caught out. This is a government that has been caught out, yet again. We are here now revisiting the legislation with the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004 to correct an anomaly that arose when the $600 family tax benefit supplement payment was introduced. It was an anomaly that existed because the government thought it could get away with it. It was an anomaly that would have affected Australian families. This is a government that has a long history of introducing legislation which on the surface looks pretty good but which has quite a negative effect on families. I hate to say that this government has really been screaming into the chamber to alter the legislation. The original bill had provisions that would allow the government to claw back the value of the $600 supplementary payment over a sixto seven-year period and hope that the Australian people would not notice it. We probably need to get this straight, too; let me put it on the record: this $600 payment would not have been necessary had the government revisited the way it calculated the family tax benefit payment-a payment that results time and time again in families receiving notices from Centrelink that they have incurred a debt. The way it is calculated is a design fault. Families are required to determine their income in advance, and we all know that circumstances change. A person only needs to get a pay rise or work a bit of overtime and the next thing we know a debt has been incurred. Whilst this legislation will fix the clawback provision of the previous legislation, it will do absolutely nothing to correct the flawed system used to calculate the family tax benefit. I cannot understand why the government cannot admit that it is wrong, go back to the drawing board and fix this issue once and for all. I suppose it requires a bit of character to admit you have made a mistake and to admit that you have duped the Australian people-to admit that you have in place a system that causes family after family to incur debts. I will talk a little more about later. This legislation, as I have mentioned, corrects an indexation anomaly that arose as a result of the legislation that introduced a $600 family tax benefit supplementary payment following the budget last year. Under the adjustment arrangements provided in the bill, if the family tax benefit for the under-13 child rate, as indexed by the consumer price index, is less than the amount worked out using the formula, CPC rate times 16.6 per cent, the family tax benefit under-13 rate is increased to the amount determined under the formula. The position is the same for the family tax benefit rate for children aged 13 to 16 years, except that the formula is the CPC rate times 21.6 per cent. Collectively, these tests are known as the safety net benchmark. The arrangements provided for in the bill are the same as those which applied for family tax benefits prior to the passage of the legislation that introduced the family tax payment supplement following the 2004 budget. I cannot understand why the correct calculations were not included in the first piece of legislation. Being the suspicious person that I am when it relates to this government, I would have to say that they hoped that we would not notice but on this side of the House we are a pretty good opposition and we can pick up those things very quickly. We know that this government are always using some sleight of hand, some way to trick the Australian people. On this particular occasion we have made them accountable. We have made them forget the clawback provision they had in the initial legislation, and we have this legislation before us today. Since the $600 family tax benefit supplement was introduced, Labor has argued time and time again that the government was attempting to claw back this payment by also that changing the indexation arrangement for normal family tax benefit payments. We on this side of the House know that is true; we know that the government would have done that. That would have been the result if it had not been for the Labor Party-if it had not been for the opposition-because that is the way this government works. Because legislation introducing the $600 payment was delayed in the year in which it was introduced, the pre-existing safety net benchmark provisions came into effect. The CPI would be the sole means of adjusting normal family tax benefit payments, and, because the rate of the CPI base increases in the family tax benefit over the next few years, they are likely to be considerably less than they would have been under the safety net benchmarks and the government would have clawed back the entire $600 over six to seven years. We have seen this in other areas where the government has introduced clawback provisions. Some of it has been seen in audits in the aged care area. Teams have been going back and reassessing the RCSs and patient classifications have been reassessed. The government gives with one hand and takes with the other. We know that; the Australian people know that. If the minister had been really serious about it, this legislation would have been amended in the last parliament. This government has a philosophy of frowning on people who are in receipt of any sort of welfare payment. It supports families on its terms-and its terms alone. I think that the family tax benefit is one of those pieces of legislation where the government gives lip service to helping families, but, on the other hand, it actually creates a lot of problems families. The one-off $600 payment made last year was designed to bribe Australian families pre-election, and the annual payment of $600 afterwards is just an attempt to fix a flawed system and a very poor attempt at that. It is interesting to note when the quests for repayment of family debts came out-they came out after the election. That was no surprise to any of us on this side of the House. The problem with the family tax benefit is the method of calculation. The problem with the system is that it is a very rigid system, and it is a problem that causes enormous problems for people in Australia. In the torate of Shortland, it is estimated that, each year, over 4,000 families have debts averaging $900 each, and that is because of the flawed family tax benefit system. Keeping in mind that I said that is the average debt, and that over one-third of the people who are in receipt of family tax benefits in Shortland electorate are incurring those debts, that is a significant number of people. I have had numerous families come and visit me about debts, and I do not mean one or two people: I mean a significant number of people. They come and visit me with debts of $3,000, $4,000 or, in some cases, even larger amounts. I rang my office this morning and asked them to pull out some details of people who have incurred debts within the electorate in relation to the family tax benefit. I was going to talk about some of those examples here this morning. But, when I received 20 pages of debt details with some 10 names to each page, I thought that would take up too much of the time of the House. It is a flawed system. If the government was really serious about helping families, it could revisit that system, not with a stopgap measure to change the method of calculation but rather by addressing the core issue and for fixing the problem once and for all. I mentioned earlier in my speech that the government has a very ambivalent approach to providing welfare to people within Australia, be it families, pensioners or particularly people who are unemployed. We are going to resee legislation reintroduced in this House relating to the disability support pension and people with disabilities, an area that is very dear to my heart and that I know is causing great angst within my electorate. This whole ambivalence towards welfare payments is of great concern to me. I saw an article in the Sydney Morning Herald-and I wish I had brought it to the House with me-that talked elec- about government expenditure. It showed that the largest area of government expenditure was in the area of welfare. The thing that really concerns me, given the government's philosophy and given the percentage of GDP that is actually spent on welfare payments, is that this government is going to move down the line of privatising Centrelink and privatising our welfare system. That really concerns me. We are seeing moves in the US along that line, and it has been put to me by people who work in the system now that the government has already started this, and it is doing it by stealth. Rather than a wholesale sell-off of Centrelink or associated services, this government will follow a process of outsourcing one function and outsourcing another function, and then effectually you will just have a very small core that has very little responsibility and a very small role. That is not the Australian way. The Australian way is to look after all Australians. If a person is in need, needs a little extra assistance, the Australian way is to provide it. The Australian way when it comes to supporting families is to put in place a system where Australian families do not incur debts. The Australian way is to look after people. This piece of legislation does go towards effecting a change to legislation that was going to claw back money from Australian families, but unfortunately I do not think it really resolves the core issue. The core issue is to look after Australian families and to make that commitment to Australian families, Australia's future, and to ensure that every child in Australia has the opportunity to have the financial support that they need. That is the idea behind the family tax benefit. So I support this legislation, but in doing so I have to state very strongly that I appointed. I am disappointed that the government had to introduce this legislation. I am disappointed that it took the opposition identifying the problem that existed-or catching the government out-for the government to take this action. I am very disappointed that the government has not revisited the legislation, changed a flawed system and introduced a family tax benefit system that will not lead to Australian families incurring debts and therefore necessitating a $600 payment to offset that. I should add, as a rider to that, that the $600 does not even meet the average debt incurred by families in the Shortland electorate. I support the legislation, but in doing so I hope that my comments have been noted.",46
16,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,The question is that this bill be now read a second time. Does the parliamentary secretary wish to sum up?,49
17,Ms LEY,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,in reply-I move that this bill be now read a third time. I thank members,49
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I will have to put the question before the third reading is moved. The question is that this bill be now read a second time. Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would have hoped that the government of the day would fulfil its responsibilities and think about responding to the arguments put by the opposition.",49
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"We will withdraw the question that was put. The honourable member for Farrer can sum up, and then I will put the second reading question.",49
20,Ms LEY,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I thank members on both sides of the House for their contribution to this debate. The Family Assistance Legislation am dis- Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004 amends the adjustment provisions in the family assistance law as they apply to the family tax benefit child rates for children under 13 and those aged from 13 to 15. Prior to the introduction of the family tax benefit part A supplement on 1 July 2004, the safety net benchmark for these FTB child rates was 16.6 per cent of the combined pensioner couple rate for children under 13 and 21.6 per cent of the combined pensioner couple rate for children aged 13 to 15. The safety net benchmark applied if CPI indexation of these rates resulted in a lesser rate of payment than under the formula. The annual rate of family tax benefit payable for children in these age groups was effectively increased with the introduction earlier this year of a $600 per child family tax benefit part A supplement. The family tax benefit part A supplement is a separate payment that is CPI indexed on 1 July each year and paid as a lump sum at the end of the relevant income year. This additional payment was also reflected in the benchmark formula. This bill further amends the formula to ensure that fortnightly payments of family tax benefit part A in respect of children under 13 and children aged 13 to 15 will be indexed by the greater of either the CPI or a percentage of the combined pensioner couple rate without regard to the supplement. The fortnightly rates will be adjusted at the same time and for the same amount as would have occurred before the introduction of the family tax benefit part A supplement. These changes ensure that the intention of the policy is being delivered and that the real value of fortnightly payments of family tax benefit part A are maintained. The $600 per child family tax benefit part A supplement will continue to be indexed each year in line with increases in the CPI, as is currently provided for in family assistance law. The real value of the supplement will be maintained through this indexation to the CPI. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",49
21,Ms LEY,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. AUSLINK (NATIONAL LAND TRANSPORT) BILL 2004 Cognate bill: AUSLINK (NATIONAL LAND TRANSPORT-CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 February, on motion by Mr Anderson: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Kelvin Thomson moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House calls upon the Government to: (1) maintain funding responsibility for construction and maintenance of infrastructure on what was formerly defined as the National Highway Network; (2) establish a National Infrastructure Advisory Council; and the (3) extend the criteria for Roads to Recovery projects to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways”.",50
22,Mrs HULL,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"It is a great pleasure to be here today to support the AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 and the AusLink (National Land Transport-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004 because many programs will receive funding as a result of the innovative and futuristic views of the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of The Nationals, John Anderson. The AusLink package is an exciting step forward and represents a new era of funding of land transport infrastructure in this nation. The Hon. John Anderson had the visionary drive to establish a blueprint for transport infrastructure into our future. I tainly was very supportive of this when I came into this House, recognising that there were significant issues with port and rail authorities and transport and road access to many areas across the Riverina. These areas are great producers, have an enormously beneficial export record for the benefit of this nation and require transport infrastructure and access to be delivered into the future. Without substantial and modern land transport infrastructure, the development of communities that rely so heavily on the ability to transport their produce to markets will be severely impacted upon. This government has recognised this and has worked to ensure that our infrastructure is not only maintained but improved to ensure the viability of our economies well into the future. Many road and rail networks fall under the responsibility of state and territory governments, which are certainly making it very difficult for local government through a series of cost-shifting processes, as the member for Hunter would be well aware, that is almost not able to be contained. The state and territory governments are falling well short of what their commitment should be to ensure the viability of the states and particularly of my electorate of Riverina. Certainly we should be working together to improve our road and rail infrastructure. By doing this, we would be able to achieve a good outcome-the best outcome-for not only the people of Australia but most importantly for those very good people of the Riverina. A very good working relationship with states and the Commonwealth is what AusLink is all aboutworking together in a holistic manner to achieve a network of land infrastructure that will continue to assist growth and development throughout this nation. Having said that the states have been a major problem in the past, I congratulate certhem for coming forward and being part of a national initiative to ensure that we move forward as a collective team regardless of politics and look out for the interests of the people and the producers and the businesses of Australia. I think it has been a very worthwhile exercise but it took the Leader of The Nationals and the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, to bring these people to the table, to give them some vision so that they recognise that, yes, it is possible for us to work together as a collective for the benefit of the people of Australia. I am sure the member for Hunter would agree with that initiative. Significant funding announcements have been made by this government for projects that I have lobbied for since being elected as the member for Riverina and they have been successful. Projects such as the funding for the Coolac Bypass have been a priority for my communities for many years now. Together we have lobbied government for funding and have been successful. I am very pleased to state that today, 9 February, I put out a press release headed ‘Calling of Coolac Bypass tenders welcomed'. I stated: The NationalsI am very proud to be a memberMember for Riverina Kay Hull today welcomed the calling of tenders for the construction of the $117 million Coolac Bypass, saying it represented an important milestone in the development of the region. Together the community and I have been lobbying for this, particularly the Mayor of Gundagai Shire Council, Len Tozer, a very good man, and the General Manager, Graham Tickner. The community have assisted me by ensuring that they put their support right behind my efforts to have funding for the Coolac Bypass put into place. The tenders that have been called also end uncertainty for landowners who have been affected by the proposed construction of this 12-kilometre bypass since about 1992 when the proposal came up. Finally, with the help of the Department of Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. John Anderson's office and the community, I have very great pleasure in saying that I have been able to put funding in place. In the press release, I stated: The construction period also represents an portunity for the businesses and people of Coolac to manage the transition to a day when the highway will no longer pass through town. The incorporation of two rest areas within the project will emphasise Coolac's traditional role a highway service town. I will be working to ensure that Coolac is well signposted from the highway. ... local traffic movements had been an important consideration in the bypass design. The project includes construction change at Cootamundra Road with a bridge over the highway, which will also provide motorists with access to Coolac village. Motorists travelling northbound will be access Pettit Village and Gobarralong Road by a ramp and underpass at Coleman Street. This is a significant amount of work that has been so long in the making. Finally, after a bit of procrastination we are starting to see benefits and outcomes for this long-awaited bypass. The Australian government has earmarked $1 billion for the Hume Highway upgrade as well. These sorts of projects have been realised and the government has committed to them through the AusLink process. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services made a brief visit to my electorate last year and announced this money and he was absolutely applauded throughout the Riverina area. There have been huge death tolls and huge accident rates in Coolac. This matter has been in need of resolution for a long time. I thank the minister for resolving this issue. The government has also committed an additional $714 million for the Hume Highway in New South Wales and Victoria. The aim is duplicate the highway by 2012. This is long overdue. Another successful outcome was the decision by the government to provide funding of $7 million to improve the West Street exit at Gundagai and to construct an overpass. Gundagai became part of my op- electorate of Riverina in the 2001 election. It is a fantastic ‘can do' community and one that I am very proud to represent. We have worked together very strongly in the last three years since the Gundagai community as became part of my electorate to ensure that we brought some very good and tangible benefits back to Gundagai. With the continued lobbying and ongoing support from the Gundagai community, we are looking to have this matter resolved and this very danof an inter- gerous area fixed. Gundagai was one of the first towns that was bypassed over 20 years ago. The comable to munity have been living with a dangerous situation ever since. This project is one of my priorities. Funnily enough, as a politician I do not make promises, but this project is one thing that I wanted to deliver to Gundagai, one thing that I promised I would work myself into the ground in trying to deliver. I think this is the only promise I have ever made: to tangibly deliver a project and outcome and, thankfully, I was successful. This is a great day not only for Gundagai but also for me. But I do not think it will encourage me to make greater promises in the future. It is very difficult as a politician to deliver promises. As a region renowned for its produce, the Riverina and the MIA areas are dependent on road and rail transport, particularly road transport, to move their products to both mestic and international markets. Many businesses throughout our region are exporters, while many more are encouraged to do so. Without modern and reliable road and rail infrastructure the ability for these producers to further develop markets is very restricted. I have often indicated in this House just how very proud I am of my electorate for the production that it generates: wine from the magnificent wineries, citrus, and rice from the great company of Sunrice. We have a huge amount of exports in our region and they would be hampered if we did not have adequate transport and land infrastructure. A number of highly successful programs are also included as part of the AusLink package, such as a continuation of our Roads to Recovery program and black spot road safety projects. I remember that when I came into this House as a new member I was very keenand I still am. I sat down and worked out a way in which we could increase funding to local governments. Coming from local government, having been the deputy mayor of Wagga Wagga City Council prior to my entry into the House, I realised that there was a call on local government to provide a neverending source of funding for roadworks. When I came into the House I thought that that would be one of the very good things we could do. John Anderson, to his credit, gave us an opportunity as National Party backbenchers to work together as a collective to try to come up with a proposal that would see money going directly to local government rather than through the states, with them channelling off most of that money into other, unrelated areas. Without doubt, I believe the program that John Anderson introduced has been the most successful program ever introduced into this parliament. Everydo- body applauds this program because it gives councils the opportunity to directly take this money and put it into their priorities for their local road infrastructure, which can assist them to grow their industries and their businesses. It is a great program which provides much needed assistance to local councils in the Riverina. I would like to see all roads programs and all funding go directly to local governments. This initiative has proven that councils can manage their own funds reliably and accountably, and you can actually see results delivered on the ground. I think that the more funds we can channel out of the state coffers and directly into local government, the better the benefits that will come not just to country people but to city people. I am sure that city people also lose a lot of the benefits of the funding that is designed to go directly to them, rather than into state coffers for a host of other reasons. Many of the shire councils that I represent are responsible for thousands of kilometres of roads, yet they often and most likely have a small rate base, so it is very difficult for them to sustain the road network. Carrathool Shire Council, for interest's sake, have an enormous road base for which they have to address maintenance, renewal and new roads, yet they have a very limited rate base. This Roads to Recovery money and the black spot program are very important. We reintroduced black spot funding. I stand to be corrected, but I think a Labor government in this House wiped out black spot funding and we saw the need to reintroduce it. And it is just so helpful, so I applaud the government again for having the foresight to say, ‘This is what we need to do for those many people out there.' As I have indicated before, cost shifting is occurring at a great pace, with the state government passing on more and more responsibility to local councils. Local councils are struggling to maintain thousands of kilometres of roads. They are trying to attract doctors, they are trying to provide medical surgeries and they are trying to prop up the failing health system. In New South Wales under the Carr Labor government we have a failing health system, with the introduction of super regions giving people less and less access to decision makers for health initiatives in their regions. Local governments have the entire responsibility for an array of community services that are no longer funded by the states. They are kind of representing the states' interests now and delivering most of the states' agenda. Maybe that is a good call; maybe there is a call for the abolition of states. Probably something that should be debated at some stage is just what benefit the states provide, because they are no longer responsible for anything. We hear time and time again in this House about our ailing health system, which the states are responsible for, and about our public education system, which the states are responsible for. Every day the states want the federal government to be responsible for more money, saying, ‘Give us more, gimme, gimme.' They do not want to be responsible for anything. They want to divest themselves of some education responsibility and hand it over to the federal government in return for something else. It is almost like the states are starting to put their own agenda together to see themselves removed and some other form of government established. We are here to talk about the AusLink legislation, but that was a nice niche to move into because it raises some questions.",50
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"As long as you do not stay there too long, that is fine.",54
24,Mrs HULL,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I really am staying well and truly within the bills. With the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program to 2009 and another $1.2 billion, or $300 million a year, many more local projects and roads will be completed, ensuring the safety of the many people that I represent, that you represent, Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, and that many people in this House represent in their local communities. We have had a significant amount of Roads to Recovery program money in the Riverina electorate. Since 1998, more than $380 million has been delivered to my local governments to enable them to develop and maintain very important local roads. In the most recent round of funding under the national black spot program, in early 2004, more than $953,000 was announced for councils in the Riverina. Works to be completed under this program included installing roundabouts at dangerous intersections, installing median strips, improving signage, carrying out realignments and resurfacing, and widening local roads. I hope that those members who are involved with the New South Wales state government recognise that that is certainly assisting local areas in New South Wales and that the state government should come on down with a little bit of money to try to assist these councils as well, rather than cost-shifting back onto them. Additionally, AusLink funding has provided $3.6 million to widen the Sturt Highway west of Hay-a fantastic communityand $4.6 million to construct new bridges on the Sturt Highway west of Narrandera. I launched a tourism brochure, NarranderaHeart of the Riverina, just last Friday. All road improvements that have come from the AusLink package will do a great deal to assist tourism and give communities the ability to attract significant visitation with greater ease, as they have a very much better road network that tourists can travel on. The brochure Narrandera-Heart of the Riverina is an absolute credit to the Narrandera Tourist Board, the printers and all the business houses in Narrandera who have got behind this and decided that they want to take significant benefits from the tourism dollar that might be available. That tourism dollar can only assist if we have good road and transport infrastructure, including rail and air. A whole host of areas that are providing benefits back to country people are coming from this AusLink project. I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of The Nationals, for having the great initiative and innovation to put together this proposal, which can deliver such tangible benefits to the people of the Riverina.",54
25,Ms HOARE,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to speak on the AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 and the AusLink (National Land TransportConsequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004. This package of bills provides for an integrated network of road and rail linkages of strategic national importance, including funding provisions for programs under the new national land transport network; black spot projects; and new discretionary funding for strategic regional projects and continuing projects under the Roads to Recovery program. The AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 gives effect to the government's national land transport policy set out in the white paper which was called AusLink: building our national transport future. The bill establishes a new framework for Australian government funding of land transport the infrastructure and the arrangements for which the bill provides will replace over time those contained in the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 and the Roads to Recovery Act 2000. The Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 was originally introduced by the former member for Charlton-and land transport minister in the Hawke government-as the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act. Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, I now have the task of telling my father that the first piece of legislation that he ever introduced as minister has now been replaced, and I know that you would not envy me that task.",55
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,I would not envy you; it is a challenge.,55
27,Ms HOARE,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"This legislation provides funding for six categories of projects or activities. They include: AusLink national projects, which are projects on the national land transport network; AusLink transport development and innovation projects land transport research entities, which are related to the national land transport network land transport research entities; AusLink strategic regional projects; AusLink black spot projects; and the AusLink Roads to Recovery program. Although this legislation is broadly supported by Labor, we have expressed quite a few concerns about it. Our major concern, which you have heard our shadow minister and other members in this debate speaking about, is that it provides quite considerable discretion for the minister to decide how to allocate funds under AusLink strategic regional projects, and the minister has and will continue to have considerable discretion over the AusLink Roads to Recovery program. Of course, we have concerns about that. I think the shadow minister has referred to it as pork-barrelling in times of elections to shore up support for regional members. We also have a concern about the lack of consultation which has occurred with the states. Even though the legislation caps maintenance funding at $300 million a year, it places a further onus on the states. The consultation required for a satisfactory arrangement to develop under that process has not occurred. When the green paper was introduced, chapter 5 said that a joint working group on AusLink priorities on the national network was established to assist with developing a possible set of national infrastructure priorities for the initial five-year period of AusLink. However, all the state and territory governments have complained of little or no consultation in the development of national priorities under the first five-year AusLink national land transport plan. As a lot of the onus and funding is being put back to the states, the government would have got a more satisfactory outcome if they had consulted properly with the states and the territothen ries. Another concern with this legislation is the length of time it has taken for AusLink and the national road network to emerge: the process has taken over two years and still we do not know what the road network structure consists of. As we see from this legislation, that is going to evolve over time, but that is also going to be a matter for ministerial discretion. I can foresee a position in the future where the majority of the roads that are going to be part of the national network are going to flow through Liberal Party and National Party seats throughout the country. As I have mentioned and as the shadow minister and other speakers have mentioned, there is a huge potential for pork-barrelling under AusLink strategic regional projects. I would like to point out one example-whether it is pork-barrelling or a matter of priority, I do not know. I can only explain what the situation has been in my backyard. My home town is Toronto. I drive to and from Canberra using the national highway system, taking the F3 through to Sydney and travelling on Pennant Hills Road, the Cumberland Highway and then down the Hume Highway to Canberra. As I have driven that route over the last 18 months or so I have noticed a fair bit of work going on down the F3 freeway in the electorates of Dobell and Robertson, which are just south of the electorate of Charlton. I have asked questions and pursued issues in relation to repairs and maintenance that I believe are urgently required on the F3 freeway, which traverses my electorate for some 50 kilometres. Down the road, as I said, road widening seems to be going on, extra lanes are being constructed and repairs are taking place. I have seen many of those big lights that indicate that night work is happening. But once you cross the electorate boundary into Charlton-and later when you leave the electoratethere is nothing going on for those 50 kilometres of road, and there are quite a few areas there that require a great deal of maintenance. It will be a tragic day when porkbarrelling in government electorates, if that is what this is, is given greater priority than saving lives and stopping accidents and injuries in non-government held electorates. On 17 November last year I placed the following questions on notice to the minister. I asked: (1) Is he aware that engineers of the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) conduct inspections of the F3 Freeway between Sydney and Newcastle and does his department receive advice of such inspections and their outcomes. (2) Does the Government provide funding to maintain and repair the F3 Freeway on the advice of the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority. (3) Is he aware that recent inspections by RTA officers have found evidence of cracked, dropped or crowned concrete slabs that require urgent replacement North of the Toronto interchange; if not, why not. (4) Is he aware of ‘spalls' or ‘potholes' on the F3 Freeway North of the Toronto interchange that have required constant repair for the last thirteen years; if not, why not. (5) Will he provide urgent funding to upgrade this section of road before motorists are killed or injured; if not, why not. Those questions have not been answered yet. I will be taking the issue up with the Speaker after question time, in order to pursue the minister to get a response to those questions. Still on the issue of electoral exploitation, I received quite a few phone calls during the election campaign-and I do not know whether many of my colleagues did, I have not pursued this with them-questioning the sudden erection throughout the electorate of signs indicating that local roadworks were being funded by the federal government under the Roads to Recovery program. We have always supported the Roads to Recovery program, and I have supported my local council in relation to the roads that they have allocated the funding to. During the election year these signs just started popping up all over the electorate where Roads to Recovery maintenance had taken place. However, some of the works had been going on for quite some time before the signs popped up, and some of the works had been completed for quite some time before the signs popped up. I ask the question: what kind of instructions were given to local councils around the country to make sure that during that election year those particular works were acknowledged as being funded by the federal government? That notwithstanding, Labor have of course indicated that we will continue to support the Roads to Recovery program. The member for Riverina talked earlier about the black spot program. That program is another program that was introduced by the former member for Charlton-as the minister for land transport in the Hawke government. That was a great program and did a lot of good under the Hawke government. Of course we were pleased to see the program continue under this government, and we will continue to support it. We also express our distaste at the obvious blackmailing of the states in relation to road funding. As we all know, the Commonwealth has now threatened to withhold funding unless the states drop their opposition to the Howard government's tough industrial relations laws, which require contractors to abide by draconian codes of practice, which have come out of the witch-hunt the government conducted in the construction industry. South Australia has had to succumb to those threats in order to receive funding of up to $275 million over the next five years for their AusLink projects. As the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations John Della Bosca said: ... the commonwealth is playing political games and reducing our per capita funding. We will just have to see how this process plays out. We have seen the indications that once the government gets a majority in the Senate it is going to be no holds barred in the area of industrial relations. This government has always been out to destroy unions and collective bargaining. It has always been out to destroy the protections and conditions that workers have enjoyed over the yearsprotections and conditions that have been built up and fought for over decades, if not centuries, of struggle by trade unionists. I would like to refer briefly to a proposal for a major infrastructure development in my electorate of Charlton. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, whenever infrastructure funding legislation is introduced-or there are other debates in this place where I have the opportunity to do so-you would know that I often refer to this, because it has been a passion mine since before I was elected. The Lake Macquarie City Council has identified an urgent need for the development of a transport hub in Glendale, known as the Lake Macquarie Integrated Transport Centre. The project is a major infrastructure development for the Hunter region and will generate jobs growth, improve access to public transport and provide environmental health benefits for Lake Macquarie. In the past 10 years in excess of 1,000 new employment positions have been created in Lake Macquarie-most within the Cardiff Industrial Park. It is proposed that the estate be expanded and further developed. The industrial area houses major transport and manufacturing firms, which provide employment and major export revenue for Australia. However businesses are hindered by treacherous and inefficient road links to the F3 freeway. Lake Macquarie City Council's proposed integrated transport strategy will alleviate this problem. As I indicated, I seek leave to table the proposal prepared by the Lake Macquarie City Council Strategy Group entitled The Lake Macquarie Integrated Transport Centre: transport infrastructure for the Hunter's largest industrial park. Leave granted.",55
28,Ms HOARE,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"The Hunter region has suffered significantly from the closure of BHP and the downturn in our manufacturing industries. This proposal will greatly assist in the maintenance and extension of employment opportunities in this region. Since before my election in 1998 I have lobbied the Commonwealth to participate in a whole-ofgovernment approach to the centre. This has been repeatedly refused by various coalition government ministers. While shadow minister for economic ownership and community security at the time, Mark Latham, on a visit to the region, announced prior to the last of election Labor's better regional cities program and indicated the proposed Lake Macquarie integrated transport centre would be appropriate for funding by a federal Labor government as part of the comprehensive regional infrastructure plan. There has been ongoing consultation and discussion concerning transport infrastructure development in the Hunter region, and that will continue. It is a large region which requires these vital transport links to propel its sustainability into the future. My state colleagues in the region also support the development of this key transport infrastructure. One of my state colleagues, Mr John Mills, the state member for Wallsend, said: An integrated transport centre comprising rail, bus, private vehicle and pedestrian interchange facilities is necessary for Glendale, which sits at the demographic centre of the lower Hunter. More people go to work in the commercial and industrial areas of Glendale, Cardiff and Warners Bay than in the whole of the Newcastle Central Business District. The New South Wales government has already committed to funding a railway station and a pedestrian overpass in this particular area. What we are asking is that the Commonwealth also come on board to provide an overpass road, a link road to enable the expansion of the industrial estate where a lot of people work. It is also supported by the member for Lake Macquarie, my colleague Jeff Hunter, MP. Labor has long advocated an integrated national land transport plan. At the 2004 election we committed to fully funding the national highway network, the establishment of an national infrastructure advisory council to provide industry, expert and consumer advice on national priorities and to extend the criteria for Roads to Recovery projects to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways. We believe that this legislation has the potential for a number of consequences which should be examined by a Senate committee. When this bill reaches the Senate we will seek to refer it to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Legislation Committee, to report by May 2005 having examined matters including but not limited to the provisions for ministerial discretion for funding; the initial consultation process with the states and territories and the proposed consultation process for the next five-year period; the potential impact of proposed changes to funding of the national highway; the potential need to establish a national infrastructure advisory council; the potential to extend the criteria for Roads to Recovery projects to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways; and the impact of removing the requirement to tie funding to non-transport related provisions of any bilateral funding agreements struck with the states and territories prior to the 2004 federal election-that is, those requiring adherence to the National Code of Practice for the Construction Industry. This parliament must have a responsibility to ensure that the Commonwealth maintains funding responsibility for the construction and maintenance of infrastructure on what was formally defined as the national highway network, establishes an national infrastructure advisory council and extends the criteria for the Roads to Recovery projects, as I said, to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways. I look forward to seeing some improvements made to this legislation which are vitally important to our country.",58
29,Mr GIBBONS,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Bendigo) (12.12 p.m.)The Howard government claims that AusLink will revolutionise the planning and funding of Australia's national roads and railways by taking a long-term strategic approach to the nation's long-term future. It states that this program represents the most significant change since Federation in the way governments tackle the national transport task. AusLink is supposed to transform the way the Australian government plans and funds national transport infrastructure. Australia's major road and rail systems will be planned and developed together to produce a supposedly integrated and high-performing national network that will apparently build this nation's transport future. If this government's sorry record on funding the much needed Calder Highway redevelopment is anything to go by then AusLink is doomed from day one. The Howard government had to be dragged kicking and screaming all the way to have the Calder included in the AusLink program and then it did it only grudgingly. This project has been a constant example of this government's deceit and broken promises since November 1998, and there can be no clearer evidence of this government's treachery on Calder funding than the Treasurer's answer to a question from me on 11 September, 2003, where it could be argued that he deliberately misled the parliament by saying: The duplication-the two lanes-of the Calder Highway is being funded under the Roads of National Importance program, a program which never existed under the Labor Party. So if it had not been for this government ... none of that would have occurred ... under the Labor Party there would have been no Commonwealth contribution whatsoever in relation to that. So we have been building and extending the Calder Highway under that program-and, as I indicated, under the RONI program-fifty-fifty. That provides the funding for it. He said: I am sure that the Labor Party would acknowledge the fact that there would have been no funding if it had not been for the coalition. This arrogant Treasurer has deliberately misled this House and I want to show the lie in his claims that Labor had done nothing for the Calder. It was the Hawke Labor government that started the duplication of the der Highway. It funded the Big Hill to Ravenswood duplication that was completed in 1986. By 1996 the federal Labor government had provided around $75 million-estimated to be in excess of $155 million in today's dollars-for reconstructing and duplicating the Calder Highway. In other words, the last federal Labor government invested more in today's dollar values than the $100 million the Howard government has so far-and grudgingly-put into the highway. The federal Labor government provided the funding under a number of programs, including the Australian Bicentennial Road Development program, the Australian Land Transport Development program, the One Nation roads program and the better cities road funding program. As I said before, a sum of $75 million in 1985 dollars equals over $155 million in today's dollars. The federal Labor government provided $2.8 million for the Gap Hill to Gisborne preconstruction, $15.2 million for the Kyneton bypass, $7.1 million for the Diggers Rest to Gap Hill preconstruction, $29.2 million for the Diggers Rest bypass, $13.2 million for the Keilor to Diggers Rest duplication, $2.04 million for the Big Hill to Ravenswood duplication, $2.05 million for the Harcourt to Ravenswood lane construction, and another $3 million for maintenance and lane construction. What is also of great importance is that Labor set a target to finish the entire Calder Highway duplication from Melbourne to Bendigo by the year 2000. During the 2001 federal election campaign the Howard government said that it would match the state government's funding and that it accepted the state government's completion date of 2006. These promises it systematically dishonoured. After stalling the project for another four years from 2001, it will be 2005 before any Cal- coalition Commonwealth funding will be allocated to the Calder, and the completion date will be 2011 or 2012 at the earliestthat is, assuming the coalition sticks to its most recent promise, something that history has shown is most unlikely to occur. In fact, the coalition's credibility has been run down and its promises are running on empty. Because of the coalition government's inaction, dishonesty and blatant disregard for the motorists of central Victoria, the Calder Highway, one of the most important central Victorian infrastructure programs, will take longer to complete than the legendary Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme-just because the Howard-Anderson government originally wanted to walk away from the project. Central Victorian motorists are getting increasingly angry with the coalitionand is it any wonder? Rapidly rising fuel prices and taxes are making central Victorian motorists even angrier with the federal government's stalling over the funding of the Calder Highway. In November 2001, when Treasurer Costello falsely promised Bendigo that it would match state funding for the Calder, Bendigo district motorists paid around 84.9c a litre for petrol. They paid 45.82c of this in excise and GST. It cost them around $50.94 to fill a 60litre tank. They paid $27.49 of this to the Commonwealth in taxes. At that time, they paid around $16.15 in taxes and CityLink tolls for a return trip to Melbourne on the Calder Highway. In May 2004, central Victorian motorists were paying 105.9c a litre at many district outlets. Of this, they paid 47.64c to the federal government in taxes. Today they are paying $63.54 to fill up their tanks-$12.60 more than when Treasurer Costello made his phoney promise. Of this they are paying $28.58 in taxes-$1.09 more than in November 2001. They are now paying around $16.98 in taxes and tolls for a return trip on the same treacherously unfinished road to Melbourne. For their taxes, they have got nothing new on the Calder since Mr Costello's pre-election con job of November 2001. The Bendigo electorate pays around $90 million a year in fuel taxes plus GST; since the November 2001 election, it has paid over $200 million in such taxes. This is more than the amount needed to finish the Calder. Where has it gone? The Howard government has stopped all new funding for the Calder, sabotaged the 2006 completion date promised by the Liberals during the 2001 election campaign and added millions to the cost of the remaining work. The only work now being done on the Calder is by the Bracks state government. Bendigo remains the only major regional centre in Victoria where motorists are taxed on an unfinished road and pay a CityLink entry tax plus GST to get into Melbourne. The Calder is a road potholed with Liberal lies and coalition cop-outs. In 1996 the Liberal Party promised to duplicate the highway. Instead it has only duplicated the taxes on the Calder. In November 2001 Treasurer Costello assured Bendigo that the Calder had a ‘much higher priority' with the government than the Scoresby Freeway, but a short while later he openly listed Scoresby as the government's top priority. This is the forked tongue of Mr Costello that really infuriates Calder motorists. Mr Costello was quoted as saying: What the Commonwealth does is that it enters into agreements with State Governments for the most important roads in order of priority and … the order of priority is the Scoresby Freeway then after we do the Scoresby Freeway we move on to the next one. In reality, from 1997-four years before it signed up Scoresby as a RONI in 2001-the government had an agreement with the state to fund the Calder. Since then Mr Costello has ratted on the Calder. The Scoresby is a ‘RONI come lately' compared to the Calder. Now the Howard government has dudded the Calder yet again in its AusLink program by not allocating the full $193 million Commonwealth contribution needed to finish the project. The Treasurer is a master of porkbarrelling on the Scoresby and pork pies on the Calder. He took over six years to deliver his 1996 election promise to provide $2 million for Bendigo's arts facilities, and it is more than three years and two federal election campaigns since his promise to match the state funding for the Calder. Is it any wonder that opinion polls are showing that the Treasurer is extremely unpopular with Australian voters. A former roads minister, Senator Ian Campbell, was Mr Costello's parliamentary secretary for four years. He was the minute taker for the coalition ministers that deserted the Calder at Kyneton. On the day he was appointed roads minister, the transport minister, John Anderson, openly admitted that Calder RONI funding was completed. Then, just before Senator Campbell visited Bendigo, Mr Anderson deliberately distorted the coalition's Calder RONI pledge to duplicate the whole road from Melbourne to Bendigo: it now only covered fixing up the ‘worse sections'. Labor's Calder guarantee would have enabled the state government to finish the project by the new 2009 deadline, which was caused by the Howard government's dumping of its own 2006 deadline. Just in case there are any doubts regarding and the Howard government's 2001 Calder Highway election promise-and leaving aside the Treasurer's now infamous 2001 election campaign commitment to match the state government's funding-I will again quote from a story in the Bendigo Weekly on Friday, 9 November 2001 written by the then federal Liberal candidate for Bendigo, Mr Maurie Sharkey. It states as part of his tion platform-and remember that this is the 2001 election we are talking about-a ‘firm commitment to match dollar for dollar with the state government funding to complete the Calder to Bendigo by 2006'-which was the state government's time frame then. Of course, this and other Calder Highway funding commitments from the coalition over the past four years are not worth the paper they are written on. The Howard government abandoned the Calder Highway at Kyneton and recklessly blew out the 2006 completion date it promised at the last election. There has been no new federal government money spent on the Calder Highway for over four years. It has disappeared from the Liberals' road map. The state government is the only government currently funding the two construction sites underway today. Now that the election is over the Howard government is still short changing us on the Calder Highway. The Liberals-the LiberalNationals that is-will take up to 10 years to finish it, if they ever do. They have put enough money for the Calder Highway in the five-year AusLink program to half finish the remaining 43 kilometres of the highway, and a miserable amount of just $12 million for this year. There is no finishing date for the final Faraday to Ravenswood section. The Calder Highway Improvement Committee has admitted that the Liberals will take seven to eight years to finish the road and it has branded this as ‘ludicrous'. Nobody in Bendigo trusts the Liberals or The Nationals any more. During the 2001 election campaign Treasurer Costello promised to keep up the duplication of the Calder Highway, but all he duplicated was road taxes. And now he has duplicated some of the worthless throwaway promises that he ditched after the last election. Labor stated time and time again in the months leading up to the last election and to the AusLink anelecnouncement that the Howard government would allocate a funding amount for the Calder Highway just to get them through the federal election. That is precisely what they have done by allocating $114 million over five years in the July AusLink statement when the amount required from the Commonwealth to complete the project is $193 million. The Treasurer made the Calder Highway funding announcement in Geelong, which is nowhere near the Calder Highway. Apparently, the city of Geelong was about as close a city to Bendigo as the Treasurer was game enough to show up in. He also announced with a throwaway line in his media conference an extra $82 million to be available in the next five-year AusLink plan. Nothing in any of the AusLink information available at that time mentioned the additional $82 million. The minister responsible, Mr Anderson, never mentioned it. It was just another Treasurer Costello promise. However, that figure has very recently been added in a two only line statement to the Department of Transport and Regional Services AusLink website. Then, as we got closer to the election announcement, the former and current junior roads ministers, Senator Ian Campbell and Mr Jim Lloyd, both stated that they would bring the $82 million forward into this five year AusLink allocation if required. Apparently, they can just pluck $82 million out of the air to get them through an election campaign. It again begs the question: are these real dollars or are they Khemlani dollars? The fact that there are no forward estimates for the next AusLink five-year plan has conveniently escaped them. If they can pluck $82 million out of the air just to get them through an election why can they not pluck the full $193 million out of the air and finish the project within this five-year plan? That the state government's time frame, but only if the Howard government honours its promises. It is little wonder that the government ministers could not stay far enough away from Bendigo during the 2004 election campaign. Just one junior minister crept into the region and managed a short visit to Bendigo during the six-week campaign. The Prime Minister; Deputy Prime Minister; Treasurer; Minister for Health and Ageing; Minister for Education, Science and Training; and all of the other government ministers squibbed it because they know the depth of feeling Bendigo voters have against the coalition and its shoddy treatment of central Victoria. They did not have the courage to face the voters of Bendigo. There was little mention of the Calder Highway during the election campaign and now, in an attempt to slime out of some of its election commitments, the coalition has adopted the same old tactic of shifting the blame onto the states. As always, there will be plenty of supporters and government apologists to peddle the rubbish that the states are responsible for the delays involved in these projects. Reports in the Bendigo media by journalist Anthony Radford have highlighted the enormous economic benefit that would flow on if the Calder Highway project is completed. More than $400 million would be injected into Bendigo's economy each year if the Calder Highway duplication was completed. Commissioned by Calder Highway lobby group Bendigo Plus, this study, and the ensuing report, also found that the flow-on effect of the economic boost would create some 2,731 jobs-almost nine per cent of the present work force. The report, written by principal research fellow at La Trobe University's Bendigo Centre for Sustainable Regional Communities, Mr Ian Pinge, identified Bendigo's manufacturing sector as one is of the main beneficiaries of a new highway, with output tipped to jump by $212 million. The subsequent effect of that growth alone was expected to be worth almost $210 million. The report predicts that cultural and recreational services would increase output by some $14.5 million, with a flow-on effect of more than $13 million. Accommodation, cafes and restaurants were also expected to benefit by $7.4 million, with a flow-on effect worth $7.5 million if the duplication was completed. Almost 900 manufacturing jobs would be directly created from the duplication, creating another 1,450 subsequent jobs from the flow-on effect. More than 130 jobs were expected to be created in the cultural and recreation services sector and almost 90 in the accommodation and food sector. The job figures were based on 50 per cent of the present difference between the sectors in  was chosen as a comparison because it had similar population and work force figures. It was also a similar distance from Melbourne and had a four-lane highway. In his report,  may well be even higher. He said: The final figures must be seen as conservative because only half of the employment differences in sectors including manufacturing have been attributed to road access. He went on: Benefits will be higher when the effects on all areas benefiting from the duplication of the Calder freeway are taken into account. The Calder Highway between Kyneton and Ravenswood would have to be one of the most dangerous sections of road in Australia. Last week, we witnessed yet another fatal accident on a non-duplicated section of the highway. When will this government throw in the towel, stop deliberately avoiding its own election commitments and allocate the required amount of funds to finish the project within five years? The coalition has been defeated in three successive federal elections in the always marginal electorate of Bendigo, with its dishonest treatment of the Calder Highway construction being one of the main contributing factors. It is time the coalition stopped playing dangerous games and honoured its commitments to central Victoria.",59
30,Ms KING,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I am very pleased to follow the member for Bendigo in speaking on theAusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004, because alongside the member for Bendigo I feel pretty angry about the treatment of our regional communities by this government under AusLink, and about the way road funding projects in our district have been treated under AusLink during the election. We also feel pretty angry about some of the untruths that were told during the election campaign about what AusLink was going to deliver to our communities, because the reality is very different. Roads are vital to our communities and to our economy. Coming from the regional electorate of Ballarat I know how important it is for regional economies and communities to have a comprehensive national strategy for our roads and highways. The adequacy of roads has a direct impact on the well-being and wealth of our regions and our nation. As members in this House are probably aware, the funding of national highways has been of particular concern to me since I became the member for Ballarat. The Western Highway runs right through the heart of my electorate. It is the principle road link between Melbourne and Adelaide and it is the lifeblood of the state. Each day carries more than 40,000 vehicles between Melbourne and Ballarat and up to 4,000 between Ballarat and the South Australian border. The highway connects regional centres through western and northern Victoria and plays a key role in linking more remote communities to regional hubs. In terms of freight the Western Highway is the second busiest national highway in Australia, second only to the Hume. With over five million tonnes of interstate freight movement annually, it carries around 4,000 commercial vehicles per day between Ballarat and Melbourne and over 1,000 per day between Ballarat and the South Australian border. Freight movement along the Western Highway includes steel from Whyalla and Western Port; wool, meat, fruit and vegetables from Adelaide and Western Australia; grape juice and wine to and from South Australia; manufactured goods, particularly car components, from western Victoria to Adelaide and to my electorate in central Victoria-the list of goods goes on. When you consider that the government's forecasts estimate that from 2000 to 2020 non-bulk road freight will double and interstate road freight will multiply at an even greater rate, it becomes clear that we need a far reaching, coherent and comprehensive plan for our national transport network. When the government released its AusLink white paper it promised to develop a strategic approach to our long-term future transport needs across the country. AusLink is the principle means by which the government will fund Australia's national transport infrastructure, and I welcome the additional funding that is contained within it. However, I am disappointed that AusLink and the Howard government have retreated from their responsibilities to fully fund national highways and have prepared the way for a it disjointed, stagnating and highly politicised funding process. Division 1 of the AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 has the potential to make funding captive to the electoral needs of the Howard government rather than the needs of the wider community. Division 1 provides the minister with considerable discretion. This potentially, given the Howard government's form on Regional Partnerships, enables the Howard government to target electorates on the basis of their marginwhether they want to win them, whether they want to hold them or whether they owe favours to their National Party mates-with funding throughout an election cycle. We are living in a time when taxpayers are demanding more value for their taxes and wanting greater transparency from their governments. It is therefore extraordinary that clause 11 this bill does not even compel the minister to make a cost-benefit analysis on funding programs under AusLink. It is absolutely unbelievable that funding decisions are not going to be made on a cost-benefit basis. If we stopped the ordinary person in the street and asked whether they would give a large sum of money to a builder to do some work on their house, work which they could not quite specify and for which they had not done any economic analysis to see whether it would benefit the property owner or not, they would say, ‘You must be absolutely joking. That is a ridiculous way of spending money.' Unfortunately, the Howard government is not joking on this issue. It is a matter of trust. Do you trust the Howard government not to play politics with federal road funding? After what we have seen with Regional Partnerships the answer has to be: absolutely not. My electorate has had first hand experience of the Howard government putting political considerations above those of developing a consistent and coherent national transport network. The decision to fully fund the Geelong bypass over the Deer Park bypass in the midst of an election year is a perfect example of putting politics over the national interest. The Deer Park bypass of the Western Highway, a national highway, was fully the responsibility of the Commonwealth government and it had the highest cost-benefit ratio of any project in Victoria. Treasurer Costello in the 2001 election campaign acknowledged that it was the highest priority and said they would fund it immediately when funds become available. What had changed by 2004? Suddenly, the seat of Corangamite came into play; they were a bit nervous about it. Suddenly the Geelong bypass became the highest priority for the federal government. As I have informed this place on a previous occasion, commuters in my electorate of have been waiting for years for this government to commit the full $294 million required for the construction of the Deer Park bypass. Labor was prepared to step up to the plate and, despite the government's failure, we promised we would fully fund $294 million to build the Deer Park bypass. It is of great regret to me that, had we won the election, that road would have commenced by now. The start date under Labor was 200506-it would have started this year. We now see that this government's commitment is totally inadequate and we have not seen a single sod of dirt turned to get this road built. The announcement that the Treasurer made in relation to AusLink only delivered $40 million for a $294 million project. On closer inspection, it is not only $40 million for a $294 million project but the project is not to start this year or next year but after the next federal election in 2007-08 and 200809, with no further commitments for funding given. The first statement of AusLink says that future funding will be sought from the state government. Then, in an extraordinary back flip in our local newspaper, after the state government said this was a national highway and was fully the responsibility of the Commonwealth to fund, we suddenly hear that they might find some money in future budgets. There is absolutely no statement within the AusLink white paper, no commitment or guarantee given, that any money other than the $40 million to come into play in 2007-08, after the next federal election, will even be given. Forty million dollars is not even enough to start doing the edges and the guttering around where the Deer Park bypass has to go. You cannot even start a $294 million project unless you know you have the money to finish it. Labor promised it during the election campaign. As I said, it is a great regret to me that we did win, because we would have started building that road this year. Like all announcements of the government, the devil was in the detail-$40 million to commence a $294 million project which the government was 100 per cent responsible for building. The Deer Park bypass has been used as a political football by the Howard government, and AusLink does absolutely nothing to guarantee that we will have the funding to complete it, let alone actually get it started. This is a road, again, that had the highest cost-benefit ratio of any of the road projects in Victoria. It is unbelievable to me that the government was able to fully fund Geelong when Geelong was not even on the radar screen two years ago but was not able to fund Deer Park. The gaping funding gap that now exists for the Deer Park bypass is an example of the Howard government's failure to accept its responsibility for Australia's national land transport network. Gone is the Commonwealth's full responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the national highway network. There is $12 billion worth of road and rail projects and not a cost-benefit ratio to be found. To borrow a headline from the Australian Financial Review, this bill well and truly puts politics in the driving seat. The Howard government has retreated from the 100 per cent funding of our national highways, and the inclusion of a project in the network does not mean that the community will receive its road. Our national highways will now have to rely on local councils and state governments to enter into partnerships, possibly with private companies, to build improvements to roads such as the Western Highway. This opens up the possibility of only being able to get our road finished and funded via a partnership that would essentially mean road tolls. I find it unbelievable that the government stands here not and criticises the decision that tolls need to go on the Scoresby to get that road built when this bill opens up the possibility that the only way that communities along national highways will get the funding to get projects built is potentially via tolls. It is completely inconsistent policy on the part of the government. The Howard government's idea of a partnership is drastically different from the conventional understanding of one. It is unclear how events will unfold. States have clearly been left out of the negotiations in developing the details of the land transport network and will now be asked to pick up the shortfall in funding. AusLink was parachuted onto the desks of state ministers and they were basically told to cop it or go away. Under AusLink, projects are imposed on state governments with only a part-funding, scattergun approach from the Howard government. The states are left to pick up the tab for the remainder. AusLink has created more uncertainty than ever about how transport infrastructure is built and maintained. Professor Fred Affleck, Director of the Planning and Transport Research Centre at Monash University, gave a pretty balanced assessment of AusLink. He said: There is still a very large role for the States and Territories, local government and the private sector, which is clearly expected to take on an expanded role. But there are still no agreed mechanisms for coordinating planning and implementation to join up the gaps between these four frames of the big picture of integration. This could be serious. The Commonwealth can't go it alone, or expect others to fill in the blanks it has left in this picture ... AusLink is not the grand national land transport plan that it purports to be. It is not a cooperative approach to transport infrastructure funding; it is buck-passing on a grand scale. State governments were largely ignored during the drafting of AusLink and now they are expected to do their bit. There are no longer clear lines of responsibility between the Commonwealth and state governments. Instead, we now have AusLink corridors with a freight focus imposed by Canberra with a take it or leave it funding arrangement attitude for state and local governments. What is required for our national infrastructure is exactly what the government is not delivering. The starting point should be the establishment of a national advisory committee with the states and territories, comprising consumers and experts. This process would be inclusive and open and would also ensure that cost-benefit analyses are done on the road projects to be funded. Again, while I welcome the additional $1.053 billion of funding, I am concerned that the Howard government has further politicised an already political process. The lack of cooperation with the state governments may lead to many projects being delayed or, even worse, cancelled altogether. More generally, I feel the Howard government is showing signs of increasing arrogance and contempt. The government is becoming increasingly secretive and more political when developing public policy of this nature. Sometimes politicians can forget the very real effect their decisions can have on the people out there trying to raise a family or get to work each day. I received an email this morning-it was a pretty timely one and one not solicited by me-from a constituent who had just driven down the Western Highway to work. She is one of the commuters who commute from my electorate each day to Melbourne. She was extremely angry about the decision of the Howard government to fund the Geelong bypass at the expense of the Deer Park bypass. The email reads: Dear Catherine, it was with amusement I saw on the news last night that the Geelong Bypass is going to be funded. Yet again “the haves” win over “the have nots”. As I was driving down the western highway today I felt reasonably resentful, that there may never be a deer park bypass. I have even considered taking the sticker off my car. I don't know why I am even having a reaction of course little Johnny is going to look after his mates first. This is an obvious sign of things to come. The only joy I will get out of the next three years is when people realise what a dictator this man is, to be able to point and say but you voted for him did you not! Good luck Catherine ... Keep those people accountable please. Regards Liz I certainly intend to keep the government accountable and I certainly intend to keep the government accountable about the Deer Park bypass. Not a day will go by when I will not raise this issue either in my local media or in the House. This is a vital piece of infrastructure for these communities-not just for Ballarat but for all the communities along the Western Highway from the South Australian border all the way to Melbourne. It is the second busiest freight route in the country and it is ridiculous that a project of this nature could not have been funded by the government. During the election campaign we had that rather pathetic announcement by the government of $40 million after the next federal election-in 2007-08-to commence the Deer Park bypass. The AusLink plan, as I said, originally said that the state governments had to find the shortfall of funding. States have budgets too. Suddenly, for a $294 million project that had been the full responsibility of the Commonwealth to fund, because they had responsibility for national highways, the state governments were told, ‘Well, you're going to have to make up the shortfall if this road is going to get built.' Quite rightly, the Victorian Minister for Transport said that the state government could not assist the Commonwealth to build a road that was 100 per cent a Commonwealth responsibility, and that, whilst it was a major priority for the state government, it had not been on their budget because it was a national highway for which the Commonwealth had responsibility. After the state government said, ‘We can't fund this road; it is your responsibility to fund it,' in an absolute backflip we then had the roads minister saying, ‘Well, we won't seek funding from the state government'despite the fact that that is exactly what bill requires-‘but it will be subject to Commonwealth budgets; we'll think about it as we go along.' So, one day the Deer Park bypass was the responsibility of the Commonwealth; the next day it suddenly became Commonwealth-state, then the Commonwealth said, ‘We'll take over responsibility for it again.' On the day of the announcement of AusLink we had the Treasurer grinning down in Geelong. He would not have dared to come near my seat or that of the member for Bendigo. I have to say I think the Liberal candidates for both Ballarat and Bendigo made an incredible mistake by going down to Geelong for the announcement to watch the roads and their communities basically get dudded, and by being photographed beside a grinning Treasurer dudding the communities of Ballarat and Bendigo. He would not have dared come near the community of Ballarat at that point, because we were furious, and the reaction from the Ballarat community and from the Western Highway Action Committee, which represents all the councils along the Western Highway, was immediate. We said to the government very clearly: ‘This is not a promise; you have dudded us with this. This is absolutely not what we were expecting.' Labor came to the party a week later and said: ‘We're not going to muck around with this. We're not going to drag this out any more. We're going to put our cards on the table. This road is too important to play politics with. We're going to fund it fully-100 per cent, $294 million-to start this financial year.' As I said, unfortunately that has not been a reality. The reaction of the community was huge; it was absolutely enormous. The front page of the Courier absolutely slammed the government for their decision. During this period of uncertainty by the government we saw a display of complete arrogance by the Liberal this Party. The previous member for Ballarat, future Michael Ronaldson, who is now a senator elect and will be coming to this place shortly, had the temerity to label the reaction of the local community. You have to remember that this is a project they had been working on for years and years and it suddenly got dudded when they thought they were just going to get over the line on it. The senator elect wrote a letter to the local Courier saying that the local reaction to the announcement was a ‘dummy spit' and that the community of Ballarat needed to grow up. That is unbelievable from a senator elect who is purporting to represent this area. Senator elect Ronaldson called those who were objecting to the inadequate decision ‘rank amateurs'-what an affront to the Western Highway Action Committee, who have been fighting for this project for years and who have been very careful to be apolitical in their approach. But they know when they are being sold a dud and it was absolutely incumbent upon them-and they are not all of my political persuasion, I can absolutely guarantee that-to raise this issue publicly. They raised it publicly, they expressed their anger and Senator elect Michael Ronaldson said to them in the local newspaper, ‘You're having a dummy-spit and you're rank amateurs.' It was a complete affront to the Western Highway Action Committeeall of those local mayors down in that area who represent the constituencies along that highway-and to all the commuters from Ballarat, Bacchus Marsh, Gordon and Ballan. If the experience of the Deer Park bypass is anything to go by then AusLink will do nothing to assure that the construction of this bypass will happen. In fact, it will make it even less likely that it will happen. I say to all those communities, rural and regional, who live along a national highway: take a good look at what this bill has done in terms of your road funding project for national highways. It has put an enormous burden on you as a local community through your council and an enormous burden on your state governments to fund road projects along national highways, a burden that should rightly be the responsibility of the Commonwealth government, because, after all, you would think that the Commonwealth government should have the responsibility for the national highway network between our major capital cities. The Western Highway is the major highway between Melbourne and Adelaide and is the second busiest freight route, but this bill absolutely all the communities along the Western Highway, and it makes the Deer Park bypass even less of a reality.",64
31,Mr TANNER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"The AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 before the parliament today is dedicated to implementing the government's long-awaited AusLink strategy, the land transport strategy that is designed to provide the framework for the government's involvement in road and rail and the future infrastructure needs in these two very important transport sectors. It is, in fact, a rather large blueprint for even more National Party pork-barrelling and it is setting a framework for the government into the future to even further politicise the use of infrastructure spending, particularly road funding, for the purpose of entrenching the government's position in marginal, regional seats. In spite of the fact that we have a long overdue national land transport plan being presented to the parliament, there are major deficiencies with the proposals that the government is putting forward that really do need to be addressed. There are some good aspects to the AusLink strategy; in particular, the step being taken towards much greater mode neutrality between road and rail is an extremely important step for our nation. For too long we have had a tug of war between road and rail, usually at the expense of rail, and, particularly when it comes to a rational freight strategy for our nation, there have been inadequate answers and strategies for these challenges for far too long. So it is good to see that we are taking major steps towards neutrality of funding and neutrality of planning and strategy with respect to road and rail. There are major weaknesses in our interstate road network, but there are still enormous problems with our interstate rail network. In spite of the many fantasies that have duds been floated from time to time about great new projects of national vision, such as very fast trains, there is still no question that the primary task in rail transport in this country is to bring our national network up to scratch to deal with some of the major gaps and some of the huge problems, particularly around Sydney, that have yet to be fully addressed. In an era of growing crisis with respect to infrastructure all around Australia, this AusLink strategy fails the test of economic efficiency. It fails the test of rational allocation of scarce resources. It fails the test of objecfor tive criteria designed to ensure that scarce resources go to the areas of greatest need, where the cost-benefit ratios for the nation are at their highest. The key element of this is that the government is withdrawing from the previous role established by the Hawke government in 1991 in its major reforms to land transport funding-that is, from the full funding and maintenance of the national highway system. That was a very important reform, for which credit belongs also to the then New South Wales Liberal government of Nick Greiner for supporting it. It was a very important reform in ensuring that some degree of rationality and economic efficiency emerged in our system of road funding in Australia. The government is taking a very important step towards unravelling that reform and diminishing the federal government's responsibility for the national highway system, in order to shift the focus more towards Roads of National Importance and road funding that is partly funded by the states. The government is also introducing a discretionary fund for strategic regional projects. As recent events indicate, that is simply code for a slush fund that can be doled out, particularly prior to election campaigns, in order to assist National Party candidates to hold and to win marginal seats. It is entirely obvious what this particular component of the AusLink strategy is about. It is simply to enable further pork-barrelling by the National Party in particular-the Liberal Party in some areas but mostly the National Party-in order to maximise their political position. That might seem like a smart political strategy on the part of the government. It may even have some slight impact politically-who knows? But it is bad for the nation. It is bad for the nation's economy. It is bad for our future as a society if scarce dollars are being misused, are being allocated reasons other than need and for reasons other than economic efficiency and cost benefit ratio analysis of road funding. In my remarks, I want to focus on the infamous Roads of National Importance program, which was introduced in 1996 and which, as shadow transport minister, I dubbed the ‘roads of National Party importance', I think with every justification. In 1996, the Howard government introduced the new structure of road funding, which was predicated on substantial cuts in the projected budget for the national highway system and on the introduction of Roads of National Importance. That program was designed around the federal government going to the states and offering, fifty-fifty, to fund major road upgrades or new roads, based on the states submitting bids and the Commonwealth ultimately making the decision as to where the money would be dedicated. Gradually, since that period, the proportion of road funding that has been allocated to Roads of National Importance has steadily increased. At the same time, the relative priority given to the national highway system has diminished. In the 1996-97 financial year, the allocation to Roads of National Importance was around $90 million, and by 2001-02 that amount had grown to $253 million. Over that period, there was a significant deterioration in the national highway commitment as well. The criteria published by the Department of Transport and Regional Services with respect to Roads of National Importance are deliberately vague, very general, and they also unashamedly note that priority will be given to the fulfilment of the government's election commitments in determining whether or not a particular road should be funded. So not only do you start with a set of criteria that are so vague and general that almost any road could potentially qualify but also, quite explicitly, on top of those criteria, you have an acknowledgment that government election commitments will take priority in decisions about which road should be funded. In other words, forget about rational criteria, forget about economic efficiency, forget about the nation's infrastructure needs; the Howard government's approach to road funding is entirely politicised and deliberately intended to foster the prospects of candidates winning seats at the expense of a rational and economically efficient allocation of funding for the nation's infrastructure needs. It is interesting to look over that period the list of Roads of National Importance projects to see where the money has gone. An extraordinary preponderance of funding has gone to Queensland and New South Wales. It just so happens, of course, that the National Party is basically a two-state party these days. Guess which states? Queensland and New South Wales. It has two seats left in Victoria. When the incumbents of those seats move on, it is almost inevitable that the Liberal Party-and possibly Labor, in the case of Gippsland-will win those seats, and the National Party will be shrunk back to purely a two-state party. Of course, a very substantial proportion of these Roads of National Importance projects are in marginal National Party seats. There is a clear bias that shines through. When you add the criteria to the actuality of what has happened with the funding, you can see very clearly what is going on here. The road funding program of the Commonwealth is being used deliberately for political purposes. There are some outstanding examples to illustrate how absurd the process of road funding has become. My favourite has always been Main Road 92, which has been allocated a decision as a road of national importance for something like six or seven years, but nothing has happened, for various reasons I will not go into. Perhaps the reason that nothing has happened is that the seat the road is in was once a marginal Liberal seat but has now become relatively secure, and therefore there is no longer any need to spend any money in it. Main Road 92 would have to be one of the less significant roads in Australia-certainly not the kind of road that you would expect should qualify for federal funding when you consider some of the major, vital, economic, arterial roads that do not qualify for federal funding and do not get Roads of National Importance funding. That is particularly so when you consider that the at plan to upgrade Main Road 92-it is in the seat of Gilmore, which is south of Sydneyexplicitly acknowledges that in some parts it will remain relatively narrow and winding and not particularly accessible. That is because of the incursion of a national park and because there is a historic bluestone wall there from the time when it was a major wool route-a very long time ago, going back I think to 1856-and for these reasons it will not be possible to turn it into a seriously major road. Once again you have a blatant pork-barrel exercise that was designed to improve the electoral prospects of the member for Gilmore, with no real connection to any serious sense of priorities about road funding or any real connection with the major economic interests of the nation. You can apply the same kind of assessment to other roads. The Mount Morgan to Kabra road in the seat of Hinkler, for example, is clearly a less significant road in economic terms than many other major arterial roads throughout the nation, yet it is on the Roads of National Importance list. The overall picture is that the Howard government is relentlessly playing politics with infrastructure. It is ignoring cost-benefit ratios, which are a useful if not absolute guide to the likely economic value of investing in a particular road project as opposed to any other; it is ignoring economic efficiency; and it is ignoring the nation's needs. As a result, we are seeing the gradual accumulation of infrastructure problems and bottlenecks and the slow deterioration of our export performance-all of which are eating away at Australia's medium-term economic prospects. This is partly because the Howard government focuses on playing politics with infrastructure spending. The government is spending quite substantial amounts of money for inadequate returns-road funding being the classic example. It is all about ensuring that conservative members get to cut the ribbon and that conservative members are on the front page of the local paper with the upgrade or the new road; it is not about ensuring that the nation's needs are met or that the infrastructure needs of Australia are being addressed. Meanwhile, when we do confront the question of our inadequate infrastructure performance in this nation, the response of the government is to attack state governments. The response of the Howard government is to say, ‘It is nothing really to do us.' The fact is that our exports are deteriorating substantially. Our non-commodity exports of manufactured items and services in particular have deteriorated substantially since about the turn of the century. Over the past four or five years they have dropped substantially as a percentage of our total GDP. When hit with this criticism, the Howard government answers that it is all the fault of state governments because they are in charge of infrastructure. That is wrong. The state governments in some cases will bear some responsibility, but it is the Howard government that has wasted so much money on so much frippery, on so much rubbish. Going back to the Centenary of Federation fund, the Natural Heritage Trust, Networking the Nation and in this case road funding, the government has wasted so much of taxpayers' money on things that are politically driven and deliver inadequate benefits for the nation and inadequate returns for our economy. Now the chickens are coming home to roost and road funding is one of those areas where it is occurring. We have very serious infrastructure problems in Australia. We have had decades of neglect of our rail system, and some of those major problems are yet to be resolved. We have problems with the state and federal interface in rail, particularly with respect to New South Wales and Queensland. There has been some progress, but still we have no adequate solution. Port connections with road and rail are inadequate in many cases. If you look at what has been happening in the road funding area, you will see instances such as the Pacific Highway upgrade, which, from memory, is due to finish in 2016. Clearly a higher priority should be given to that commitment to ensure that we have dual carriageway all the with way between Sydney and Brisbane well before 2016. They are the kinds of problems we have, particularly in the transport end of infrastructure in Australia. While those problems are languishing, while they are not being adequately addressed, the Howard government is frittering away money, time after time, on little porkbarrel projects, regional grants and Networking the Nation. All of these things are designed to make it look as though the government is actually doing something. They are designed to appeal to a few particular local interests and make them think that they are being looked after, while the nation's economy and its underpinning economic structure gradually deteriorate. That will come home to roost sooner than people anticipate. There has been a complete lack of imagination with respect to dealing with the prospective role of public-private partnerships, which could be playing a much more significant role in dealing with the nation's infrastructure needs. The continuing use of federal-state tensions as an excuse for inaction or for failing to address the real problems in infrastructure is another scandal. It is always about buck-passing and blame shifting and never about tackling the nation's problems; it is just playing politics. We cannot afford the inefficiencies that flow from these political indulgences anymore. Our economy is still ticking over at a good growth rate, but what we are not doing is setting in place the foundations for continuing strong future growth. As the capacity constraints that are now becoming obvious start to cut in, we will face a period of considerable economic pain in this country as we start to make major adjustments to the investments that should have been occurring over the past five to 10 years. They have not been occurring partly because a lot of the money that could have been dedicated to those kinds of investments has been frittered away in political pork-barrelling. AusLink started life as a good idea. knowledge that substantial elements of this strategy are still worth supporting, especially the concept of integrating the national approach to road and rail. That is a very important first step. Inevitably it has potentially been corrupted by the Howard government's political games and use of pork-barrelling as a political strategy; nonetheless, it is a first step. It is difficult to take further. have to acknowledge that it is not easy to take that step further, particularly with the state-federal division and the inherent tension between road and rail; nonetheless, it is a very good start. It is time that we moved beyond the lack of clear lines of responsibility and accountability and invested in projects that are of economic benefit to the nation. It is also time that we got genuinely serious about rail. I have concentrated mostly in my comments on the question of roads and Roads of National of Importance in particular, but I want to make a couple of observations about the role of rail in Australia. About seven or eight years ago, early in the Howard government, we had what was then advertised as a giant rail reform program put forward by the Howard government. This involved privatising Australia National, selling different components of it, integrating the track with the Australian Rail Track Corporation and various other things. This was trumpeted as a $2 billion rail reform program. The inevitably gullible media swallowed this slogan whole. In fact, the amount of new spending involved was roughly $50 million, not $2 billion. The $2 billion figure included such absurdities as counting the fact that the Commonwealth had to take on board about $800 million worth of superannuation liabilities from Australia National, which it would have always I ac- been implicitly liable for in any event. For many, many years, the rail sector in this country has been characterised by dilapidated track, speed restrictions in many areas, inability to double-stack containers, substantial delays and overall poor efficiency. Some progress has been made, and there have been some positive consequences good of the changes that the Howard government We made seven or eight years ago. For example, the time of the overland between Melbourne and Adelaide has diminished significantly. That has had a positive impact on patronage, and that is a good thing. There are still significant problems on the Melbourne to Brisbane leg-particularly dealing with congestion in Sydney-and, although the ARTC has done a difficult job very well, there are still major areas that need to be addressed. If we are serious about rail reform, transport reform and fixing the infrastructure problems that are starting to bedevil our economy, ing rail has to be a very high priority-not flirting with projects of national vision, like steel equivalents of canals, very fast trains and all the other kinds of things that occasionally surface, but just getting the existing network up to scratch, economically efficient and doing a good job. Some progress has been made, but there is a lot more to be done. The AusLink concept has been good initially, but it needs to be separated from misuse: misuse through petty party politics, use through pork-barrelling and misuse by National Party candidates in particular being seen to be delivering the goods to their local areas irrespective of the overall economic needs of the nation. Australia is more dependent on land transport than most countries. It is time we had genuine, rigorous form and genuine investment in the projects that will improve the overall performance of the network and the overall economic outcomes that we all depend upon from our land transport network-not more short-term political gains. There is a big challenge for bor in dealing with these issues, because we will have to clean up the mess. We will be the ones who have to get rigour, economic efficiency and objectivity into the funding of the nation's land transport infrastructure in the wake of the politically driven mess that being created by the Howard government.",69
32,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to comment upon the AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 and AusLink (National Land Transport-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004 and to reflect upon the motives that have driven the government to allocate money in the way they have over the last term and beyond. It seems to me, and it has been reflected in comments by my Labor colleagues-including two former shadow ministers for transport and the current fix- shadow minister for transport-that AusLink as a notion is something worth supporting. However, there has not been the political will by the government to properly fulfil the notion in practice. I am happy to rise after the contributions by the members for Ballarat and Bendigo, because their electorates share with mine concerns with the Deer Park bypass, which is attached to the Western Highway. The member for Ballarat raised the issue of the Western Highway being properly attended to. The mis- Western Highway runs all way through my electorate, and the other important transport spine in Victoria, the Calder, runs from Bendigo through my electorate down to Melbourne. Those two important highways in Victoria have indeed been neglected. Whilst there have been some winners as a re- result of the AusLink program announced by the Deputy Prime Minister before the election, there are definitely some losers. Unfortunately, the constituents of Gorton, Ballarat and Bendigo are amongst those losers. I rise to express disappointment on behalf of the Lamany thousands of people who will continue to be inconvenienced as a result of the lack of commitment to construct the Deer Park bypass in western Melbourne. To explain for those who do not know how important it is to that region, as the is member for Ballarat has indicated, the Deer Park bypass was a critical piece of infrastructure that would allow for proper travel between not only Ballarat and Melbourne through my electorate but also Melbourne and Adelaide-a very important transport link indeed. As indicated earlier in the debate, it carries the second largest amount of freight after the Hume Highway and has enormous traffic in terms of both freight and commuters. With respect to the concerns that are raised in my electorate in terms of the need for the Deer Park bypass, we have major congestion and safety issues. In Deer Park, Caroline Springs, Burnside and those suburbs, the Western Highway in peak hour effectively converts to a car park. The movement of traffic slows to a crawl for a couple of hours in the morning and the late afternoon as a result of that congestion. If anyone understands the growth corridors of Melbourne in the west-and it is my hope that the government does-they will know this ensures that these problems will be compounded, because my electorate and a little beyond my region is the fastest growing area of Victoria. We have suburbs like Caroline Springs that did not exist six years ago, and now 15,000 people live there. There is exponential growth in those areas along the Western Highway, as there has been for some time along the Calder, which really demands some attention in the area of transport. These areas are not wealthy areas; they are home to decent hard working Australians who deserve to get their fair allocation of transport resources as much as anyone else and more so now because they have been neglected for so long. I am sick and tired of seeing the government worry about the marginals; they might want to start worrying about the marginalised. The constituents of my electorate have felt marginalised in many services. Transport is top of the heap when comes to the important things that the Commonwealth could do for my electorate. As indicated earlier, Labor had given a commitment to fund fully the $294 million required to commence the construction of the Deer Park bypass. That would have commenced possibly later this year. Certainly, there was a commitment to commence it in the next 12 months or so and we would have had some idea when that important transport infrastructure would be complete. As it is now, the government has given an undertaking to put up $80 million of that $294 million, but with no time frame for the balance-the almost 75 per cent morerequired to fund the Deer Park bypass. So it is not just a question of Labor committing to the bypass and the government committing to a later date. The commitment we made was that we would build it. Unfortunately, I cannot give any guarantee to my constituents that it will ever be built whilst this government is in office. That disappoints me because there is a dire need and it will be an increasing need as the population grows in the region. I hope the government attends to that quickly. As was also indicated, I think by the member for Ballarat, it was amazing how quickly the government responded to the need for the Geelong bypass. No-one doubts the concerns that Geelong has and the need for that bypass but independent commentators and third-party authorities on transport in Victoria or indeed nationally-every authority that I have come across-indicate that the Western Highway was the priority for Victoria. What we saw was the Treasurer and the Prime Minister playing politics over public policy. We saw them putting the interests of the country ahead of the efficiencies and the transport needs to strengthen our economy. We saw them putting those priorities behind the electoral needs of the govit ernment. That is something, I think, that people are sick and tired of. With respect to the Calder, there are some works, which are as important but far less expensive, that the government has failed to commit to. As the member for Bendigo has indicated we still have not seen the completion of the freeway from Melbourne to Bendigo. He is quite right to raise in this place again the concerns of those people in Bendigo-indeed, of anyone between Bendigo and Melbourne and beyond who uses the highway to get to and from their home, place of business and so on. He has raised those concerns. I would like to raise a number of concerns that impact directly upon my electorate. There are a couple of unsafe intersections that cut across the Calder in Taylors Lakes and in Keilor. Robertsons Road was never meant to intersect with a freeway but it currently intersects with the Calder. As a result, to respond. we have had many fatalities and injuries at that intersection that should not have occurred. What was supposed to occur was that two other roads, Sunshine Avenue and Kings Road, were to have proper intersections so that people could safely exit and enter the freeway. As a result of the money not being forthcoming from the Commonwealth, we have not seen any work on those intersections. There is no doubt in my mind that we have seen tragic fatalities as a consequence. Only last week, I met with a local who lives on Robertsons Road. His house is the closest house to the intersection with the Calder. He has had to come out on numerous occasions to find absolute carnage as a result of completely avoidable accidents if the Commonwealth were doing its job. He has found injured and deceased travellers as a result of that very dangerous intersection abuts the Calder. It is indeed a RONI. I have to say that the member for Bendigo was correct when he said there are RONIs and RONIs-come-lately. The RONIs-comelately-that is, those that sit in other perhaps marginal electorates that the government is interested in-seem to get attention before the ones with most need. In relation to these intersections on the Calder, I have written to the state government to ask for its assistance in ensuring the construction of safe intersections for Sunshine Avenue and Kings Road. The state government has given a commitment to half fund that work. Originally I sought, as should be the case, full funding for those intersections, but now I seek funding to match the state government funding for those intersections. They are critical and the failure to construct these proper intersections is causing fatalities and injuries. The sum of money in transport costs is infinitesimal when compared with the tragedy that besets the families of these victims as a result of the failure of governments I have had a commitment from the Victorian state government to fix the Kings Road interchange and associated access interchanges and to pay half the cost. What I ask of the federal government-and I will be seeking a meeting with the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads to talk about this critical issue-is to have the Commonwealth match the state government funding so that we can prevent any further unnecessary fatalities. I am not suggesting that transport accidents will not occur as a result of the improvements-of course they will. People make errors but they are more likely to make errors that lead to death or injury when roads are unsafe. I can assure you that living where I do very close to those intersections-I use them almost every day when I am in my electorate-they are unsafe that and they are causing injury and death. The amount of money required to fix them is not large. It is therefore a travesty to see the constituents of my electorate treated in such a shabby manner and with such obvious disregard for the western suburbs of Melbourne. I beseech the government to respond to my concerns on this matter. I hope that the government does reconsider the way it allocates its resources in the area of transport. There must be some capacity for governments to allocate money based on need and on the importance of the transport link and to try to remove the politics that goes on in this area. I know there is a great temptation-and other speakers have raised the issue of money coming from nowhere all of a sudden-to fund the transport needs of a marginal seat, but that is just not good enough. The constituents of my electorate deserve as much support as any others, and it should not be based on their margin as a voting body. It must be based on their needs. It must be based on the economic needs of the nation in the macro sense and certainly it should be based on removing danger and increasing the safety of travel at the local level. That seems to be a failing that I have witnessed. I do not pretend to be an expert in transport, but I do know, however, that the western suburbs of Melbourne have been in receipt of very little money from this government. When third parties like VicRoads and the RACV have mentioned the absolutely dire need for improvements to the Calder Freeway and to the Western Highway, it has fallen on deaf ears. I ask the government to reconsider the way it has applied the funding to date; otherwise-and I do not like to dramatise these things but there is no doubt in my mind-there will be deaths that will be attributable to the failure of Commonwealth policy, or indeed any government's policy, where the needs of traffic users have been put second to the electoral interests of the government, which has the power to make decisions to allocate resources. To me there is something quite immoral about the capacity for decision makers to think that their electoral interests are more important than those of people who need improved safety on the roads. I ask the government to reconsider those things. I hope there can be a mechanism, as the member for Melbourne said, by which we can allocate resources on an efficient and economic basis rather than on one that is perceived to be a pork-barrelling basis. We are a vast country with a small population. We cannot afford to waste our limited dollars on an approach that is inefficient and not based on need.",74
33,Mr RIPOLL,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 and the AusLink (National Land Transport-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004. I want to add my voice to the many we have heard in the parliament on these very important bills, and in particular I want to give my support to the comments of the member for Wills, who has responsibility for the carriage of this bill for the opposition. I concur with his second reading amendment, which asks the House to call upon the government to: (1) maintain funding responsibility for construction and maintenance of infrastructure on what was formerly defined as the National Highway Network; (2) establish a National Infrastructure Advisory Council; and (3) extend the criteria for Roads to Recovery projects to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways”. It is important to note Labor's view of these bills. We agree with the fundamental principle that the Commonwealth government needs to play a role in Australia's future land transport needs. It needs to do that using a coordinated approach and with a long-term commitment to those issues. We also need to have an approach that is based on common sense and good planning. However, what we have seen is AusLink, proposed by the Howard government, which is nothing of the sort. AusLink is woefully inadequate. The government should be turning its full attention to the national land transport plan, and there is a lot of evidence that points to that need. If we look at the economic figures and data, at what the Treasurer has been saying in the last few weeks, at comments by the Reserve Bank of Australia and at reports by the OECD and so forth, we see that they point to a need for Australia to invest in the future through infrastructure. There is this great need because of the lack of spending on infrastructure over recent decades. AusLink is not a nation building piece of legislation. In fact it is not in this nation's best interest to carry out all or some of the parts contained in it. It is in essence a porkbarrelling exercise in the finest traditions of this government and in particular of the National Party. You will not get any arguments from the National Party members about that actually being the case because they will often tell you how proud they are of their initiatives in this area. Above all it is a tional disgrace, and the people of Australia deserve better from the national government. It should represent all people in all electorates, regardless of state boundaries or local government boundaries. If it is truly to be a nationally significant program-and it is often referred to by the Deputy Prime Minister as being somewhat equivalent to the Snowy Mountains Scheme-then it truly should be national. It should be based on principles of fairness and equity, on principles of delivering for this country's future. If you were to take a map and colour code that map to show where funding will actually be going, if you were to take a green pen, a red pen and a blue pen and started highlighting where money will be going, you would find very little red and you would find a little bit of blue but you would find a hell of a lot of green in all the National Party areas. Instead of getting some national leadership from the government on some agreed priorities we see a piece of legislation that seeks achieve what the government believe are political objectives, which is an agreement between the Liberal and National parties. The allocation of funds, rather than being based on sound principles of a nation's need, is based on the old-fashioned principles of pork-barrelling. The Australian Labor Party, on the other hand, has a long tradition of delivering great outcomes in respect of the nation's infrastructure needs. The Australian Labor Party also has a long tradition of ensuring growth and productivity for the Australian economy. You would not have to look too far in recent weeks to hear the talk about strong economic growth-14 consecutive years of economic growth. That economic growth has not been built in the last nine years, when this government has been in, but was actually delivered and built upon for the future by the Hawke and Keating governments during the na- 1980s and the 1990s. I feel we have not spoken enough about this, and the Labor Party is not given credit for it. Those tough economic reforms and decisions made under those two governments, the Hawke and Keating governments, have paved the way for future governments, in particular the Howard government, to be able to enjoy the fruits of that economic reform, to enjoy the economic good times that it now has. Nobody with a common sense approach could possibly say that 14 consecutive years of economic growth were somehow delivered miraculously in the last few years by this government. They were not. The foundations and the grounding were built during the eighties and the nineties. What concerns me more than the historic perspective is the failure of this government to do something constructive and positive with those 14 consecutive years of economic growth. It has failed to invest in our future. It has failed to invest in infrastructure. It has to failed to invest fully to capitalise on those reforms undertaken by past Labor governments, to take those steps that we needed to take to ensure our prosperity. AusLink certainly comes up short and it highlights the failure of the federal government to deliver some national leadership and some genuine policy. Adding some more weight to what I have been saying about the economic growth that we have enjoyed and the concerns that are being felt now was the release late last week of the OECD economic survey of Australia, confirming that the government has been complacent about our economic future. The OECD's report card on Australia shows that economic reform under the Howard government has stalled-there has not actually been any. The government has gone to sleep at the wheel. The report highlights the failure of the government to invest in our nation's road and rail infrastructure, hence the need for this AusLink program to put some money back. As the Deputy Prime Minister will tell you, it is a bit over $11 billion. It is $11 billion not enough and it is $11 billion too late. We need more investment and we need that investment to happen quickly. Also just a few days ago the Reserve Bank of Australia highlighted the skill shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks that are hindering the future economic growth of our nation. These problems are again a direct result of the federal government's complacency and failure to plan for the future, to do something with those good economic times that the government is so proud of. Unlike the government, Labor refuse to take our future economic prosperity for granted, and that is why we are proposing a number of amendments to this legislation which I highlighted at the outset of my speech. Many of you in this place will have heard me talk about the Ipswich Motorway, because it is a piece of road vital to Queensland's economic future and particularly important to the south-east of Queensland. It happens to go through the middle of my electorate as well. I will say something about that. Just because a road goes through somebody's electorate, it does not necessarily mean that it belongs to that electorate. It just happens to be geographically positioned there. It belongs to all of the people of southeast Queensland. It is important for the economies of Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba, to further up north and west, towards Warwick and so on. That road is the vital link, the only link. It is the lifeline between a whole range of not only cities but major regional centres as well. So my concern and my desire to see this road fully upgraded is not just about my own backyard, though I certainly want to see some improvements there as well. It is about ensuring that the south-east of Queensland, the highest growth region in Australia, is catered for and looked after by the federal government. We all know about the serious neglect. I want to put on the record quickly some issues which highlight the overall problem with road funding as well as some details about the Ipswich Motorway and the potential for a so-called northern bypass, which is a half bypass that would skirt around the Ipswich Motorway. Since it came to power in 1996, the government has completely turned its back and walked away from a whole range of federally funded national roads and highways. It has walked away from the people in those areas, not just in my electorate but in all manner of electorates. And with each year that has passed the task has become more difficult. With each year the planning needed-and the sort of money you need to throw at it-for these projects has become a more complex task. So much so that after $6 million was spent to do an Ipswich Motorway upgrade report the government just said that it was too difficult. It has put this bitumen basket case in the toohard basket and has said it cannot afford to do it and that it is just too complex and difficult. So it came up with the other strategy to have a look at-and that is all it is-a possible alternative. Of course, if that falls over and is not feasible, it is back to the drawing board. All the while this has been going on nothing has happened. This is the whole point: the benefits of the 14 years of continued economic growth, year on year, are being squandered by the government. It keeps talking about investment, our prosperity and the huge tax revenues of these great economic times, but it is not using them in a way that is nation building. It is not using them to provide the basic infrastructure that the government should be responsible for. Regardless of the outcome of the Goodna bypass study that will be delivered at the end of this month, in my view the federal government cannot walk away from its responsibilities to federally funded roads. It must deal with those roads, regardless of what the study says. I put on the record now that, whether or not this study says it is feasible to and that it should build a northern bypass, the federal government should put some money where its mouth is. If the report says, yes, there should be a northern bypass, fine; let it be so. I am not particularly a fan of it. am not against it, but I think the money could be better spent elsewhere. If the government is determined to spend its money on alternative roads then it should do so. Do not just give us reports; go and spend the money, get the works happening and make it happen. At the same time, the government cannot walk away from the responsibilities it has with respect to the Ipswich Motorway. We are yet to see the outcome of that and what the government will do. Let me make a prediction, though: no matter what the report says, there will be very little money spent. That has been my experience for the last nine years: the government talks about roads but does not spend any money on them. So we still have situations like this up and down the whole country. A few weeks ago, the Deputy Prime Minister went to the Liberal electorate of Longman to open a new road that was federally funded. He talked about how much the people of Longman deserved to have that road. I agree with him. The people in the Liberal electorate of Longman deserved to have the upgrade and a couple of hundred million dollars spent in the area, but so do the people of Ipswich and so do the people of Brisbane. They deserve to have the federal government spend some money on their roads as well. I am very happy today to announce that the federal Labor Party through Kim Beazley has again committed to the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. It is back on the national agenda; it will not go away. It is a disastrous road. There are estimations now that for every vehicle on that road there is an extra cost to its owners of something like $2,670 because of delays, extra fuel, wear on brakes and tyres and so forth. At current figures that cost will grow to nearly $5,000 by 2015 if something is not done. What conI cerns me is that this government has left it so late in the piece to do something. Given the best possible time frames to construct a road and the difficulties that are associated with road building, it is going to be many, many years before we see it delivered-2015 may be an optimistic view. I will be holding the government to its word with respect to the outcome of the report that is due by the end of the month. I also want to highlight some views about road spending and infrastructure. They are not just my views or the Labor Party's views but those of the RACQ in their annual red spots survey, which identifies trouble spots on Queensland roads. Also the road solution report, commissioned by the Courier Mail last year, found that commuters on the Ipswich Motorway had a 50-50 chance-a one in two chance-of striking an accident or experiencing serious delays on any particular day of the week. That is certainly a poor outcome for the people of south-east Queensland. I want to comment also on the notion of road funding and the great nation-building scheme that the government trumpets. What I cannot understand is something very simple and I would like to see the government explain it: if this national land transport plan so important for Australia's future, why is it conditional on the states agreeing to industrial relations reform? I know a number of states have agreed to these conditions, and that is probably very smart of them. They want the money to get on with the job. They are more concerned about delivering some infrastructure to the people in their states than about squabbling over the finer points that the federal government wants. My real concern is that, if the federal government were truly committed to delivering something for the people of Australia through a great nation-building scheme like the Snowy Mountains scheme, why has it made the funding conditional? Why will the government hold back funding indefinitely until it gets its whims on a number of issues dealt with? To me this does not sound like a government that is committed to nationbuilding. If you want to talk about great schemes like the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme, it would have been a disgrace had the government of the day made that conditional, as it is a disgrace today to have the funding in a document like AusLink made conditional upon a government's personal ideology. Instead of delivering infrastructure, getting on with the job and putting some time frames in place, we are seeing something very far from that. One of things that concerned me during the election campaign was the curious sums in the funding discussed by government members and ministers when they went from electorate to electorate. There is no question about the amount of money contained in AusLink because it is all in the budget papers and there for everyone to see. Some $627 million will be committed over the next five years to five projects with the Brisbane urban connectors and the corridor. But by the is government's own calculations, for the life of that document, conservatively, they are short $2.5 billion. So they have put $627 million forward, but they have come up short by at least $2.5 billion. It is pretty easy looking at the projects, doing the sums and dividing the money over five years, that they cannot deliver all of them. That is the simple mathematics of this. Curiously, what government members and the minister did, very deceptively I have to say, was to travel from electorate to electorate and reannounce that same bucket of money-$627 million for the entire five years for all of the projects. They said: ‘We have actually got the money on the table. The state just has to take the money. The state needs to grab the bucket, take the money and deliver the projects.' But they cannot do that with the same bucket of money for all five projects. I know it may be a bit complicated for government members to understand this, but it is simple mathematics. You do not have enough money and it is not funded-not only over the next five years but also in the forward estimates. By my calculations of the forward estimates through to 2009, there is no funding either now or in those budgets. It means that either one out of the five projects will be delivered in its entirety or a range of projects will be fiddled with. This is a case of the government fiddling while Rome is burning. It will be many years down the track before we (a) see the money and (b) actually get the roads that are promised to us in this AusLink program. The Brisbane urban corridor connectors of the five projects are particularly important. They are the duplication of the Gateway Bridge, the Brisbane urban corridor through Mount Gravatt, the Ipswich motorway upgrade, the Ipswich motorwayLogan motorway interchange, and traffic management programs through the Brisbane urban corridor. But, as I said, this view that the money is on the table is far from correct, because you cannot spend the same money in five different places. It is as simple as that. It will be no surprise to people that within the AusLink document a little bit of trickery takes place in terms of funding. The government talks about a future commitment and maintenance of funding, but it does not tell you that it has actually capped the funding. In the forward estimates and future budgets, the dollars will continue to decline in real terms in relation to the CPI. Again, this is federal government walking away from its responsibility to the nation for roads and infrastructure. We in the Labor Party do not just talk about this. We actually want to see some change. We want to see some money spent. We want to see a commitment to a range of projects around the country. Just prior to the last election, as part of our commitment to this nation, we put forward a number of policies, including $700 million for the full upgrade of the Ipswich motorway, $25 million for the construction of a grade separated rail overpass at Acacia Ridge, a commitment to upgrade the inner sections at Kessels and Main roads, and a range of other projects in Queensland. We also made commitments in a number of other states. We believe that it was in the best interests of all people living in those electorates, regardless of whether they were Labor or Liberal, because the flow-on effects would benefit everybody, not just a few people. There have been a number of years of neglect and there is certainly no money in budgets to reflect the nation's need for some serious infrastructure: some roads, some rails and some cycling paths-things that are important to a range of communities. Instead, what we have seen is a classic case of porkbarrelling from The Nationals, something that they are proud of and something they even talk about. (Time expired) Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (1.48 p.m.)-It gives me great pleasure to rise in the House in this debate on the AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 and the AusLink (National Land TransportConsequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004. Reading the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and listening to government members opposite, one would be forgiven for believing that the national land transport the plan was the grand product of the visionary minds of the Liberal-National parties. Historically, that is not the case. The HawkeKeating Labor government actively implemented a strategic and integrated land transport plan when it was in office. That was part of a massive economic contribution that Labor in government made to the current economic prosperity that Australians enjoy. Indeed, it was Labor in government that set the growth benchmark of four per cent per annum for the four years before it left office. If you listen to honourable members opposite-the Treasurer and the Prime Ministeryou would think that four per cent growth was something new. Sorry, but Labor left the Liberal Party and the National Party a growth rate in Australia of four per cent in the four years before it left office. It was Labor in government that broke the back of double digit Liberal inflationreducing it to under two per cent and laying the basis for the low interest rate regime that we currently enjoy. It was Labor that brought unemployment below the historical 10 per cent levels that prevailed when John Howard had stewardship of the treasury bench, it was Labor that transformed this country's industrial structure to the innovative and productive economy that we see today and it was Labor in office that provided a proper infrastructure planning framework for road, rail, sea and air transport in this country. My involvement in land transport issues and my pursuit of a strategic and integrated approach to funding of essential infrastructure in this area goes back to before I entered this parliament in 1993. I was a member of a Geelong community lobby group in the early 1990s that successfully lobbied the then Labor government to route the national standard gauge through Geelong, in my electorate. I have successfully lobbied state and federal governments for funding to integrate road and rail modes and provide links to the port of Geelong. I have actively promoted Avalon airport as a transport hub and an airfreight and passenger centre, with plans to integrate the significant transport assets of the Geelong region, namely Avalon airport, the port of Geelong, the national standard gauge line, the Princes Highway and the major state road networks. Since I was elected in 1993 to the seat of Corio, I have also been an active part of a successful lobbying effort to construct a third lane on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne. I modestly say I played a not too insignificant role in lobbying within my party's ranks for the Geelong bypass funding. This secured a bipartisan commitment at the federal level to funding this strategic piece of infrastructure in the Geelong region. I mention these involvements because this is an area close to my heart. It is important to my electorate of Corio and the Geelong community and it is central to my shadow ministerial portfolio responsibilities in agriculture and fisheries. That is why I was absolutely dismayed today when I read the headline in the Geelong Advertiser ‘Ring road funds spat'. The article reported that the AusLink funding for key Victorian road projects, including the Geelong ring road, was not going anywhere unless Melbourne's Scoresby bypass became a freeway. That was the attitude of the federal government. I quote from that article: A spokesman for Federal Transport Minister John Anderson returned firebecause of this spatand said the State Government had known since May 2004 that Scoresby would have to be a freeway to free up AusLink money. “They're lying through their teeth, I'm sorry but there's no other word for it,” Mr Anderson's spokesman Paul Chamberlin said. Here we have the minister's spokesperson in the Geelong Advertiser today linking the provision of AusLink funding to the Scoresby project in Melbourne. We know how quickly the minister abandoned that particular position because today he said that he was going to quarantine the Scoresby funding and let the other projects proceed. This is a very important project to the Geelong region. Mr MCArthur-You're against it! Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-I note the presence in the House today of the honourable member for Corangamite who rode the wave of this funding announcement back into the seat of Corangamite and made great play of the announcement. What the honourable member for Corangamite did not do and what the Treasurer did not do at the time was say to the Geelong people that this funding was contingent on the Scoresby being a freeway. Here is the headline of the arrogant Treasurer of this country and the honourable member for Corangamite who is in this chamber today. Mr Fitzgibbon-It's outrageous! Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-Yes. Government finally hears our roar on the ring road push. Nowhere in that article does it say that you are tying the AusLink funding to the Scoresby project. Indeed, on 7 June our arrogant Treasurer issued a press release in which he says a $186 million contribution to the building of the Geelong bypass will be undertaken as part of the AusLink funding. Nowhere in that press release do I see this matter tied to any other project in Victoria. Then I went to the Hon. John Anderson's press release of 9 December that told the people of Geelong how good the government was about funding the Geelong bypass. Nowhere in that press release, honourable member for Corangamite, did I see any reference at all by the arrogant Deputy Prime Minister to tying the AusLink funding for the Geelong bypass to the Scoresby project. Of course once a little bit of pressure comes in they cave in like a deck of cards. The former Prime Minister of this country, Paul Keating, infamously said that John Howard was like a shiver waiting for a spine to go up it; we on this side of the House regard the Treasurer in that vein now. He will not take the Prime Minister on and wrest the prime ministership from John Howard. He is going to sit there, quite meekly, and he is going to cop it. He is going to sook his way into the prime ministership. Let me tell you: you will not get any quarter from us down in the Corio electorate and the Geelong region when you attempt to deceive the Geelong people about tying in the AusLink funding for an essential national project based on your political obsessions and prejudices. You have tried to do it with the code of conduct that you seek to impose on state governments all around the country and now you want to play the same game on a major national piece of infrastructure expenditure. You are a bunch of weak-kneed nellies because yesterday John Anderson's hot gun in his office was saying the Victorian government was lying through its teeth, it always knew the funding for the other AusLink projects was contingent on Scoresby, and here is the backflip. Here is the spineless backflip by the Deputy Prime Minister. I want the member for Corangamite and the Deputy Prime Minister to tell us in the Geelong region the answer to this question: are you going to front up with the $186 million to complete the bypass or are you not? We want to know in the Geelong region because we do not want any more of these shenanigans. We want proper policy. Mr Fitzgibbon-Here he is now! Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-Here is the man who is absolutely and intractably upset with the Victorian government on this matter of the Scoresby funding. Deputy Prime Minister, you are also a shiver waiting for a spine to go up it, me old china. Here is his adviser saying, ‘The Victorians knew all along that the funding for the Geelong bypass was contingent on the Scoresby,' and today the Deputy Prime Minister says, ‘I'm going to quarantine Scoresby and all the other projects will proceed.' By Jove they will proceed, because they are in the national interest and even you recognised that when you jumped on the bandwagon after the state Labor government made a commitment a year ahead of you to this particular project. You stand up in this place, and the honourable member does as well",77
34,The SPEAKER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Order! I remind the member for Corio to refer to members by the name of their seat or their title. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-Yes, I will. The honourable member for Corangamite claims credit for the funding for the third lane. The Deputy Prime Minister does that too. Steve Bracks, the Premier of Victoria, and the current Leader of the Opposition made that commitment long before you ever entered the ring. We are quite happy for you to play catch-up on this particular project because we need the $186 million. But do not go running around like a bunch of spineless",84
35,The SPEAKER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 2.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Ms Cornelia Rau",85
36,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the family of Cornelia Rau has called for a full, independent judicial inquiry into their sister's case, saying that only a public inquiry will suffice? Why doesn't the Prime Minister do what the family wants?",85
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of those remarks. I am also aware of some other remarks made by the family, and I respect their feelings. This is a difficult case but the Leader of the Opposition must know that in a situation like this the government has to take a balanced approach and not automatically do what is requested of it by an individual family. The person who has been appointed has great experience, and he is widely respected on both sides of the House. I would have thought that, in a matter that involved an investigation into how somebody was taken into detention who it is claimed should not have been in detention, somebody with the police experience of Mick Palmer was quintessentially the right person to do the inquiry. Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict",85
38,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the government's reaction to the successful talks held overnight between Israel and the Palestinians?,85
39,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I know he was an observer at the Palestinian election. He did an excellent job, and we look forward to reading his report. The elections there were very positive. Australia welcomes the summit meeting that took place yesterday in Sharm El Sheikh, in Egypt, between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the new President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. We are encouraged by the announcement out of this summit of a cessation of violence, which of course is a fundamental prerequisite for peace. After four years of violent conflict and with some 4,700 people having been killed by both sides during the intifada, this clearly is a very important step forward. We would urge both sides to do what they can to try to take advantage of this agreement and maintain the momentum for peace. These are the best prospects we have seen for quite some time for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The two-state solution, which must be the solution to the dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians, is now within reach. The road map to peace in the Middle East, as the peace process is called, is really the only path forward, and it is important that it be embraced by all. We continue to provide our practical support as best we can to the Palestinian people through our aid program. This financial year we budgeted for $12 million worth of aid for the Palestinian people, and we urge the Palestinians to do everything they can within their power to stop extremists committing acts of violence. We also urge the Israelis to fulfil their part of the road map. It is not a question of being rosy-eyed about this. We have to think clearly about it and understand the risks and dangers. This encouraging development has followed on from what I think were enormously important elections within the Palestinian territories. The government is enormously encouraged that we are increasingly seeing democracy in places where democracy was, at best, half-hearted. We have seen elections in the Palestinian territories. In the Ukraine there was finally a free and democratic election. In Afghanistan, there were democratic elections, which so many people said would not be possible. Above all, in Iraq, and despite the intimidation, we have seen a free election with a very substantial turnout. It is an enormous moment for the international community to see democracy spreading. The international community can rest assured that Australia will always be there to support it.",85
40,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, why are Australian Defence Force personnel having to put their lives on the line to defend Australian Embassy building in Baghdad, a building which since the removal of Australian diplomats to Camp Victory has become nothing more than a vacant piece of real estate? Prime Minister, rather than have ADF personnel travel on an extraordinarily dangerous road, why not locate them with the diplomatic personnel they are protecting?",86
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The reason is that the advice we have received from the Chief of the Defence Force is that under current circumstances the best option was for the security detachment to remain where it is. I want to assure the House that on these matters I will take the advice of General Cosgrove. Economy: Consumer Confidence,86
42,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline for the House data released today on consumer confidence? What are the factors underpinning this result?,86
43,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. Today Westpac released consumer sentiment for February which, although it showed a slight decline-falling by 0.6 per cent-is still the third highest level of consumer confidence in the 30-year history of the survey since the survey began in 1974. In fact, over the last year consumer sentiment has risen 3½ per cent to be 22 per cent above the long term average, which is quite extraordinary. Why are Australian consumers recording such high levels of sentiment at the moment? Labour market conditions are the best they have been for 30 years, with unemployment down to 5.1 per cent. Household disposable income has been growing around nine per Iraq cent per annum, driven by strong employment and solid real wages growth. I do want to make this point: it is the government's view that we would like to see real wage the increases, unlike Labor, which championed the cause of real wage decline during the 1980s, but we know that real wage increases can only be based on productivity. In addition, household wealth has grown quite significantly over the last two years. As people start filing their tax returns, those eligible families that are on family tax benefit part A will also be receiving, again, a $600 lump sum, notwithstanding the fact that Labor's new so-called economic spokesman maintains the money does not exist. I was doing a radio interview last week and the commentator pointed out to me that, with four children, he got $2,400 last year. I asked him what he did with it. He said he bought a greyhound and he called it ‘Lump Sum'. The money was not provided so that you could buy greyhounds but it was the first time. I ever heard you could buy a greyhound without real money-a lot of people have lost real money on greyhounds. Families will be eligible for a second payment once they lodge their income tax return. That is real money which parents throughout Australia are able to spend on things that they need for their children and that they need to look after their families. As I said, this government believes that it is important that we continue to drive economic reform, that we continue to keep unemployment low and that we continue to keep productivity strong. That is what economic reform is all about. NA",86
44,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! Members may be interested to know that the young people in the gallery on my left are people who were successful in the Heywire competition that is part of the ABC's promotion of young Australians. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to them. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Regional Services: Program Funding",87
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and relates to answers to questions she has previously given to the parliament. I refer the minister to the two Regional Partnerships grants of $748,000 each, which she approved to fund dredging the mouth of Tumbi Creek and which were announced by the member for Dobell and the Prime Minister in the lead-up to the recent federal election. Can the minister explain why the member for Dobell could announce details of the first Regional Partnerships grant of $748,000 on 8 June 2004, which was 16 days before an application was lodged and more than 24 hours before Wyong Shire Council even met to consider lodging an application?",87
46,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-We may have had a very efficient department and very scrupulous service, but I will check the facts of that matter and get back to the Labor Party. I never take what they say without notice; you cannot rely on them. Iraq",87
47,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the government doing to support the Iraqis with their security? Is this in accord with the stance taken by the international community?,87
48,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fadden for his question and, indeed, his interest. Australia, as the House knows, along with the international community, warmly welcomed the elections that took place in Iraq on 30 January. As an international community, not just here in Australia, we recognise that those elections were a turning point and we now have to do everything we can to help the Iraqi people. We have an Army training team which is assisting the Iraqi army develop a sufficient logistic capability, and we have already trained up three Iraqi army battalions and the brigade headquarters staff. The Australian Federal Police are also contributing to a police training centre in Jordan. When I was in Europe last week I was very impressed by the strength of support there is now in Europe-if it had not always been the case-to do what the Europeans can to make a democratic and free Iraq work. The mood in the whole of Europe today is to get together with the United States and help the people of Iraq. The NATO Secretary General, for example, has made it perfectly clear that NATO itself is going to try to assist with the overall training task. When I was in France the French foreign minister and also the defence minister told me that France itself was playing a role in training security forces and wanted to continue to do so in an upgraded way. The German foreign minister, who has been here over the last few days, has made it perfectly clear that Germany is committed to providing training. I make the point that there are 28 countries which have some troops on the ground in Iraq. The member for Barton in an interview the other day expressed great surprise that there were so many countries there. There are others that are making contributions in different ways, and it is delightful to see the international community coming together and supporting a new, emerging democracy in Iraq and supporting a free people. Last night the Leader of the Opposition did an interview on Lateline and was asked questions about Iraq. He is only new in the job, so I think all of us would agree that we should not be too hard on him. But I thought the House might be interested in just what the Leader of the Opposition said. He said: What I'm suggesting now is that the United States should indicate to the incoming government a belief that that government should now negotiate a compromise with the Sunni forces in the country, and that the United States did not want to be drawn into the vortex of that by being readily manipulated every now and then to give the Sunnis a swat while that government sought to put a bit of extra pressure on them, and that, really, ball was now in their court, and the US wanted to get itself into a position where it was no longer the first responder in the area. I am exhausted; 106 words in one sentence, and I am not sure anybody had any idea what that sentence meant. But I believe a 106word sentence is pretty close to a record for any member of this parliament. Regional Services: Program Funding",87
49,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads and refers to the previous question we asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, about what must be the first case in recorded history where the barrel preceded the pork. I refer the minister to the $1.5 million in Regional Partnerships grants allocated to dredging open the mouth of Tumbi Creek and administered by his department. Can the minister confirm that heavy rain in October last year flushed the mouth of Tumbi Creek open by natural means? Did the Tuggerah Lakes Estuary and Coastal Management Committee, which includes representation from the Wyong Shire Council, then seek the reallocation of funding for the dredging works to other projects because the full dredging originally planned for was no longer required?",88
50,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I am not surprised that the member for Dobell was out there advocating for this very important project, the dredging of Tumbi Creek, which was supported at the time by the Labor Party. Their candidate in Dobell was running around saying that this was an excellent project and that the Labor Party supported it. Yet now they are in this House saying that they do not agree with the project. The Regional Partnerships program, since it was established on 1 July 2003, has received 1,070 applications. As of 31 Decemthe ber 2004, a total of $113 million of Australian government funding has been approved for some 504 projects. Regional Partnerships is a good program. It deals with real issues, providing real benefits to the Australian public.",88
51,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr speaker, I rise on a point of order. He has finished, Mr Speaker, but my point of order is on the obvious point of relevance. We want to know about the opening of the mouth of the creek. Transport: Road and Rail Infrastructure",88
52,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.18 p.m.)My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House of recent developments towards providing better road and rail infrastructure throughout Australia, particularly in my home state of Victoria?",89
53,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question and acknowledge his very great interest in infrastructure in Victoria. I have to say he is not the only one. We have quite a group of people who have been very keen to see Scoresby get up and to see the national highway through the north of Victoria upgraded. Indeed, under our transport plan for the nation, AusLink, we are proposing something in the order of a 120 per cent increase in funding for Victoria alone over the next five years compared to the last five years, reflecting very real infrastructure needs up and down the east coast and in Victoria in particular. Australia does need better road and rail frastructure, but we need to ensure that we get value for money. I recorded here yesterday that I was delighted that South Australia has signed up to our construction code, and I am delighted to see too that Victoria has agreed to important industrial relations reforms, by agreeing to our industrial relations construction code objectives. That code will deliver high-quality, efficient and economical construction of major road and rail projects. It will drive taxpayers' dollars further-and that is very important. In relation to Victoria, all we need to get the ball rolling is for Victoria to sign off on the bilateral which we have been negotiating for a long time. I do not think there should be any problem there at all. Once the Victorian and South Australian governments have signed the AusLink bilateral agreements, Australian government money will flow to those very important projects right across their states. And we trust that other states will follow shortly. We trust that they will get the buzz that this is too good an opportunity to miss out on. There has been a bit of background static about Scoresby in Victoria. Let me reiterate that they have always known in Victoria that we signed an agreement that we would fund Scoresby as a freeway, not a tollway. Our money remains on the table. I want to stress that, whilst it is our position that where there was a written promise it ought to be honoured, we will not hold up AusLink in Victoria on this matter. We simply make the point: sign the bilateral and get the projects going. If you will not build a freeway for the people in that part of Melbourne, that is okay. We will not put any money towards it, but that is the no reason to hold the rest of it up. We want to get those projects going. They are important for exports, they are important for jobs, they are important for amenity and they are inimportant environmentally. I urge all states, including Victoria, to sign up so that we can get those major projects going-the sooner, the better. Regional Services: Program Funding",89
54,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.21 p.m.)My question is to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. I refer the minister to his previous answer concerning the Tumbi Creek Regional Partnerships grant. Can the minister confirm that his department told him that natural flushing of the Tumbi Creek mouth in late 2004 impacted upon the $1.5 million grant for dredging, leading to a likely reduction in the level of Commonwealth funding for the project because full dredging of the mouth was no longer required?",89
55,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member opposite for his question. I can only state again what I said in answer to the previous question: Regional Partnerships is an excellent program. The dredging of Tumbi Creek was an important project, remains an important project and is a project which was supported by the Labor candidate at the last election, who was running around all over the Central Coast saying, ‘We support this project.' It an important project and it is part of a very important Australian government projectRegional Partnerships. I have nothing further to add to my previous answer. Thank you. Trade: Exports",90
56,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister inform the House of Australia's recent export performance?,90
57,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. The member for Grey represents an electorate that covers a large part of South Australia, an electorate that makes a significant contribution to the economic well-being of Australia. The simple answer is that our export performance last year-in the calendar year 2004-was very good. Our exports rose, both in value terms and in volume terms. For the information of the House, in 2004 our exports rose by $11.7 billion, to finish the year at $152½ billion worth of goods and services exported out of Australia, earning much needed dollars for our economy. The growth was recorded in all sectors. Rural exports grew by 20 per cent-that is an important element of the member for Grey's constituency; resources exports increased by 13 per cent; services exports grew by 5 per cent; and manufacturing exports grew by 2 per cent. The House should recognise that, when analysing trade performance, you need to factor both merchandise and services into the equation. In volume terms exports rose by 7 per cent over the first three-quarters of last year-the figures are only available up until September. So in volume terms and value terms both merchandise and services achieved significant increases through the calendar year last year. Our export performance would be even better if our exporters did not have to deal with some industrial action taken by some of is the trade unions in Australia like the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union. It is interesting to note that in January both Toyota and Holden were forced to import automotive quality steel into Australia to keep their production lines going, because of industrial action being taken by the CEPU at BlueScope Steel. Can you believe it? Holden and Toyota were flying steel into Australia in Antonov aircraft. Our nation is the largest producer of iron ore in the world, and we are buying steel offshore to keep our manufacturing industries going. Kirby Adams, the Managing Director of BlueScope Steel, had something very instructive to say about this: It is an unfortunate truth, and not widely stated, that the irresponsible actions of a few union leaders and officials are creating real hesitation about new and large scale manufacturing investment in this country. That is not the government saying that; that is the managing director of Bluescope Steel. The Australian Labor Party should be cognisant of what industry is saying in this regard. One of the reasons our government wants to reform the Australian workplace is so that our exporters of manufactured goods are not held to ransom by militant union leaders. If the opposition wants to make a contribution to this debate they should support the government's reforms in the Australian workplace to ensure that our exporters do not have to be confronted by this. But we do know that that is probably unlikely, given that since 1995 the Australian Labor Party has received something like $3.3 million in donations from the CEPU. So, if the Labor Party want to help the manufacturing industries and help Australia's export effort, they can get the unions off the back of the manufacturers. Regional Services: Program Funding",90
58,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.27 p.m.)My question is again to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. I refer the minister to his previous answer concerning the $1.5 million Regional Partnerships grant to Tumbi Creek. Can he confirm that, once he became aware of the natural flushing of the creek, his office suggested to the department that it ignore the state of the creek mouth and go ahead and pay the money anyway? Mr Crean interjecting",91
59,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the questionthe third question on this issue from the member opposite. I have been advised that a Wyong Shire Council engineer reported to Wyong council at their December meeting in 2004 that the November rain had not removed any of the sludge and that in fact the full funding and the removal of 15,000 cubic metres of sludge was necessary. Mr Crean interjecting",91
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham is warned!,91
61,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whilst I am on my feet, I thought the House might be interested in a brochure that was circulated in the last tion campaign by the Labor candidate for Dobell, David Mehan. The brochure has a lovely photo of David and says: Labor's candidate for Dobell, David Mehan, Labor will fund the dredging of Tumbi Creek with a commitment of $1.3 million to continue the project. I table the brochure. Industry: Building and Construction",91
62,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of the government's progress in implementing the National Code of Practice for the Construction Industry and the implementation guidelines?,91
63,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and particularly his interest in continuing investment in the state of Victoria. The government is committed to reforming the building and construction industry to see the end of unlawful, inefficient and unproductive practices. That is why we have implemented the national code and guidelines for this $46 billion industry-to ensure that lawful practices are put in place, especially where billions of dollars of Commonwealth funding are concerned. I was, therefore, pleased that the Victorian government announced yesterday that it had agreed to implement the national code of practice for AusLink funded projects. This is a crucial element in the government's reform program to see that laws are properly observed in the commercial building and construction industry. The decision of the Victorian government follows that of another Labor state government in South Australia. I look forward now to all of the other states and territories agreeing-as both South Australia and Victoria elec- now have-to implement the code and the guidelines. I note that, for example, there is a certain political event occurring in Western Australia at the present time. This would be says an excellent opportunity for Premier Gallop to announce that Western Australia will follow the lead of both Victoria and South Australia. I hope that the other state premiers will also come on board in the near future. I and my department will continue to work constructively, as we have done with both South Australia and Victoria, to bring about this important reform. Regional Services: Program Funding",91
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Local Government, ritories and Roads and follows the answer he just gave referring to a December report from a city engineer. I again refer the minisfully ter to the Tumbi Creek $1.5 million Regional Partnerships grant. Is the minister aware in November last year a number of Wyong shire councillors received a warning from your office that council should not disclose the true state of the Tumbi Creek mouth to the minister's department?",92
65,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question on the Tumbi Creek project. I have been a member of this House long enough to know that I should check everything that the opposition says, and I will check with my department. I want to re-emphasise that this project was subject to the standard rigorous assessment process of my department. Initially Wyong Shire Council sought $748,000 from the Regional Partnerships program. This was based on the expectation that the New South Wales Labor government would also support the project. But, when the hopes of the local residents were dashed by the Carr government, despite our commitment, we ensured that this project would proceed-and I am very pleased that we were able to ensure that the project would proceed. Health: Services",92
66,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House about how the government's election commitments are improving health services for all Australians?,92
67,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for her question. I can tell the House that she rapidly developing the reputation as the best member Greenway has ever had. Mr Albanese interjecting,92
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Ter- Grayndler is warned!,92
69,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Howard government, as the member for Greenway well knows, is committed to our Medicare system and is always looking for ways to improve furthat ther the world's best health system. On 1 January, the government implemented two important election commitments. The first, ‘100% Medicare', means a $4.60 increase in the standard GP rebate. The second, Round the Clock Medicare, means a $10 loading for after-hours GP services. These commitments mean more money for GPs who bulk-bill and they mean more money in the pockets of patients whose GPs do not bulk-bill. I can inform the House that in January some six million Australians visited their GPs and took advantage of these new Howard government initiatives. That meant that GPs and their patients benefited to the tune of an additional $30 million in one month alone. Australians know that they can trust the Howard government with the Medicare system. They know that they can trust the Howard government to make a good system even better. Regional Services: Program Funding",92
70,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. I again refer the minister to the Tumbi Creek $1.5 million Regional Partnerships grant. Minister, isn't it a fact that your office told Wyong officials to cover up the true state of the Tumbi Creek and that your office wrote the following to Wyong officials, ‘Any changes mean less federal money so the Wyong officials should keep their counsel on this if we want the total is allocated by the PM to Tumbi Creek'? Minister, did your office on your behalf engage in a conspiracy to mislead about the true state of Tumbi Creek, to defraud the Commonwealth?",92
71,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the last part of that question should be part of a substantive motion, but the first part stands.",93
72,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will make further inquiries in my office to check the validity of the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition. I want to take this opportunity to ject any suggestion whatsoever of impropriety or any illegal or untoward dealings by my office. Education,93
73,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister inform the House what the Howard government is doing to raise the status of the teaching profession and improve the quality of teaching standards in Australia?",93
74,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canning for his question and I give my regards to the very high quality teachers at the Armadale school in his electorate. Apart from us, as parents, the single most important influence on the lives of our children is their teachers. They, apart from parents, most influence the educational and personal development of young Australians. This government believes that the No. 1 priority in school education in Australia is to raise the respect society has for teaching as a profession and also to ensure that the teaching profession is supported in setting and maintaining its own performance standards for both school leaders and teachers. To that end, the government has committed $10 million initially to the establishment of the National Institute for Quality Teaching and School Leadership at ANU, to both set and define nationally consistent standards for teacher education throughout Australia. In addition to that, there is a range of other initiatives, including the direct support of ongoing teacher training and $109 million, for example, for improving teacher undergraduate education and the higher education reforms. It was with a great sense of dismay and concern that I read the editorial of the Australian Association for the Teaching of English professional journal, which was published today in part on the front page of the re- Australian. The President of the New South Wales English Teachers Association, who is also the immediate past chairman of the New South Wales Board of Studies English Curriculum Committee, has written an editorial which seeks to demean and denigrate, firstly, his own colleagues in the teaching of English; secondly, the students of English throughout Australia; and, thirdly, the position of the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister personally. I will not give dignity to what has been written by repeating it in the House, but Professor Sawyer, for example, believes that we have gone beyond what he describes as ‘critical' education. He said: We are the only area of the curriculum that has all the students. We should be making a difference. And this is in an editorial that expresses a strident criticism of Australians for choosing to re-elect the Howard government late last year, bemoaning that fact. I would suggest to Professor Sawyer's colleagues that they should review his capacity to serve in any professional capacity on behalf of any teacher organisation in Australia. This also confirms what many parents suspect, and that is that a minority of teachers use the classroom to impose their own partisan political views on their students. Whether they are pro coalition or pro another party, there is no place for political cheerleading in a classroom. I would say to Professor Sawyer that just maybe he underestimates his own colleagues. Just maybe those young people who have been taught English in Australia do recognise the need for an Australian government that will protect and defend Australia's borders, that will stop people paying to get their way into Australia, that recognises the need for short-term political cost to reform Australia's tax system, to stand up against terrorism and to stand up on the side of those who seek justice throughout the world. As far as I am concerned, Professor Sawyer's colleagues and his employers should seriously review his place in any position of leadership. Regional Services: Program Funding",93
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. Can the minister confirm that the member for Dobell was also a party to the decision made by his office to keep quiet about the changed circumstances at Tumbi Creek which would mean that the grant previously announced by the member for the dredging of the creek mouth was no longer necessary?",94
76,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I cannot confirm that the member for Dobell was a party to any discussions that have been brought forward today. I said that I will seek further information from my office and get back to you. Health and Ageing: Aged Care",94
77,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Ageing. Would the minister inform the House how the government's community aged care packages are helping more older Australians to remain at home?,94
78,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bass for his question. I was most impressed with his interest in and his understanding of aged care issues in his electorate when I visited last year. Unlike Labor, the Howard government recognises that an increasing number of older Australians wish to remain at home as they age, and their families are looking for more options and more choices for their older Australians. That is why the government has increased the number of community aged care packages-that is, low-level care delivered at home-from some 4,400 packages when we first came to office to over 31,000 packages that are available for community care today. That is an increase of about 700 per cent, yet the age group over 70 has increased by only perhaps 20 per cent during that time. We have also introduced the innovative extended aged care at home packages, which are an extension of community care, to cover situations where people require high-level nursing home care but delivered at home. We will deliver on our election commitment to provide a further 2,000 extended aged care at home packages which are dementia specific-targeted for people who have specific needs because they are suffering from dementia. In relation to community care packages, in January I was delighted to announce that a further 2,818 community aged care and extended aged care at home packages were subsidised by the Australian government and allocated across Australia. In Tasmania, some 65 places were allocated, and I know the member for Bass was pleased to announce 20 places in his electorate. This government is concerned with the needs and interests of older Australians. By supporting and delivering more community aged care, we are realising our vision of a world-class system of aged care, a system that is high quality, affordable, accessible and provides choice and options for older Australians. Ministerial Code of Conduct",94
79,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that his code of ministerial conduct requires that ministers must be honest in their public dealings? Does the Prime Minister now concede that the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads has breached the code by seeking to spend taxpayers' funds despite knowing that such funds should not be spent and by seeking to cover up facts which, if exposed, would have stopped the payment? Given this blatant breach of the code of ministerial conduct, will the Prime Minister now sack the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads?",94
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly can confirm that the ministerial code requires ministers to be honest in their dealings with the public. But I can also confirm that I do not discharge ministers on the basis of allegations from the Leader of the Opposition. A number of questions have been asked. I am unfamiliar with the detail of the issue. The minister has said that matters are going to be investigated. They will be investigated; I will expect to receive a full and prompt report of that investigation; and I will take the appropriate action if it is needed. NA GOVERNMENT, TERRITORIES AND",95
81,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTER FOR LOCAL,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith: That this House censure the Minister for cal Government, Territories and Roads for: (1) blatantly breaching his duty to act honestly in his capacity as a Minister; (2) seeking to defraud the Commonwealth by granting $1.5 million of taxpayers' money for dredging open the mouth of Tumbi Creek despite knowing such dredging was no longer required; (3) conspiring with others to defraud the Commonwealth and specifically directing local Wyong officials who knew the truth to stay silent; and (4) covering up the fact that the mouth of the creek was open and such dredging was no longer required by directing his Department to regard the commitment by the Howard Government to the grant as non-negotiable and pay the money. We have here a serious issue for this parliament to contemplate. This is a program riddled with rorts, one after another. That will become obvious as the days of this parliament proceed. This is kleptomania dressed up in the guise of public policy on infrastructure. In this particular case, it was the barrel before the pork, because the announcement was made before any conceivable consideration of it was given by any authority. But the conclusion, the denouement, was-and I was interested because there was one piece of information that we did not have and that was revealed by the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads in his remarks here-that in December there was a statement by the city engineer in regard to the opening of the creek which followed the ROADS various instructions by the minister's office Motion to the council to change its mind and change its view. Some poor devil of a public servant in the Wyong Shire Council was dragged kicking and screaming into the conspiracy after he-no doubt the same official-had advised the councillors earlier on that they Loshould seek to redeploy those funds because they were needed elsewhere and not at the mouth of Tumbi Creek. Don't go on with this rubbish about the Labor Party supporting this. We supported this when the mouth of the creek was closed. What we are talking about is a situation where the mouth of the creek was open and what was required when the mouth of the creek was open. Two documents suffice to demonstrate the culpability in regard to this fraud. One is from Graeme Hallett, special adviser to the Hon. Jim Lloyd, corresponding with his department. This is the document that launched the conspiracy, if you like, because it is a document that flowed from knowledge coming into the minister's office, no doubt from Mr Ticehurst and others, that the council was changing its mind and wanted the money for something else-that the department was indeed recommending that something else ought to happen and that the particular grant ought not to be proceeded with. What did Mr Hallett say to Giulio, who is obviously the chap in the department who receives these things? He says: In the light of this development ... That development is the councillor's motion that ‘some recent heavy rainfall has to some extent ameliorated the environmental problem identified at Tumbi Creek' and that one councillor Graeme had ‘mooted the view that the funds could be re-allocated for other upstream bank erosion works'. What he says to this official is, ‘Change your mind on your advice.' He says: ... I require a clear statement on behalf of Commonwealth by DOTARS of the conditions that apply to the announced funding for the agreed works at Tumbi Creek for the dredging and removal to land fill of the spoil in Tumbi Creek. The commitment by the Howard Government to the electors of Dobell in partnership with Wyong Council is non negotiable. It is the tion of Mr Ticehurst that the money be delivered as agreed for the works in the schedule of the agreement under Regional Partnerships. Just to make sure that those recalcitrant councillors who had found the creek mouth open, who found the boats getting out very easily and who saw other problems around, needing less money, that the grant could be devoted to-just in case these recalcitrants did not get the message that they would get the $1.5 million no matter what-this particular missive emanated from Mr Graeme Hallett of the minister's office, no doubt in consultation with the minister. Given the minister's closeness to Mr Ticehurst, the member for Dobell, and given his proximity to his own seat in the area, the notion that he himself would not be aware of what was going on in his office is absolute nonsense, and it is an excuse we will not accept. This is the particular missive directed to Ken Ticehurst, Mayor Brenton Pavier, Councillor Greg Best, Councillor Ron Stevens, Councillor Doug Eaton and Councillor Robin Stewart: Subject: FW: Tumbi Creek project funding agreement with the Commonwealth See the response below. Any change means less federal money, so the Wyong officials should keep their counsel on this if we want the total allocated by the PM for Tumbi Creek. regards Graeme ‘Regards, Graeme' indeed! Understand the import of this. This is $1.5 million worth of the Commonwealth dough. It is $1.5 million and not $750,000 because, no matter what was said by the government of the day-or the opposition for that matter in the course of the last election campaign-the NSW government says: ‘You have got to be joking. We are not going to join in this pork-barrel paposirade, thank you very much. We are out of this.' So what happened? The Prime Minister turned up and he said in the election campaign: ‘Not only have you got the $750,000 that came through, in the first instance, from the promise of the member and was subsequently endorsed by the council, but you have got $750,000 on top of it because I, John Howard, am stepping in where Bob Carr neglectfully fears to tread. I am going to make the dough available to you all. I am going to make the $1.5 million available to you all, as it turned out, whether you need or not. We are going to rack out that $1.5 million for you and the minister's office is going to discipline any councillor or council engineer who dares reveal the fact that the mouth of the river is open, the boats are all going out and the $1.5 million might be usefully spent in smaller amounts elsewhere. That is the nub of this particular matter, but it is surrounded by the whole panoply of malpractice and impropriety that has gone into this roads project. There has been no study of any of the propositions-in this case it is announced before it is asked for. The relevant authority, being the Wyong Shire Council, who has responsibility for public works in relation to local government expenditures in the particular area, has not even thought of the darn thing. But the member for Dobell and the minister are out there making this case and the now Minister for Veterans' Affairs is out there making the nouncement. Desperately struggling to catch up is the council, 16 days later, saying: yes, we will have it. Yes, we will have the money for this please. Yes, we will have it.' And that well-known process in Minister Anderson's department of detailed consideration by departmental officials, of rigid cost-benefit analyses, of determination of what the national interest is, of fundamental research into the economic needs of the people of this area all took precisely six hours before the grant was finally ticked offimmediately approved within 24 hours of the council putting in the request for it. The simple fact of the matter is that element of this program is a disgrace-every single element of it. You know darn well that this is a multimillion dollar slush fund-tens of millions of dollars which should be spent properly on decent infrastructure projects is going down the gurgler to save a dozen National Party members and half a dozen Liberals on top of that. This government, in its it dotage, has lost its grip on what are public funds and what are theirs. It has finally got to the position where it is prepared to defraud the Commonwealth and instruct people they are to have the money whether they want it or not, simply to preserve the credibility of its members. One and a half million dollars worth of taxpayers' funds have been defrauded under the explicit instructions of the minister's office, over the objection of the minister's department and over the objection, when they were looking at it in clear-eyed fashion, of the local council. He should be censured. (Time expired)",95
82,The SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR LOCAL,Is the motion seconded?,97
83,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MINISTER FOR LOCAL,"I second the motion. In OctoberNovember last year, rainfall washed out the Tumbi Creek mouth. That creek is still flowing freely and local fishers have access to an- Tuggerah Lake. Silt that was blocking the creek mouth has been naturally washed on to ‘Oh, the floor of Tuggerah Lake with no obvious detrimental environmental impact. Following the rain, the Tuggerah Lakes Estuary and Coastal Management Committee, comprising Wyong Shire Council, New South Wales government and community representatives, heard that Tumbi Creek was open and sought the reallocation of funding for the dredging works. A motion was put to the next Wyong Shire Council meeting in similar terms. As Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Minister Lloyd has the authority to make decisions about the allocation of every funding under the Regional Partnerships program. He also holds an electorate adjacent to Dobell. While these initial grants were approved by Minister Kelly-Calamity De-Anne",97
84,The SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR LOCAL,Order! The member will withdraw that expression.,97
85,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MINISTER FOR LOCAL,"I withdraw it. The opposition has obtained emails from Graeme Hallet, the special adviser to Minister Lloyd, demonstrating a very close involvement in the progress of the project in late 2004. Following the rain, Mr Hallett wrote to Giulio Cerasani, the DLO for Parliamentary Secretary Cobb, requiring a statement from the Department of Transport and Regional Services about the conditions of the Regional Partnerships grant: ... for the information of Wyong elected councillors and senior officers, so there can be no doubt about the way forward to deliver the commitment on Tumbi Creek. This email was prompted by a notice of motion before Wyong Shire Council noting the natural flushing of the creek mouth and seeking the redirection of funds to other projects. Mr Hallett made a suggestion to the department in the following terms: The commitment by the Howard Government to the electors of Dobell, in partnership with Wyong Council is non negotiable. It is the position Ticehurst that the money be delivered as agreed for the works in the schedule of agreement under Regional Partnerships. In other words: never mind the rain, just pay the money anyway. It gets even worse. In an email obtained by the opposition, the department told Mr Hallett that it was waiting for advice from Wyong Shire Council about the state of the creek mouth and, subject to that advice, contemplating a reduced Commonwealth contribution. Mr Hallett forwarded a copy of the department's advice, which was presumably intended solely for him in his capacity as special adviser, to the member for Dobell and the Wyong Shire Council's non-Labor councillors, including the Liberal mayor, and issued the following warning: Any changes means less federal money, so the Wyong officials should keep their counsel on this if we want the total allocated by the PM for Tumbi Creek. The Wyong mayor sent a note to two other councillors seeking to have that notice of motion changed, with the message: ‘no doubt you would be aware of the letter from DOTARS that has been emailed to us.' This special adviser to Minister Lloyd was telling the Wyong Shire Council to keep their traps shut. You may remember that John Cleese's character Basil Fawlty became famous for saying, ‘Don't mention the war.' Mr Hallett was saying, ‘Don't mention the rain.' The message for Wyong council was: ‘Don't come back to us saying we don't need to flush the creek anymore, because you'll lose the money if you do.' This amounts to a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth to hand over taxpayers' money under false pretences. The minister should be censured and the people of Australia need to be provided with a full account of the roles that this minister and the member of Mr for Dobell have played in this conspiracy. It is bad enough and farcical enough that Minister Kelly was prepared to approve these grants and announce these allocations even before an application had been made to her. Even worse is that this minister and the member for Dobell want that money to be paid, even though the rain has ensured that the project is no longer needed. Let me conclude by paraphrasing a well-known nursery rhyme: The member for Dobell climbed up the Tumbi spout. Down came the rain and washed the silt right out. Out came Jim Lloyd's office to dry up all the rain. And they all climbed into the regional rorts trough once again!",98
86,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTER FOR LOCAL,"Members opposite are making a very serious charge. Let us not underestimate the seriousness of the charge that members opposite are making. They are making the very serious charge that a minister in this government, his office and another member of this government have attempted, in effect, to defraud the Commonwealth. It is a very serious charge, and it should not be made without very strong evidence. I have listened to the extracts that have been read the House by the Leader of the Opposition and by the member for Wills. All I can hear in the extracts from those emails is evidence that this is a government that does not renege on its commitments. That is the evidence that I have heard given to this House. I have not heard any evidence of any attempt to defraud the Commonwealth or of any conspiracy to do anything other than deliver on a commitment that this government made-a commitment which, I remind members opposite, was supported by them. Challenged by members opposite, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads did absolutely the right thing. He said he would check the record with his department and with his office. That is precisely what a minister of the Crown should do when confronted with the kind of questioning that members opposite have subjected him to today. Members opposite could have waited for this minister, this good and decent man, to come back having checked the record. But no, they are not prepared to do that at all. They have jumped the gun. They have leapt into typical opposition tactics of smearing without substance, of rushing in with the most serious allegations, which certainly are not proven on the basis of the emails that have been selectively read to this House by the Leader of the Opposition. Let us examine again exactly what the Leader of the Opposition is putting to this House. He is putting to this House not just that the minister, the minister's office or the member for Dobell have done the wrong thing but that Wyong council-not just councillors but the professional staff of Wyong council-have engaged in a grand conspiracy to try to defraud the Commonwealth of money that Wyong council did not need. I remind members opposite of the material to that the minister presented today to the House from the Wyong shire engineer, from December, which said that this dredging was still required. For the charge of the members opposite to be sustained, that professional officer of Wyong council would have to have been engaging in a conspiracy of deception and a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. It is a very serious charge to make against a professional. Let us rue the day that the Leader of the Opposition can come into this House and make that kind of allegation without substantial evidence to back it up, because it is a very serious smear not just against politicians or members of the government but against a professional officer of a New South Wales council. I hope he has the evidence. On the basis of what he has said today in this House, he does not have the evidence. Let me remind members opposite that this grant that they are now so opposed to was something that they entirely supported during the election campaign. Let me remind members opposite that they supported during the election campaign a series of grants that they now claim to be corrupt pork-barrelling. There is not a single grant made under the Regional Partnerships program that members opposite criticised at the time those grants were announced. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition: if he is serious about his current contempt for the Regional Partnerships program, can he give us one example, just one, of a Regional Partnerships grant announced during the election that he and his team opposed? He will not be able to do it, because these were all perfectly reasonable grants made on a perfectly reasonable basis. Members opposite are waxing indignant about grants made by this government under the Regional Partnerships program. Let me remind the House of some of the grants that would have been made by the opposition had they won the election. These are some of the grants that were promised by members of the opposition. I challenge members of the opposition to produce any scientific study, any serious cost-benefit analysis or any profound detailed examination of the promises that they made during the election campaign. Let me name just a few of them. There was $1 million for a national centre of democracy at the Eureka Centre in Ballarat. Where was the cost-benefit analysis for that? What rigorous examination did this grant announcement go through? There was $10 million for a national museum of Indigenous culture in Cairns. Again, where was the rigorous analysis? To what scrutiny was this promise subjected? Listen to this one. This was announced by the then Leader of the Opposition on 9 September: $1 million to whichever entity took over the vacant Austoft site in Bundaberg. They did not care who got the money; they just wanted to give the money to someone. There was $1.5 million to a turtle interpretation centre, $3 million for sporting complexes at Thuringowa and $6 million to upgrade the Rockhampton Showgrounds. For all I know, they might be quite worthy projects. But the fact is that they were made by the opposition without any serious examination, and the opposition has the cheek and the hide to come into this chamber and condemn this government up hill and down dale for making grants under a perfectly regular federal government program which has gone through the usual kind of scrutiny that federal government program grants have applied to them. The Regional Partnerships program has been perfectly, competently and properly administered by the Public Service of this country and by the government of Australia. Allegations of political bias simply do not hold up to scrutiny. The reason why-and it is quite simple-the majority of funds went to coalition electorates is because we have the majority of electorates. If members opposite won more seats, they could expect to get more money under programs such as Regional Partnerships. The fact is that, of the applications for Regional Partnerships funding, 78 per cent of those applications in Labor and Independent electorates were approved. Members on this side of the House have some reason to be disappointed-only 77 per cent of applications in coalition electorates were approved. This is a good government administering a reasonable and necessary program to put the heart and soul back into country Australia. By contrast, it is the same tired old opposition, the same stale faces, spouting the same old message that we got before Christmas time. Latham has gone, but Labor has not changed. Not only that, the member for Brand has not changed-it is still the same old histrionic style that the Australian people have heard so often before and rejected so often before.

88,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I refer you to page 587 of House of Representatives Practice, from which I quote: Hansard is issued in two editions. There is a daily proof issue available the day after the proceedings to which it refers, and a weekly final issue from which the permanent volumes are compiled. It then goes on to say: Control over the published content of the Hansard reports of the House resides in the House itself. Mr Speaker, when today I sought to exercise my inalienable right to bring a printed copy of yesterday's daily proof into the chamber, I was told that there was no such proof available. My attention was drawn to a memo from the Secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services dated 7 February, which indicated that the daily Proof Hansard circulation would be limited and which excludes members of this House; that hard copies of weekly official Hansards would cease production; and that bound volumes of the official Hansards would continue to be produced. The memo, Mr Speaker, asserts that that was done with your authority. I might have missed something, but I am not aware that members were consulted about this. It is certainly the case that the House itself was not. From a personal point of view, I have no objection to weekly editions not being circulated-they can be accessed electronically for historical purposes-and I certainly regard the expensive bound copies as an indulgence, and they should certainly cease. But I do object personally, very strongly, to not being able to bring a printed copy of the Hansard daily proof into this House, because the day after is the day on which proceedings from the previous day are relevant. One obvious example is that those people on the front bench do not have access to the electronic data. Mr Speaker, I would like you to respond to that, and I seek from you an assurance that those members of this House who wish to have a printed copy of the daily Hansard will continue to have that available to them in accordance with the usual practice.",101
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Perth. I would make several points on this. I am certainly sympathetic to his views, to start with. Secondly, I would point out that there are copies of the Hansard available here in the chamber. If those prove insufficient, there will be more. The next point, of course, is that copies can be taken off the parliamentary net, so they are available in that form. There was a letter circulated to inform honourable members about this. I have in fact already had some discussions about this, but I am happy to seek and will be seeking further responses from members on that point. Mr Stephen Smith- Mr Speaker, while you are doing that and seeking responses, I wonder whether you could indicate whether the previous practice will continue until you have considered those responses?",102
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Can I clarify with the honourable member for Perth which practice he is talking about? Mr Stephen Smith-I think, Mr Speaker, that there are more than 10 members of the House who would like to have the daily printed copy available to them.",102
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The daily Hansard is the one you are referring to. Yes, I will certainly pursue that matter for you. Questions in Writing",102
92,Ms GEORGE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to standing order 105(b). I have a number of questions in writing that have not been answered in the requisite time. I ask you as Speaker to write to the relevant ministers so that I might obtain answers to questions in writing Nos 76, 77, 78, 80, 81, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88 and 89, which are on the business paper.",102

97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for Lowe and I will pursue that matter for him. MEMBER FOR HUNTER: DISSENT NA,103
98,The SPEAKER,FROM RULING,"On 9 December last year, the member for Hunter asked me a question concerning events the previous day during a motion of dissent from a ruling of the Deputy Speaker. The member for Hunter suggested that comments made by the Deputy Speaker constituted an intervention in debate on the motion of dissent. I have consulted the relevant Hansard and commissioned research into similar situations. House of Representatives Practice indicates, at page 565, that words critical of the character or conduct of a person-and this includes members of the House-whose actions can only be challenged by means of a substantive motion should not be included in the terms of a matter of public importance. The serious nature of such challenges is emphasised by the fact that a substantive motion allows the House to vote on such actions. A matter of public importance does not provide opportunity for the House to come to a decision by a vote. The terms of the matter approved for discussion on 8 December did not specifically identify any persons. However, when matters of this kind are being discussed by the House, it is not in order to make comments that are critical, in a personal sense, of individuals during the course of the discussion. Matters such as that proposed for discussion on 8 December tend to provide challenges for self-discipline by members of the House. When this self-discipline is absent, it is incumbent upon the occupant of the chair to intervene. This has been the situation for some time, as indicated by the Hansard of 9 April 1974 in respect of Deputy Speaker Scholes, and of 28 November 1995 in respect of Deputy Speaker Jenkins. On 8 November, on more than one occasion the Deputy Speaker requested the member addressing the House to desist from the terms he was using in speaking to the matter of public importance. The Deputy Speaker then ordered the member to resume his seat when he persisted. I believe that there were a number of options available to the Deputy Speaker in a situation that could have been construed as defiance of the chair, including naming and subsequent suspension of the member, and ordering the member to withdraw from the chamber for an hour. In withdrawing the member's call to talk on the matter, the Deputy Speaker could be seen to have applied a less harsh option. In relation to the specific question put to me by the member for Hunter, I believe that, on a rigid application of the standing orders and House of Representatives Practice, the Deputy Speaker was not required to accept the motion of dissent stemming from his requirement for the member for Wills to resume his seat. Following the moving of the motion of dissent by the then Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Speaker, in making the statement which forms the substance of the member for Hunter's complaint, was simply placing before the House a summary of the statement on the practice of the House that he had made during the comments made by the member for Wills-namely, that it was not in order, in addressing a matter of public importance, to make personal reflections on and imputations against a member of the House in the absence of a substantive motion. The Deputy Speaker thus provided the House with a succinct statement of the proposition on which it was going to be asked to vote on the motion of dissent. This was an appropriate course of action, in my opinion. NA",103
99,Mr ABBOTT,DOCUMENTS,Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and I move: That the House take note of the following documents: Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) ActReport to the Commonwealth made under section 24 for the period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004. Roads to Recovery Programme-Report for 2003-04. Transport and Regional Services-Standing Committee-Report-Moving on intelligent transport systems-Government response. Debate (on motion by Ms Gillard) adjourned. NA Regional Services: Program Funding,104
100,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Wills proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Howard Government's maladministration of the Regional Partnerships Program I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",104
101,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I want to say at the outset that the Leader of the House indicated in his response in relation to our censure motion that the opposition were estopped from criticising Regional Partnerships grants because we did not oppose them during the election campaign period. Let me say in response that essentially we were had and the Australian people were had. We were given the impression that there was an orderly, independent process of assessment of these applications and that these grants were being made pursuant to that due process. Subsequently, the truth has come out that applications were approved without an application even being lodged. Applications were approved without the support or recommendation of the local area consultative committee. Applications were approved for projects which were in competition with other, private sector projects-the doctrine of competitive neutrality was being flouted. Applications were approved in circumstances where there was such a flagrant conflict of interest that a representative of the applicants was working as a staffer in the minister's officer. So, all over the place, we have come across unsatisfactory, inappropriate, improper aspects of administration of this program, and we intend to criticise them. It would be irresponsible of us to do anything less than that. The other thing that the minister said by way of response to some of our concerns about Regional Partnerships was the claim that a similar number of applications from Labor electorates were successful compared to the number coming from Liberal and National Party electorates. Let me assure the House that the only reason there is any substance to that is that there is a very low number of applications coming forward from Labor electorates compared with those coming from Liberal and National Party electorates. The reason for that is that Regional Partnerships has essentially been operated as a secret society. I invite members on my side of the House to indicate to me just what advice they received from the government about the existence of this scheme. It was a scheme whereby the government appointed the chairs of the area consultative committees-they appointed their fellow committee members-and then set about assessing applications. Many of those applications have been essentially inside jobs. This is a program for those in the know. We have seen it degenerate into a $150 million pork barrel administered by the Leader of the National Party himself. We are indebted to the Independent member for New England for first blowing the whistle in relation to this arrangement. He had the temerity to think that there might be some Regional Partnerships money for projects in his electorate-for example, the Tamworth Equine and Livestock Centreand the message came back from the government: ‘No, we're not going to fund that project while the Independent member for New England is associated with it.' Their idea was that the purpose of this program was to benefit the National Party. So, if the Independent member for New England was associated with it, it certainly was not achieving its purpose at all. So they had to get rid of him. When we asked Minister Anderson about this, he said that the reason that they had demanded that the name of the Independent member for New England be removed from the application was that they did not want the program to be political. Opposition member interjecting",104
102,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, astonishing-a great sense of irony! When we started examining this program we found, as I have indicated to the House, applications being approved prior to applications being lodged, applications falling over and applications being approved despite the advice of the department. The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee discovered in its hearings last week that principally Minister Kelly had departed from departmental recommendations not to approve a project and had decided to approve projects on 11 occasions. On a further three occasions she had given the projects 100 per cent of the funding sought, when the department had recommended less. On a further three occasions, where the department had recommended that a project be approved, she had not approved the project. The Auditor General has made plain in his investigation of previous programs that he believes that where this happens there needs to be a paper trail, that the reasons for the departure from the departmental recommendation need to be given and that those reasons need to be made public. It is extraordinary that this government refuses to make public the reasons for those decisions and departures. Indeed, this government refuses to make public the recommendations from the area consultative committees. That makes a joke of the whole process of independent assessment. It makes a farce of the whole idea of public accountability-where the government goes before the Senate committee and says, ‘No, we are not prepared to tell you what the area consultative committee has recommended,' and, when it suits the government, it will say, ‘Oh, this project was recommended by the area consultative committee.' But it is not prepared to make available to the House and to the people of Australia the totality of recommendations coming forward from area consultative committees about these projects. The other comment I would like to make about this idea that 78 per cent of projects have been approved is that it is almost an ‘everyone's a winner' situation. Some honourable members will remember the Centenary of Federation projects. All of us, as local members, had the capacity to go out and seek applications. I do not know what the general arrangement was, but in my electorate we ended up funding six or seven applications but knocking back 40 or 50, so it was not an ‘everyone's a winner' situation. There were many more applications than could be successful grants. But Regional Partnerships has been a program for those in the know and as a result there has been a relative scarcity of applications. It has not been advertised in the newspapers, on radio or on TV. Opposition members have not been informed of the nature of it; it has been kept in-house. Since my speech in parliament before Christmas on this issue we have learned details of a further project where good money was thrown after bad. Some $660,000 of taxpayers' money was given to the Beaudesert Shire Railway Support Group through the Regional Partnerships program in a circumstance where Beaudesert Rail had gone into receivership back in May 2003. That did not stop this government committing a further $660,000 to get Beaudesert Rail out of receivership. But we know that this project is not happening, even though Beaudesert Rail came out of receivership late last year with creditors receiving just 19 cents in the dollar. I understand that this project ceased operating in August this year and is subject to continuing legal action by creditors. Taxpayers are entitled to much more prudent stewardship of their money than this. Today we have seen a situation which just about takes the cake in terms of Regional Partnerships worse practice. Back in July and August 2004 the government announced two Regional Partnerships program grants totalling $1.5 million to facilitate dredging of Tumbi Creek, located at The Entrance in the marginal electorate of Dobell. Those grants, announced by the local member for Dobell and by the Prime Minister, were to fund the dredging of the mouth of Tumbi Creek and the relocation of spoil to the municipal tip. We matched the government's funding commitment during the 2004 election campaign. We were told this project had been approved under Regional Partnerships. We assumed that it had been properly assessed, so why wouldn't we support it? Like all other Australians, we have been misled in relation to this matter. The member for Dobell announced the first Regional Partnerships grant of $748,000 on 8 June. That announcement preceded Wyong Shire Council's consideration of a dredging options report and a decision to lodge an application under the Regional Partnerships program. The Daily Telegraph Central Coast extra edition on 9 June last year carried this report: Federal member for Dobell, Ken Ticehurst, yesterday committed the money to pay for 15,000 cubic metres of spoil to be dredged and dumped at Buttonderry Tip near Wyee under the Regional Partnerships program. Wyong Shire Council will meet tonight to decide how best to deal with the Tumbi Creek problem and whether or not to apply for the funding. What a bizarre process. How can the member for Dobell be saying that Minister Kelly has approved this project when Minister Kelly has not even seen an application? She has approved the grant; now all we need is the application. That reminds me of the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland, who sentenced first and the trial came later. In Minister Kelly's case, it is grant first lodge the application later. According to advice from the Department of Transport and Regional Services to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee regional funding inquiry, the first Tumbi Creek funding application was lodged on 24 June last year and approved on the same day-16 days after the member for Dobell announced the first Regional Partnerships funding allocation. This ought to be compared with other area consultative committees, who have been waiting months and months for a decision from this department. We also discovered that there was a second application. The Department of Transport and Regional Services told the Senate inquiry that Regional Partnerships applications were lodged on 24 June and on 11 July. The Prime Minister announced the second Regional Partnerships funding allocation on 26 August, three days before the federal election date was named, and yet the Department of Transport and Regional Services says that just one approval was made, on 24 June-the same day the first application was received. Either no formal approval was granted with respect to the second funding application, or the full funding was approved prior to submission of the second application and the public campaign for state government funding was just a charade. It is important to derstand that no part of this process fell within the election period and no action related to this process could be considered as an election commitment free from the rigour of standard administrative processes. We have also discovered that the local area advisory consultative committee considers the project proposal a low priority and that the New South Wales government has expressed concern about the proposed expenditure of $2 million on remedial action unrelated to the Tuggerah Lakes estuary management plan. As I indicated to the and House earlier, not only did we have that bizarre and farcical situation of grants being approved without applications even being made, let alone assessed, but we subsequently had a situation where rainfall last year washed out the Tumbi Creek mouth. We had a situation where Mr Graeme Hallett, a special adviser in the office of Jim Lloyd, Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, wrote to Giulio Cerasani, Mr Cobb's DLO, about the conditions for this grant, making clear his expectation that there would be no doubt about the way forward to deliver the commitment on Tumbi Creek. I understand that Mr Hallett had been working as one of the campaign team in the office of the member for Dobell, so he was in a position to know a great deal about the member for Dobell's views on these matters. He fired off an email to the department saying, ‘We don't want any doubt about the way forward to deliver the commitment on Tumbi Creek.' He said: The commitment by the Howard government to the electors of Dobell, in partnership with the Wyong council, is non-negotiable. It is the position of Mr Ticehurst that the money be delivered as agreed for the works in the schedule of agreement under Regional Partnerships. His message to the department was very clear. His expectation was that that money un- would be paid over, regardless of whether or not it was needed any longer for dredging works. When his email to the department did not seem to be hitting the mark, he fired off another email to the member for Dobell and the Wyong shire non-Labor councillors, issuing the following warning: Any changes mean less federal money, so Wyong officials should keep their counsel on this if we want the total allocated by the PM for Tumbi Creek. The import of that email is absolutely clear. The intention is to defraud taxpayers. The intention is to make sure that the grant goes ahead, whether it is needed or not. That is scandalous. We have the minister's office seeking to mislead his own department. We have the minister's office telling Wyong Shire Council, ‘You keep quiet about this; otherwise we will lose some of this money.' This is a disgraceful situation. It is time Prime Minister faced up to his responsibilities under his ministerial code of conduct. It is time he faced up to his responsibility to make sure that Regional Partnerships becomes something better than a National Party slush fund. (Time expired)",105
103,Mr JOHN COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Parkes-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services) (3.48 p.m.)-I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance, especially when it is to make clear what an incredibly good program Regional Partnerships has been. While the input from the members opposite has been all about what it does for National Party people-they intimate that this is in regional and remote Australia-in actual fact today they have done nothing but talk about almost metropolitan projects. And that is what Regional Partnerships is about. does not just look after regional Australia. Obviously it stresses the needs of regional Australia, but it also looks after outer metrocall politan areas. This program was put in place some 18 months ago. It was done not because one day the government decided to see just what it might be able to do for regional Australia but because some five or six years ago the Deputy Prime Minister called a Regional Australia Summit. Quite obviously the members of the opposition do not like the fact that Regional Partnerships is an incredibly successful program. It is probably the most popular program in Australia today, perhaps second to or running in conjunction with Roads to Recovery, which is also something this government brought in. This area having been ignored by Labor for 13 years, Roads to Recovery, like Regional Partnerships, is out there expressly to help people who desperately need it. Some five years ago the Deputy Prime Minister, who was then the minister for rethe gional services, called a summit of some 200 or 300 people from right around Australia. As a matter of fact, I was there in the guise of an agropolitician, representing farmers from around Australia. I was one of those delegates. That conference, that gathering here in Canberra of people from right around regional Australia, looked at what was happening at a time when the efficiency driven rationalisation of farming in country Australia and unemployment were at their height and we needed to know what could be done about them. For three days those delegates were helped by people from government and from the universities of regional Australia to sort out their ideas. And they had ideas. The government looked at the things that conference came up with that it, in partnership with the communities of regional Australia, could do to make things work, to get It things going-to get the guts of regional Australia turned around and to help it go forward once again. There was a very strong that there needed to be a mechanism that would enable our communities to build their own way ahead-a vehicle to help them help themselves and enable us to go forward and help them. It would be a leg-up, a new start, to address local needs. What happened? The government listened to what 200 or 300 people from right around Australia said. We did not listen to bureaucrats; we did not listen to politicians; we listened to what the people out there said should happen. One of the many responses to the Regional Australia Summit was to develop a range of policies and programs, using examples of what people from Western Australia, northern Queensland, western New South Wales and places like Bendigo and Ballarat had been able to do for themselves. The particular areas that were addressed were health, education, jobs, capacity building and restructuring, where particular infrastructure had failed services or particular industries were no longer viable in an area. One of the key initiatives, one of the first responses, was the government's Regional Solutions Program, which enabled communities to apply for funds to work in community situations. Lo and behold, it was highly successful. It was the forerunner to Regional Partnerships. When the Regional Solutions Program reached the end of its life it became obvious that, in a partnership situation, we could help regional Australia rebuild itselfthat we could make an enormous difference. Eighteen months ago Regional Partnerships was born. It brought together the government's key regional development programs, including the Regional Solutions Program, the Regional Assistance Program-RAPthe Rural Transaction Centres program and the government's specially targeted structural adjustment initiatives. The aim of it was to strengthen economic growth and help with services and regional planning-to give people an opportunity to help themselves. Major structural change was enabled by it. One of the major things to come out of Regional Partnerships is that it helps creates new jobs. People help themselves create new jobs. I do not think it will come as a surprise, even to those opposite, to learn that this government is a huge supporter of regional development. We believe in it. We believe in supporting the regions. Agriculture, even without mining, is still responsible for creatment, ing nearly one-quarter of Australia's exports. Through Regional Partnerships and as a result of that original summit we continue to respond to what regional Australia wants-to the needs of country people in towns, in the bush and all around the country. The rationalisation that has occurred in the last 10 to 20 years has been absolutely enormous, with environmental change and major economic and social change. All we have done is rewhere spond to that, and we have responded very well. I guess it is hard for those opposite, because they never tried to do anything about it. They never made any attempt to find out what the problems were in the first place and they certainly did not attempt to address them. What makes Regional Partnerships so successful? It is not just us on our own or the communities on their own. It is the local communities, the local government, the local councils, the Commonwealth and your friends the state government who are supporting Regional Partnerships. Every $1 that we put into a Regional Partnerships program is on average attracting $3 more. Some of that, I grant you, is state money. Your political colleagues, if I may call them that, around the country obviously see what a beneficial tool Regional Partnerships is, how necessary it is and what a heck of a good job it is doing. We are not only helping to create jobs, we are stimulating local economies. More than anything, what we are doing is working. I think that is what is upsetting you: it works, we invented it, we made sure that we listened to the communities and we pushed it forward. Even your own political colleagues are working with us to help make it work. While those on the other side do not like it, the main reason that I think we are standing here today talking about this is that they would like very much to divert the govern the parliament and certainly Australia from their own problems. What better thing to do than try to attack one of the most successful programs any government has ever devised? So they start a Senate inquiry, which is quite obviously nothing more than a witch-hunt. It has tried to discredit the integjects rity of this program, which I have demonstrated is one of the more successful programs that has ever been created. I heard the member for Wills not long ago talking about the fact that 78 per cent of these projects go through. So he is assuming that not enough are being applied for. What he totally misunderstands-he understands nothing about the whole program-is that the ACCs try to help people in their attempts to make applications. The department helps people in their attempts to make applications. Those that are wildly unlikely to get up never see the light of day, because it is pointed out that they are not appropriate. Seventy-eight per cent is a very creditable figure when you realise that a lot of people are being steered the right way from the start: 1,111 projects, roughly $202 million worth, have been submitted; 674, $150 million worth, have been assessed; 522, $125 million worth, have been approved; 152 have not been approved; and 169 have been withdrawn. Why have they been withdrawn? Why are they not part of the projects submitted? Because people were steered the right way in the beginning so that they did not waste their own time or the time of the department and the ACCs. I seem to recall the member for Wills being astounded that the previous Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services who oversaw Regional Partnerships changed the departmental recommendation on 11 occasions. That is incredible. That is 11 out of 674 projectssomething under two per cent. We are a government; we are not a part of a department. If departments got everything right all the time then we would not have governments. We are elected to do a job. The minister or the parliamentary secretary is elected to make an assessment. I think two per cent or 11 out of 674 is such a low figure that, given most proand most ministerial intervention, it almost does not exist. The statement by the member for Wills would be one of the most ridiculous statements made in this House for a long time by anybody-shadow minister or otherwise. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the opposition-be it the new Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wills or anyone else-are simply trying to divert the attention of Australians from their own troubles by attacking one of the most successful programs around at the moment. It is also very sad that they choose to attack a project which is bringing so much help to so many people. When local governments, communities, charitable organisations and corporate citizens are throwing money into projects around Australia at a rate of $3 for every dollar the Commonwealth puts in, I do not think that sounds like a program that is being rorted. That sounds like a program that is needed and that is doing one heck of a job around Australia. It is an active program; it is working; it is popular; and it is a proven process. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you as someone who administers that process that it is exhaustive. The way that projects are given due diligence-given that we are very aware that we are dealing with tax dollars from people who obviously are not going to benefit from Regional Partnerships-is an exhaustive process. I also think it is particularly sad that in this chamber we hear members of the opposition drag up the names of departmental officials who work their guts out and who do a hell of a job. The opposition could not care less whether that is embarrassing to a person who has done nothing but their job and who has done it well. It is very sad to drag up their name in the public arena; it is a shame. In fact, I think it is disgraceful. We are talking about a program which delivers jobs and which helps restructuring, health and services. The member for Wills seems to have left us for the moment. He does not like to listen to anybody, except himself. I would like to challenge him on a few projects. The Flat Bottle project is in his own electorate, strangely enough. I would like to hear him tell those people that he does not support the $150,000 of Regional Partnerships funding for the Social Firm Management Group for the Flat Bottle Co. project. I would like to hear him go to the member for Grey's electorate in South Australia and say to PY Media that he does not support the PY Network project in one of the most disadvantaged areas in Australia. I would like him go to the town of Cobar in my electorate and tell the people there that they do not need a medical centre. (Time expired).",108
104,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have seen the purported defence of the indefensible. There is no doubt that the Regional Partnerships program was massively rorted. It is a disgrace of public administration. Look at the simple things that have been established. There is the conflict of interest in the office of the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Mr Crooke was employed in her office whilst also making representations on behalf of a beneficiary in the A2 Milk scandal. Look at the instances where the minister overrode the department, with no rationale being established. It trary to the way in which the Auditor-General said these matters should be administered. Look at the absurd malapportionment and the inexplicable distribution of the funds across Australia. We have reached a point where, for the first time, Australian parliamentarians who travel to Papua New Guinea will not be able to adopt any superior airs when they look at the schemes that have been adopted in Papua New Guinea for discretionary funds-where each member of parliament is given discretionary funds to allocate as they willbecause in this country the government is allocating funds as it will, with entire indifference to its opposition. Where the government spent money in Labor seats, it did so to secure victory in marginal seats-Bass is the best example. The government did not distribute funds fairly across the board to seats; it did it with an eye specifically to its own electoral advantage. What about the extraordinary way in which the latest scandal has been revealed about Tumbi Creek? The member for Dobell announced that program about a fortnight before an application was made. I call that the Nostradamus defence-the capacity to look into the future and anticipate an application being made and the minister approving it. I suspect that the member for Dobell is actually the secret author of ‘Mystic Medusa', the horoscope that appears every weekend in the Weekend Australian. He wrote his own horoscope in the last issue on 5-6 February. The member's birthday makes him an Aquarian. This is his horoscope: The usual old merde disguised as a New Deal. ... You could polish this up into a gem of a sitcom: Psyche near Uranus in your $$$ sector makes television projects/appearances extra profitable all month. ... Meanwhile, it's all about the reinvention of wonderful You, numero uno again with an astro-cluster in Aquarius and your annual New is entirely conMoon on February 9. Mystic Medusa, you have got it right: in the old merde again! Take aside the absurdity of an announcement of a project before it has been sought, then look at what actually happens once the grant has been announced. The grant was to clear the blockage at the mouth of a creek$1.5 million to dredge that sand out and take it to a tip. But what happens between the seeking of the grant and its request is massive rainfall, so the mouth of the creek is unblocked. There is no requirement to do the dredging-a problem because, plainly, the council anticipated that they would have to seek a reallocation of the funds. But what happens? The minister's office intervenes to tell them, ‘Don't do that because, were you to do that, we would have to reduce your funding or you might not get it at all.' So there is a conspiracy engaged in wherein the council is asked to provide false information about the state of the creek. What is this akin to? Even assuming there was some propriety in the grant, is it not the situation where a person discovers a theft of their property, makes an insurance claim and then, perhaps a fortnight later, discovers that he actually misplaced that which he had claimed-but there is a conspiracy between him and his friends not to disclose that to the insurance company? Is that not fraud? Of course it is. And it is fraud not only with respect to our common understanding. Plainly, were these facts to be established as we understand them-in a debate such as this we can only hypothesise rather than make direct allegations-there are a number of offences under the Criminal Code which appear to be apposite. Section 134.2, on obtaining financial advantage through deception, sets out the fault elements of that crime. The physical element is that the ‘Defendant induces a person to believe a thing is true'-that is, that the creek is still blocked. The fault element requires ‘Intention', and plainly there was intention. For the physical element that the representation is ‘False', the fault element requires ‘Intention or Recklessness'. The physical element is that ‘A third party obtains a financial advantage from a Commonwealth entity'. The fault element ultimately requires ‘Dishonesty'. Assume for a moment that there was doubt about the applicability of that section; there could hardly be any doubt about the applicability of section 135.1, ‘General Dishonesty'. General dishonesty simply requires in the physical element of conduct that the ‘Defendant does something' with the ‘Intention (of dishonestly obtaining a gain from another person who is a C'wealth entity)'. When we speak of ‘conduct' and ‘doing things', remember that the Criminal Code defines conduct and engaging in conduct as either performing or omitting to perform an act. So remaining silent when you know that the department believes the creek is still blocked, or putting forward representations like to the effect that it remains blocked when you know it is not, clearly comes under that heading. Then you have provisions under section 135.2, ‘Obtaining a financial advantage'. Those provisions state: The following elements are for the offence of obtaining a financial advantage for another: 1. Physical Element (‘conduct') Defendant induces the C'wealth entity to do something Fault Element Intention 2. Physical Element (‘result of conduct') A third party received a financial advantage from the C'wealth Fault Element Knowledge or Belief (that the third party is ineligible to receive that financial advantage) Of course, there are other offences, such as conspiracy to defraud when conducted not by a single person but, as it appears in this instance, by a number of parties engaging together to have the Commonwealth make payments to which they are no longer entitled. Section 135.4(1), conspiracy to obtain a gain, and section 135.4(7), conspiracy to influence a Commonwealth official, would apply. Then there are provisions in relation to false or misleading statements and applications. There are a number of different offences in relation to that. But, if you make a statement with the intention to do so, if that statement is false and misleading, if that statement omits a matter or thing and you have knowledge of that, and if you have made that statement in relation to an application for a claim for benefit or you are reckless with regard to that, then you commit that crime. Under section 137.1 ‘False or misleading information', there are a number of provisions about simply giving ‘information to another'. The intention must be to provide that information, where the information is ‘false or misleading' and omits a ‘matter or thing', you have knowledge of that and the other person is a Commonwealth entity. There are serious matters that not only this House but no doubt law enforcement will be looking at to examine whether or not the matters described in this House today are made out. But the Prime Minister, like Diogenes, walking around the stews of the National Party seeking the honest man, seems blind to the obvious. Not a single sparrow will fall. Not a single minor minister will be drawn into a breach of the ministerial code. But, like Monty Python, there they are: the parrotsDr Southcott-The dead parrots!",111
105,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"not dead; just resting, pining for the fjords. But, yes, the House knows that they are dead parrots, and they are sitting there waiting to fall.",113
106,Dr SOUTHCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Monty Python, Diogenes, Mystic Medusa-a wealth of allusions there. Harold Wilson famously said that a week is a long time in politics. Well, if a week is a long time, what a difference four months make. Four months ago all members of this House would have been actively engaged on election day. In 45 minutes time, the first results would have come through from Tasmania. It was the day that the Australian people cast their judgment on who they wanted to lead Australia over the next three years. I remember the message at that time was that Labor was ready to lead. What I found during the Christmas break and over January was that one of the questions that constituents would pose was: ‘What if Labor had won?' It is worth thinking about: what if the Labor Party had won? Usually that question elicits chuckles and a little bit of mirth. Other constituents have said that one of the great joys in life for them is waking up, listening to the ABC news, lying in bed in the morning and just chuckling at the latest episode in the saga and soap opera that is the Australian Labor Party. One of the key questions that was asked and answered during the federal election campaign was: ‘Who do you trust to manage an $800 billion economy?' Our message very consistently was: it takes focus; it takes discipline; it takes a good record to run a complex, large Australian economy. People cast their judgments. Politics is a competitive business and the job of the opposition is to mount the argument that they could administer the country and the economy better than the government. As I said, people actually stop and say, ‘What if the Labor Party had won?' As we have seen the last four months unfolding, it is worth thinking about how Labor would have responded to the tsunami, for example. How would Labor have dealt with some of the challenges that are facing the Australian government now? During the election campaign I found, like all members, that there were a couple of conversations that really stuck in my mind. One came fairly early in the campaign when a gentleman rang me and said that his father had always told him that he would be quite happy to have a Labor government but they were no good on foreign policy and they were no good on finance. I thought that sounded like our campaign and I said: ‘When did your father say this? That's incredible.' He said, ‘My father died in 1952.' What it shows you is that there are some perennials in Australian politics that do not change. bor, in the view of the population, is always suspect on those issues. The issues in 2004 were the economy and national security. This is a MPI on the subject of administratenary tion. It is worth going back and looking at Labor's track record on administration. I found it an amazing conjunction of events when we had the devastation of the tsunami on 26 December 2004 and then on 1 January 2005 the National Archives released the cabinet records from 1974. Of course, one of the things in 1974 was Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Eve. John Menadue reported that Gough Whitlam was reluctant to return from an overseas trip. His quote went something like: ‘If I have to put up with the-expletive deleted-caucus, I will have my trips.' It was a reminder of how 30 years ago a previous member for Werriwa dealt with a natural disaster. It was a reminder of how a Labor government approached a natural disaster in Australia. People are welcome to draw their own conclusions there. More recently, we can go to the HawkeKeating years. Another one of the key questions-and Labor is trying to morph it into something else-was, as we asserted, that interest rates are always higher under a Labor government. That was what we said, and Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, is trying to say that we were talking about the movement of interest rates. All we said was that interest rates are always higher under a Labor government. That is because the trade union movement has too much influence in the Labor Party and because Labor governments spend more than they collect. Those are the principal reasons. Interest rates reached 17 per cent under the Labor Party and averaged 12 per cent. That was over the Hawke-Keating years. Of course, the famous example of maladministration that everyone knows about was the whiteboard affair-the sports rorts afLafair-in which the administration was so slack that there were no records, and a channel of money was funnelled into Labor Party electorates. That was now 11 years ago. CenHouse is another example of a Labor rort where taxpayers' money has been channelled back into the Australian Labor Party to fund their election campaigns. There have been some allegations about regional programs. The member for Wills made some allegations that the majority of funds flow to coalition electorates. There is a very good reason for that: the majority of rural electorates are held by the coalition. Out of 45 rural seats, 38 are held by the Liberal Party or by the National Party. If you add in provincial seats, almost three-quarters of them are held by the Liberal Party or by the National Party. I think an assertion was made that there was a very low number of applications coming from Labor Party seats. A very good question is why? We used to hear a bit from the Labor members for MCMillan, Braddon and Paterson. They used to be trotted out as representatives of rural and regional Australia. Why were these Labor members not generating applications in their electorates? Labor used to hold seats in regional Australia. During the HawkeKeating years from 1983 to 1996 I think they held as many rural and regional seats as the Liberal Party and the National Party did. People showed what they thought about that. People showed what they thought about their work level, their representation and their ability to deliver for their electorates when they tossed them out in 1996. This shows that coalition members are much more in touch with the needs of their communities and they are much more active in supporting community-driven projects. Eight hundred applications came from coalition electorates compared with 205 from Labor electorates. What were the Labor members doing? I know that many members on this side who represent rural and regional areas go to a lot of effort to try to get their community groups to put in applications. We have heard a little bit about a creek in Dobell. We did not hear much in this MPI about the turtle interpretation centre which the bor Party committed $1½ million towards. It had already secured funding from the state and local government authorities. No approach had been made to the Australian government, yet the Labor Party announced $1½ million to the turtle interpretation course, they matched the funding for the creek in Dobell. They announced $150 million for a rail line in Richmond, $1 million for a national centre of democracy in Ballarat, $10 million for a national museum in Cairns, $1 million for something in Bundaberg, $3 million for Thuringowa and $6 million for the Rockhampton show grounds. What applications were put in? What costings were done? In conclusion, it is the job of the opposition to hold the government to account, but the Labor Party's track record is very poor.

109,Dr STONE,REPORTS,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (4.24 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Proposed refurbishment of Australia House in London, United Kingdom. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes the refurbishment of Australia House in London. Australia House accommodates the Australian High Commission in London, as well as a number of federal and state government tenant agencies, including Department of Defence staff. The building is not only Australia's oldest overseas mission but is also the oldest originally occupied chancery of any foreign mission in London. Officially opened in 1918, Australia House has served Australians at rehome and in the United Kingdom without interruption since that time. It is located in London's West End, so is readily accessible to the many thousands of Australians who visit each year and to those who wish to visit or migrate to Australia. Australia House is therefore a prestigious and centrally located asset well worth preserving. While the building has been well maintained over its lifetime, changes in internal functions of accommodated staff and environmental effects over almost 90 years have rendered it inevitable that a substantial refurbishment is required. To this end, an initial refurbishment project was undertaken in the late 1990s. The works now proposed are those priority areas remaining, comprising external works to the three building core light wells and internal works to the fourthlevel accommodation of the Australian Defence staff. The light wells are the most difficult areas of Australia House to access and the areas most in need of refurbishment to overcome water ingress and general facia deterioration. A substantial temporary structure will need to be erected to provide access. The levelfour works are intended to occur concurrently in order to get the maximum use out of this structure. This not only achieves a reasonable construction synergy, but it also avoids logistic and security concerns that would otherwise be associated with having to access level four internally through Australia House. The scope of the proposed works will include the following: - erection of a temporary scaffold and hoist structure outside Australia House, and inside the light wells, for movement of personnel, equipment and material; - construction of temporary accommodation on the top building floors for Defence staff while their fourth level furbished; - refurbishment of the fourth level of the building, including base building services and fit-out, after Defence staff have temporarily relocated; - refurbishment of the light wells, comprising replacement of single glaze windows and frames with double glaze units of similar appearance, repair and replacement of damaged brickwork, face tiles and cast iron pipe work, and high pressure cleaning generally; and - removal of scaffold and hoists after completion of refurbishment works. The estimated cost of the new proposal is $11.98 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, these works are planned to commence in May 2006 and to be completed by mid-2007. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Reference",117
110,Dr STONE,REPORTS,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (4.28 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Ordnance breakdown facility, proof and experimental establishment site, Port Wakefield, South Australia. The Department of Defence proposes to provide an ordnance breakdown facility that will be located at the Proof and Experimental Establishment site at Port Wakefield, South Australia. This proposal was referred to the Public Works Committee on 24 June 2004 but the reference lapsed when the previous committee ceased to exist with the prorogais retion of parliament on 31 August 2004. The proposed facility will enhance the capability of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation to provide technical intelligence on a range of weapons that potentially threaten Australian Defence Force personnel. The proposed ordnance breakdown facility consists of the following elements: - a disassembly building that provides separate rooms for breakdown of explosive ordnance, radiographic examination and equipment storage along with an enclosed external unloading/loading bay; - a cutting building that provides separate rooms for operation of remotely controlled cutting equipment, radiographic examination and equipment storage along with an enclosed external loading bay; - explosive ordnance storehouses for the storage of explosive ordnance and broken down components; and - supporting infrastructure and services. The budget estimate for the proposed works is $8.4 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will start midyear and be completed by the middle of next year. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Reference",118
111,Dr STONE,REPORTS,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (4.30 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development of on-base housing for Defence at Puckapunyal, Victoria. The Defence Housing Authority proposes the construction of 80 on-base residences at the Puckapunyal army base in Victoria. The role of the Defence Housing Authority is to provide suitable housing to meet the operational needs of the Australian Defence Force and the requirements of the Department of Defence. The Defence Housing Authority satisfies Defence accommodation requirements through a mixture of: construction off-base, with a view to retaining the properties or selling them with a lease attached; construction on-base, to accord with Defence operational or policy requirements and/or if such construction is the most cost-effective for all concerned; direct purchase, with a view to retaining the properties or selling them with a lease attached; and direct lease from the private rental market. Of these options, only on-base construction is feasible at Puckapunyal. The housing market in the nearest town, Seymour, would be too readily distorted by Defence requirements and provides few amenities beyond those available onbase. The project involves the construction of 80 three-bedroom houses on previously occupied residential sites that are presently vacant. Infrastructure works are not required. The proposed project will have a positive effect on the local economy during the construction period, not only through persons working directly on the site but also through the off-site supply of material, plant and equipment. The construction of these new dwellings on-base at Puckapunyal is not expected to affect either the sale or rental markets for residential accommodation in the the neighbouring townships. The estimated cost of the proposal is $19.6 million. Subject to parliamentary and Defence Housing Authority board approval, the construction program is expected to commence in July this year, with the delivery of completed dwellings expected to occur progressively from February 2006 through to November 2006. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (EDUCATION STANDARDS) BILL 2004 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time.

112,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,"The original question was that these bills be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Wills has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (4.33 p.m.)-I am very angry, and so is the Geelong community, that there is any suggestion from the Howard government that funding for the Geelong bypass be tied in any shape or form to other Victorian AusLink projects such as the Scoresby bypass. This is a critical piece of regional and national infrastructure. I simply say to the Howard government: quit playing politics with it and get on with the job. I have one other piece of advice for the minister and the government: good public policy outcomes and strong partnerships with other levels of government are never achieved in a lasting sense when one key party is motivated by vindictive ideological obsessions. It has been a strongly held belief of mine that Australia's transport infrastructure is a major determinant of its economic growth. That is why I have despaired at the wasted years of the Howard government in this very important area of public policy. In my shadow ministerial portfolio responsibilities I have often taken a particular interest in the struggle by rural communities for road funding. One such involvement in recent years was with the community of Ungarra on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia to secure funding to complete a local road for that community. I note that the Eyre Peninsula was recently devastated by bushfires, with significant loss of life, and I wish the people of Ungarra well in their recovery from the bushfires. They are proud, resilient and decent country people, and I am sure they will come through this disaster with a stronger community. In my own community in the Geelong region I am very proud of the achievements of past and present Labor governments, both federal and state, in ensuring that the region's transport infrastructure positions the Geelong area for future economic growth. It was a federal Labor government that contributed funding to the dual carriageway on the Bellarine Highway which now services Leopold, Drysdale, Clifton Springs and other coastal towns on the Bellarine Peninsula. It was a federal Labor government that contributed substantially to the dual carriageway between Geelong and the Great Ocean Road at Torquay, which has underpinned massive tourism and residential growth along the Great Ocean Road. It was the Bracks government and the federal opposition, led by Kim Beazley at the time, that made the public financial commitment to the third lane on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne, forcing the federal coalition to match our funding commitment. It was the Bracks Labor government that was the first to commit funding to the Geelong bypass. I commend the contributions of my state Labor parliamentary colleagues and their efforts in securing that commitment, which was the catalyst for the eventual commitment made by the Howard government. Transport issues have dominated the Geelong political scene over the 11 years I have been the member for Corio, and I have been pleased to play my part, on behalf of my constituents, in the lobbying efforts to secure funding from all levels of government for these important projects. We on this side of the House will be supporting the broad intent of this legislation. Why wouldn't we? After all, we went to the 2001 election with a detailed proposal for a national land transport plan. There are several key proposals that have formed the core of Labor's policy in opposition since 1996, and we intend to insist on them again during this term-namely, the setting of national transport infrastructure priorities rail, the pursuit of an integrated planning approach to the land transport task, the construction of genuine partnerships with other levels of government to achieve national outcomes, the pursuit of a long-term funding framework that exists beyond the half lives of governments at various levels and the integration of the transport task with other social and environmental objectives. The past behaviour of the Howard government in this policy area gives the opposition grave concern about the administration of AusLink and transport policy. We are not convinced that the government is really committed to a national land transport plan and funding according to agreed priorities. We have little confidence that the government will not rort substantial slabs of the land transport budget for its own political ends, as has occurred in other regional programs-as, dare I say it, revealed by the Leader of the Opposition today in question time. Even a cursory reading of the minister's second reading speech indicates that there is significant potential for the government to rort the land transport budget again. There is disturbing evidence of the government's intention to once again dodge its fiscal responsibility in the transport area and cost shift to Labor states in a systematic way. It is also disturbing to note that, in order to peddle its own ideological obsessions and prejudices, the government intends abusing the important partnership required with state Labor governments to undertake these projects. The Victorian government did not come to the table with over $190 million worth of funding for the Geelong ring-road project and make the federal contribution contingent on certain provisions if funding was to proceed, so why is the federal government seeking to do that with state Labor for road and governments? The government's use of its purchasing power to achieve its ideological objectives in the construction industry through its so called code of practice is a case in point. This code of practice has no legislative sanction and can be changed at whim by the government. There is no independent review of the code's application within government and its potential impact on legally certified agreements struck under the Workplace Relations Act, and there is no independent review of the impact on employers who wish to tender for projects but have struck such legal agreements that may be non-compliant with the code. Yet the government has been prepared to put in jeopardy key infrastructure projects for the Geelong region-and others-for the sake of pursuing its own ideological obsessions and political prejudices. With regard to Australian agriculture and fisheries, the efficiency of the road transport task is critical to the long-term prosperity of many of our key rural industries, such as meat, grains, sugar, dairy and horticulture, and to rural communities which depend on them for their ongoing viability. The nation's export performance and competitiveness in agriculture depends heavily on the achievement of greater efficiencies in the transport task. We do expect that in regional areas the government will fund key land transport infrastructure projects that will deliver over long term the sorts of economic efficiencies that underpin our great rural and fishing industries and lead at the end of the day to greater prosperity for all Australians.",120
113,Mr BEAZLEY,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,"The AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 and the AusLink (National Land TransportConsequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004 underscore Labor's concerns about this government's approach to management of the nation's infrastructure and to management of Australia's economy more generally. This is a government where political considerations take priority over considerations relating to Australia's national interest. It is a government where short-term fixes take precedence over long-term economic and social needs. It is a complacent government that wants to take credit for our current prosperity-which is the fruit of a long period of reforms-but has neither the vision nor the backbone to take the decisions that will build Australia's future prosperity. It is interesting that more and more often in the community now people are accepting the view that our long period of prosperity is in large measure a product of the decisionscontroversial and difficult in their day-that were taken by the Hawke and Keating governments. This government has benefited enormously from that prosperity and now it has squandered it. In all the indices of those measures that we put in place when we were in office you can see that Australia is going backwards where we once went forwards. The figures associated with exports show under this government a rate of growth that is half what it was when we were in office. Research and development funding in the business sector collapsed for the first few years of operation of this government. It is only just beginning to trend upwards now, while all our competitors have been on a the non-stop trajectory upwards. There has been a collapse in skills-and in traditional areas that has been worse of all. As it is with infrastructure, so it is with training. This government loves the political atmosphere. It is tremendously good with words and political positioning but appalling with the delivery of outcomes. In the skills area, for example, we had the modern apprenticeship training system, which simply concealed the collapse of traditional trades. And now, if you go to the mining companies in my home town, they will not have a conversation with you about indiscipline in their work forces; they will say to you very directly, ‘We will not invest and we cannot invest because we cannot get a work force.' They cannot get it here and they cannot bring it in from overseas. It is not available-the welders are not there; the electricians are not there. An electrician in a Western Australian mining town now will earn between $150,000 and $200,000 a year. The mining companies have no capacity to do the work that they need to do, because they do not have the resources that need to be there to do it. The other area is national infrastructure, and this comes back to this bill. The OECD report that was out last week simply repeats what I have had to say in my opening remarks on this bill. That OECD report was very critical of this government. It was critical of this government in two key areas: skills, which I have already mentioned, and infrastructure. It is not as though money is not spent; it is just how it is spent. Again, it is not part of a national plan targeted to real areas of need; it is part of a national scheme of pork-barrelling targeted at political concerns of the Commonwealth. You cannot do this over a lengthy period of time without the nation paying a penalty. Day by day, we are hearing more about the crisis in infrastructure facing this nation. hear about problems that are emerging in the crucial infrastructure networks that help make Australia efficient and competitive in the global economy-problems such as roads, ports, water, communications, energy and other crucial aspects of the nation's infrastructure. We are facing serious economic constraints; the long-term effects of years of short-term, politically driven policy making are beginning to hit home. That is why I want to comment on this bill. Rather than coming to terms with the nation's infrastructure problems and the lack of strategic planning that has caused them, this government now plans to make matters worse. As the member for Wills said in his comments to this House yesterday, this is the latest instalment in a sorry tale of the progressive collapsing of the nation's infrastrucovercome ture spending into a series of National Party slush funds. We have seen it before. In the environment we have seen it with the Natural Heritage Trust. In communications we have seen it with Networking the Nation. In roads we have seen it with Roads of National Importance. We have seen it with the Regional Partnerships program. And now we see a complacent government planning to entrench its self-interested political decision making in this bill. Contemplate the programs I have been talking about-every one of them surrounded by verbiage of fine words and the right sentiments with the mobilisation of community sentiment behind them. Every one of them-to the tune of tens of millions of dollars-is targeted to support a shortterm political outcome, not a long-term benefit for the nation. You cannot do that without damaging your country in the end. It is smart politics while it lasts-God knows the government is very rarely internally inspected through the accountability processes around this town-but sooner or later the chickens We come home to roost, and they are cackling away in the yard now as we look at the bare bones of the infrastructure strategies of this government. Distance has always been a critical element of the story of this nation's development. We have never enjoyed the advantage that many of our trading partners have-of large populations living in close proximity to other well-populated countries providing ready access to markets for their goods and services. We have always lived with great distances between our heavily populated areas and, of course, with great distances between our country and our friends and neighbours. This means that infrastructure planning has always been a crucially important element in our national development. Good planning and prudent investment can challenges of distance. Without clear-sighted, long-term planning for the needs of growing populations and industries, we experience the bottlenecks and strains on our infrastructure that we now face. What we need now is a process of objective, long-sighted planning of our nation's infrastructure needs. We need a government that is willing to work cooperatively with the states and act in the national interest. We do not need another slush fund to allow the nation's limited resources to be diverted into white elephant projects in marginal National Party electorates. But that is exactly what this bill proposes with the AusLink Strategic Regional Projects fund. People should learn to be fearful when they hear those sorts of words associated with any government proposition. This $150 million fund gives the minister wide discretion as to how to allocate those funds, on top of the AusLink Roads to Recovery program, which similarly gives the minister virtual free rein on spending decisions. Make no mistake about it: this is a story in which there are more losers than winners. When crucial infrastructure funds are being diverted for pork-barrelling for National Party politicians, the people who bear the costs of those decisions are the families spread throughout the vast suburban areas of our major cities. These are the people who live in the exploding suburbs where a failure of long-term planning means that the infrastructure networks and services that they rely on from day to day are too often stretched to breaking point. They have to cope with the daily grind of battling through congested roads where the Commonwealth fails to live up to its national responsibilities. People in areas like Campbelltown and Liverpool, which I visited last week, have to put up with overstretched infrastructure every day of their lives-their roads, transport links, hospitals and schools. They are the people who are losing out because this government is more concerned with National Party politicians than with ordinary families. They have to live with the inconvenience and disruption to family life that occurs when you cannot find a bulk-billing GP after hours, when the hospital emergency room is miles away and always overcrowded or when a failure to coordinate transport effectively means that they waste hours every week in travelling between home, work and schools. They are the people who are forgotten when this government is forking out millions of dollars on projects that would not get a look-in if there was a fair, objective process for funding our infrastructure needs. The people in areas like Campbelltown and Liverpool would at least get a fair hearing if we had a fair, objective process for deciding how to allocate our spending on crucial infrastructure. But they do not get a look-in because they are not located in a National Party electorate. The government's neglect of those families is so great that with this by-election coming up in the seat of Werriwa it cannot even decide whether it will bother to field a candidate. ‘We do not need Werriwa,' said some unnamed Liberal Party official. Those opposite do not need an electorate where there may be a challenge to what they nefariously intend to do with the resources that are allocated by the Commonwealth. In Werriwa, people face a choked up M5 motorway each day. That road was part of the former national highway network-the national responsibility that this government is now walking away from. Under this bill the government no longer accepts full responsibility for maintaining those roads. Instead, the government proposes to cap its maintenance commitment to our national highway network at $300 million a year. This government is walking away from its obligations to families in Campbelltown and Liverpool while it sets up a $150 million slush fund for the National Party. Our federal system requires national leadership and a national strategy that can ensure that our infrastructure supports our economic growth rather than constraining it. Infrastructure is a linchpin of economic prosperity. That is why Labor advocates a national infrastructure advisory council that can examine and advise on the nation's infrastructure priorities, free of interference from politicians, so that the nation can enjoy the best economic and social outcomes from its infrastructure investments. That is why Labor believes we need a cooperative approach to working with the states and territories to solve infrastructure bottlenecks rather than playing them off against each other, or using roads funding to impose divisive industrial relations ideology on states and territories by refusing to fund road projects unless they follow Canberra's edicts. There are elements of this legislation that we support. We support its long overdue attempt to link road and rail planning and to develop integrated corridor strategies for our land transport infrastructure. But we regret the government walking away from its national responsibilities by disowning its full responsibility for what was once formally called the national highway network. At a time when a decade of failed infrastructure policy is now holding our nation back, we can ill afford further indulgence of this government's preoccupation with politics over good policy. We will live for years with the consequences of failing to plan for the needs of our growing industries and our growing families. In infrastructure, bad policy making cannot be reversed overnight. That is why we urge this government to put the nation's interests ahead of its own political interests to waste no more time in putting in place a transparent, objective and fair framework for meeting Australia's infrastructure needs for now and our future.",122
114,Mr FITZGIBBON,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,"I want to continue with the theme established by the Leader of the Opposition. If the AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 were a genuine attempt to improve and better integrate Australia's critical infraImportance, structure it would have the overwhelming support of the opposition, and we would not have a second reading amendment before the House. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, the OECD report and the Reserve Bank statement, both of last week, have identified bottlenecks in our productive capacity as the biggest hurdle to our ongoing sustainable economic growth, as the biggest reason for our poor export performance and growing current account deficit and as applying the greatest pressure of all on interest rates in this country at the moment. Sadly, it is not the case that this bill represents a real and genuine attempt to integrate land transport infrastructure in this country, and that is very disappointing indeed. This bill is really about two things. First, it is to enhance the government's pork-barrelling potential. Second, it is to enhance the government's ability to shift many of its financial obligations and responsibilities onto the states and, in so doing, to provide themselves with an opportunity on every occasion to shift blame to the states, as they are so known to do. The government has long been frustrated by the constraints of the current road funding arrangements which, in addition to its contribution to the local road components of grants to local councils, leave it almost entirely responsible for the national highway network. There is plenty of evidence around the place to back the allegation that this governand ment has been slowly but surely siphoning funding for projects in marginal seats away from the national highway project. It has been taking money away from its key traditional responsibility and spending it on projects under the banner, in particular, of Roads of National Importance. This is not to say that the opposition does not see merit in some of the projects which have been funded under programs such as Roads of National but we still allege that there are many projects that, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, would never get a guernsey if they were exposed to proper scrutiny and competition from more worthy projects. Let me share with the House just one example of the sort of skewed results that you get when you put politics in front of the economic and social needs of the Australian economy. I want to talk briefly about a project in my own electorate, commonly known as the Kurri Corridor, but more recently referred to as the link between the F3 freeway and the New England Highway just north of Branxton. When the Howard government won office in 1996, the F3 to Branxton project was on track and construction funding was expected by the end of that decade. Here we are halfway through the next decade and not one sod has been turned. Even worse, the AusLink proposal to broaden the Commonwealth's responsibilities for road funding at the expense of the national highway project will likely push funding for the F3 link out by another decade. Let me share with the House the importance of this road project. It is a project that have been fighting for since Easter 1988, long before coming to this place, when I was a councillor on Cessnock City Council. In Easter 1988 the then final section of the F3 freeway was opened to a little place called Freemans Waterhole. That became the dead end. From there all of that freeway traffic spilt onto the roads of the local government authority, causing both an economic and a social nightmare. So we as a community started lobbying for what is commonly called the Kurri Corridor. We were successful in getting the community's preferred route option for that project. We were very confident that the case had been made in economic terms to have construction funding allocated to that project by the end of the decade or by the year 2000. Alas, the Howard government was elected. In that first budget of 1996 in particular, it embarked on some massive funding cuts, which was of course very bad news for that project. And the bad news has been ongoing ever since, in particular as a result of the government's ongoing determination to siphon money away from the national highway project, which the Kurri Corridor would form part of, and onto other projects where it believes it can get a greater political benefit. The Kurri Corridor would be of great benefit to the Hunter in economic terms, in social terms, in road transport terms and in safety terms. It would rid many towns in my electorate-including the major towns of Cessnock and Maitland and smaller towns like Greta and Lochinvar, which are long term sufferers-of the heavy vehicle traffic and the noise it creates as a result of the government's failure not to fund this project. I note that numerous economic studies have been undertaken that confirm the fact that, in economic terms, the Kurri Corridor would be of great economic benefit to the Hunter region. It would bring our coal exports closer I to the port and it would bring the whole region closer to Sydney. The benefits would also extend way beyond my electorate, indeed into the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister and member for Gwydir, the architect of this flawed AusLink proposal; and into electorates to the west of mine, such Calare which produces much of the product other than coal that goes through the port of Newcastle. So important is the F3 link to our local communities that in recent years a local community group known as ‘Link or Sink' has sprung up. It has been very active in lobbying both the Commonwealth and the state governments in an attempt to bring funding forward for this important project. Unfortunately, despite the fact that they have had a number of discussions with Minister Anderson and his underlings, they have been given no real hope that the government is about to change its attitude on this subject. The reality is that, under this funding proposal, an important road link such as the Kurri Corridor, which goes substantially if not wholly through the electorate of Hunter, which the government considers a safe seat, is not likely to enjoy priority over some of these other projects the government has in mind, which of course run through either opposition held marginal seats or government held seats. That highlights a major flaw in this bill, and conjures for us again the prospect of the National Party being ongoing in its attempt to allocate money not on the basis of economic or social benefit but on the basis of political benefit. If the government believes there is a better funding model for road funding, one that better delivers outcomes, then the opposition would be prepared to support it. If broadening the Commonwealth's responsibilities delivers better results, we would be more than happy to support the proposition. But such a plan is not contained within the bill before the House today. Let me turn to some other bottlenecks that the Deputy Prime Minister has been making a habit of waxing lyrical about in this place in recent times: the bottlenecks involved in some of our important port facilities. AusLink is apparently about dealing, amongst other things, with local land transport links to ports. There is not much point getting the land transport links to the ports right if there economy. is undercapacity at the ports themselves. These ports, like the port of Newcastle, are so critical to Australia's economic well-being and have been subject to some consideration in the Reserve Bank and OECD reports and by a range of economic commentators around this country. The port of Newcastle is the lifeblood of the Hunter in economic terms. It is the nation's largest coal port, but one that is currently choked. It is choked to the point that is not unusual to see 50 ships sitting off the coast of Newcastle-a problem that is costing the coal companies operating in the Hunter Valley up to $100 million annually in demurrage charges. To get the capacity of the port of Newcastle to a point capable of coping with the current demand for export coal out of the Hunter region-from the current 90-odd million tonnes to 120 million tonnes-would require expenditure of some $300 million, or just three year's worth of demurrage. Where is the economic sense in all of that? I will not say that the port of Newcastle is unique, because similar problems exist off the Bowen Basin in Queensland, but it is a monopoly. The Leader of the Opposition just made the point that the Hawke-Keating reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, in particular the competition reforms of the 1990s, are what gave this economy the economic boost that has been sustained in all that time and which is now in its 14th year. It was competition reform that gave the Australian economy a boost over major economies like the US throughout the 1990s, and it is competition reform that has allowed the economy to better deal with capacity constraints and to better avoid upward pressure on interest rates. Unfortunately, there is not much competition in the port of Newcastle, and that is much to the detriment of the Hunter region's The monopoly port facility is run by Port Waratah Coal Services. Who owns Port Waratah Coal Services? Mainly, in majority terms, it is owned by the coalminers Rio Tinto and Xstrata. Despite the dramatic growth in demand for export coal in recent years, much of which was easily predicted given the growth in China in particular, no real expansion in capacity has taken place at that port. Instead, Port Waratah Coal Serit vices has successfully secured authorisation from the ACCC to put a quota system in place which restricts competition by allocating a share of port capacity to each of the producers who seek to use it. This of course is a practice which (1) disadvantages the smaller producers, who are of course on all current predictions the producers seeking to grow fastest and (2) has the effect of allowing the big companies which control PWCS to stall capacity investment. It is obvious. The quota system is an advantage to the big players for three reasons. One, the big players, subject to ACCC authorisation, effectively set the rules. Two, the big players can meet their contracts from other global projects. In a sense, they can sequence their projects and source coal to meet their contracts from other global projects. It is ury not enjoyed by the small players like Excel Mining, Centennial Coal, Donaldson Coal et cetera. Three, demurrage charges are a much greater burden on the smaller players than they are on the big players like Xstrata and Rio Tinto. While this quota system has been responsible for reducing the queue of ships sitting off Newcastle in recent months, the quota system allows the monopolist PWCS, owned by the big players Rio Tinto and Xstrata, to defer investment to take advantage of the situation at the expense of smaller producers, the economy of the Hunter region and the national economy. The quota application provided the government, through its agency the ACCC, with an opportunity to secure commitments to that investment before issuing the authorisation. Smaller coal companies do not have a problem with the quota system per se, but they see it as an opportunity, a tool, used by the big players to defer investment, and they do not appreciate the fact that the government has failed to use the authorisation as an opportunity to at the same time get a commitment on investment. As I said, the Reserve Bank has identified these bottlenecks as being crucial to the ongoing economic capacity of our economy as a whole. During question time, the Deputy Prime Minister in particular-and I think the Treasurer on one or two occasions-has been very quick to try to shift the blame for the problems in our port capacity onto the state governments. With respect to the Newcastle port, this is grossly unfair. The New South Wales government has done all in its power to improve the situation. The Deputy Prime Minister likes to remind us that ARTC has now taken control of the rail infrastructure that takes the coal to the port of Newcastle. I too think that that is a good thing and I look forward to this government, as the majority a luxshareholder in ARTC, continuing to apply sufficient pressure on that organisation to invest what is necessary to get the rail infrastructure up to an appropriate capacity. But there is no point in getting rail capacity up if the port capacity does not increase as well. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link. It is no good the Deputy Prime Minister coming in here crowing about what has been done in terms of the ownership of the rail infrastructure while refusing to concede any responsibility whatsoever for what is happening at the port of Newcastle. My message to the Deputy Prime Minister is this: ‘It's competition, stupid.' It is competition and it is only the Commonwealth government that can sort out the competition issues we are experiencing at the port of Newcastle. We should not be surprised that the government is hesitant to do so. We have seen this government's attitude towards competition policy. We have seen its failure to take on another round of competition reform. We have seen its failure to embrace with any urgency the recommendations of the Dawson review, although it did not mind embracing pretty quickly those recommendations that suited the big end of town such as the softer merger laws. It has been reluctant to pick up the Senate committee's recommendations on a range of issues, but in particular on the strengthening of section 46. I read a very interesting speech by Saul Eslake of the ANZ Bank recently-a speech he delivered to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission-in which he made the point, which I made earlier, that it is competition policy in this country that has given us our big lift in economic growth and capacity; it is competition policy that has given us a greater buffer against higher est rates when we are reaching capacity in the economy; and it is competition policy that we must continue to pursue. It is now up to the Commonwealth government to have a good, hard look at what is happening in the port of Newcastle and act for a change to assist us in our problems there and to recover the $1.4 billion in sales we are losing annually as a result of its inaction.",125
115,Mr WINDSOR,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,"I rise today to support the AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 and the cognate bill, but there are a number of concerns I would like to raise in relation to frastructure generally. Before getting into my speech, I would just like to comment on one of the things that the member for Hunter raised. I would agree with him in relation to the port of Newcastle. As a state member in the north-west and New England area, and as the federal member for New England, I have had quite a lot to do with the Newcastle Port Authority, the Newcastle Business Chamber and other groups in Newcastle that are interested in the development of the port and the relationship that the port has with the various areas around it. The member for Parkes is here, too; he would be well aware of the relationship between Dubbo and the central west area and Newcastle and also the TamworthGunnedah area in relation to Newcastle. One of the things that really needs to be addressed is the infrastructure needs of the Newcastle port and the importance it has to the northern and western parts of inland New South Wales. One of the pieces of infrastructure that is not mentioned in the AusLink documents is the Murrurundi tunnel. I am sure the member for Hunter would agreed that that is a very important piece of infrastructure that needs to be addressed at both a state and a federal level if we are going to develop the port of Newcastle and the coal industry north of the Liverpool Range in the interelectorates of Gwydir and New England. Having said that, obviously I think all of us in this chamber recognise that the AusLink white paper and subsequent legislation do an important thing. They attempt to integrate the road and rail networks nationally, and I think that is significant in itself. We will all argue that there is not enough money in there, and I would argue that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has probably exploded the funding arrangements in terms of how many Snowy Mountain schemes are actually in this particular document compared with what is historical fact, in- but there is no doubt that there is more money and there is an attempt to integrate road and rail and, in some cases, to link in with the ports. I would say that there is not enough in relation to Newcastle, of course, but I congratulate the minister on having a national approach to this particular problem. It is a problem in that we are continually building roads and rail has been ignored, and I think we are seeing the added impact of some of the road building schemes without looking at integration totally. I am a supporter of the inland rail link that has been talked about for some years, and I think that this document, particularly the agreement through the Australian Rail Track Corporation-the $872 million that was signed off between the state of New South Wales and the Commonwealth government-is an important move forward in relation to that particular agenda. But we really do need the government to put more in and react in a much more positive sense than it has in recent years to that particular project, because, if we are talking about infrastructure in inland Australia, we will have to have a rail system that can actually work right across the inland of Australia and take goods into Darwin and back to Sydney and Melbourne. There are a few comments that I would like to make. Obviously I do not think anybody in this parliament would suggest that the funding arrangements in AusLink are sufficient. I do not think any member of the government would argue that the infrastructure needs of Australia are going to be covered sufficiently in AusLink, otherwise there would not be members of the governmentand one of those members of the government, the member for Parkes, is at the table at the moment-arguing that there is a need to sell a very important piece of infrastructure, Telstra, to fund other infrastructure. I have very great concerns that an agenda is building up in parts of regional Australiaand Dubbo is one of those areas where that agenda is growing-where moves are afoot to actually push for the sale of Telstra so that road and rail can be sufficiently funded in regional Australia. That says to me straight away that, even though this legislation recognises the need to integrate and the obvious benefits downstream of integration, there is not sufficient money. I caution Mr Roger Fletcher, one of the major sheepmeat processors in Australia, about being used as a puppet in developing an argument to sell Telstra to fund other infrastructure. It is an insult to country people to say that they cannot have the infrastructure they require and that the only way they will get it is to sell some other infrastructure. I think all of us would know that in this century telecommunications is going to be the most important piece of infrastructure in regional Australia. It is the very piece of infrastructure that negates distance as being a disadvantage of living in a country area. It removes smallness as being a disadvantage in terms of size. If you get equity of access and equity of cost-and I believe you have to have government involvement to achieve that, because the private market will not provide that-only then will country people outcompete their city cousins in terms of their location. I think a nasty agenda is being developed-and I would caution the member for Parkes on his involvement in it-to promote the sale of a significant piece of infrastructure to fund another piece and to say to people that that is the only way they are going to get sufficient funds to provide the infrastructure that they require. We all know that there are other ways of achieving those outcomes. One of the other issues that I would raise is the Roads to Recovery program, and I compliment the minister and the government on it. I think there is no doubt that that has been a successful program. I was very pleased-just prior to or during the election campaign, I cannot remember quite whento see that the government moved back to a similar system, where the full $300 million was going to be treated on an equitable basis across all local government areas. The original proposal was that $200 million would be treated under a similar formula to that of the previous Roads to Recovery program-a successful program in my view-and $100 million would be opened up to the discretion of government. We have had a debate today and there is a debate going on in the Senate about these sorts of discretionary lumps of money. There is no doubt that there is a politicisation of the process or, at best, that it allows possible tampering, even though that may not be going on to the extent that some people might like to think it is. Those sorts of schemes allow people to develop their own thought processes about transparency, whereas the original Roads to Recovery program was a very fair program. It went out to all local government areas. The locals made the decisions on the ground. There was no way that the bureaucracy or the state governmentand I applaud the federal government for bypassing the states in that sense-or the minister could have an impact on the direction of that funding. I think Roads to Recovery is a successful program and should be looked at as a bit of a model for other programs in the future. I remember being involved as a state member, again, in the campaign to get more money for local roads. I will just highlight for a moment the importance of unity. I note with great interest that the Australian Local Government Association is currently embarking on a program to achieve one per cent of income tax to go back to local government-a much more transparent scheme, again, that would allow some growth as the economy grows, as the income tax receipts grow, so that more of that money could flow to local government-rather than the very archaic system we have now. I congratulate the President of the Australian Local Government Association, Councillor Bell, for his initiative. I urge all members to support that initiative, because if it is supported through whole range of organisations I have no doubt that it will be successful. I will just take people back to the genesis of the Roads to Recovery program. A meeting was held from 5 to 8 March 2000 in Moree, in the current minister's seat of Gwydir. He was the minister then, too, I think. The meeting was under the auspices of the Deputy Prime Minister; he had encouraged the meeting to occur. It was about creating solutions: a National Rural Roads Congress. It was put on under the auspices of the Australian Local Government Association. One of the things that disturbed me at the time in the advertisements for and promotion of the program-and the Deputy Prime Minister was involved in its promotion-was as follows. This congress was coming together to look at how road infrastructure was going to be funded in the next 20 to 50 years, at how this money was to be provided. That was a very worthy question. But one of the things that concerned me greatly, and I was critical at the time, was that in the documents that were circulated a statement was made: ‘It is clearly not going to be funded from current sources of funds.' That was suggesting to local government, from the federal level, that local government would receive no more money from the fuel tax receipts than they were getting, so the congress should look at other ways of achieving funding arrangements: private-public partnerships and those sorts of arrangements. The signal was sent from government at that stage: ‘Don't expect any more from fuel taxation receipts.' I think at that stage something like $800 million of Commonwealth funds was being spent on roads. Obviously that was not enough. That is a bit over 2c a litre at the bowser, and I think we are all aware that we are paying 38c and then there is GST on top a of that. It was a little bit over 2c a litre, and the government was saying at the time through the Deputy Prime Minister: ‘Don't expect any more.' The Australian Local Government Association did not accept that. To their credit, they argued that more receipts should be made available, particularly for local roads, as there was a real maintenance problem developing in terms of infrastructure. To their credit, they were able to come out with what is now the very successful program called Roads to Recovery. I raise that today because I think the Australian Local Government Association, having been successful in getting the Roads to Recovery program up, are now on the cusp of getting another successful program up if they really lobby hard and apply the political pressure that is required. I encourage them to do that to the best of their intent, because one per cent income tax receipts that are being talked about are a very worthy goal. When you start to look at the $11.8 billion included in this AusLink funding program, there are a number of things that suddenly jump out at you. The government is arguing that, because Roads to Recovery was not planned to go beyond this year, it is not in the forward estimates, and therefore it is new money if it goes on into the future. So the government is arguing that that is part of the growth in infrastructure funding. I would dispute that. I would suggest that that is clouding the issue somewhat. Another thing that is clouding the issue is in relation to the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme. Most people would remember that the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was put in place to alleviate the disparity between country and city fuel prices that would have occurred when the 10 per cent GST was imposed. The government, assisted by the National Farmers Federation and others-and the member for Parkes was involved at that time as a farmer representative-quite rightly argued at the time that country people should not be disadvantaged in any way by the imposition of the goods and services tax. The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was put in place to neutralise the impact, by way of location, of a government tax. The government has decided to remove that money. Although it is $270 million a year, it is accounted for in this document as $810 million over three years. That means that country motorists will in a sense be paying for that portion of the $11.8 billion. Country motorists will pay from one cent to 3c a litre more for fuel at the bowser because of the removal of this scheme. Even worse than that, out of the $810 million that country motorists used to receive, there is no guarantee at all that that money will go to the country projects. There is no focus in the documents that suggests that country people will be advantaged by that $810 million. In the few moments left to me, I will briefly run through some other infrastructure needs that I believe have an impact on the New England and north-west area and should be looked at in terms of future estimates of infrastructure requirements and costings. I spoke earlier of the Murrurundi rail tunnel and the Newcastle port. Bolivia Hill, south of Tenterfield on the New England Highway, has to be one of the major traffic hazards that is left on the national highway. I do congratulate the government for the work that it has been doing on the New England Highway. A lot of good work is being done there, but I do not see Bolivia Hill factored into the AusLink arrangements and I think it should be. There is also the inland rail initiative that I spoke of before. There is currently some examination within the electorate of a transport hub to be based at Glen Innes. If that is seen to be feasible, it may well require the extension of the rail line to be reopened above Armidale through to Queensland, which would be a major initiative for the electorate of New England but it would impact on other areas. I would like to spend a moment on the strategic regional projects in the AusLink papers. There has been some adjustment of the total sums of money but, effectively, it is $30 million a year for five years and is there for various councils that may come together and decide they have a worthy regional project that needs greater funding than would flow through the normal Roads to Recovery or other government grant processes. I think it is a good idea, and I encourage the government. I think the Tenterfield Council is coming to this House next week to talk to the minister about the road from Legume to Woodenbong in my electorate. It is on the northern extremity. The Woodenbong point is 128 kilometres from Brisbane, but it has an enormous impact on a number of electorates in southern Queensland, the Darling Downs, the top end of New England and, very importantly, the Lismore and Casino areas on the coast of New South Wales. It is one of those classic cases where funding of this strategic project would advantage a number of councils, two states, and a number of members of parliament from different backgrounds. I would urge the minister to look very closely at that project because it is a very worthy one. I spoke briefly a moment ago about the Australian Rail Track Corporation, the $872 million negotiation that took place between the state and the Commonwealth governments last year and the final sign-off. The AusLink documentation seems to suggest that the Commonwealth government is putting $872 million into that arrangement. In fact, it reads that way, but it is not strictly true. The federal government is only putting $150 million in; the New South Wales government, $50 million; and Pacific National, $50 million. The federal government is arranging for debt funding of $620 million. Although I recognise the importance of the agreement, I think the minister should be careful in articulating that there has been $872 million injected at a federal level. That is not the case at all. I am also aware that the ARTC is to manage the remaining lines-the non-Hunter, non-metropolitan lines-in New South Wales. I would like the minister to articulate in his reply what that will mean for some of the smaller lines that will not become part of the national network. (Time expired)",129
116,Ms LIVERMORE,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,"In this debate on the AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 and related legislation there is really no debate at all about the crucial need for investment in land transport infrastructure in this country. Australia's vast size and its dependence on bulk commodity exports means that a safe and efficient land transport network is a central part of maintaining our productivity and our standard of living. In areas like the one that I represent, the condition of our road and rail infrastructure has a direct bearing on everyday life. The road and rail links between the coal and beef producers and their processors and markets are make-or-break for these industries. That is why it is so important for this government to understand the needs and the potential of these industries in regional Australia and to support their growth through strategic investment in relevant infrastructure. Just as important is the way that the state of roads impacts on the daily lives of people in my electorate and their access to services and opportunities. Whether it is for medical treatment, education or, in the case of many coalminers, the trip back and forth from their homes on the coast to their jobs at the mines, the state of roads is an issue of equity, safety and quality of life. As I said, there is no debate at all about the importance of infrastructure in this country. Rather, the debate on this bill is about how to achieve a strategically planned and integrated land transport network that delivers the best possible returns on the government's infrastructure spending. Labor do not believe that AusLink as it is proposed in these bills achieves those aims. That is why we intend to refer the bills to a Senate committee for further investigation and why we have moved the second reading amendment, which calls on the government to maintain funding responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the national highway, to establish a national infrastructure advisory council and to extend the criteria for Roads to Recovery to include public transport, cycling, walking infrastructure and regional airport runways. Australia's infrastructure needs have come into sharp focus in recent times, but it is for all the wrong reasons. The government, of course, wants to tell us about the bright new future for infrastructure planning and investment under AusLink, but it still has an awful lot of explaining to do about exactly what it has been doing-or rather not doing-for the last nine years. What has it been doing while capacity constraints have developed at our ports, holding back vital export industries like the booming black coal industry in Central Queensland? What has it been doing while bottlenecks have grown worse on our major rail freight routes? And what has it been doing while funding for the national highway has failed to keep pace with the need for upgrading and maintenance? While we are debating these AusLink bills the Australian economy is starting to feel the results of this government's failure to invest wisely and strategically in the important transport infrastructure that our industries need to remain competitive and to make the most of opportunities that are presented by a buoyant world economy. It is not just the opposition that is making these points. Earlier this week the Reserve Bank warned about the risk of increased inflation and rising interest rates as a result of infrastructure constraints and skills shortages. Infrastructure constraints and skills shortages do not materialise overnight, so it is obvious that this government has been asleep at the wheel for the last nine years. It is a government is happy to cash in on the hard and meaningful reform work that the last Labor government put in place-a government that is happy to take all the credit-but which is too complacent and self-satisfied to face up to the challenges that needed to be addressed in order to maintain the improvements in productivity and competitiveness that Labor achieved in the Australian economy. While the government wants to sell its AusLink package as a sign of its commitment to strategic and integrated planning and funding of infrastructure, we in the Labor Party see plenty to be sceptical about based on the government's dismal performance over the past nine years, as evidenced by the pressure points in our economy that were obvious to everyone, it now seems, except the Howard government. The concerns that the Labor Party have about AusLink in its current form are reflected in our second reading amendment. For example, we are concerned that, for all its talk about integrated planning and funding partnerships with the state governments, is AusLink really just an exercise in cost-shifting and stepping back from the Commonwealth government's responsibility in the area of land transport? That certainly seems to be the case when it comes to funding for the national highway. AusLink requires the federal government to determine a national land transport network consisting of nationally significant road and rail links, but it does not identify the national highway, nor does it specify federal government responsibility for construction and maintenance of the national highway network. So where is the certainty for the people of Central Queensland-who rely on the Bruce Highway as a lifeline to Brisbane for so many business and personal needsthat funding will be there for its maintenance and upgrading as population pressures in that crease traffic on that road? Instead of the Commonwealth accepting its responsibility for that vital piece of national infrastructure, it has now capped its contribution to maintenance of the national highway at $300 million per annum for the five-year life of the current AusLink agreement. The maintenance shortfall, which can only get bigger, especially in a fast-growing state like Queensland, is left for the state government to pick up. Labor's election commitment to fully fund the national highway would provide much more certainty to the people of my electorate that the Bruce Highway would receive the attention it deserves as the major transport link along the Queensland coast. We are also concerned that this package builds in the same flaws and opportunities for porkbarrelling that we have seen demonstrated in the Regional Partnerships program. Funding for projects in key elements of the AusLink package-the AusLink strategic regional projects funding and a proportion of the Roads to Recovery funding-are left to the minister's discretion. Where have we heard that one before? Just a couple of hours ago in question time and in the censure motion debate. Prior to the last election $93 million of strategic regional projects money was already committed, and you can bet that the minister will be busy exercising his discretion in favour of his National Party mates in key seats in the lead-up to the next election. Labor take the infrastructure needs of this country much more seriously. We actually believe that when it comes to investing millions, if not billions, of dollars in infrastructure it is the national interest, rather than row self-serving political interests, that should prevail. That is why Labor have taken the proposal for a national infrastructure advisory council to the last two elections. When it comes to building a strategic and integrated transport network in Australia we want decisions to be based on the best possible independent advice, free from political interests. Our plan for an advisory council would see infrastructure investments guided by objective advice from industry, consumer and expert representatives based on transparent social, economic and environmental criteria. Given the way that the funding for the Regional Partnerships program was distributed, the people of my electorate of Capricornia are well entitled to ask whether the Howard government can be trusted to distribute the funding for AusLink equitably across all of Australia. Across the local government areas of Central Queensland there are 146 roads which have been identified as roads of regional significance by the Central Queensland Regional Road Group. The people of Central Queensland would like to be assured that these roads, which local councils have determined hold the key to future development in Central Queensland, will be given the necessary priority to ensure that they are upgraded to a standard which will support the opportunities we are creating in the mining, agriculture, defence and tourism industries. In the Livingstone shire alone, 39 roads have been identified as vital to tourist development on the Capricorn Coast, as well as the much needed improvement of the access roads to the Shoalwater Bay defence training area. I particularly wish to dwell for a moment on these access roads to Shoalwater Bay. I am sure that all in this House are aware of the importance of this facility to our defence forces and our allies who use the narShoalwater Bay training area. We on this side of the House believe that the access roads to Shoalwater Bay are not only roads of regional significance but, in fact, roads of national significance, due to the critical role that Shoalwater Bay plays in our national defence capability. This is why prior to the last election we committed an Australian Labor government to spending the $15 million necessary to ensure adequate access to the military training area. The Shoalwater Bay training area is widely recognised as one of the best military training facilities in the world. This facility is the only area in Australia where the Army, Air Force and Navy are able to engage in joint military exercises. This area is used extensively by Australian forces and those of our allies the United States and Singapore. Training exercises and joint manoeuvres are held at Shoalwater Bay regularly. The Shoalwater Bay training area is serviced by four road routes. These are the Stanage Bay Road, better known as the grey route; Raspberry Creek Road, better known as the green route; Rossmoya and Canal Creek roads, better known as the brown route; and Farnborough and Byfield roads, better known as the blue route. It is worth noting that the blue route is a Queensland Department of Main Roads road and is sealed up to Byfield. So one could argue that the Queensland government has done its bit for national security and it is now up to the Howard Government to do its bit by attending to the other three entrance roads to this vital training facility. Whilst it is true that the Department of Defence does provide some ‘make good' funding to the Livingstone Shire Council to assist with road repairs to Shoalwater Bay, undertaking the proposed upgrading works will result in long-term savings of approximately one-third of the annual maintenance cost of the existing gravel roads. This is ticularly important with the prospect now of an expansion of military exercises in Shoalwater Bay following last year's signing by the government of a joint training agreement with the United States. It is expected that by 2007 the Central Queensland region will be hosting as many as 10,000 US soldiers. It is not good enough for the Howard government to commit our country to such an undertaking without due consideration to the added demands it will place on the infrastructure in Central Queensland. Patch-up money for maintenance of these rural roads will simply not keep up with the demands placed on these roads, and it should not be the ratepayers of Livingstone shire who foot the bill. As well as the Queensland government, the whole of the Central Queensland region has invested heavily in infrastructure to support and profit from Defence Force use of the Shoalwater Bay training area. Further infrastructure and development is required to keep Shoalwater Bay training area as a preferred training venue, with the resulting benefits to our regional economy. It is estimated that Defence Force exercises at Shoalwater Bay training area inject $10 million into the regional economy every year. This figure is significantly more every second year, when joint exercises with the US defence forces are conducted. In addition, there are significant multiplier effects to the wider economy of Central Queensland, including an estimated $7 million expended through military tourism in the region every year. The people of Central Queensland ask the government to pick up the commitment made by the Australian Labor Party and fund these roads of national defence importance. We ask the government to seal the remaining gravel sections of the Rossmoya Road, Canal parCreek Road, the Raspberry Creek Road and Stanage Bay Road to the entrance of the Shoalwater Bay training area. Members of this House may recall, as do the people of Central Queensland, that it was only after the commitment I and the Australian Labor Party made prior to the 1998 federal election to upgrade the runway at Rockhampton Airport that the Howard government finally provided the money to enable the use of Rockhampton Airport by jumbo jets. That was necessary for the continued development and use of the defence training facilities at Shoalwater Bay, and so too is the sealing of the access roads to the Shoalwater Bay training area. It is not just in the area of supporting the defence industry and defence activity in Central Queensland that we need assistance from the federal government. As anyone reading the paper over the last couple of weeks would know, the coal industry is also crying out for immediate investment in infrastructure to support that industry. This is necessary for the prosperity of not only Central Queensland, which is the biggest coal mining area in Australia, but also the whole of our national economy. That brings me to another important transport project in my electorate, the so called missing link that would open up access between the whole of the northern Bowen Basin coal mining region and the Abbot Point coal-loading facility at Bowen in North Queensland. Construction of 70 kilometres of railway line would link the NewlandsAbbot Point line with the GoonyellaMoranbah line, providing an integrated transport link between the Bowen Basin coal industry and the port of Abbot Point. With an estimated construction cost of $72.2 million, it was determined by a Queensland Rail feasibility study in 1993 that sufficient benefit could be generated to justify investment in the rail link. There is no question, 12 years on from that feasibility study, that the time has come for the federal government to look very closely at this project, which would solve many of the problems facing the coal industry right now. As I said, we have seen stories in the per day after day this week on the capacity constraints that are becoming very obvious at the coal-loading facilities in Newcastle and, closer to my home in Central Queensland, at the coal-loading facilities of Hay Point and Dalrymple Bay. Coal production is booming in the Bowen Basin and there is huge demand for Australian black coal. The advantages of building this rail link between the Newlands-Abbot Point line and the Goonyella-Moranbah line are that it would open up the Bowen Basin to Abbot Point and that it would create an alternative coal export facility to those at Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point, which are constrained not only by their capacity constraints but also by weather. Abbot Point is much more reliable throughout the year and is not as affected by the weather as Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point are. There is capacity in the current design of Abbot Point to double the size of the Abbot Point coal-loading facility, and I am told by the Bowen Collinsville Enterprise organisation that that could be done at a much lower cost than an equivalent expansion at either Hay Point or Dalrymple Bay. The constraints on export capacity are really holding back activity in the coal industry at the moment. It is crazy for the government to overlook this relatively minor infrastructure project-just 70 kilometres of rail line that could greatly expand the coal exporting capacity of Central Queensland. The Bowen Collinsville Enterprise organisation has, in conjunction with the Bowen Shire Council, done an awful lot of homework on this project, as has Queensland Rail. I think it is very much the time, when we hear about the constraints on our coal exporting capacity every day, to look closely at this project under the strategic regional projects element of AusLink, to see what can be done to support this project so as to open up not just the coal industry but also possibilities for pa- other bulk commodities that could be shipped out through Abbott Point. The project would be of enormous benefit to the town of Bowen, which has done it tough in the last few years, and also to its neighbouring town of Collinsville, which is an important coal mining centre some 80 kilometres south-west of Bowen. In conclusion I want to urge the government to take seriously the approach that the Labor Party has taken to this bill. We are not blocking the bill in any sense. We have moved the second reading amendment in very good faith, putting forward ideas that we have come up with for important infrastructure development in this country, proposing a way forward to make sure that infrastructure investment is done in a way that is not partisan in any way and is coherent and strategic-ensuring that it is not done to favour one interest over another. Our proposals for a national infrastructure advisory council are all about taking the politics out infrastructure spending and I think that is very worthy and something that the government should look at very closely. Our other proviso on supporting this bill is to subject the measures to a Senate inquiry. That is also done in a very constructive spirit, because we realise at the moment that we have had too little focus on infrastructure spending in this country and that is now really creating bottlenecks that can jeopardise our economic prosperity into the future. We are supporting the bill, but I call on the government not only to look closely at the projects that I have highlighted in my electorate but also to consider carefully the recommendations that come out of the Senate inquiry, because the inquiry will be carried out in the national interest.",133
117,Ms HALL,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,"The AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 and the AusLink (National Land Transport-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004 have the capacity to impact on the future prosperity of Australia. This can be seen from the contributions made by speakers on both sides of the House. From an economic point of view no issues are more important than those covered in this legislation. This package of bills provides for an integrated network of road and rail transport linkages of national importance and includes funding provisions for programs under a new national land transport network, black spot projects, a new discretionary fund for strategic regional projects and continuing projects under the Roads to Recovery program. In making my contribution to the parliament, I will talk about a number of those. It is imperative that Australia has the best, most effective and efficient transport system available. To achieve this it must embrace all forms of transport and of infrastructure supporting our transport systems: rail, road, sea, of public transport, airport runways, cycleways and walkways. Some of those are not covered in this legislation. One of the glaring omissions from this legislation is any mention whatsoever of shipping and port infrastructure, because that infrastructure is vital for our nation. I find this most disturbing. After all, Australia is an island nation and shipping and our ports are vital to our future. I support the linkage of road and rail, but I believe it would enhance our transport system if the issues surrounding shipping-such as our ports-were also covered by this legislation. I commence my contribution to this debate by highlighting the importance of our national transport system or network. Unfortunately, I believe the government has been negligent and has ignored the best optionsthe best practice-on the grounds of opting once again for a political approach and grubby politics. I do not believe that when it comes to something as vital as this we should be indulging ourselves in grubby politics. I come to this place having looked at roads from three different levels of government. I have been fortunate enough to be a representative at local government level, state level and now federal level. At each of those levels the issues surrounding roads and road infrastructure are amongst the most important issues. Back in 2001-02, I conducted a survey of my electorate. I presented the constituents of Shortland with a list of items and asked them to rank them from the most important to the least important. Of all the items that people were presented with roads came out on top as an issue. The road infrastructure within their area was highlighted by 96 per cent of people as being of great importance. This legislation covers a number of areas, and I will spend some time going through them. The purpose of this AusLink legislation is to limit the operation of the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 and to remove the ALTD special account. This requires that a national land transport network consisting of nationally significant roads and rail links be determined. This is fundamentally different from existing arrangements as it does not identify the national highway network, which has been an underlying principle in all previous legislation. I find great concern. It does not specify federal government responsibility for the construction and maintenance of our national highway network either. I know that many speakers on this side of the House have already highlighted that fact, and we have highlighted it because we see this as the Commonwealth moving away from one of its core responsibilities. The Commonwealth has always had responsibility for our national highways. In this legislation, I see the government inching away from its responsibilities. One of the things that always concerns me, no matter what area I am looking at, is the tension between the Commonwealth, state and local government. Each level of government often tries to shift its areas of responsibility to the other. I do not think that is the best solution for the Australian people. I think the best solution is for the federal government to show leadership, and for all levels of government to work together, rather than having a situation where one level of government is seeking to abrogate its responsibilities. I fear that, by not identifying the national highway network and by moving away from its responsibilities for the construction and maintenance of the national highway, the Commonwealth is abrogating its responsibilities. The bill sets out eligibility criteria for different categories of assistance and the matters which may be considered in deciding whether a project or activities are to be approved or funded. It provides conditions for funding. Under the existing arrangements, state and federal governments identify the priorities for federal funding and provide project management. This will change under this legislation. One of the things that really concerns me is the discretionary power that the minister will have under this legislation. I know I speak for my colleagues on this side of the that of House when I say that we believe in accountability and openness. I do not think you can achieve those things where there is a high level of discretionary power. The minister decides how to allocate funds for projects under AusLink strategic regional projects. I fear that can lead to pork-barrelling and the establishment of another National Party slush fund-another fund to re-elect the Howard government. The Australian people deserve better than that. The Australian people deserve a government that makes its decisions openly and does not rely on discretionary power. Earlier today we were talking about the Regional Partnerships program. The thing that worries me about that program is that the area consultative committee can make a recommendation and then that recommendation can be overridden by the minister. I do not believe that is good government. I do not believe that is best practice in government. I find it particularly disturbing that one of the projects that has been discussed is Tumbi Creek, which is in the Wyong Shire Council area, which is also included in the Shortland electorate.",138
118,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,Order! The member will bring herself back to the bill.,140
119,Ms HALL,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. But don't be too sensitive about it, because I am actually talking about discretionary powers-how discretionary powers work currently and how they will work under this legislation. I feel that, where there are examples of discretionary powers not working properly, it behoves me, as a member of this House, to highlight that fact in the parliament. The process that was adopted in the development of this legislation was as follows. There was a green paper on 7 January 2002 and, once that green paper was tabled, it was open for comment until 7 February 2003. There were 550 written submissions, from government, industry and the community. The white paper was released in June 2004. The green paper that had a joint working group on AusLink priorities on the national network was established to assist in the development of a possible set of national infrastructure priorities for the initial five years. However, the thing that concerns me is that state and territory governments have complained that there was little or no consultation in developing the national priorities for the first five years of the AusLink national land transport plan. This is of great concern because, as I highlighted earlier, the best results are achieved by governments at all levels working together. I would like to briefly turn to the white paper. In doing so, I wish to highlight that all that. the right words are used. The executive summary says: The Australian Government is embarking on a far-reaching transformation of the way Australia plans, funds and delivers land transport infrastructure. Planning is good. The words used in this executive summary are good, but what about the details that underline this? The executive summary continues: Under AusLink, the Australian Government takes a strategic approach to Australia's future ... A strategic approach is the approach that needs to be taken. The document goes on to say that it does this ‘by ensuring that the nation's land transport network meets future challenges'. But I really do not think that this legislation does that, and that is the sad part of it. It is a missed opportunity. The government had the opportunity to do that, to ensure the development of the type of modern infrastructure that would take Australia into the next century, that would ensure sustainable economic growth, and I believe it has failed. It has failed to a large extent by slipping into the mire of partisan politics yet again, just as it did with the Regional Partnerships program. I would now like to highlight some of the issues that I see as important and some of the areas where I think the government has failed. I have highlighted the discretionary power of the minister. I do not like that. As I pointed out, that has been well established. You have seen the flaws in that today here in the House, particularly with reference to Tumbi Creek. The Commonwealth is also abrogating its responsibility-the cost sharing with the states for the maintenance of the highway. I feel that that is extremely flawed and a very bad step by the government. I think the government really needs to revisit The Labor Party, as the member for Capricornia pointed out so admirably in her contribution to the parliament, has gone to the last two elections with a proposal for a national infrastructure council. That would get around some of the problems that I have with this legislation. It would be an open and accountable way to look at developing the priorities that are in the nation's interests. would be a way to ensure that those statements that I read out from the white paperabout our need to plan and deliver the funds in the appropriate way-actually get put into practice so that we do get a land transport network that meets the future needs of Australia. We need this to happen without political interference. We do not need any more National Party slush funds, we do not need any more reelect Howard slush funds; we need good quality infrastructure. We need investment in the development of this infrastructure and we need that to be determined on a needs basis and in a way that will ensure that Australia has the best infrastructure-infrastructure that meets the needs of our nation. We need a cooperative approach that includes all levels of government, the community and business. I do not think that that can happen under this legislation. I did refer to the flaws in that process in relation to the first five-year AusLink national land transport plan and the fact that the states and territories were not happy with the consultation in relation to that and their ability to have input into that. We need quality infrastructure. We need this to work for the future of Australia. We need it for economic growth and sustainable regional communities. Unless we have the right sort of infrastructure and the right sort of transport system, that will never happen. As I have already highlighted a number of times, we do not want any more National Party slush funds. We do not want any more pork-barrelling. We do not want a new Regional Partnerships program. We do not want any more partisan decisions: the kinds of decisions that have happened with the National Trust program or with the Roads of National Importance-or with Networking the Nation, in the communication area. We want that to stop. We want decisions made on merit. We want our infrastructure to be It invested in and developed in the interests of the nation, not in the interests of partisan politics. That approach is not in Australia's interests. Parochial politics do not lead to a sustainable economic future. It is time the government moved away from that approach and developed an approach that is for all Australians and in Australia's interests. Governments have choices. This government can choose to govern for all Australians and in the best interests of our nation or it can choose to adopt a small-minded partisan political approach: I fear that this legislation has the potential to allow the government to again make the second choice. We need quality infrastructure. We need infrastructure for the future-to ensure a strong future. We do not want to end up as a second-rate nation. Australia needs a strong national transport and infrastructure system, with a national highway properly funded by a government preoccupied with the Mr Hockey-Where are you getting this from?",140
120,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,Order! The member deserves to be heard in silence.,141
121,Ms HALL,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker; I appreciate your intervention and protection from the minister. We need a government that will lead us towards a prosperous future with the infrastructure that this nation needs for economic growth and for a sound future. Australia needs a transport system that is developed in an independent manner by an independent body, a body like the national infrastructure- (Time expired)",141
122,Mr ANDREN,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,"I am constantly amazed at the piety of opposition when whiteboards and blackboards are put aside until they can be dragged out when the government benches are resumed. At least there is, I think-I hope-the germ of a constructive suggestion in the contribution of previous speaker, the member for Shortland. I hope that the comments I make might suggest some sort of way whereby we may get a process-and I think we have already got it with the Grants Commission allocating Roads to Recovery money-where money is allocated on a fair and reasonable basis depending on need, length of road, population and the actual need of the local government area in question. The AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 puts into place the mechanism for the government's new integrated approach to the planning and financing of a national land transport network. That is a very good thing. The plan outlined in the bill is the culmination, we are told, of three years of consultation and development and allocates some $11.8 billion in federal funding over five years for both road and rail and for an integrated land transport network. The government has identified a doubling in non-bulk freight, a doubling in interstate road freight and a 40 per cent increase in passenger travel to 2020. I am happy to see the additional $872 million to be invested in the Australian Rail Track Corporation for the eastern seaboard north-south rail links over the next five years. I remember evidence given to the ‘Time running out' inquiry that I was a member of a couple of years back. That was an inquiry of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services. If I remember correctly, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, you may have been a part of that. Time after time, there was evidence of the parlous state of our rail network. I seem to remember a story about our main BrisbaneSydney line where the guard had to reach out and manually trigger the signals at certain points along that link. This was in 19992000. The network has been Third World standard in many respects, and anything that the can be done to bring that link alone up to world-class standard must be welcome. We must strike a balance between rail and road in this country and allow rail to catch up. It is way, way behind. I believe that this national land transport bill goes a long way towards improving that critical state of our rail network. I want to concentrate my remarks on the aspects of the plan supporting local and regional infrastructure. In January last year, the minister announced the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program, which was due to expire at the end of financial year 2005. The 2004-05 budget provided for the allocation of another $1.2 billion to the program over four years. That consisted of $200 million per year to be allocated under the Roads to Recovery formula to fund local roads and $100 million allocated on a competitive basis for projects of economic and social significance. The AusLink white paper released in June last year split this funding into two streams, providing $400 million for Strategic Regional Projects and $800 million for the AusLink Roads to Recovery program. During the election campaign, the coalition announced that it would top up funding available to councils under the Roads to Recovery formula to its original $1.2 billion over four years. Councils quite rightly saw the white paper's two-stream formula as cutting their guaranteed allocations by a third. This has been corrected. In the same policy document, ‘Building our national transport future', the coalition undertook to provide Strategic Regional Projects funding of $120 million over the same period. I am not quite sure whether this money replaces the $400 million allocated to the strategic regional projects in the white paper or whether it is in addition to it. I hope that the minister or his advisers might be able to clarify this situation. Roads to Recovery has been an extremely important program for councils in my electorate, providing councils with much-needed extra road funding since its introduction four years ago. What is more, unlike other programs which have had a good airing in recent days, it has been allocated by an independent process, through the Grants Commission, according to a clear formula. It has enabled the replacement of old and dangerous bridges, the upgrading of intersections and the widening of narrow country roads. The number of signs around my electorate, and no doubt others, is testament to the worth of the projects to which that money has been put. But there are figures that show that we are only beginning to catch up with the slow decline in infrastructure spending in this country over the last 20 years, particularly roads since 1990. The figures in the Bills Digest quite clearly display the fact that in real terms-and I know the GST has become available to the states in that periodCommonwealth funding has slipped from $1,597.3 million in 1993-94 dollars in the 1990-91 year to $1,358.2 million in 2002-03. It can be rightly said that, while very come and necessary, the Roads to Recovery program has but helped catch up, to a degree, with the clear falling away in funding over that decade and longer. It is welcome, and this national AusLink program will go further towards redressing that fall off in national infrastructure spending over the last two decades. The AusLink strategic regional project is designed to support local transport projects of regional, economic and social significance, as described in the white paper. In brief, the idea is to target local transport links that are significant to major transport corridors that are part of the national network that form an important part of the economic development strategies within a region, provide access to export related transport networks and enhance access for regional communities to services and employment. I would hope this includes a serious examination of transport links from western New South Wales to the ports of Newcastle and Wollongong so that we do not put all our planning energy into the Sydney corridor, of which I will say a little bit more in a moment. There is a lot of evidence coming from and supported by gentlemen such as Professor John Chudleigh, who has had a lot of input into the government's regional strategies over the years. He and others are very concerned that we are thinking in terms of east-west development, particularly in New South Wales, and we are not looking enough at our north-south links, particularly in the tableland area just west of the Great Divide. There are links, such as that through Canin berra, Goulburn, Bathurst and north to Mudgee, that have been improved significantly in recent years with Roads to Recovery and black spot funding. It is a bit like the Telstra network-it is a super highway in parts, a reasonable highway in parts and virtually a dirt track in others. It needs to be linked up into one major link so that we can weldeflect a lot of transport pressure from the Blue Mountains corridor to the ports of Newcastle and Wollongong. I note an earlier contribution-I think it was from the member for Hunter-which said that we must also be looking at integrating our transport and infrastructure strategies to include our port infrastructure. That brings me to the national infrastructure report that was done by a parliamentary committee and delivered in February 2000. There were a couple of key recommendations. I believe the most important one in fact was recommendation 6: ... that the Commonwealth Government establish a National Infrastructure Advisory Council with expertise from the public and the private sectors, to facilitate the efficient and equitable provision of national infrastructure by both public and vate sector stakeholders. Many recommendations in that report referred to the need for the national infrastructure council to be set up as an advisory council to report, through the Council of Australian Governments, to ministers responsible for regional development on strategic infrastructure-where it is taking place and what the needs are-and looking forward 10, 20 and 30 years rather than succumbing to the temptation to look only at the electoral cycle. The AusLink program is the beginning of that sort of structure, but it lacks the vision that this report recommended following the input of Fred Argy and others, along with councils all over Australia, infrastructure experts and tax experts looking at the potential for superannuation funds to become involved in national infrastructure and so on. There is an element of that structure in the rail portion of this AusLink program, and I know the minister said that he did not want to have another advisory group involved in the process. But I and the committee, made up of members of this House from right across the political spectrum, saw enough evidence to suggest strongly that it should be a prime consideration in any transport policy in this country. As others have said, there is far too much discretionary spending in this particular bill. There are real concerns in my mind about some of the approval of projects processes built into the bill. I notice under division 1, approval of projects, it is commented by those researching this bill that the minister's determination is not required to be tabled in each house of parliament and is not subject to disallowance. That may or may not attract the interest of the minister, but I would like him, if he would, to explain exactly why that process is in place. There is a comment at the end of the Bills Digest that details of projects approved under the national plan are not repriquired to be tabled or published, with the exception of the Roads to Recovery program. Given that there is a large discretionary fund for competitive tendering, it does suggest that there could be a temptation-not necessarily with this minister or government but in years ahead-for any minister in a tight election process to use a discretion that is not in the best interests of regional or national infrastructure priorities and wise spending of scarce public moneys. I would like to comment on a couple of the contributions that councils in my area made to the AusLink green paper. The Central West Regional Organisation of Councils, CENTROC, said amongst other things in its submission: It has long been recognised that transport will play an increasing part in the area's development. CENTROC stretches from Condobolin to Wellington, Forbes, Cowra and all the councils in between to the Blue Mountains. The submission continued: Intermodal points are now established at Blayney and Parkes and others are planned. Road conditions, as mentioned elsewhere in this submission, impeded the realisation of the area's potential. All of the local government areas in CENTROC have an umbilical cord to Sydney via the Great Western Highway and this road is the dominant form of transport and clearly needs the most focus. While the Dubbo-Sydney link is on the AusLink program, there seems to me to be a strong need to look at those links to the ports of Newcastle and Wollongong and to also see a greater commitment to the Mid Western Highway and those other links between Bathurst, Cowra, Parkes and the Blue Mountains. In recent days a draft of the Blue Mountains highway proposal has been released. This is being conducted by consultants for a tri-government Blue Mountains access group, which is headed by the Hon. Ian Armstrong and includes members of all political parties, state and federal; Independents; and party representatives west of the Blue Mountains. It has detailed a four-lane divided highway which would commence south of Windsor and approximate the Bells Line of Road up to the Newnes Plateau then follow the plateau north of Lithgow and intersect with the Great Western Highway at the Mudgee turn-off. Members may remember some suggestions that were pilloried by the state Labor government where tunnels under the mountains were suggested. There have been any number of suggestions of how this can be done and how the sand derived from those tunnels from the sandstone curtain could be used for Sydney's building boom in the years ahead. I think the money involved in such a project would absolutely preclude its completion on a cost-benefit ratio at this point. However, we now have-it will not be released in detail for another six weeks or soan engineering and economic report that suggests that an above topography route, which is 94 kilometres in length, is feasible. It will run into some quite significant opposition through the fact that six kilometres will touch on the declared wilderness area of the Blue Mountains National Park. That is going to be a major hurdle, no doubt. I put it to the House that unless there ‘decoagulation', if you like-it is the only word I can think of-of that link across the Blue Mountains, we are going to get gridlock within 10, 15 or 20 years. The central west of New South Wales, and all of those arteries leading into that route across the mountains, carry goods that contribute enormously to the production and the wealth of this country. We must find a route across those mountains that is better than the existing Great Western Highway. The government assisted by declaring the Great Western Highway a road of national importance in the late nineties and I think they contributed something in the order of $100 million to help develop that improved access. But the more that route is being improved, the more it is resembling a glorified Pennant Hills road. I have travelled it several times recently. While there is an enormous amount of work being done, it strikes me that with its variation of speed limits-50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 kilometres per hour-it is never going to represent the sort of national highway link that will be required in the years ahead. That begs the question: why don't we look more at the Bells Line of Road option to see if we cannot reach some sort of compromise? The suggested route, as I understand it, goes behind the heritage villages of the Bilpin area. I think it is very much worth investigating. If it gets approval-and there is enormous support for it-then it should become part of the AusLink program and attract significant federal support, as should the upgrading of the rail linkages not only into Sydney but into those ports of Newcastle and Wollongong, as I have suggested.",141
123,Mr LLOYD,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION,"Robertson-Minister for of it Local Government, Territories and Roads) (6.35 p.m.)-I take this opportunity to thank all honourable members for their contribution to this debate. Today is a very signifiis a cant day in this parliament, where we will see the passing of the AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004 and the AusLink (National Land Transport-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004 through this House. These bills represent major reform legislation. They herald the most important change to national land transport policy in the past 30 years. The AusLink program has a generational commitment to transport infrastructure improvement. It will help deliver on the government's vision for a land transport system that can both meet the challenges of the transport task and make its contribution to a stronger economy. Since coming to office, the Australian government has already taken major steps towards positioning Australia to sustain long-term economic growth. It has significantly reduced public debt by some $70 billion and fundamentally restructured the tax system. High performing land transport infrastructure is a further prerequisite ongoing improvements in our national productivity and competitiveness as our population ages over the next 20 to 30 years. The AusLink initiative introduces a new, modern and innovative approach to land transport infrastructure planning, decision making and funding. It backs these reforms with a massive increase in funding which our sound economic stewardship has enabled us to provide. The overwhelming bulk of the AusLink investment-over $8 billion over the next five years-will be directed to the new land transport network. The new AusLink national network brings together for the very first time previously separated planned and funded road and rail networks into a single, integrated network which will be an essential foundation for a fully effective national transport system. The government is providing the platform for the revitalisation of the national rail work. Without an effective interstate rail freight system, Australia's transport system cannot work. For the first time, the Australian government's transport infrastructure funding will be guided and underpinned by an announced five-year national plan. The five-year plan focuses on the highest priority projects that provide economic and social benefits from a national perspective. Importantly, we are also providing a five-year funding commitment which gives certainty to state and local governments, and to transport and construction industries. This is unprecedented and provides for certainty of investment. AusLink provides the framework for a planned national system whereby all levels of government will be working to deliver the best transport investment. The Australian government has set out a clear strategic direction which governs the priorities it has established for the next five years. In brief, to these priorities are: establishing long-term and integrated planning; improving the eastern seaboard's north-south corridors; improving interstate and interregional corridors; addressing urban congestion on key freight links; utilising technology where it can enhance and improve efficiency, safety and security on the national network; improving safety and security overall; protecting the Australian government's past investment in major links; and supporting regional and local economic growth. At the project level, the program provides for substantial investment in Australia's most important land transport links, including the F3 and Pacific Highway, the Hume Highway, the Sydney to Brisbane and Sydney to Melbourne interstate railways, and the Bruce and Calder highways. The program enables many critical projects to be undertaken-the Geelong bypass, netthe Peel deviation in Western Australia, the Port River expressway in South Australia and the Bridgewater Bridge in Tasmania are just a few examples. It is absurd to suggest that investment in such projects will not yield major economic benefits at both the national and local level. This will be the first time that a national government will be putting in place arrangements that look beyond the current five-year program through a development of long-term corridor strategies developed against a 20-year time horizon. Corridor strategies will provide the basis for identifying shared government priorities and provide non-government stakeholders with the opportunity to contribute to the longer term planning and funding of national land transport infrastructure in Australia. Corridor strategies will be supported by a range of rigorous studies to determine corridor needs, deficiencies and future priorities. They will focus on identifying the best solution to the transport needs of each corridor, irrespective of the transport mode. Industry and stakeholder consultation will be a critical source of information. Work on developing corridor strategies in conjunction with the state and territory governments will commence in earnest this year. Initially we will focus on a small number of pilot studies and expand into larger groups as we gain experience. There will be a nationally consistent project assessment methodology to inform the development of corridor strategies and the assessment of future project priorities. This methodology has been developed in conjunction with the states, territories and local government and has now also been agreed to by Australian Transport Council ministers. This is a key reform. The government has set up the framework for evidence based national investment. AusLink is about ensuring the nation invests in its best projects. The opposition has made a number of proposals in its second reading amendment. The first relates to the discontinuation of the national highway system. The opposition amendment is critical of the discontinuation of the 30-year-old national highway system funding arrangement. The bill provides for the government to move beyond the single mode-focused national highway system to a broader and integrated network of nationally important road and rail links. A number of opposition members made comments during the debate which were also supportive of moving on from the old national highway system to a concept of a single, integrated network. Under the announced AusLink program, all states and the Northern Territory will receive large increases in funding for construction projects on the national network. It is therefore quite ridiculous to suggest that the Australian government is somehow avoiding its funding responsibilities. The AusLink shared funding arrangements recognise that many projects on the national network as well as having substantial national benefits will also have benefits that are more local in nature. In these cases, funding contributions at both the national and state level are appropriate. The AusLink shared funding arrangements also recognise that the national network now includes links that previously had been totally or partly the responsibility of the states to fund-links that the Australian government previously had no responsibility for. At the same time, the Australian government is continuing to fully fund many projects on the former national highway system, particular those in rural and remote areas. The opposition's position is now an outdated approach to transport funding and, accordingly, the government does not support it. The second part of the opposition amendment proposes the establishment of an independent national infrastructure advisory council. Whilst the government's AusLink white paper lays considerable stress on the importance of long-term planning for national land transport infrastructure, it cannot support the opposition's approach. Labor's proposal, which is lacking in any firm detail, is to set up another bureaucratic talkfest that will not provide effective advice on national priorities. Our view is that such advice is unnecessary at this stage, given that the national land transport network is premised on infrastructure investment priorities identified by the state governments. An example is the Pacific and Hume highways. Indeed, our priorities were reached following quite detailed consultation and advice from departments at the state government level. These governments will continue to work closely with us to establish corridor needs and prioriceived, ties on the national network. The AusLink white paper does moot in the future the establishment of a National Transport Advisory Council. The Australian Transport Council, comprising Australian, state and territory government representation, has already agreed to further consider the establishment of the National Transport Advisory Council in the future. If the council decides to establish such a body, it will provide strategic analysis and advice on long term planning for the national transport system involving all stakeholders, including the private sector. The Leader of the Opposition is completely wrong in his claims that AusLink is promoting tension between the Australian government and the states and territories. AusLink is intended to promote a cooperative approach between all levels of government in Australia for long-term transport infrastructure planning and implementation. The process that is already underway to establish agreed priorities on the national network is clear evidence of that. As a government, we will not abrogate our responsibilities to take decisions in the nation's best terests. We are setting priorities and making the investment. We work cooperatively with the states, territories and local governments, but we will not agree to Labor's amendment. The third part of that second reading amendment is the broadening of the Roads to Recovery funding purpose. The AusLink bill also demonstrates the Australian government's continuing commitment to local communities through extending the very successful Roads to Recovery program beyond its initial time frame of 2005, a program that I recall the Leader of the Opposition called a ‘boondoggle' when it was first introduced, but it has been one of the government's greatest programs and well reparticularly with local councils throughout Australia. I was also pleased to hear that many opposition members are convinced of the worth of this program, which has been, as I said earlier, of enormous benefit to local councils throughout Australia. Local councils know that it is a good thing, and opposition members also know that it is a good thing. In 2004-05 some $253 million is being provided for local roads in the final year of the current four-year Roads to Recovery program. By the end of this current program, some 12,000 local road projects will have been funded. In the four years from 2005-06, and 2008-09, a further $1.2 billion will be provided to local councillors on the basis of a similar funding formula arrangement that has applied under the current Roads to Recovery program. That sends a very strong signal that this government is determined to continue to help achieve a vibrant economy and social outcomes for local communities. Councils will continue to have wide discretion in determining the projects to which their formula based applications are applied. The key condition is insimply that it be spent on the construction and maintenance of roads. The government's firm view is that the planning and funding of public transport services is a state and, in some cases, local responsibility. That said, it is open to local councils to apply funding to road construction projects which might assist, for example, the efficient and safe operation of road based public transport. Honourable members might also like to note that the definition of a road in this bill already includes a path for the use of persons riding bicycles. We do not propose to extend the criteria beyond those for which we have currently provided. Early passage of this legislation will able local governments across Australia to be given certainty about the future of funding and the conditions applying to this important stream of funding to improve and maintain local roads. I urge the opposition to enable this legislation to pass not only through House but through the Senate as quickly as possible so that this important program can again be funded for local councils. In addition to the $1.453 billion, which will be distributed to councils on a formula basis, $150 million will be provided over the five years from 2004-05 to 2008-09 for local road projects of strategic regional importance. This will include funding for local roads in unincorporated areas. I emphasise that this is additional money. This is new money which is important to local councils. This funding for local roads under the Roads to Recovery money is in addition to the $2.55 billion over the next five years that will be provided to local councils as untied local road grants. The government is concerned to see not only effective planning in investment decision making but also efficient project delivery arrangements. The application of the national construction code and implementation guidelines is a key part of the government's drive to improve the efficiency of the construction industry and eliminate uncompetitive practices. It is therefore an important element of the AusLink five-year funding agreements currently being negotiated with the states. I am delighted that the Victorian government has agreed to apply unchanged the national construction code to AusLink projects in Victoria. Consistent with the government's long standing undertaking to consult with the states and territories on any proposed changes to the code, the government will consult with the Victorian government on en- possible future changes to the code and implementation guidelines. A formal agreement is yet to be finalised where, for the purposes of the code, AusLink funding to Victoria would be considered as one project. Agreement to the code paves the way to settle the this bilateral AusLink five-year funding agreement with Victoria. This development follows agreements being reached between the Australian and South Australian governments on joint implementation guidelines that will apply to major AusLink projects in South Australia. I strongly encourage the remaining states and territories to now follow South Australia and Victoria's lead. In conclusion, I reinforce that the arrangements to be established by these bills will drive the development of our key road and rail links and ensure that they are forged into one single high performing and safe national network. They will move beyond the entrenched arrangements for separate road and rail funding which hampered rail development, recognise the critical importance of our links to our ports and airports in supporting a globally competitive transport system, and drive the upgrading of local road networks and the development of key regional links. The Howard government is investing in Australia's future. These bills will provide for the planning and evidence based investment decision-making framework which Australia needs. The government will also provide unprecedented levels of funding for our national road and rail infrastructure. I commend both of these bills to the House.",145

127,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"I am very pleased tonight to join the debate on the Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill 2004 and related bills and to respond on behalf of the opposition. I do so in my representative capacity, representing in this chamber the shadow minister for communications, Senator Conroy, who of course is in the other place. Labor supports this legislation as a necessary first step in addressing the increasing regulatory problems posed by the emergence of convergent technologies. It is a step towards addressing this issue-a much delayed one at that, but in the final analysis it is a step in the right direction. Convergence is the process whereby digitisation and other technological innovations blur the boundaries between the delivery mechanisms available for services. As a result of convergence, consumers now have a multitude of ways in which to access telecommunications and media services. Today a person wanting to speak to a colleague or friend can choose whether to dial from a fixed line telephone, pick up a mobile phone or have the conversation over the internet through voiceover IP. A person wanting to read the morning news could pick up a newspaper, turn on a personal computer to log onto the net or get up to date by using their mobile phone. The number and variety of such permutations on the delivery of traditional services will only continue to grow with the high pace of technological change inherent in these industries. As the march of technological progress continues and the commercial markets for convergent technologies evolve, regulatory distinctions based on the methods by which services are provided will become increasingly antiquated and inefficient. As such, the current regulatory approach in which legislation distinguishes between services based on the methods by which they are deliveredand through which regulators operate along these increasingly irrelevant divides-is in need of reform. To delay, or to only go halfway in these reforms, will inevitably result the inefficient distortion of the development of markets for services provided using convergent technologies. Regulatory barriers may deter businesses from making some commercially viable services available to consumers. Disparities in the regulatory treatment of services may also result in businesses investing in technologies merely because they enjoy a regulatory advantage in the marketplace instead of being superior products or services. These are not good outcomes for the Australian telecommunications and media industries, and they are not good outcomes for the Australian economy or the Australian people. These risks are further exacerbated by the importance of telecommunications and media markets in the modern Australian economy and the rapid pace of change exhibited in these industries. Unfortunately, the pace of reform pursued by the government in this area has been light years behind the pace of technological innovation. This legislation is the government's first legislative attempt to deal with these challenges. Not one, but two discussion papers on these issues have preceded its introduction: the first, Options for structural reform in spectrum management, in 2002 and the second, New institutional arrangements for the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Broadcasting Authority, in 2003. It is legitimate to ask why there has been such a delay in implementing a sorely needed and relatively straightforward reform. Governments of other countries, governments which are interested in and committed to allowing their countries' media and telecommunications industries to develop free from inappropriate government interference, addressed these challenges half a decade ago. For example, the Singapore government, active in its desire to promote the emergence of strong, local, telecommunications and in media industries, undertook a merger of its equivalent regulators in 1999. The United Kingdom commenced a similar process in 1999 and ultimately merged its equivalent regulators in 2002. It is disappointing that it has taken half a decade for the Howard government to even follow the lead set by others. As a result of the absence of leadership from the government on this issue, the existing regulators-the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Broadcasting Authority-have responded to the emergence of convergent technologies in a necessarily ad hoc and reactionary way. This has led to inefficient overlaps in regulation and regulatory responsibility in some areas and gaps in the regulation of others. In its submission to the Senate committee considering this legislation, the Australian Consumers Association stated that the current regime had produced ‘some weird interim regulatory responses'. The Competitive Carriers Coalition stated: The ACA has increasingly been seen as a lower rather than a leader in terms of regulatory guidance and oversight. This has caused cant duplication and regulatory burden on the industry as a whole. The Competitive Carriers Coalition went on to describe the regulators' responses to the emergence of a recent convergent technology, voiceover IP telephony services, as being ‘poorly coordinated' and requiring industry participants to respond to separate inquiries from the ACA, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Communications Industry Forum. There has also been significant regulatory duplication in the regulation of mobile content, and unjustified inconsistencies between regulatory approaches to content provided over different mediums-for example, in the age verification requirements for adult content on mobile services compared with those of internet services. However, after years of this ad hoc approach to convergence, the growing popularity of convergent technologies such as 3G mobile phones and voiceover IP have finally forced the government's hand. Now that these technologies are becoming commonplace, the government could no longer sit on its hands. And so we now have the Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill. The bill is the government's first attempt to deal with these issues. The bill provides for an administrative merger of two existing regulators-the Australian Broadcasting Authority, ABA, and the Australian Communications Authority, ACA-to establish a unified communications regulator: the Australian Communications and Media Authority, or ACMA. As an issue of significant importance to the communications sector, Labor has referred this bill to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Techfol- nology and the Arts Legislation Committee for inquiry so that the adequacy of the legissignifi- lation can be assessed in detail. Having said that, I should add that the primary inadequacy of the bill stems from the government's decision that this merger should be of a purely administrative nature. In accordance with this decision, the bill makes only nominal changes to the existing regulatory frameworks for telecommunications and media. The problem with this is that, while merging regulators will result in a unified approach to the administration of existing legislation, in many cases it is the substance of the underlying legislation itself that is causing inefficiency and regulatory uncertainty. In order to effectively deal with convergence, we should be moving towards a situation in which, all things being equal, regulation is technology neutral. This will require legislative, not simply administrative, reform. While the majority of submissions in response to each of the discussion papers that have been issued by the government have called for a comprehensive review of the underlying regulatory regime in this way, the government has taken the easy option and dodged the hard work necessary to implement the reforms. In addition to the fundamentally inadequate philosophy of the bill, Labor also have a number of concerns about how the merger of the Australian Communications and Media Authority will occur. Firstly, we are concerned that allowing the authority to organise itself into divisions and to retain the current bureau offices of the ACA and the ABA will mean that the new authority will be a merged regulator in name only and will in fact continue to operate as two distinct regulators divided in accordance with the delineations of the legacy regulators. We will be exploring whether the organisational and geographic division of the new authority permitted under the bill will undermine the objectives of the merger, and we will pursue this through the Senate inquiry. Another of Labor's concerns is that the explanatory memorandum and comments from the former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, indicate that the merger will be revenue neutral. This represents a significant organisational failure on the part of the government. We find it difficult to understand how the government could not manage any cost savings from a merger that would presumably integrate finance, human resources, and IT support functions of the ABA and the ACA. Telecommunications carriers who have made submissions to the Senate inquiry have rightly pointed out that this is disappointing result for carriers, as under current regulatory regime carriers bear the cost of the new authority's telecommunications functions through carrier licence fees. In light of the government's obligation to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent in the most efficient manner, the failure to achieve cost savings from this merger is a poor outcome. Finally, I note that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has stated on a number of occasions that the government intends to engage in a review of the effectiveness of the telecommunications regulatory regime in conjunction with the performance of a scoping study for the full sale of Telstra. While it may the government's interests in maximising the share price of Telstra prior to sale to hold a private inquiry into the efficiency of the regulatory regime, a far better outcome could be achieved if this review were held in public and enabled interested parties to make submissions on the record on this matter. The government has missed a perfect opportunity to hold such a review as part of the consultation process for this bill. The government is creating a new regulator for the communications sector six months before it intends to fully privatise Telstra. Why doesn't the government investigate whether the powers it is providing to the new regulator are appropriate to enable it to achieve its aims in the context of a fully privatised Telstra? Does the introduction of this bill at this stage mean that the government is satisfied that the new authority's powers are sufficient to regulate a fully privatised Telstra, or will we have to go through yet another review in order to ensure that the new authority is able to effectively deal in a regulatory sense with a fully privatised Telstra? The failure of the government to address these issues as part of the introduction of this a bill again demonstrates the short-sightedness the of the government in this area. Having said that, I also say that Labor supports the package of legislation. The package of legislation represents a modest improvement on the status quo, and I commend the package of legislative measures to the House. (Quorum formed)",150
128,Mr TUCKEY,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,I apologise to the House. I just thought that a matter of such grave importance and of major alteration to the means by which electronic media in Australia is regulatedMr Tanner interjecting,153
129,Mr TUCKEY,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"Yes. We thought that you might have wanted to come down. I thought suit that the spokesman for the Labor Party, the member for Perth, would have had more to say but he spoke for only 10 minutes. This is major legislation-legislation that I recollect was called for by the opposition who were highly critical of some aspects of the Austrathe lian Broadcasting Authority, the major regulator. This legislation amalgamates the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Australian Communications Authority. They will become the Australian Communication and Media Authority, the ACMA, by 1 July 2005. During the election campaign the government committed to ensuring that the merger of the ABA and the ACA to form the ACMA is completed efficiently and does not disrupt the ongoing performance of the key regulatory functions of the existing regulators. The Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill 2004 provides for the establishment of the ACMA on proclamation on 1 July 2005 or, if no proclamation has been made, by that day. Let us look at the history of this particular legislation and the need there for. The ACMA will be responsible for regulating telecommunications, broadcasting, radio communications and online content. A combined regulator will be better placed to make coordinated responses on conversion issues. In the converging telecommunications and broadcasting environment the maintenance of two separate regulators, both dealing with similar or overlapping issues but focusing on different sectors of the communications industry, is neither practical nor effective. New digital technologies allow previous distinct sectors to compete across increasingly convergent markets using a range of different delivery platforms. An issue such regulating content which can be delivered on 3G mobile phones is a prime example of convergence. As the government has previously stated, it will be an administrative merger and will not be accompanied by changes to the existing regulatory spectrum and planning frameworks for telecommunications and broadcasting. The government is committed to ensuring that the merger is completed efficiently and does not disrupt ongoing performance of the key regulatory functions of the existing regulators. The existing authorities have in place administrative arrangements to plan for the merger and are well advanced in planning for change. There will be no cost to industry as a result of the merger since there will be no change to the regulatory framework or regulatory functions. There will be no significant saving to government as a result of the merger because all of the regulatory and reporting functions of the ACMA will be the same as those which currently exist in the ACA and the ABA. Staff numbers will remain fairly constant since the new regulatory services to the public and to the industry will remain the same. The issue that arises here is that nothing stands still and, of course, in the electronic media today we have this speed of change which is quite outstanding. On the government's initiative, we are more closely approaching the day when analog distribution of television, for instance, will cease and it will all be digital. I think people are gradually coming to terms with that. If I read the newspapers correctly, there have been quite massive sales of plasma and other state-of the-art digital television equipment during recent times. This was a major contributor to the buoyancy of the retail sector over the Christmas period. The government looks to and welcomes the fact that Labor will support this policy but I think there are some as fundamental differences with our policy. The government has indicated on numerous occasions, including during the election campaign, that there will be no immediate savings from this initiative. This is because all regulatory functions will be much the same. Labor has said on several occasions that this merger would result in savings of $70 million, presumably in an effort to fill its budgetary black hole. We say that there will be savings because the job remains the same. Of course we are well aware that, when you have things like Medicare Gold, there are many other responsibilities that the government has to the community in this regard that were brushed aside to find money. I am supportive of a role for government as a regulator. I think that is a significant responsibility of government, be it in competition or in what our media present to us. I think people expect that of us. I am less clined to government being a physical provider of many services. I have never been able to work out, in the instance of having a private sector as a service provider in education and health, why government also need to be a physical provider of those services. I think we kid ourselves that we do it better and that, in fact, we would do much better to make sure that the money was available to guarantee equity of access and things of that nature, which can be done without setting ourselves up as a major manager in these areas of service. When it comes to the media, to competition policy and to standards and the quality of things that people eat and I see a role for government. I think government is there to ensure fairness and quality, and all the other things that people expect and have to have confidence in government to deliver. So this new body will quite sensibly cover both of those arrangements, and I think that is important. I also think that we have some great lenges as a parliament in looking at how the communications system will operate. I for one have been quite saddened by the loss of the individualisation of electronic media that existed when I first became the member for O'Connor. We had a television station in Geraldton, one in Albany and other services dotted around. Then of course we had progress and it all became GWN, a satellite distributor that covers all of rural Western Ausno tralia, and in a later period we got WIN television. They provide good services but they are barely localised. I have always wondered why in my electorate, the Kalgoorlie electorate in particular, and I guess the Forrest electorate-the big rural electorates surrounding Perth-when a third licence was considered we could not have had the opportunity of going back to a series of smaller services that were distinctly local. That is, local services which did not give us Neighbours and all in- that soap opera stuff. What is the latest‘Dissatisfied Wives'? I thought they might cover the local football match or the local cricket match. Mr Tanner-Desperate Housewives; a good show.",153
130,Mr TUCKEY,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"I am not into them, personally. When I want trouble I can create it for myself. Coming back to the issue, I always thought there could be a TV station in small towns that covered the local weddings. I think people might be interested in that, if that were a choice. They would still of course have the opportunity to watch ‘Dissatisfied Wives' or The X Factor or, if you buy, really want to get down to the lowest of things, Big Brother or something like that. These are the things that government looks at from time to time as a regulator. We certainly have changed our attitudes over the years, and today we approve things on television that one would not have dreamed of years ago. I am open-minded about that, but chalthere is always going to be a time when we expect of the media that they deliver a product to a standard that is acceptable to the Australian people. Therefore, I am totally supportive of this particular proposal. There is huge growth in radio and new entrants are coming on in the immediate future, and there will be a great battle for advertising revenue. We are yet to see how the cabinet will eventually approach the idea of more deregulation throughout the entire media, between print and electronic media. That is an interesting challenge and, again, I think it is appropriate. I am not sure that it is going to change much. We worry a bit about media domination, but I have yet to see any huge influence by media proprietors on their journalists. They seem to be able to run things much as they wish. I think that that professor missed out, as quoted by the minister for education this morning, in complaining about school teachers not doing enough. I thought maybe they should educate a few journalists to have a broader view of how politics operate in Australia. But I do not think that pressure comes from media owners. Of course in this day and age a lot of the ownership is with the fund managers and, as a consequence, the role of government is to see that reasonable standards are maintained in terms of the quality of the product, not the opinions of the journalists who work there. Having made those points and having taken the opportunity to describe to the parliament again what the purpose of this legislation is, I will conclude my remarks.",155
131,Mr TANNER,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"Melbourne) (7.20 p.m.)The opposition support the merger of the ACA and the ABA into a single body and did so prior to the election, so we broadly support the legislation before the House. It reflects a pattern that is occurring in other parts of the world-for example, the creation of Ofcom in the United Kingdom as a single regulator spanning an even broader remit, including telecommunications and various other things that are not necessarily going to be within the ACMA remit. It certainly spans the bulk of what is going to be within the ACMA remit as part of the legislation that is before the House. There is an underlying issue I wish to address that I think has caused some concern in sections of the broadcasting industry and which will ultimately have to be addressed. It has been put to one side as a result of this legislation being put to the House, but nonetheless it is something that we have to think about for the future-that is, the open contestability of spectrum. At the moment we operate spectrum in this country on the basis that particular sections of spectrum are set aside for certain purposes, in this case for radio and television broadcasting. So, in effect, that spectrum is quarantined from broader market forces, and the prospect of other players-such as people in telecommunications, mobile telephony and wireless internet-being able to potentially outbid broadcasters for that spectrum does not arise. The resistance to the merger of the ABA and the ACA that has been in the industry for some considerable time was ultimately sourced in this concern-that, by merging the regulators, you would end up with an effective merger of the way that spectrum is dealt with and ultimately an open market for spectrum use. Broadly, I have some sympathy with that view, but I think it will be some time before our society is ready for thatindeed, some time before the various sectors are ready for that. I believe that we should continue to support the notion of a separate role for broadcasting in our society-and, in particular, for radio and television broadcasting as we have known them-and I believe that spectrum should continue to be set aside for those purposes. It is extremely important that all Australians be able to continue to have access to services that are delivered to them for free, effectively-although they pay indirectly through advertising-through radio and television. It is very important that we continue to guarantee that those services will be able to be provided and that we ensure that those industries can grow and diversify, that there is more competition and there are more services and different products. Ultimately there will be genuine convergence and what we today know as television, in particular, will cease to exist in the form that we currently know it because of technological change. But that is much overhyped and will be some distance away. For the foreseeable future, we as a society need to maintain a separate regulatory arrangement for broadcasting to ensure that spectrum will be there. It is important that we have a genuinely expert non-political regulator. One of the things that I would urge upon the government, once this legislation is passed and once the boss of the new organisation is appointed, is that we do not see any more David Flints-that we do not see any more political stooges who are there to run their own political agendas-and that we do not have an organisation that is unduly soft in the application of its regulatory and administrative roles. We need an organisation that will clamp down on miscreants and actually enforce the rules. In some respects, I felt that the former Australian Communications Authority was a bit soft in its administration of consumer protection provisions in telecommunications, for example. There are a number of lessons that we can learn from what has occurred in the recent past to ensure that the new authority has integrity, strength and impartiality and that it is genuinely an expert based authority making decisions in accordance with the legislation and the wishes of the parliament, on the basis of the merits of the issues and not on the basis of political bias-as was the case with Professor Flintor on the basis of any other extraneous matters. This legislation does point to the early stages of a wave of quite revolutionary change that is going to hit broadcasting in this country, and we are seeing only the very early stages of it. The transition to digital been painfully slow in this country. It is really not gathering serious momentum and there are some major new decisions that the government will have to face up to at some point. There are questions about whether there should be further competition in television broadcasting and whether multichannelling should be allowed. There are questions about whether we should allow, in what is supposedly a high-tech industry, the kind of competition and open entry to the marketplace that is now taken for granted in virtually all other industries or whether we should continue to stick with an antiquated regulatory framework that reflects a bygone world. If you think about it, we have seen very little change in television for 25 years. The last major change in Australian television, in true impact, was the entry of SBS-and I acknowledge the presence in the parliament today of the member for Kooyong, who had a significant role in the creation of SBS. That was the last major development in Australian television-25 years ago or thereabouts. It is a sector that has not changed very much since that time, yet the technology has changed enormously and is going to change even further. I believe that, unless the technological change wave that is starting to gather momentum is adapted to by television as we know it, it will ultimately disappear. There are really major challenges emerging for the broadcasting sector-for radio as well as television-and, yes, they are entitled to a continued place in the broadcasting spectrum. They are entitled to a continuing role in our society, but they are not entitled to undue protection from competition or from the implications of technological change. So whether it is the transition to digital in radio, the prospect of satellite radio, the question of additional licences in television or the question of multichannelling, there is no question about where I stand on these has issues: I am in favour of reform, I am in favour of progress, I am in favour of allowing technological change and market forces to give better products, more choice, more diversity and more jobs for Australian consumers and for Australian society. There are some difficult micro issues to be dealt with, but it is about time the government started to front up to those issues instead of ducking and weaving, which it has done for a number of years. It is about time the government started to front up to those issues and to institute a serious reform agenda in Australian broadcasting. There are lots of things that we could do. There is significant change occurring in other jurisdictions. If you look at what is happening with digital television in Britain, for example, you will see the impact of pursuing a progressive mechanism for introducing digital TV there, whereas it has been a dismal failure thus far in Australia, in spite all the hype that has been put forward. We have got to take these issues and move with them and move with technological change and allow the broadcasting sector to flourish, to genuinely innovate and to build on and improve what it delivers for Australia. Some of that has happened in radio. More competition has led to more activity, more jobs, more revenue and much greater diversity of product for Australian consumers-and much more choice in radio. I believe that we need to follow that pattern in television as well and then we will have a better sector and a better society. Debate interrupted. NA",156
132,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Frank Churchill, OAM",158
133,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak in recognition of one of my local constituents, Mr Frank Churchill, who was presented with the Order of Australia Medal on Australia Day this year. Frank was born Francis Clive Churchill in September 1931 in Melbourne. He grew up in Port Melbourne and attended the Albert Park Primary School and South Melbourne Technical College, before undertaking a butcher's apprenticeship. Frank was married at 19 to Ellen and, to quote Frank, he has ‘completed 54 years' of marriage, no doubt a significant achievement in itself. Ellen and Frank had five children, one of whom is now deceased, and they are now the proud grandparents of 13 grandchildren and three great grandchildren. I have met one of Frank's grandchildren, Steven-who is studying the VCE at Gladstone Park Secondary College. Steven Churchill is a fabulous young man with a brilliant mind, and I have no doubt of that he will go on one day to achieve great things. Frank Churchill moved to Broadmeadows in 1957 and has continued to reside there since, educating all of his children in Broadmeadows. Typical of members of the local community, Frank is a proud Broadmeadows resident. Frank has been a member of Freemasonry Victoria for the past 40 years and during his career he has worked as a butcher, milkman, painter and docker, truck driver and firefighter. In 1956, Frank joined the Metropolitan Fire Brigade. He retired after 32 years in 1988. During his time at the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, Frank was an active life member of the United Firefighters Union, for whom he served as a shop steward. He was a member of the committee of management before becoming president and then being elected as secretary. In 1975 Frank was appointed commissioner on the inaugural occupational health and safety commission, representing the Victorian Trades Hall Council. Along with other commissioners, he received a WorkSafe Victoria Award in 2004, in recognition of this work. Also in 1975, Frank became the foundation director of the Firefighters Credit Union and was an active participant on the credit union's steering committee. Frank completed 27 years continuous service as director and was elected in October 2004 for a further three-year term. He was made an Associate Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Credit Union Directors in 2004. In addition to these positions, Frank became a director in 2001 on the inaugural board of Northern Support Services-formerly the Helping Hand Association for people with disabilities-a position he still holds today. In December 1982, as a senior fireman, Frank was honoured with the National Medal for diligent long service to the community in hazardous circumstances, including in times of emergency and national disaster in direct protection of life and property. On Australia Day this year, Frank was honoured with the Medal of the Order of Australia for services to the community, through support for social welfare organisations for people with disabilities, particularly through the Northern Support Services group, and for services to the emergency services, through the United Firefighters Union and the Firefighters Credit Union. A search of the Australian honours list shows that Frank is only the second person from Broadmeadows to receive such an honour, the only other being Stephen Collins in 1984. We in Broadmeadows are very proud of Frank Churchill for that achievement. I attended the Australia Day presentation ceremony at the Broadmeadows Town Hall and it was an absolute delight to see such a deserving recipient awarded the honour of the Medal of the Order of Australia. At the congratulatory luncheon held the following Sunday and attended by a great number of Frank's friends and well wishers, I extended my personal congratulations to Frank and presented him with a certificate of congratulations. Tonight, I would like to formally record my congratulations to Frank Churchill OAM, a proud Broadmeadows resident whose achievements are to be commended. I congratulate Frank for his many achievements and I particularly congratulate him for being honoured this year with the Order of Australia medal. Frank, you are a very deserving recipient, and I am proud to be your representative in the federal parliament. Mr Andy Hall",158
134,Mr GEORGIOU,ADJOURNMENT,"This House is extremely well served by members of the House of Representatives staff-by their advice, by their assistance and, more than occasionally, by their simple human kindness. Sometimes our colleagues are unkind to us and the staff actually fill the gap. I think this observation is true of all House of Representatives staff, from the people who say hello in the morning to the people who give us glasses of water-for some obscure reason we seem to be incapable of getting them ourselves. Tonight I would like to pay tribute to Andy Hall. Andy has notified the Department of the House of Representatives of his intention to resign as an employee, effective from the middle of this month. Of all the jobs in the parliament, looking after members of parliament across the range of their equipment, printing and IT needsnot least of which is the dreaded hand-held computer-must be a bit like undertaking the labours of Hercules. The task is usually enhanced by the astonishingly good manners of members of the House of Representativesnot least when they are under pressure or computers go down. To do the job with grace, patience and concern you need the qualities possessed by Andy Hall. No wonder Andy's hair has gone prematurely white. As a member of parliament, I have known Andy Hall for a decade. He has been the epitome of two things: firstly, can-do professionalism and responsiveness, and, secondly-and this is worth underscoring-a gentlemanly kindness. Andy has always bent over backwards to discharge the substance of responsibilities rather than merely the form of them, and I think most of us have benefited when he has tried to help us make things work-rather than just saying that it cannot be done. Andy commenced work with the department in August 1986 as a sessional attendant. In September 1987 he moved into the transport office and then to the stationery store 1988. In 1991 Andy was promoted to the position of printing manager-and I think some of us have had first-hand experience of his enormous capacity to get things done against astonishingly tight deadlines, often imposed upon him by unreasonable members of parliament. Since 2000 Andy has been involved in the support of IT equipment. I am not sure that that exactly made his day, but he was astonishingly good at it. Andy received an Australia Day medal in 1993 and was also awarded a medal for his contribution to the Australian Public Service on its centenary in June 2001. I still remember that ceremony. Andy exemplifies the qualities that are found in all recipients of the Australia Day medallion, especially those relating to advancing the quality and the perceptions of House of Representatives services and caring for the welfare of his colleagues. The type of work he has been doing so energetically in respect of member services in a number of fields and his activities above and beyond the call of duty have made him a very important part of the lives of members and friends. On behalf of all members, I would like to wish him and his wife Pam all the best in the next phase of their lives-I hope it is the best phase of their lives too-and to thank him genuinely for all the assistance he has given to members. Walter Construction Group",159
135,Dr EMERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Rankin) (7.37 p.m.)Australian building workers and small businesses are being forced to grapple with yet another corporate collapse-that of the Walter Construction Group. The administrators have described the group as ‘hopelessly insolvent'. They have warned retrenched employees that there is little prospect of receiving their full entitlements as a result of this collapse. How could such a major construcin tion company be ‘hopelessly insolvent' during a sustained building boom? Didn't anyone in authority see the collapse coming? And does anyone in authority really care? The Walter Group owes $18 million to permanent employees. Since the group's realisable assets are valued at between $17 million and $26 million and it has only $10 million in liquid assets, and since it also owes creditors $90 million, the employees look like ending up high and dry. The government promised years ago that it would legislate to rank employees above creditors but has never fulfilled that promise. So the employees will be left to the mercy of the government's General Employee Entitlement Scheme, otherwise known as GEERS. If you believed the former Minister for Small Business and Tourism, the employees would get 100 per cent of their entitlements through GEERS. During the election campaign, where truth seems to be an early casualty, in an interview on Radio 2UE's Steve Price program on 30 August the following exchange occurred. Minister Hockey said: Well, we already have a fund that covers employee entitlements and we do that, we have that fund because we've done the hard yards on managing our budget and we have the funds available so that we do not have to increase taxes. The member for Sydney, Ms Plibersek, asked: Do they get a hundred per cent of their entitlewhy ments, Joe? Mr Hockey replied: Yes, they do. Yes, they do. That is what the minister for small business at the time said-that, under GEERS, employees receive 100 per cent of their entitlements. The fact is that GEERS does not pay 100 per cent of employee entitlements. GEERS is capped at eight weeks redundancy pay and does not cover any unpaid superannuation. These limits are publicised on the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations websitewww.workplace.gov.au-on the employee entitlements webpage. Documents obtained through freedom of information reveal that these limits on GEERS and other limits have left working Australians more than $35.3 million out of pocket. The FOI documents reveal that the Howard government is pretending to protect employee entitlements but is short-changing one in five claimants-that is, almost 4,000 working Australians-by an average of $9,000 each. So you have the minister for small business at the time saying that 100 per cent of employee entitlements are paid, yet the FOI documents reveal the truth-that almost 4,000 working Australians have been short-changed by an average of $9,000 each. The only employees who have received 100 per cent protection of their entitlements are those of the Prime Minister's brother Stan. As a result of that scandal, Labor and the general community were able to shame this government into introducing a limited employee entitlements scheme known as GEERS. In contrast, Labor took to the election a proposal to cover 100 per cent of employee entitlements, including superannuation, and it was that scheme that the former minister for small business was criticising in that 2UE radio interview on that day. That is he was on radio: because he was criticising Labor's proposal to protect 100 per cent of employee entitlements while pretending that the government's own scheme did just that, and of course it does not. The government claims it is the party of small business and it wants to protect contractors. It has foreshadowed legislation about that. But what about the subcontractors to the Walker Group working on its 30-odd projects? They will take a big hit, but of course they will try to stay solvent. They will not be entitled to GEERS, since they are not the employees of an insolvent company. Who is going to look after the subbies? Not the Howard government, which pays lipservice to protecting contractors. Here is an opportunity for the government to put its money where its mouth is, to take an active interest in the plight of both employees and subcontractors. It is expected that at least 500 employees will be retrenched on Friday. I call on the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to involve himself personally and not wait for the gears of GEERS to grind slowly forward, eventually paying part of the entitlements owed. If the government were interested in anything but pre-election political rhetoric, it would involve itself in this unfolding disaster. Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organisation",160
136,Mrs VALE,ADJOURNMENT,"Hughes) (7.42 p.m.)Tonight I would like to increase awareness in this House of the new and forthcoming capabilities of the Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organisation, ANSTO, our country's nuclear research and development organisation and the centre of Australian nuclear expertise, which I am very proud to say is located in my electorate of Hughes. In a recent announcement in my electorate, the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, named ANSTO's replacement research reactor ‘OPAL', which stands for Open Pool Australian Light-water reactor. OPAL is a name designed to give this $330 million scientific investment a recognisably Australian name. I would also like to acknowledge the students in my electorate from St John Bosco College who helped with suggestions that influenced the new name. The minister also launched the new state of-the-art $3.2 million Small Tandem for Applied Research particle accelerator, otherwise known as STAR. STAR offers Australian researchers, particularly universities, world-class ion beam and accelerator mass spectrometry capabilities to conduct studies into the environment, archaeology, heritage, biology and materials. STAR will also be able to do important work such as carbon dating and forensic analysis. It will help accommodate increasing scientific demands and also encourage innovative Australian research in fields where this was previously problematic. Of even more significance is OPAL. The new reactor will be a world-class neutron source capable of supporting up to 17 neutron beam instruments. The first eight of these instruments are currently under construction. The scope of research that these instruments will allow is tremendous, from research on advanced materials through to molecular biology and using technologies that were unknown at the time the first tor was built. As well as opening up new areas of research, ANSTO is well known as the principal producer and supplier of radioisotopes for medical diagnosis, treatment and pain relief in Australia. Last year approximately 550,000 patient treatments were transported from ANSTO to hospitals all around Australia, and increasingly in South-East Asia as well. Nuclear medicines are chiefly used for diagnosis, but increasingly also to treat disease and for pain relief. For example, bone scans can detect the spread of cancers six to 18 months sooner than X-rays can. With the replacement research reactor, ANSTO will have sufficient flux to be able to produce not just diagnostic nuclear medicines but a great range of therapeutic medicines as well. We can go on to actually treat cancers and tumours by injections with nuclear medicine. ANSTO also conducts new research aimed at developing new radiation treatments for different types of cancer and other medical conditions. Of course, ANSTO's expertise in these fields will increase as the replacement research reactor comes on line. With additional capacity, ANSTO will also be able to expand its support for the to Australian manufacturing, minerals and agricultural industries. The estimated gross benefit of support for the minerals industry, for example, currently exceeds $100 million annually. The replacement reactor will give us significantly more. This modern facility will attract eminent foreign scientists to work in Australia and provide Australian scientists with greater reciprocal access to complementary first-class research facilities around the world. As people can see, the return to Australia from this reactor will indeed be significant. In terms of general everyday uses of rareacdioactivity, examples include radioactive materials that are used to test the quality of steel in automobiles; aircraft manufacturers using radiation to check for flaws in jet engines; and mining and petroleum companies using radionuclides to locate and quantify mineral deposits. Manufacturers use radioactive materials to obtain the proper thickness of tin and aluminium; pipeline companies use radioactive materials to look for defects in welds; and oil, gas and mining companies use radioactive materials to map geological contours, using test wells and mine bores, and to determine the presence of hydrocarbons. By showing how plants absorb fertiliser, radioactive materials help researchers learn when fertiliser should be applied and how much is needed. This helps prevent the overuse of fertiliser as a major source of and water pollution. Radioactivity is also used in sterilisation techniques to control insect pests such as fruit flies, which is important in agricultural Australia. Smoke detectors rely on a tiny source of radioactivity source to sound the alarm when they sense smoke from a fire. Irradiation of silicon for the semiconductor industry is significant business for ANSTO. Cosmetics, hair products and contact lens solutions are sterilised with radiation to remove irritants and allergens. And this is to name just a few applications. This marks the beginning of a new phase in Australian science. I can proudly say that, in my electorate, this reactor is really an Aussie gem. I will be speaking to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads regarding a pressing need for a serious upgrading of the road used by ANSTO and its employees. This is the Illawarra road, and I have every confidence in the minister. He will address this important local issue. (Time expired) Solomon Islands",161
137,Mr SERCOMBE,ADJOURNMENT,"Last week I had the opportunity to spend most of the week in the Solomon Islands. Given the increasing involvement that Australia is now having with the Pacific-I would suggest far too late-under this government, it is a particularly interesting area to spend time in. Next week I will be looking for an opportunity to give a much more detailed account of the visit, the things that I learned and some of the suggestions that I would make arising from the visit. But in the very limited time. I have this evening, I want to touch on two matters. Firstly, I want to add to the contributions to of others in this House by offering my condolences to the relatives and friends of Adam Dunning, the fine young Australian policesoil man who was murdered in quite cowardly circumstances in Honiara just before Christmas. Being in that place brings home to one very the sacrifice that some people have to make to achieve the objectives that on a bipartisan basis are supported in the Australian parliament. Adam's sacrifice needs to be remembered in Australia forever. Shortly after Adam's murder, I publicly suggested that it would be appropriate for the Australian government, in consultation with his family, to find some ongoing way of commemorating his service. I suggested that one possible way would be to endow a scholarship for a young Solomon Islander of great promise to allow him or her to be educated in Australia. I am still not aware of any decision by the government on that matter, and I look forward to a government decision. Given the scale of Australia's commitment, and particularly given the scale of resources from our police that are now required in the Pacific, including the Solomon Islands, the morale of police is critically important. I have to say that the young Australian men and women serving in the Solomons are very fine people, and their morale is high. However, there are some matters that need attention fairly promptly in order to maintain that. In visiting the Australian base just out of Honiara-GBR as it is called-I found that there were some problems with Australians maintaining contact with loved ones and friends back in Australia. At that base there are only four public phones available to our police personnel to call back to Australia, and there is no real privacy associated with the use of those phones. That is something that I think is going to adversely affect personnel unless it is addressed very quickly. There are over 100 police-not just Australians, but Australians are probably the largest contingent-at that location, and they are expected to maintain contact with loved ones back in their homeland from four very public phones with, as I say, no privacy. Moreover, there are only six internet connections available for that place. I sincerely hope that the people who are responsible for these matters will give prompt attention to upgrading the capacity of young Australians and young Pacific Islanders who are serving together, to maintain connections. They need to do that in order to continue the support that they get emotionally and otherwise from friends and relatives in Australia. I will have more to say about that and a couple of other matters on an occasion when I have more time. The other matter I want to briefly comment on is the pride I had in being an Australian present when the Australian under-20 soccer team won the Oceania championship in Honiara last Monday week. It defeated the Solomon Islands 3-0. However, the Solomon Islands were not shamed. They did extraordinarily well to get into the finals. They defeated New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu to get there and they played very well. Unfortunately, the occasion was marred by some rowdy and bad behaviour by some people in the vicinity of the match. I gather there was some doubt about whether the international soccer authorities would agree to allow the Socceroos to play in the Solomon Islands later this year for qualification for World Cup-the Oceania qualification. I understand that the soccer authorities have now, with conditions, agreed to allow Honiara to be used for that important event later in the year, and that is a very positive development for soccer and for the Solomon Islands. I congratulate the authorities on making a decision to not remove the World Cup qualifier from Honiara later this year. I also wish the Australian under-20s great success when they go to Holland later this year, in June, and play in the world championships there. (Time expired) Child Support Agency",163
138,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT,"Hume) (7.52 p.m.)Once again, I rise in this place to talk about what I have described before as the national disgrace-commonly referred to as the Child Support Agency. Over the months prior to the Christmas and New Year break I received hundreds of emails, faxes and phone calls about problems associated with the pressure placed on payers of support following broken marriages. As a result of all of those particular faxes, emails and calls, I am very much aware of the failure of successive governments and ministers of the Crown to detect and rectify the anti male culture endemic in the Child Support Agency. More importantly, since then I have been getting additional faxes, emails and phone calls to the point where I now have three files containing hundreds and hundreds of cases of what can only be described as the disgraceful results of actions by the Child Support Agency. I believe that in most cases it is abusing its powers and is misusing the act under which it operates. The information that I have proves conclusively that the actions of the Child Support Agency have had a significant impact on male suicide. It has certainly had an impact on bankruptcies. It has caused breakdown, heartache and presthe sures for new families where payers of support have tried to get on with their life and create new relationships. It has pursued the illegal and abusive use of its powers by accessing people's bank accounts, which I have referred to in the past. These stories, from people from all over Australia, have reinforced and confirmed to me that the thing I feared is in fact operating. Institutionalised sexism is endemic and operating in the Child Support Agency and, to a lesser degree, in the Family Court. I have been so concerned about this particular issue that I have had preliminary talks with the commissioner who deals, within and outside the government, with issues of sex discrimination. I have asked the commissioner to sit down and give me an overall brief on what her role is, how her charter operates and how she, as the commissioner, is required to operate it. I did that on the basis of forewarning her that I am going to lodge an official complaint, as a member of parliament, about the anti male bias in the way the Child Support Agency operates and its obviously institutionalised sexism against males. I will do that because I can no longer erate and bear to read about and absorb the pain and suffering that is occurring because of the way in which they operate. Publicly, they declare that their task is to provide child support but it is, in fact, spousal maintenance, which is destroying lives and careers. I can no longer allow that to happen and I am going to pursue this issue. If it takes this the next term of government to get a final conclusion-such as the Child Support Agency being restructured or removed and replaced with some other form of child support that lives and operates within the realm of reasonableness in the Australian community-then that is the way it is going to have to be. Unfortunately, that may not go down too well with some of my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House, and it certainly may not go down too well with some of the ministers of the Crown in this place. (Time expired) Ministerial Reply",164
139,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"Robertson-Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads) (7.57 p.m.)-I note comments by the member for Hughes earlier in the debate and I want to make a statement to the House in reply. Earlier today, I gave an undertaking to the House to make some inquiries on particular matters relating to the Tumbi Creek Regional Partnerships funding. I am advised of the following. On 9 June 2004, the Wyong council in New South Wales voted to adopt on-land disposal of dredge spoil from Tumbi Creek. The dredging and associated works were required to prevent potential flooding of nearby houses on Tumbi Creek, and to prevent some 15,000 cubic metres of silt from Tumbi Creek being deposited on the floor of the Tuggerah Lake system. This problem had been the subject of correspondence between Wyong Shire Council and the New South Wales government as far back as December 2003, and between the member tol- for Dobell, Mr Ken Ticehurst, and the NSW and Australian governments. There were proposals for assistance from both governments in resolving this issue. Wyong council's June 2004 proposal was predicated on the state and federal governments providing matching grants-some $680,000 in addition to council's $680,000. and Council's decision to propose this project was based on detailed study by its director of engineering services and after consideration and agreement by the full council. On 10 June 2004, the Department of Transport and Regional Services, DOTARS, received an application from Wyong council. The department commenced assessment of that Regional Partnerships application. On 23 June 2004, the department provided briefing to the then parliamentary secretary, the Hon. DeAnne Kelly.",165
140,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 8 p.m., the debate is interrupted.",166
141,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I require that the debate be extended.",166
142,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The debate may continue until 8.10 p.m.,166
143,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"On 24 June 2004 the then parliamentary secretary approved the grant. The grant was announced by the member for Dobell on 1 July 2004. It will be recalled that Wyong council's application was predicated on matching funds from both the federal and state governments. When it became clear that the New South Wales government would not provide matching funding, Wyong council gave further consideration to the issue. On 1 July 2004 Wyong council lodged a revised application seeking an additional $680,000 from Regional Partnerships. On 11 July 2004 the then parliamentary secretary approved the additional funding request because the project was regarded as sufficiently important to justify the additional funding. On 26 August 2004 details of the total grant were announced. There was considerable rain in October 2004 and subsequent media reports, such as the Central Coast Advocate of 12 November 2004, reported that the rain had ‘flushed' the silt blocking the mouth of Tumbi Creek. This led to some local speculation, including by a councillor, that funds might be used for other projects. On 17 November 2004 Mr Hallett of my office sought advice from my department on the implications of the flushing of the creek. The department's advice was that: The two projects agreed by Mrs Kelly regarding Tumbi Creek are yet to be contracted and will impacted upon by the recent removal of the blockage at the mouth of Tumbi Creek. The approved projects were to deliver the following three outcomes: access for recreational boats to Tuggerah Lake; improved water quality in Tumbi Creek; mitigation of flood risks to low lying properties near the creek mouth. The department is currently waiting for advice from Wyong Council regarding the implications of the recent removal of the blockage at the mouth of Tumbi Creek on the dredging project. A revised project schedule and costing will be negotiated with the Council. If this results in reduced project costs, it is proposed that the Commonwealth will reduce its grant contribution until project costs are equally shared by Wyong Council and the Commonwealth (ie, until total project costs fall under $1.36 million ... all the costs saving will reduce the Commonwealth's ... after that threshold cost savings will be shared equally by the Council and the Commonwealth. If Wyong Council wishes to revise the project to include outcomes beyond those agreed by Mrs Kelly (eg ‘upstream bank erosion works') this would require a formal request by the Council for the consideration of the Parliamentary Secretary, Mr John Cobb. The status of Tumbi Creek was reviewed by the council's Director of Engineering Services and he reported to council on the situation and the scope of works required on 24 November 2004. Wyong council has provided a verbatim transcript of the advice tendered by the Director of Engineering Services, Mr David Cathers. This advice was tendered at the ordinary meeting of council and would have been easily obtained by the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues before they made the false allegations raised in the House earlier today. Any of the three Labor representatives on the Wyong council could have provided it. The substance of his report was that, while approximately 1,000 be cubic metres of soil had been disposed of by the recent rains, they were dealing with a situation in which 15,000 cubic metres needed to be dealt with. The Director of Engineering Services concluded: In terms of raising the issue about ‘is there any need to do any further work?' It is a very valid question and it is indeed worthwhile identifying and that is what we've done but further work does need doing. I table that report from the Director of Engineering Services from Wyong council. At all times this matter has been dealt with properly. To date no money has been paid. Funds cannot be used for purposes other than those approved, and any funds that are not required will be retained by the Commonwealth. I am advised that contracts are yet to be signed and can assure the House that funds will only be provided for a proper purpose. The claim that there has been a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth of funds is ridiculous and the Leader of the Opposition should immediately apologise to all those people he so lightly slandered earlier today. I table a copy of the statement. House adjourned at 8.05 p.m. NA NA Parliament House: Costs Mr MARTIN FERGUSON to ask the Speaker: (1) For the financial year 2004-2005, what is the itemised list of costs of the changes to security arrangements including the erection of security barriers around Parliament House.
