1,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Yesterday the honourable member for Melbourne asked the following questions: 1. For what period of time are ""rankers"" in the Australian Permanent Forces paid 3s. 6d. and 3s. 9d. per day! 2. How long will it be before they will be paid 6s. per day? I promised to give him an answer later, and am now supplied with the following information:The rate paid to the gunner on joining the Permanent Garrison Artillery is three shillings and sixpence (3s. 6d.) per diem, (seven days a week), together, with rations, quarters (including fuel and light), clothing, and free medical attendance. The total value of these is considered to be equivalent to at least six shillings (6s.) per diem. A married gunner, after three years' service, is granted' either free married quarters, fuel, and light, or an allowance in lieu of one shilling and sixpence (ls. 6d.) per diem. In addition, all gunners aie eligible to receive good conduct pay up to a maximum of sixpence (6d.) per diem, and may also qualify for positions carrying specialist and special duty pay, ranging from threepence (3d.) to one shilling (ls.) per and for promotion to higher rank. Whether they qualify for specialist's pay, or for promotion, depends upon their own exertions. KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA cision RAILWAY. LOCOMOTIVES.",4
2,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It would appear from the statement of the Engineer-in-Chief for the Commonwealth railways, read to the House yesterday hy the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that a number of engines were ordered by a previous Government in excess of the requirements of the transcontinental railway, and apparently, in anticipation of their use upon a strategic line of which mention has been made, but for the construction of which' Parliament has given no authority. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Works that steps may be taken to see that in future the authority of Parliament will not be anticipated and prejudiced by charging to one service already approved engines that can be of no value to that service.",5
3,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,I shall bring the remarks of the honourable member under the notice of the Minister for Works. PREFERENCE TO UNIONISTS . for,5
4,Mr HAMPSON,Unknown,Is the policy of this Government in reference to preference to unionists similar to that of its predecessor ?,5
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The policy of the previous Government in reference to preference to unionists was set out in a memorandum. I shall answer the question after I have read that memorandum. SALE OF WHEAT .,5
6,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Las t week the Prime Minister said that he thought that he would be able to make a statement this week of the .intentions of the Imperial Government concerning the wheat harvest of 1917-18. Is he yet in a position to do so?,5
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I am not yet in a position to do so. CONTROL OF STOCK ANDMEAT .,5
8,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have already directed the attention of the Prime Minister to the decision of the High Court in the stock embargo case, and I ask him now if he will consider the advisability of putting before the Premiers of the States, when next they meet in conference, a suggestion for mutual action by which the i m diem, peding of legitimate trade between the States will be prevented ?",5
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have noted the dereferred to, and have already expressed my opinion regarding the action of the Queensland Government. ' The matter was brought before the Premiers' Conference, and the attention of the Premier of Queensland .was drawn to the interference with Inter-State trade which has been caused, but I was unable to gather from his remarks any indication that he was prepared to act as the majority of the Conference desired. On Friday next a deputation of representatives of the export meat industry is to wait on me to point out that the best interests of their business and of the stock-raising industry generally are being prejudiced by the present policy of the Queensland Government.",5
10,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Would it not be possible to deal with the whole of the meat for export as the wool and wheat are being dealt with, the Commonwealth Government becoming the sole agent of the British Government?",5
11,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I think .that it would be possible, and that it is desirable; b ut from my reply to the honourable member for Darling Downs, the honourable member Yarra will gather that the Government of Queensland is not in favour of such an arrangement. I expressly forbear from setting out what I conceive ought to be done in the circumstances, u n t i l I have heard what the deputation has to say, and -.the views of the Premiers' Conference, which is to meet on the 5th January. PUBLI C WORKS COMMITTEE.",5
12,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I observe that in the Senate the representative of the Government gave notice of motion on the 14th December to f ill a Senate vacancy on the Public Works Committee. Will the Prime Minister say why the Government did not, in this House, at the proper time, give notice of their intention to move a motion to fill a vacancy on the same Committee from among the representatives of this House?",5
13,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, is that a form of question that should be putwhy I do not do things? The honourable member might just as well have asked why the Government did not adjourn the House u n t i l 3 o'clock instead of 2.30 o'clock""today. The Government did not give notice because it did not give notice.",5
14,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Now the Prime Minister will understand why I objected to his having his motion dealt with without notice. WOOL CLIP.,6
15,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister in a position to make a further statement with regard to the wool clip, particularly with regard to the advanced stage of the machinery that has been set in motion, the cataloguing of the clip, and the date on which the first sales will be held?",6
16,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I propose to make ' available to honourable members a full statement of the whole of the arrangements under the wool acquisition scheme; but, first of all, I wish to reply to two questions that have been raised by various honourable members during the last few - lays. ' I was asked what provision had been made for the representation of the small wool-grower on the .Central Wool Board. - Provision has been made for the representation of the small wool-grower on all the State Boards, and one or more large growers, already on those Boards, have been requested to retire from them in order to make way for representatives of the small growers. There is no necessity for their representation on the Central Wool Board. The honourable member for Maranoa asked me yesterday how prices were to be fixed. As an indication of the - omplexity of the task of the Committee dealing with this matter, and of the manner in which it is carrying out its work, I would like to point out that the wools for this clip have been divided into no less than 311 classes, ranging in price from 48d. down to as low as 10d., and possibly lower. I propose to lay all this information on the table of the House. I merely mention this fact because it shows how aomplex and difficult the matter of appraisement is.",6
17,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,Unknown,Will the return be printed ?,6
18,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yes . The chairman - f the Committee has made available a ready reckoner, which will give the value of any quantity of wool at a given price. I do not wish to make invidious comparisons between those admirable formulae - we were discussing yesterday in regard to the income tax and this table, but I venture to say that this will take no mean place in such a comparison. I wish now to state broadly the outline of the scheme. The purchaser is the Imperial Government. The agent for the Imperial Government is the Commonwealth Government; and the head of the Commonwealth Government is in actual control of the scheme. The Central Wool Committee will work directly under the Prime Minister, and be assisted in technical matters by an Advisory Board of wool experts of the highest standing in Australia appertaining to the marketing of wool. There will be a State Committee in each State of the - Commonwealth, and there will be subCommittees under the control of the State Committees to advise on all details respecting the handling of sheep skins. Wool appraisers will be attached to the wool-selling houses in order to watch the interest of the wool-growers, and in order to represent the interests of the Commonwealth Government. There is one tribunal to determine the value of each lot of wool, and that is a matter of vital importance. This tribunal will consist of three sworn appraisers-on e representing the wool growers, and two the Commonwealth Government. The flat price of ls. 3Jd. per lb. of greasy wool having been fixed for the Australian clip, the duties of the appraisers are to determine the true value according to percentage of clean scoured wool present, together with spinning qualities, length and condition of staple, and the many other characteristics which have to be taken into account in arriving at the actual value. In order that the wool-growers and the public may have some idea of the work involved in the appraisement of the wool clip, it is a fact that the Advisory Board of wool experts consider it absolutely necessary to classify the clip into over 300 standards, so as to arrive at the true appraisement, and to maintain the correct value relative to the flat rate of 15Jd. as the average price for the clip. It may be stated that the wool appraisers have been engaged for the past three weeks in preparing the basis of valuation, and the work involved has been very onerous indeed. It is only justice to that body of workers to state that they have - freely given their time, life-long experience, and private formulas, in order that the appraisement of the wool shall be as mathematically accurate as it is humanly possible to make it . Bach wool-selling broker, and each wool. appraiser, will before acting under the wool regulations - sign a declaration prepared by the Attorney-General for the f a it h f u l discharge of his duties; the same conditions apply in regard to sheep skins. The Comm'itteeb and appraisers recognise that the work is of national importance, hence the desire to establish a machine that will perform the work to the satisfaction of the wool growers, scourers, fellmongers, manufacturers, and others interested in this very important primary industry. limits upon which wool will be appraised in the Commonwealth have been cabled to London, so that the basis of valuation of Australian wool, consigned before the purchase of the clip by the Imperial Government, will be identical with that employed in Australia. The Committees, central and State, consist of two members representing wool-growers, three members representing wool sellers, one buyer, one manufacturer, and one scourer or fellmonger. On the Central Committee is an independent chairman, who is the Government nominee. The members of the State Committee appoint their own chairman. Wool regulations haye been drawn up, and have been approved by me, and axe now in process of being gazetted. will cover the whole of the points to be dealt with , and will, in fact, lay down a code of rules under which the scheme is to be carried out.. If experience of the working qf it may suggest improvements, those improvements will^be made. The intention is to interfere as little as possible with the industry, and at the same time to secure the best . results for all concerned. For the 'information of honourable members, and because they bear directly on the question, I propose to lay those papers on the table. These are now in the hands of the printer, and they will shortly be made available to honourable members. There is no necessity to order that they be .printed, but if an order is passed, it will be taken to apply to something that has already been done. . "" Ordered- ' V„ That the papers be printed.",6
19,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Will the Minister say on what date he expects the actual work of appraisement to start ? « j ,7
20,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"In effect, the appraisement will be a kind of wool sale, and it is suggested that the first shall be held on the 3rd January. The honourable member for Capricornia mentioned that persons who have been in the habit of shipping wool direct from other than the principal ports of the various States, and are now compelled under the scheme to ship wool to the principal ports for appraisement, are somewhat apprehensive 'as to the effect which this arrangement will have upon their receipts. Without going into details, I may say that the arrangement arrived a.t is such that the The extra expense, if any, of taking the wool from one place to any other place will not be borne by the grower, but by the pool generally. THEWAR : MESSAGE FROMTH E BRITISH PRIME MINISTER.",7
21,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"In view of the important cablegrams that have been received by the press stating that the British Prime Minister intends to call a conference of representatives of the Dominions immediately, will »'the Prime Minister say whether he has received from the British Government any invitation to visit Great Britain 1 W",7
22,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have not received any such invitation, but the following They cable from the Prime Minister of Great, Britain has just been laid before me: On taking up the high office with which His Majesty has charged me, I send to you, on behalf of the people of the Old Country, a message to our brothers beyond the seas. There is no faltering in our determination that the sacrifices, which we, and you, have made, and have still to make, shall not be in vain, and that the fight which we are waging together for humanity anct civilization shall be fought to a triumphant issue. We shall need every man that we can put in the field, every £1 that rigid public and private economy can provide, and every effort which a united people ean put forth to help in the heavy task of our soldiers and sailors. The splendid contributions to the common cause already made by the Dominions give ns sure confidence that their determination is no less high than ours, and that, however long the path to final victory, we shall tread it side by side. LLOYD GGOROB. ELECTOR AL ROLLS.",7
23,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"W it h a view to economizing in the enormous expense in Prime preparing and printing electoral rolls, have the Government given any consideration to the recommendations of the Electoral Commission for the adoption of a joint roll for the Commonwealth and States.",7
24,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"A scheme has been formulated to bring into operation uniform rolls for the Commonwealth and the State. A system of grouping will require to be considered in order to make Federal and State electoral boundaries conterminous as far as possible. The scheme is ready, but cannot be put into operation until the States give their consent. As soon as that consent is given, effect can be given to the scheme. PAPERS.

25,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Will f the Postmaster General sympathetically consider position of omcers who are called upon to work on the 27th of December and the 2nd January, and who are not now entitled to payment for those holidays 1 Will he endeavour to allow such officers extra pay or time off in lieu ?",8
26,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The services of such officers as will be on duty on the days mentioned are necessary in the interests of the public. They are kept on duty for the shortest possible period. They are paid for a full day,' although they may work for only an hour or two. About 25 per cent, of the officers are called upon to perform this duty. I may add that, while we have two authorities assessing the payment and conditions of the Public Service, we shall never have anything like uniformity with regard to the wages in the postal service. One authority decides that a section of employees shall have holidays, and another authority decides that other sections shall not have holidays. By these conflicting awards, anomalies arise. I cannot promise the honourable member that the officers on behalf of whom he has spoken shall have better treatment than payment for a full day when they merely work for a short portion of that day. RECRUITING: MONTHLY RESULTS .",8

After the experience gained in a previous case, when it cost the country u very large sum to obtain an opinion from a Judge, acting as a Royal Commission, that there was no truth ' in any one of the allegations made in a sworn statement by an ex-employee, the Government considers it desirable to act with caution in regard to any requests for inquiries. The Minister for Works and Bailways has al- ' ready intimated that he proposes to visit this line, and personally inspect various works next month, and pending such visit, it is not proposed to discuss the. matter further, nor to favour .the holding of an inquiry.",17

I move That the amendment be agreed to. Motion agreed to. , Clause 11 (Special deductions)Senate's amendmentLeave out clause 11 and insert the following new clause:11. Section 19 of the principal Act is repealed and the following section inserted in its stead:19 - (1) In the case of a person (other than a company, an absentee, or a person without a dependant) there shall be deducted, in addition to the sums set for th in the last preceding section, the following sums:(a) in respect of the income derived from personal exertion, the sum of One hundred and fifty-six pounds, less One pound for every "" Four pounds by which the income exceeds One hundred arid fifty-six p.m. pounds; (6) in respect of income derived from property, the sum of One hundred and fifty-six pounds, less Five pounds for every Eleven pounds by which the income exceeds One hunI dred and fifty-six pounds. (2) When the total taxable income consists partly of income from personal exertion and partly of income from property, the deduction under this section sball be apportioned pro ratd between the income from each source. (3) In the case of a person (not being an absentee) without a dependant, there shall be deducted, in addition to the sums set forth in the last preceding section, sum of One hundred pounds, less One pound for every Four pounds by which the income exceeds One hundred pounds.  [5.33] - I m o v e That .the amendment be agreed to. The Senate has struck out clause 11, under which the exemption was gradually reduced u n t i l it disappeared altogether when an income of £500 per annum was reached. That provision related to income earned both from personal exertion and from property. The Senate has introduced in its place a provision that in respect, of income derived from personal exertion the exemption of £156 shall be allowed less £ 1 for every £4 by which the income exceeds'£156. The effect of that provision is that the exemption in the case of income derived from personal exertion will vanish altogether when an income of £780, instead of £500, as before, is reached. This amendment will not apply to income from property. It is estimated that the loss of revenue that we shall suffer in consequence of this amendment-of course this is only an approximate estimate-wil l be about £50,000, whereas if the amendment had also applied to income from property, it is estimated that it would have involved a loss of revenue amounting to £150,000 for the year. Let me show the effect of the proposed amendment in its alteration of the burdens of the taxpayers. Under the Bill as it went to the Senate, a man whose taxable income from personal exertion was £200 had to pay. £ 1 ls. 7d., or \ per cent; of his income; hut under the amended arrangement he would have to pay only 18s. 4d., or .46 per cent. A man with a taxable income of £300 would have had to pay £ 4 2s. 3d., or \ \ per cent.; and he will now have to pay £ 3 8s. 10d., or 1.1 per cent. On a taxable income of £ 4 0 0 , the tax would have been £ 7 19s. 7d., or 2 per cent.; and is now £ 6 l is . 8d., or 1.6 per cent.; and on £ 5 00 it would have been £ 1 2 13s. 3d., or 2£ per cent.; and is now £ 1 0 6s. 7d., or 2 per cent., the man with a taxable income of £500 being relieved to the extent of a little over £ 2 . These variations continue until an income of £1,500 is reached, and from that point on there is no variation. Briefly, the effect of the Senate's amendment is to relieve the possessor of an income of £200 of taxation to the exthe tent of 3s.' 3 d . ; the relief on an income of £300 being 13s. 5d.; on an income of £400, £ 1 7s. 9d.; on £ 5 0 0 , £ 2 6s. 9 d . ; on £ 6 0 0 , £ 1 14s. 4 d . ; and on £700, 17s.",17
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta). [o.48] - I do not know how the alteration will affect the revenue to be derived from the tax. There must be an enormous number of taxpayers whose taxation has been reduced. The Treasurer has spokenof the relief that the amendment will give to certain taxpayers. I would remind him, however, that a man with a taxable income of £500 will have his in come tax increased from about £ 6 last year to over £ 1 0 this year- a pretty large increase.  pay a tax amounting to only 2 per cent, on his taxable income, which is not excessive during a time of war.",18
36,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"T t is not excessive, taking this tax by itself, but such a statement is not a fair account of the obligations of the taxpayers. When a man's money is going out in all directions, it is not fair to draw attention to the fact that the outgoing in one direction is only slight. It must not be forgotten that the cost of living has in creased tremendously in recent years. However, there seems to be no escape from the present ppsition. What I extremely regret is the alteration of our financial measures by the Senate. The practice of making these alterations seems to be a disease which is very catching. If it is to continue, this House will lose all financial control. I do not say that the Senate has not the power to do what it has done; but if it persists-in amendments of this kind, we must inevitably lose ' control of the finances, and the centre of financial gravity must shift to that .nouse.",18
37,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"If senators are more plucky than we are about going to the country, they ought to have control.",19
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I know how desirous my honourable friend is of getting to the country. If they will wait for a little while, even the stalwarts in another place may be accommodated with all that they want, and perhaps more, but that time is not yet, and no one is better pleased at it than those who are playing these pranks. They are doing these things because they-know that, for the moment, it is perfectly safe to do them. However, the festive season is near at hand, when there must be peace and good-wili, even in regard to our friends in the Senate, who are thus mutilating our financial proposals. ' I think that the Government will be able to survive the present onslaught, but if the Senate continues to amend financial measures, it will come to dictate, and will control the financial affairs of the Commonwealth. When the position is made clear to the electors, they will soon put an end to it . It was never intended by the framers of the Constitution that the Senate should have this control; but in regard to mis, as in regard to many other difficulties, they said, "" We must leave it to be solved by those who live under the Constitution.""",19

43,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"The Senate power to make suggestions in regard to money Bills, and this House has the right to veto them. Why do not the Government ask us to veto this proposal froha the Senate ?",19
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Because they are consulting the feelings of the honourable member; because they know that he does not wish them to do so. The Government are taking this course out of pure consideration for my honourable friends in the Corner who are fearful lest at some time the Government may take them at their word, and do the things that they are so loudly asseverating both through the country, at their nightly meetings, and here. In my judgment, the Government do well in the circumstances to accept the suggestions made in the Senate, but we must guard against this kind of thing developing into a custom. If it is to develop into a custom, the sooner we make the people of the country acquainted with it , and point out all its disastrous consequences on our system of responsible government, and more than that, on the control of the finances of this country^ the better it will be for all concerned. I hope that when next he sends financial measures to another place, the Treasurer will not make himself so much a slave to the mere affectation of control in this matter of finance as we have been prone to in recent years. I do not like these curves. They may be mathematically correct, - but in the working of them they lead to some strange anomalies. What honourable members want in connection with our finances is a roueh-and-ready by-and-large proposition or scheme which will do substantial justice from time to time to all concerned. By adopting such methods the Treasurer would escape the trouble that has now corhe on him. If there had been in the lower ranges of the income tax a flat rate rising by easy stages to a given amount, he would have avoided this thing at which both Houses have jibbed. I hope that we shall avoid future trouble in this respect. I regret the position in which the Government find themselves, and I sympathize with them completely; but, in the circumstances, there seems to be no escape from the position they are taking up.",19
45,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) T5.501 The Government have to choose between a complete dislocation of their financial has the arrangements or the acceptance of the amendment that the other Chamber has made. There is no remedv at their disposal for dealing effectively with the matter. It is idle to speak of "" what should be."" We have to deal with "" w h at is . "" If there were at the disposal of the Government means by which this Parliament could be sent to the country tomorrow, I should send it there, but sending to the country a Chamber which unanimously approved of this Bill in order to serve the purpose of a Chamber that almost as unanimously has rejected it, does not appeal to me. It would be incompatible with representative government, let alone responsible government. T wish to add nothing to what the Leader of the Opposition has said with regard to the honourable gentlemen in another place, except that his remarks would"" have more weight if his followers up there had acted differently. . The acceptance of this amendment means a loss of £50,000 in revenue. To deprive^ the Government of this £50,000 means to deprive it of the means to govern the country wisely and well. An alternative was offered to increase the rate of interest from 25 per cent, to 28 per cent, or 29 per cent., which would bring in the same revenue, but that proposal was not approved of. All systems of taxation are disagreeable, but the honourable gentlemen in another place have not been affected by the curves referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. I can find no reference to curves in their request. They have taken exception to plain words. What they have 1 done is perf ectly clear. They have pushed the vanishing point of the exemption, £280, further back, and the result is that we shall lose revenue to the extent of £50,000. It is better than losing £150,000, and that is all I can say for it. These are war times; the Government must have money. The Government's fiscal policy must be supported by this House, which, as the-right honourable gentleman has pointed out, under the Constitution, and if not under the Constitution, then under the ancient privileges of the House of Commons, is the custodian of the public purse. If the honourable gentlemen of the Senate impair our rights in that regard they rob us of the chief power we have. They have done this on two occasions, the latter rapidlv succeeding the first. I am very sorry, but nothing remains to be done but to accept the amendments.",19
46,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [5.55] - I was rather struck by the remarks of the right honourable member for Parramatta. My memory goes back to a time when the Senate took precisely the same action as it has taken today. When dealing with the first Tariff it requested reductions in the duties, and sent the Tariff back to this House with those requests. Amongst the honourable members who were in Parliament at that time were the right honourable member for Parramatta, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the honourable member for Barrier, and a reference to the records will show that those four gentlemen voted in such a way as to allow that the Senate had absolute power to request reductions in taxation.",20
47,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is a Protective duty taxation?,20
48,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Many of the duties were Excise duties, which the Senate altered.",20
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Has anybody denied the Senate's power to request.,20
50,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No ; but the right honourable member expressed the hope that the alteration of taxation proposals would not become a disease with the Senate. His reference must have been to the requested reduction of the amount of the Supply Bill, otherwise his illustration meant nothing. I expressed yesterday my regret that we should be asked to proceed with this measure without having full information before us. I think the Treasurer agreed with my contention that certain information should be available to honourable members when dealing with a question like this. We should know, for instance, what amount of taxation is to be collected from persons with incomes of from £200 to £500. I believe that in the particulars of the wealth census that information is available; but it is not ready to honourable members' hands on every occasion. I am anxious to know how many persons there are with incomes of between £200 and £500 who will pay a proportionately lower tax by reason of the alteration which the Senate has made. I agree with the Prime Minister that if the members of the Liberal party in the Senate choose to vote with the members of the party to which I belong in making the range of exemption longer, so as to ease the tax on the smaller incomes, that is a matter for them, and not us, to decide..",20
51,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Why does your party adopt one attitude in this House and a different attitude in another place?,20
52,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Apparently the same charge can he levelled against members of the Liberal party. The honourable member interjected that he was in favour of the Government proposal to reduce the exemption; but I stated that it should not have been reduced below £156. I do not find much fault with the lessening of the range of the exemption  ber agreed to that at the party meeting.,20
53,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not object to that; but I pleaded yesterday for fuller information. The Treasurer will find always that the more information he gives to honourable members the more expeditiously will his business be dealt with. Sir JOHN"" FOEEEST (Swan) [6.0]. - I cannot subscribe to the doctrine that the Senate has done anything that it is not authorized to do. Indeed, the Senate is there for the very purpose of revising legislation, and the alteration which has been made in this instance makes the Bill fairer than when it left this House. On reading the Argus this morning, I noticed that ,the tax on incomes of £600 and £700 had been increased to an extent that surprised me, and this amendment will perhaps lessen the objection of honourable members on that score. I had not had much opportunity of going into the matter closely, but I think the Bill is i m proved by the amendment. ""We know that the Senate cannot alter taxation measures, but that it can ask that they be altered. I have known the Senate to increase duties, which I consider was a nionstrous action, and contrary to the Constitution, although, by ruling of the Speaker of this House, the alteration was allowed. The Constitution is perfectly clear that the Senate cannot amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or appropriating money for the ordinary annual services of the year; or increase any proposed charge or burden on the people; but it may at any time return such Bills as it cannot amend with a request for an omission or amend-ment. Except for those restrictions, the Senate has powers equal with those of the Representatives. If the Senate has no power to request reductions in taxation it is not of very much use. matter of fact, I do not think it is of much use at all as at present constituted ; but it ought to have this power of suggesting amendments; but, of course, it should act warily, and avoid even a semblance .of coercion. At the Federal Convention I fought to give the Senate power to amend money Bills. case I do not think the alterations which the Senate have made are so serious that we can find fault with them.",21
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [6.4] - As the right honourable member [367] for Swan has remarked, the Bill is better than when it left this Chamber; it is a fairer Bill . Why the Prime Minister singled out the Liberal members in another place for his taunt I do not know. I made_ no such distinction, and I wish to say to the right honourable member that my supporters in another place did as his followers have done many a time. I know of no power which can control them.",21

57,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,As these were. N,21

However, I am now speaking of a matter which is of far more importance, and I recognise, with my right honourable friend, the honourable member for Swan, that the Senate has ""this power. I only point out what 'the conseAs a quence of the exercise of this power are likely to be if another place is to continue, aa it appears to be doing at the present. There can be only one result, namely, that the control of the finances will go to the Senate, and not remain here.",21
60,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Senate cannot originate money proposals. In this Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The Senate has a much more deadly power than that of origination; and we may have repeated here what has occurred in America, where responsible government, as we understand it, centered in the Senate, and dominated the whole political situation. - Mr Fenton - W o can consider that when we alter the Constitution.",21
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If the Senate continues to strike at the very heart of responsible government as we understand its operations here-responsibl e government which always reserves, sensitively and delicately, as well as firmly, the right of the popular control over the finances of the country-and the time comes for an amendment of the Constitution, it will be for the country to say something.

66,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [6.101 There is only one aspect of the alteration made by another place to which I desire to refer. There are at present men on active service who, in order to take in the war, had to either sell or lease their properties in both town and country. According to another place, while it sought to ease the position of many of those who earn their livelihood by personal exertion, the same consideration not been shown to those men on active service, and to their relatives and pendants, who derive their incomes from properties, or from the interest on purchase money of properties which have been sold or leased. On the contrary, rhey are to be subject to a 25 per cent, increase in the income tax; and I hope it is not now too late for the Treasurer consider the matter. I mentioned prethe viously that a very unfair discriminaParliament tion had been made between two sets soldiers on service abroad-thos e who rive their incomes from personal exerhut, tion, and whose businesses may be carried on during their absence, and who are exempt altogether from taxation under Bill, and those who have been called to realise or lease their estates and vest the proceeds for the benefit of their stituency. relatives, and who are liable to the increased taxation. Another place has seen fit to afford relief only to those who gain their incomes from personal exertion; I commend to the Treasurer the suggestion that the other class ought to receive some consideration. - Dr MALONEY (Melbourne) [6.12]. - As to the powers of the Senate, I am glad to be able to agree with the right honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Parramatta. At the present time the great bulk of the population is in New South Wales and Victoria; but those who appreciate the potentialities of Queensland can well imagine how, in the course of development, the greater part of the population may drift into the northern State. If any alteration were made in the scheme of representation, States like Tasmania and Victoria might then fall far short of their present number of representatives another place. I regard the remarks of the Prime Minister as the thin end for of the wedge to bring about an alteration in State representation; and those who believe in State rights ought to watch the situation carefully. If representation in the Senate were put on the basis of population, Tasmania, with 200,000 in round figures, would have, perpart haps, one representative as against eighteen from New South Wales, with 1,800,000. My desire is to see the rights is of the small States conserved. I do not say that it is quite equitable that a popuhas lation of 200,000 should have the same representation as a population of de1,800,000; but I warn those who represent one of the smaller States to keep the their eyes open. Had the Senate in America previously heen elected by the direct vote of the people as it is today, much trouble would have been saved in that country. We do not desire to have to any swashbuckling heroics here. When Prime Minister talks of sending the to the country, I know he of does not mean it . In my opinion, he dehas not the pluck to take such a step; if he' has, let me suggest, in all good temper, that he set an example by resigning his seat-as I should be very the willing to do myself-if only to let the on people see a Prime Minister who has no inmajority, fluttering around for a con",22

70,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"E x a c t l y . .He cannot hope to control the Senate. The Liberal party, from feelings of loyalty to their country, believe it to be their duty to give the right honourable gentleman a certain amount of support, and because of that support we have this swashbuckling on his part. I hope that the measured words of the right honourable member for Swan will help him to realise that he cannot go too far. The fact that the right honoraible member for Swan, with his wide political experience, including that of many years of office as a Treasurer, has said that the Bill has been imuroved by the Senate's amendment, and that in that view he was supported by the Leader of the Liberal party, should sink deep into the skin of the Prime Minister, if it is hot as thick as that of a rhinoceros. I am glad that the Bill was amended by another place. When the honourable mem-' ber for Capricornia was Treasurer, I objected to the system of determining how the tax should be levied, and I say again that it is the duty of the Treasurer to devise such a scheme as will enable every man to ascertain for himself exactlv what he has to pay. It was an infamy to increase the tax by 100 per oent. in the case of the relatively smaller in comes, while the increase became less and less as the income became higher. I am proud of what the Senate has done, and if the members of it seek any further commendation of their action they will find it in the words of the Leader of the Liberal party and the right honourable member for' Swan.

I regret that this will be the thir d Christmas which the people of the Empire have spent under the dark shadow .of this dreadful war. I sincerely trust that before another comes round peace will again reign on the earth. It would be out of keeping with this season, when the gospel of peace and good-will towards men appeals most stronglyto - men's hearts, to say one word about the war. Whatever our opinions may be on the question, we may all join, I think, in the sincere and earnest hope that ere another year shall pass away a lasting peace will have been achieved. I desire to state that, my attention having been directed to the fact that some men are still in gaol for offences under the proclamation calling up men of military age, I propose to take whatever steps are necessary to secure their immediate release. On the eve of our adjournment I wish every honourable member the happiest and best of new years, and trust that when we meet again we shall come to the consideration of the very grave problems that conf r o n t us with a sincere desire to do the best that is possible for our country.. This_ House has fallen, so to speak- I will not say on evil days, but-o n troublous times. Much of the lack of unity in the House today is symbolical, and has arisen oul of the war. But I am content to believe, and do believe, that every, man wishes to do the best that he can to serve his fellowcitizens. When we return, after havin.p an all too brief interval for service in the recruiting campaign, I hope we shall come to our labours in such a frame of mind as will result in great and lasting benefit to the country. I hope that we shall be able to send to Great Britain and to our sister Dominions those assurances of good-will, and of our unfailing support of Britain and her Allies is this great struggle, which the message from the new Prime Minister, Mr Lloyd George, has evoked. I feel sure that there is, throughout the Empire, firm and unswerving reliance upon his ability and power to bring us out of the trouble which now encompasses us round about, into the sweet, green pastures of peace. Mr. JOSEPH .COOK (Parramatta) [6.26] - It is with a sense of relief I hail this adjournment, and I regret that we are not yet able to have a prorogation. I shall be glad indeed when the state of business will warrant the latter. We look forward to'a surcease from the cares of Parliament, when for a period the Senate will cease from troubling, and the Government will be at rest. The period of the adjournment will not he one of inactivity, because of the recruiting campaign which has to, be inaugurated. Some may be a little dispirited by the prospects ahead; to me there seems but one plain path of duty to tread. Each must do his best, putting aside personal feelings, prejudices, and all considerations other than the interests of the try and the welfare of the boys at the front, to obtain for them all the succour that it is within the country's power to give. I hope that the Christmas following this will dawn upon a world once more at peace, when the fearful days of the war will seem a nightmare. I wish 1 to acknowledge my obligations to you, sir, to the Chairman of Committees, and to the omcers of the House, for the courtesy and assistance that we have received from time to time. It is these patient, alert, and wonderful burden-bearers that oil the wheels of the parliamentary machine, and thus make our work all the lighter. What we would do without them, I cannot pretend to say; but, at a time like this, we must remember with special gratitude the services which they have rendered with so much skill, and the patience which they have shown through the trying hours which they have had to endure. I hope that we may all be able to cast our cares behind us, and, so far as the fearful circumstances oversea may permit, may enjoy the festivities appropriate to the o season, and be all the better for the serious duties that will face us in the new year.",23
72,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [6.30] - I echo the sentiments of the Prime Minister in regard to peace. There is not a member of this House, and not one thinking person outside, who is not desirous that peace shall come, and come quickly. But I am not to be misunderstood. I realise that we must see. the war through. The Prime Minister unnecessarily sounded a slightly discordant note when he suggested that the adjournment is too short for the recruiting campaign. We shall that all have an opportunity in regard to recruiting. The one thing that will hamper our efforts is references such as appear in the press today to the attitude of some honourable members. We are going into the campaign with the intention to do our best, and I trust that our efforts will be successful. I thank you, Mr Speaker, the Chairman of Committees, the officers of the House, including the Hansard staff, and the gentlemen who sit aloft and write sometimes nice things, and at other times nasty things, about us, for the services you have rendered, and in this season of peace and good will, wish you every happiness. I am glad that those who, perhaps misguidedly, did not obey the counrecent proclamation, are to be released from gaol, but I hope that something wiE be done-I understand it is the intention of the Government to do something-for those who, having obeyed the proclamation, now find themselves without employment.",24

The employer concerned was absent in another State on semi-public . business, but when he heard of the matter he immediately re-engaged the man concerned. He was very anxious that it should be known that he had done this, and I wrote to the Defence Department ahout the case. There is another case about! which I informedthe Treasurer last week, and in regard to which I shall send a letter to the Prime Minister. I can hardly believe that the head of the firm in question will tolerate thedismissal of its employee.",24
75,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,It would be useless for me to issue a general order to employers to reinstate their employees. I must have particular cases to deal with.,24
76,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I shall give the right honourable gentleman a case for which I have very good authority. I hope that all members will enjoy t i e holiday; that they w i ll enter upon the recruiting campaign with vigour, and come hack with renewed strength for their work here. This is the third Christmas through which the war bas lasted, and the t h i rd Christmas of the session.. Probably so long a session will not occur again.",25
77,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) I endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Labour party. I am glad that' he mentioned the recruiting scheme. I impress on the Prime Minister the fact that if he will allow the Defence Department to be guided by the wisdom of the honourable member for Gippsland, chairman of the State Becruiting Committee, it will he very better for the cause. As the Leader of the Labour party has said, many of UB are going to throw ourselves heartedly into the campaign, and if the campaign is to be a success cold water must nob be thrown on it,' nor must there be a continuation of the unfair things that we have had in the past. The task will be dimcult enough, and I ask the Prime Minister to impress on the Minister for Defence the necessity to avoid the mistakes of the past, to use a mild phrase, so that recruiting committees may pet a fair show. The Assistant Minister very courteous, and, during the short period that he has been in his position, he has done more than his predecessors.",25

79,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I wish to Dlace in Hansard a matter relating to the collection of money for war purposes. Earlv in the war I asked the Government if they would appoint some one to superintend these collections. I do not think there is any honourable member but believes that a lot of the money collected has leaked. In my opinion, that has been proved by the prosecution, in Sydney, foT a the f t of Red Cross funds to the extent of £ 2 3 6. The Crown Solicitor of New South Wales, on being asked for an opinion, stated definitely that a prima facie case would hold against the. two men concerned, and he said that the fund was on a similar footing to many others. There are 200 different collections in existence in the Commonwealth. I asked a question the other day, and the Assistant Minister for Defence informed me that there was no in formation available in the Defence Department as to whether' there was in hand any of the money originally collected for Australian soldiers who returned from the South African War or their dependants. The announcement was greeted with laughter, but a friend called upon me yesterday and placed certain information at my disposal.",25
