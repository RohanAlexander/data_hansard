If the rate of interest is raised for any subsequent issue, will the subscribers to the first issue benefit accordingly!",4
2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The question is an important one, and I am pleased that it has been asked. The Government have considered the matter, and are not prepared to offer any increase in the rate of interest. The conditions under which the loan is offered are sufficiently liberal to justify all patriotic persons who have money to lend in investing in the loan. The conditions under which the British loan were offered were quite different. In come tax is chargeable in respect of the interest paid on the British loan, and the loan, . it must be remembered, was a conversion loan. We shall not be a party to the proposition of contingent conditions in respect to our war loan. Investors may withhold or not, as they please; we are certain to get the money at the rate of interest offered. LIVE STOCK.",4

9,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I understand that a preliminary inquiry is now being made into the complaints about the treatment of some wounded soldiers who were brought back to Melbourne by the Kyarra, and sent hence to Sydney and Brisbane by train. As it is felt that an impartial inquiry into the conduct of military officers cannot be made by a military officer, will the Minister for the Navy allow the final inquiry, should one be thought necessary, to be made by an independent civilian investigator?",6
10,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The mattermight well stand over until Colonel Irving's report has been received. Should a further inquiry be deemed necessary, no doubt the honourable member's suggestion will be considered.",6
11,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"Is it a fact that soldiers who have returned as invalids do not receive any pay? At the present time men with certificates of discharge in their pockets are to be found begging in the streets of Melbourne, and sueh men have informed me that they are unable to get money from the Defence Department until their pay-books arrive by some later steamer. Are men turned on to the streets without money until their pay-books arrive?",6
12,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"When a soldier is invalided back to Australia because of sickness contracted through no fault of his own, he continues to receive his pay until he is discharged, and, if permanently disabled, may claim a pension. But some of the men who have returned and have been discharged are responsible for the complaints that they have contracted, and the Department cannot, at this juncture, take their cases into consideration. The Department is not responsible for men who have to be discharged because of complaints for which their own conduct is to blame. If they are walking the streets, it is their own fault.",6
13,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Can the Minister for the Navy yet make a definite announcement as to whether Lismore is to be a permanent recruiting centre? As a recruiting campaign is about to be commenced in New South Wales, will the honourable gentleman have the decision of the question expedited ?",6
14,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I shall be glad to confer again with the Minister of Defence on the subject.  out of a letter which I have received, I ask the Minister of Defence if he is aware that fraudulent cablegrams asking for money, and purporting to come from soldiers at the front, have been received in Australia. In a case brought under my notice, the cablegram was certainly a fraud. Will the Minister consider the advisability of warning the public against the possibility of imposition of this kind?",6
15,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The Minister hasalready given a warning to the public on the subject, but I think that it istime that another warning was given. It has been brought under my notice that certain persons have received cables purporting to come from relatives at thefront, stating that they are wounded and are stranded in Egypt, and asking that funds shall be remitted to them by urgent cable. Upon inquiry it has been foundthat the persons from whom these messages purported to come have not been wounded, so that some one over there is. guilty of wrong-doing. It would be wise if those receiving such cables would in quire before remitting any money to Cairoor elsewhere.",6
16,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether any impediment is being placed in the way of youngofficers in his Department going to the front? A young postal oflicer in the country submitted himself on the 12th inst., and passed the test at a countrycentre. He then applied to his Department for permission to proceed to Melbourne, but to that application he received no reply. He has, however, been notified of his transfer to another office, and notice of a long outstanding promotion also accompanied that communication.",6
17,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"No impediment is placed in the way of any young officer of the Postal Department enlisting for active service. If the honourable member will supply me with the name of the man to whom he has referred, I shall cause inquiry to be made. Mr HANTAAN/ - I desire to put a question to the Minister for the Navy. A statement has been widely circulated to the effect that those in charge of Eed Oross goods in Oairo are charging ls. 6d. for a pair of socks, and 10s. 6d. for pyjamas. Those are the amounts given to me as having been charged wounded soldiers.",6
18,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"On a point of order, I draw attention to the fact, Mr Speaker, that a question on this subject is already on the notice-paper.",7
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That being so, it is - not competent for the honourable member to ask the question.",7
20,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"B y way of personal explanation, I should like to state that, had I known that such a question was on the notice-paper, I would not have asked it.",7
21,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"""When I questioned the Minister for the Navy a few moments ago as to the position of certain returned soldiers, I had in mind the case of a returned soldier who has testimonials from the Commanding Officer at Cairo stating that he proved himself thoroughly trustworthy. This man, who was injured by a kick from a horse, is now walking about the streets of Melbourne, and says that he cannot obtain any pay. I desire to ask the Minister for the Navy whether that statement is correct? The unfortunate man says that he has made application at the Barracks, and has been informed that no payment can be made to him until the books arrive from Egypt.",7
22,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"If the returned soldier has been injured while on active service, there can be no question as to his being entitled ro a pension.",7
23,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,Would he not receive rail or sea. his ordinary pay while returning to Australia ?,7
24,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,A soldier is supposed to leceive his pay up to th-3 dato of his discharge.,7
25,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"Would the man be master-General, - discharged in Cairo or here? . Mr JENSEN - Here .",7
26,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Why not give his name?,7
27,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,If the honourable memam 'ber will supply me with this man's name I shall have the matter at once inquired into.,7
28,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Is the Minister for the ""Navy aware that on the arrival of the turned soldiers in Sydney, two or three days ago, there was such a vast congregation of people on the railway station, and so many motor cars and ambulance waggons drawn up outside, that it was almost impossible to get within half-amile of the platform?",7
29,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I have heard that the wounded soldiers on their arrival in Sydney received a magnificent reception.,7
30,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That is quite correct.,7
31,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Will the Minister for the Navy state whether detailed arrangements have been made for the transfer of returned wounded soldiers for New South Wales and Queensland who are to arrive by the Ballarat, and whether, in considering the arrangements, the desirableness of sending the men on by sea instead of by train will be favourably entertained ?",7
32,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Every comfort will be provided for wounded soldiers on their arrival in Australia. We have under consideration the question as to whether it would not be advisable for the steamer by which the wounded soldiers travel to call at the principal port of each State, so that the men may be landed direct from the sea.",7
33,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"In regard to the transport of wounded soldiers from Sydney to Brisbane, will the Minister for the Navy consider the advisability of giving the men the alternative of travelling by sea or rail? Many, by travelling overland, have an opportunity of seeing relatives along the line.",7
34,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I am inclined to think that the soldiers from each State should keep together. Still, I think the soldier should have the choice of travelling by NA ATTENDANTS: NIGHT DUTY.",7
35,Mr MATHEWS,FEMALE TELEPHONE,"I gathered, from remarks made yesterday by the Postthat it is his intention to require female telephone attendants to do all-night duty, and that he said they had expressed their desire to do such work. I informed that they have not done so.",7
36,Mr SPEAKER,FEMALE TELEPHONE,Order ! The honourable member is now debating the question.,7
37,Mr MATHEWS,FEMALE TELEPHONE,"I wish to ask the rePostmaster-General whether it is a fact that such a desire has been expressed, and, if not, will he see that female telephone attendants are not required to do all night duty ?",7
38,Mr SPENCE,FEMALE TELEPHONE,"I made no such statement as that referred to by the honourable member. My reference was merely to female telephone attendants in South Australia, who had petitioned to be allowed to take charge of night work. That petition was granted, and the work has been going on satisfactorily.",8
39,Mr MATHEWS,FEMALE TELEPHONE,Does the Minister intend to institute the same system in Victoria ?,8

41,Mr KELLY,FEMALE TELEPHONE,Is the Minister for the Navy in a position today to make available the papers regarding the permit to visit America which was given to Mr. Blau ?,8
42,Mr JENSEN,FEMALE TELEPHONE,There has not yet been time to obtain them; but I shall endeavour to have the papers ready for the honourable member by Wednesday next.,8
43,Mr KELLY,FEMALE TELEPHONE,"As the Attorney General is not present, I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he will lay on the table of the House next Wednesday, or otherwise make available for the perusal of honourable members, all the papers in the possession of the Attorney General's office in connection with Mr. Blau's visit to America, and subsequent references to the importation of 4711 Eau de Cologne into Australia?",8
44,Mr TUDOR,FEMALE TELEPHONE,They will not be in the Attorney-General's Department.,8
45,Mr KELLY,FEMALE TELEPHONE,"A great many of the papers are in the Attorney-General's Department; but, in order to make the file complete, will the Prime Minister also arrange with hi9 colleagues-the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Minister of External Affairs-to produce any papers in their Departments relating to the same subjects?",8
46,Mr FISHER,FEMALE TELEPHONE,"I shall bring the matter before my colleagues, and unless there are good State reasons rendering it visable, the file will be made available. WAR CENSUS.",8
47,Mr JH CATTS,FEMALE TELEPHONE,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question, and, with your permissiou, Mr Speaker, to state the facts on which it is based. While in Sydney during the week-end, I found that the State Government were distributing cards through the agency of the police, and taking a census of all males between seventeen and forty years of age. I found, further, that many people were confusing this action with the taking of the Commonwealth census. I should like to know if the Prime Minister could arrange with the State authorities to prevent this confusion and duplication of effort ?",8
48,Mr FISHER,FEMALE TELEPHONE,"The question is a very useful one. It would seem that great ideas are running in the minds of great men in different parts of the country. The honourable member is right in saying that if the operations are similar, then it is a waste of effort on the part of the State Government to anticipate the thorough census that is to be taken by the Commonwealth .",8
49,Mr JH CATTS,FEMALE TELEPHONE,"They are adopting, the card system.",8
50,Mr FISHER,FEMALE TELEPHONE,"The details for the Commonwealth census have not yet been finally arranged, but a census must be taken in respect of the whole Commonwealth. I shall communicate with the Premier of New South Wales to ascertain if we can work together. ASSENT TO BILLS. Assent to the following Bills reported : War Census Bill. War Loan Bill (No. 1).

51,Mr SPEAKER,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"I have received anintimation from the honourable member for Macquarie that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public business, namely, "" the implied intention of theinad- Government to transfer the making of small arms from Lithgow to Canberra."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",8
52,Mr CARR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"Macquarie) [2.54] - I bring forward this"" question, firstly, because it is of very vital importance to the town of Lithgow, which I have the honour to represent; and, secondly, because I think, on national grounds, there is every justification for leaving the Small Arms Factory where it is and effecting any necessary extensions there, instead of incurring the enormous expense of transferring the whole plant and the men to' Canberra, in addition to installing any new plant that may arrive at the Federal Capital. Apart from the intrinsic merits of the proposition, to my mind the Public Works Committee, in the first place, and the Government, in the second place, have been guilty of tactlessness of the most extreme character in announcing at this particular juncture that it is intended to transfer the manufacture of small arms to Canberra. A f t e r considerable agitation and a great deal of trouble we have stimulated the Small Arms Factory to work a double shift. The assistance of the people of Lithgow has been a material factor in bringing about that result, and in many cases they have voluntarily suffered in convenience in order to accommodate the extra men now employed at the factory. The general impetus given to Lithgow by the establishment of the factory there was very great, and an additional impetus was given by the announced intention of the Government to increase the size and output of the establishment. The whole people were unanimous and happy in rendering all possible assistance to facilitate the output of arms in this time of national trouble. But suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, comes the proposal to shift the whole concern to Canberra. When the transfer is to take place is not stated in the report of the Public Works Committee, and when I put a question to the Prime Minister he replied that it was not intended to move the factoryI did not for a moment think it wasbut that a new building was to be erected in the Federal Capital area which would house the new machinery when it, arrived.",9
53,Mr GREGORY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,That is a misleading answer.,9
54,Mr CARR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"There is nothing satisfactory in it . Even were it advisable to remove the factory from Lithgow, it was distinctly unwise to announce the fact at this juncture, when the Government are asking for the unanimous co-operation of the people resident in the centre where the small arms are being manufactured, and who have ' been of material assistance in increasing the output. This new policy is announced without justification, and even if there were justification, the unwisdom of taking such a step now must be apparent to all. Already the town has stagnated, and whereas up t ill about a week ago, the Town Council was receiving applications for twenty building permits per week in order to accommodate the extra workmen, it is now receiving none. Those people who are temporarily housing the extra employees of the factory find that responsibility irksome and require further accommodation. Instead of providing them with that accommodation, we are imposing on them the burden of keeping those men, knowing all the while that in the course of time the factory is to be shifted. The folly of such an announcement is hard to assess. Even if it be necessary to remove the factory from Lithgow, knowing that the transfer cannot be effected for a couple of years, wby should the Government throw a pall over the town now ? We might as well have a German aeroplane hovering over L it h gow. The enthusiasm of the people has vanished; their aspirations are ended, and the heart has been taken out of the town. The lack of imagination on the part of the men who recommended this step is beyond my comprehension. We, as a party, were particularly careful in nominating to the Public Works Committee the cream of the party, men of judgment-me n who it was thought would not commit an error of this kind. So careful were we on this point that we declined to give the Opposition a full sh£re of representation, and insisted on having six members on the Committee to the Liberal party's three, because we desired to assure ourselves that what was done by the Committee would be sound. But what have they done? They have come forward with a scheme that cannot be carried into effect for two years, and by the announcement of which they are cutting across the grain of the efforts which the townspeople of Lithgow are making to meet the sudden demand for arms. They are suffering by this announcement of policy, and their properties have been depreciated by 50 per cent. What sort of imagination must the members of the Committee possess when they could put forward such a proposal? To-day there are weeping women in Lithgow because the prospects of their husbands are ruined. The whole proposal to my mind is an outrage, and represents a tactlessness that it would be hard to parallel. After all that has been done to get this factory going at Lithgow, this is the result. We are told by the Prime Minister that the factory cannot be moved-in fact thai it will not be moved-and the meaning of that can only be that the plant will be ultimately taken away. This, of course, is just as bad as if it were taken away At once. It is sufficient to damn the prospects at Lithgow, and a proposal of the kind is deserving of the severest censure. Not only is the contemplated action tactless, but the whole idea is entirely impracticable for various reasons. To quote the high-flown language of the limited report which the Public Works Committee has supplied, I say that, "" on broad national grounds "" it is unwise to (have this factory removed from where it is to the Federal Capital area. If it is not intended to move the factory as it stands, with the men and machinery, it is intended to have two factories, with two sets of overhead charges and other incidental expenses; and such an idea seems to me altogether too foolish, even for the Public Works Committee or the Government. It is suggested that the removal - of the factory will make no difference to Lithgow, where some other industry may ""be undertaken. But I say that it will make a difference to that town, because there is nothing that can be substituted for such a permanent undertaking, and the severing of personal interests cannot be atoned for. If there be a demand for some other kind of factory, let Canberra have it-let Canberra have the benefit of the new idea; it is not required in Lithgow, where there are many advantages for the manufacture of small arms not presented at the Federal Capital. I should like to quote some of the figures of the Public Works Committee to show how impractical their proposal is, and how ill-digested their report. And this is the committee which was appointed from the cream of our party to see that no errors of the kind were made! The Committee - say that for the extra land and buildings Mr Carr. at Lithgow, including power plant and so forth, the cost will run to £66,000, and that they can put up a building, with power plant, at Canberra for £92,100, with, twice the capacity of the present factory. 1 deny that that is so, and I shall tell honourable members why. To begin with, the £66,000, the estimated cost for the additions at Lithgow, includes £10,000 for additional power plant, while there is no allowance made in the £92,100 for a similar purpose. Why? Because there is already at Canberra a gigantic power plant with very little to do.",9
55,Mr KELLY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"But that plant at Canberra is just large enough for the efficient service of that place, and it would have to be added to for the purposes of a Small Arms Factory.",10
56,Mr CARR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"Whether that be so or not, the fact remains that in estimating the cost of a new factory, any sound business man, with an elementary knowledge of bookkeeping, would allow for the cost of a power plant. In order, however, to discredit the existing factory, the Public Works Committee, with their idea of concentrating all works in this Utopia they are dreaming about, leave out, as is customary with dreamers, the actual cost that must be faced, though they do not forget to include it when they speak of works at Lithgow. I suppose Canberra is going to be the'haven of officialdom; and the Public Works Committee have apparently accepted official ideas on the subject; in fact, the members of the Committee have simply been bulldozed. Further, the Lithgow estimate makes the assumption that 10 acres of ground will cost £300 per acre, that 50 acres will cost £250 an acre, or £12,500, and another 50 acres will have a similar price, making £28,000 in all. I am in a position to say, however, that I could get the necessary land at Lithgow for £10.000 or less. ' Mr SAMPSON - How many acres?",10
57,Mr CARR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"The acreage estimated here, namely, 110 acres, I would undertake to get for £10,000 while the Committees say it will cost £28,000. The value in my opinion, haa been intentionally inflated by the officials, who have not gone the proper way to work to ascertain how the land can be bought. If the Government, some years ago, had taken the advice of the honourable member for Darwin, - wheu he was a Minister, they would have adopted a cheap and effective scheme; hut, as is usual when a practical, common sense proposal is made, they turned the deaf ear, preferring to listen to officials who, of course, know everything. The idea of men, who claim to be business men asserting that similar land at Can| berra will cost only £ 5 5 0 ! to learn that land in the Federal Capital will be of less value than Lithgow land. At any rate, there is the potential value in the Federal area.",10
58,Mr MATHEWS,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,We can only get real value by placing works there.,11
59,Mr CARR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,Then let us place our new works there. Why destroy a flourishing town to build a fanciful capital? The proposal is open to the gravest possible objection.,11
60,Mr MATHEWS,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,They ought to take all the works from my electorate to the Federal Capital.,11
61,Mr CARR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"The honourable member talks very largely and easily, but if he looks into these matters he will see that they develop an entirely different aspect. In order to show the absurdity of the estimated cost at Canberra, let us consider what was the original cost of the Factory at Lithgow, exclusive of land and fittings. According to the original contract, the buildings at Lithgow cost £55,890, exclusive, as I say, of land and equipment. Since then-thoug h the report of the Committee takes no cognisance of this-some think like £10,000 has been spent on additions to the buildings, and, approximately, £10,000 on officers' dwellings!which are of the best in Lithgow, and may be described as palatial. A f t e r all this has been done, it is proposed to play fastand-loose with the interests of the town. If we add this £20,000 to the original cost, we find a total expenditure of £75,890. The two items' of £10,000 each are my own, but they are substantially correct. The Committee, however, did not take them into consideration, but only had regard to the original contract price. The Committee, in their report, go on to say that for the £92,100 at Canberra there will be provided a complete structure with twice the capacity of the present works. In order to obtain a fair test, we must deduct from that £92,100 the sums mentioned in schedules 2, 3, and 4 in appendix A of this report. These figures total £24,600, and include such items as moving the existing machinery to Canberra-showin g clearly what the idea is - wate r main at Canberra, railway, sewerage, and a number of smaller items. That total deducted from £92,100 gives us £67,500 as the estimated cost of new buildings at Canberra that are to have twice the capacity of the existing L it h gow factory. Is it likely that we can, I have yet for that .sum, put up at Canberra a building that will have twice the capacity of buildings that cost £75,890 in L it h gow ? Is that common sense ? Where in such a recommendation do we see the in the tuition of those gentlemen who were elected to the Public Works Committee because of their assumed superior ability in matters of this kind 1 The figures will not bear investigation. An y school boy knows that we cannot get at Canberra, an out-of-the-way place in the bush, for £67,500, twice as much as we have already had to pay at Lithgow £75,890"" for. The thing, on the face of it , is ridiculous. Cartage charges at Canberra would 1 be altogether disproportionate to what they were at Lithgow, and we have alsoto take into consideration the pace at which works are likely to be constructed at Canberra, all of which mean increased cost as compared with the Lithgow buildings that were constructed by contract.. The Federal Capital is more or less * haven for both officials and workmen. It ought to be better than most places, T admit, but I think I am fairly safe inassuming that, on this ground, the cost of the same buildings at Canberra would: be proportionately greater than at L it h gow. Labour difficulties have also to be* considered, and we have also to bear in mind there will be no educational and other facilities, all of which will tend to discourage men from going there. Men employed at the Small Arms Factory are for the most part trained men, of high intellectual order. They draw good wages, and they want educational facilities in order to give their children a chance in life, and they do not want to be taken away from all the conveniences of civilization. Added to this, we have to bear in mind that all the people who go there will be disfranchised. Before any recommendation was made by the Public Works Committee, all preliminaries of this sort should have been threshed out. There is no parliamentary representative there, and the body of officials who will live at the Federal Capital will be able to do just as they like. Por all these reasons, I say that the proposal is impractical, and its presentation means that the Committee has been doped-the Government has been doped, too, for that matterand has committed the unpardonable offence of presenting a hastily-drawn re- House. port calculated to seriously damage the town of Lithgow before our being in a position to do anything at all. If the Public Works Committee and the Government had been really keen and genuine on this question of extending the output of the Small Arms Factory, and equipping it with extra machinery, they could have done much by the use of facilities already at hand. I have on a previous occasion told the Government that there is at Randwick a plant capable of adding 100 per week to the output of small arms. Yet that plant has been idle for twelve months because of some dispute between Mr Balsillie, the Government wireless pert, and the owners of the place. I understand that Father Shaw is one of the principals; I do not know who is identified with him-but the position is as I have stated, nevertheless. The premises were offered to the Government for £45,000. Included in the offer was machinery which alone cost £75,000, some of it equal to anything we have in the Small Arms Factory; yet nothing has been done. I am told that we shall have to wait twenty months before we can obtain machinery, from Pratt, Whitney, and Company, in America.",11
62,Mr KELLY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"If they are as slow as they were in the first contract, the period will be much longer.",12
63,Mr CARR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"Then that makes the position all the more untenable. We are proposing to do something which we cannot possibly do for two years, and, in the meantime, we have damaged a flourishing community like that of Lithgow by this premature announcement. In my opinion it is a shame and disgrace that the machinery at Randwick should have been allowed to remain idle on account of some paltry dispute brought about by a gentleman who came out a discredited man, and who, I make bold to say, is a further discredited man because of his commendation regarding this plant. The Public Works Committee, and the Government, too, are discredited for permitting this machinery to remain idle, as they have done, when the cry is "" Arms for our men ""-whe n arms means lives saved at the front.",12

69,Mr CARR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"The machinery is adaptable for the manufacture of small arms. I have gone into the matter carefully, and I make bold to say that there is machinery in this factory that, if applied exto small arms purposes, would increase the output of rifles by approximately 100 per week.",12
70,Mr KELLY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,It is the same old talethey must have the exact machinery or they will have nothing.,12
71,Mr CARR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"Abl e engineers have advised me on this point, and, though I do not know much about machinery, still I can tell one machine from another.",12
72,Mr SAMPSON,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,Are these machines still idle?,12
73,Mr CARR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"They are, and have been for twelve months. We understand that output at the present moment is everything, and, while that is so, the Prime Minister is fiddling about, trying to settle a dispute between Mr Balsillie and.FatHer Shaw. What has that dispute to do with a critical situation like that before us? I say that Mr Balsillie has been the cause of more trouble than enough, in all the disputes he has got into in the infringement of patents and all sorts of things. I am not in a position to know definitely, but I can express the opinion that he is in the wrong in this particular matter, and that the owners of the factory are right; but that is beside the question. We want arms.. F'ratt, Whitney, and Company cannot supply plant for re- twenty months or two years. We have machinery in this country that can be adapted to the manufacture of arms, and yet this machinery has been ignored in a manner that amounts to criminal negligence, whilst the Public Works Committee is still dreaming about the Utopia at Canberra and bringing in a proposal that will only have the effect of disturbing all the carefully-prepared efforts that have been made to stimulate the output of rifles, and taking the heart out of the people. The Public Works Committee would have been much better occupied had it given attention to the housing of our soldiers, instead of making suggestions of this kind, which cannot take effect for some years. I draw attention to the injustice of what has been done. The Government Owes something to the town of Lithgow. Surely it is not a function of government to lift towns up, and then to drop them again. it is not the business of Governments to boost a township here, and another there, and then to withdraw all support, leaving the townsfolk to struggle as best they may, after they have spent their money in making accommodation for the works that the Government had established. This wanton action is as vicious as it is disastrous. The proposition that has been made has affected, not merely the original settlers in the town, but at least 200 of those who have gone there comparatively recently, and have invested in property there. The Committee puts down the number as only ninety-five. The value of the houses and property owned by these persons runs into many thousands of pounds, but the announcement that the Small Arms Factory was to be removed to Canberra has been as effective in depreciating the value of that property as the removal of the Factory would be. The townspeople have provided accommodation for the convenience of the 500 men who have been brought to Lithgow to work in the Factory, and should receive some better return than the wholesale depreciation of their town values. Confidence in the stability of the Factory has gone, and confidence in the stability of the Government is gone too, so far as Lithgow is concerned. Other towns will, no doubt, feel much as Lithgow feels, and wonder when the long arm of the Federal Government will be stretched forth to steal away what they have been giving, in order that this isolated refuge which the oflicials have made for themselves at Canberra, and which is going; to be made for workmen as well, may be fostered.",12
74,Mr SPEAKER,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,The honourable member's time has expired.,13
75,Mr KELLY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"Wentworth) [3.24] - I am glad that the honourable member for Macquarie has raised this question. I have not been able to find, either in the report of the Public Works Committee, or elsewhere, any justification of the step recommended. The honourable member has dealt faithfully with the main line3 of the recommendations of the Committee, but, to my mind, these recommendations are more to be deplored because of what is omitted than because of what is stated. The Committee speaks of the cost of building at Lithgow arid Canberra, the cost of land at the two places, and the cost of installing maSurely chinery at one place, without taking into account the cost of installing it at the other; but it has entirely overlooked the prime essentials that govern the considerations of business men when they locate a factory: these being, first, availability of raw materials, and, secondly, availability of labour. In regard to these essentials, it is proposed to go from a place which has them in part, to a place which is wholly without them. There is no steel at Canberra, no iron, and no coal. Every ton of coal that is used there must be brought there by train, and enormous freights must be paid for its transport. Similarly, every ton of steel that is used there will have to pay heavy railway carriage. Then, when the rifles have been made, it will be found that the freight from Canberra to the sea-coast is larger than that from L it h gow to the sea-coast. I do not say that Lithgow is an ideal site for the Small Arms Factory. Personally, I think that the Factory ought to have been established in a large centre of population, such as Sydney or Melbourne, but preferably Newcastle. But if you go away from such cities as those, I doubt whether you can get a much better place than L it h gow. You certainly have advantages there which do not exist at Canberra.",13

77,Mr KELLY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"So far as I can see, Canberra has no advantage for the successful manufacture of rifles. In a casual conversation with the Director-General of Public Works, I asked what he thought the cost of making rifles at Canberra would be. Of course he could not be expected to give an exact answer offhand, but, at least, the Committee should have gone into the matter. asked him what would be the additional cost with which every rifle made at Canter, berra would be loaded, and his reply that he did not know, but that he I thought that it would not be much. cost Would a business committee appointed to inquire into a business project overmanufacturing look such elementary considerations nected with the establishment of a factory I cannot see why this recommendation been made; but reading the Committee's report, I can see that its leg has been pulled. The Committee gives as one of its chief reasons for establishing a factory at Canberra the desire to settle a large population there. Are you going to take population from other Australian cities to build up a population for Canberra ? Is would be so? the Federal City to be a sort of cancer, to grow at the expense of every other Australian city ? Could anything be more absurd ! The Chairman of the Public Works Committee laughs.",13

Shell cases made here can be filled and inspected in England, and as to rifles, we can provide for their inspection 'here. It is a simple matter to improvize machinery for the manufacture of rifles. The rifles thus made will cost a little more, but the urgency of supply is a sufficient excuse. We shall not assist the conduct of the war one iota by starting a factory at Canberra, which the Minister says will be able, perhapsor he will be "" surprised "" if it is not-to turn out rifles eighteen months hence. It is about time the House and the country woke up to what is being proposed. The Government are proposing to remove the Small Arms Factory from a centre where iron is being produced from native ores, where there is already an unlimited coal supply, and the elements of all the materials of manufacture, to another site where we have at present no industrial population, and no raw material for the manufacture of rifles, and where the cost of manufacturing rifles in Australia will be loaded for all time. The proposal should be dropped. It is about time the people realized what is sought to be done, and that it is altogether wrong. I hope that the Government will not proceed with the proposition, and that, if on no other grounds, they will, at any rate, take time to consider the whole matter on the plea put forward by the representative of the district that the removal of the Factory will destroy the loyal co-operation of every person connected with the turning out of rifles at Lithgow afc the present time.",15

The only way to stop the damage that has been done, and which will be vastly increased, is to recede from the utterly untenable position which has been taken up' by the Government at the instance of the Public Works Committee.",15
99,Mr RILE Y,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"South Sydney) [3.37] I find no fault witli the action of the honourable member for Macquarie in bringing forward this matter, and doing his best for the district that he represents. I ndeed, I congratulate the electors of Macquarie upon having as their representative an honourable member who is so vigilant in its interests. The PubUc Works Comcosts mittee does not hold a brief for either Lithgow or Canberra. Our sole duty is to> determine from the evidence submitted to us what should be done. And what are the facts? Captain Clarkson, who was first manager of the Factory, has said that he did not think Lithgow was a suitable site for a Small Arms Factory, and he could not understand on what grounds it was selected.",15
100,Mr BURNS,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,What were his reasons for objecting to the site?,15
101,Mr RILEY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"Tim e will not permit of my giving them at this stage. Mr. Wright, the next manager of the Factory, who was brought from the United States of America, told the Committee that Lithgow was not a suitable site for a SmallArms Factory, and that had he been consulted, he would not have selected it , but that since the Factory had been established there, he would not shift it.",15
102,Mr GREGORY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,Captai n Clarkson said that as it was there he would not shift it.,15
103,Mr RILEY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"Hi s evidence was that it was a bad site, but since the Factory had been established, he would not have it removed.",15
104,Mr CARR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,I suppose it is also a bad site for an iron works!,15
105,Mr RILEY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"I shall have something to say in a moment as to the iron works. The new general manager, Mr Ratcliffe, who was also brought from America, gave evidence that Lithgow was totally unsuited for such a factory, and that he would never recommend the establishment of a Small Arms Pactory in a hollow between two hills, which is the situation of the Lithgow site. Here, then, we have the evidence of three of the most expert men in Australia in the manufacture of rifles that it was a mistake in the first place to erect the tory there. Tliat mistake was made before the appointment of the Public Works Committee, and prior to the selection of the site for the Federal Capital. In view of all these facts, the Public Works' Committee had to determine what was the best course to pursue. The honourable member for Wentworth has said, "" The Public Works Committee are proposing to remove the Pactory from the district where the raw material, in the shape of pig iron and steel, is manufactured, to a site where there is none."" Such a plea might carry some weight with those who are not acquainted with the actual facts. The truth is that not one ounce of locally manufactured steel has been used in the production of rifles at Lithgow. All the 6teel required for the manufacture of rifles has to be imported and carried from the seahoard by rail to Lithgow. So much for the first argument.",15
106,Mr WISE,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,Will it not have to be carried much further if the Factory be established at Canberra?,16
107,Mr RILEY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"No . The honourable member for Macquarie has laid great stress on the point that the removal of the Factory from Lithgow will greatly disturb and upset that town. No town in the Commonwealth owes more to the Federation. Lithgow, which, according to the honourable member, will be ruined if we remove this factory, has received, by way of bounties from this Parliament, no less than £180,000 to keep its iron works going, to say nothing of the benefit that it has derived from the employment of a large number of men in the Commonwealth Small Arms Factory there. The people of Lithgow have no reason to complain of their treatment at the hands of the Federal Government. The Public Works Committee must be guided by the evidence, and there is an overwhelming volume of evidence that Lithgow is not a suitable site for a Small Amis Pactory. If a mistake was made in establishing it there in the first place, surely we have no right to perpetuate that mistake by proposing to extend the Factory. An important consideration is that the making of additions to the Factory would interfere with its output. In order to duplicate it, one end of the Factory would have to be taken out and partitions put up. That would interfere with the work of the Factory at the present time. Fac- Then, again, a further proposal was that another story should be added to one part of the building, and that additions should be made to the front elevation. We could not make such alterations without upsetting the arrangement of the Factory.",16
108,Mr GARB,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,The making of additions need not have that effect.,16
109,Mr RILEY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"Thos e who have drawn t.he plans say that it would. If additions were made, then the power plant would also have to be increased. That, in itself, would be an expensive item. Turbines and additional boilers would have to be put in, and this work would also hamper the output of the Factory. The members of the Public Works Committee considered that they should endeavour, if possible, to devise a scheme whereby the output of rifles in Australia could be increased without any interference whatever with the present work of the Factory. The honourable member for Wentworth, cheered by the honourable member for Macquarie, said that there was railway communication between Sydney and Lithgow, and that all the material could be brought up at very little cost. The cost of building the Factory at Lithgow, however, was largely increased by reason of the. fact that tliere was-and there still is - n o railway communication with the site, so that the material had to be carted over very bad roads for a considerable distance. At Canberra, on the other hand, we have one site, amongst others, that is almost alongside the railway line. Material would not have to be carted half-a-mile from the railway to that site. Then, again, it is proposed that the Factory at Canberra shall be built of concrete, and in the bed of the river, quite close to one of the suggested sites, there is an unlimited supply of material for the making of concrete. That material will cost us nothing since it is in our own Territory. As one who is in the building line, and, therefore, knows a little about building, I venture to say that the making of additions to the present Factory would be very costly. Additions to a building are always tedious and difficult to carry out, whereas a new building may be erected without trouble. These are some of the reasons that have induced a majority of the Public Works Committee to recommend that the Factory be erected at Canberra. The honourable member for Macquarie has said that land can be purchased at Lithgow for £100 per acre.",16

This is entirely a new proposal. The majority of the members of the Committee decided ' ' that it is desirable to transfer the Commonwealth Small Arms Factory from Lithgow to Canberra, and that a building of double the capacity of the present factory be erected in the Federal Capital area."" Six members voted in favour of and three against that proposal. The minority were of opinion that the existing factory at Lithgow should be doubled in size. When the Committee's recommendation comes before the House, I hope to have an opportunity of explaining my own action in voting against the transfer of the Factory to Canberra. In my opinion, the weight of evidence presented to the Committee was in favour, not of removing the whole factory to Canberra, but of doubling the size of the existing establishment at Lithgow. Members of the Committee will agree with me that the question of allowing the present factory to continue to manufacture rifles at Lithgow, and at the same time to erect a separate factory at Canberra, is one that was not seriously considered by the Committee; at any rate, the records will show that no decision was given by the Committee on that particular issue. Now a new situation has arisen by the decision of the Cabinet to spread the manufacture of small arms over two factories of equal sise. The conduct of two separate factories must increase the overhead and administrative costs, and also the cost of the product. I desire, by an argument on purely business principles, to show that if the decision of the Cabinet is carried out it will involve the Commonwealth in an enormous expenditure which is entirely without justification.",18
135,Mr CABR,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,Do you think it was wise to make an announcement of the transfer at this stage?,18
136,Mr SAMPSON,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"I think the decision of the Cabinet was unwise. I do not propose to deal with the matter of the erection of workmen's^homes. It is possible to purchase land at Lithgow for the purpose of increasing the number of workmen's homes, in addition to the 100 houses or blocks of land which have already been purchased by the Factory [workmen at Lithgow. If a factory is established at Canberra, the land required I for workmen's dwellings will probably cost £ 1 per foot, or £ 5 0 or £60 per block. It is not a fair argument to say that land can be bought in Canberra for £ 4 10s. per acre, because the enormous expenditure there will mean that every workman who acquires a home will hie required to pay a ground rent that will probably be equal to the interest that would be paid, on the freehold value of land at Lithgow. However, I shall deal with that aspect of the matter when the Committee's report is under consideration. If the new plant which has been recommended by the Committee is in stalled in a separate factory of the same size as that existing at Lithgow, instead of being added to the plant in the present factory, and if it is desired to get from the second factory the same output as from the first, it will be necessary to incur an expenditure, based on that of the Lithgow establishment, of not less than £155,000. Mr Wright, in his report for the year 1913, said that the cost of buildings already erected at Lithgow was £55,890, and of plant £79,871.",18
137,Mr ARCHIBALD,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,Do you think that we have gained nothing by experience?,18
138,Mr SAMPSON,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"As a matter of fact, we shall have to pay more for plant now because the price is increased on account of the war, and, whilst the cost of the buildings was much in excess of the original estimate, I have yet to learn that it was excessive for buildings of that character. The power, heat, and lighting plant cost £1.2,966, office requisites, furniture and fittings £1,639, factory fittings and furniture £ 3 , 6 1 1 , and vehicles £1,038, making a total of ,£155,000 for the buildings and machinery, and excluding the cost of the land. We can duplicate the present building at Lithgow, and install the machinery that is on order, and which would double the output, at a total cost of £95,000.",18

140,Mr SAMPSON,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"Ninety-fiv e married Lithgow. men employed in the factory have erected tlieir own homes, or have arranged to erect them, and other land could be chased in Lithgow, the interest on which would not be greater than the ground rent that wili necessarily be charged on the holdings at Canberra. places the housing problem can be overcome without difficulty, but I am dealing exclusively with the factory.

143,Mr FINLAYSON,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,The evidence does entirely upon my memory. not bear out that statement.,19

Thus duplicate the output at Lithgow for a total expenditure of £95,000, which would represent a saving of about £60,000 on the probable cost of erecting a half-size factory at Canberra. I shall not touch on the question of a doublethe size factory at Canberra, but am confining my attention to what we understand to be the decision of the Cabinet to allow tke existing factory to remain at L it gow, erect a smaller factory at Canberra, for us to do? .and have the two establishments running simultaneously. Such a policy would be available. ruinous, and would mean the expenditure of £65,000 of public money without tification, and materially increase the cost of the production of rifles. I think the Minister should tell the House whether the Government intend to adopt the recommendation of the Committee-wit h which I disagree also-and so let honourable members have an opportunity of discussing the whole question; or whether the are we to Cabinet have decided to build a factory at Canberra similar in size to the one at I desire also to emphasize the point that if the Government are proposing to start a separate plant in Canpurberra the plant already ordered will be probably £50,000 or £60,000 short bf the plant that will be necessary in order to attain there an output of rifles similar to At both the present output at Lithgow.",19

There are proposalsto which, I think, the Leader of the Opposition is favourable-to still further in crease that output. Independently of war, it is essential that our trained troops in the future should be kept full y supplied with rifles, and to that end it has been thought necessary to have anh - other plant.

149,Mr ARCHIBALD,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"I do not think jusso. Is Canberra to be regarded simply as a picturesque spot in the wilderness, to be photographed and admired, or is it to be of some use and value to the Commonwealth? We are faced with the necessity of increasing our output of small arms, and I have heard no reason yet why there should not be erected a factory capable of doubling the present output, thus really making the production of rifles fourfold what it was some little time ago. There is the fact that at Canberra we have the necessary power, and it ought to be utilized. Further, I do not believe in dual control-in allowing a State authority to have anything, directly or indirectly, to do with works that are necessary in the Commonwealth-and any works erected at Canberra will, of course, be under our own exclusive authority. The question of the interests of particular districts should not be introduced into a matter of this kind. If such questions are to be introduced, then I may claim to have a grievance, because I think that the Small Arms Factory ought to have been in Hindmarsh. I am not a Canberra fanatic, and I do not for one moment suggest that every activity should be centred there, regardless of common-sense considerations.

173,Mr ARCHIBALD,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,The right person to apply to for the policy and intention of the Government is the Prime Minister. I am merely saying what is in my own mind; and it does not occur to me that two factories can be kept permanently going. Does the honourable member for Macquarie think that it is the intention of the Government to raffle the Factory at Lithgow ? Is there no other purpose to which that Factory could be put 1,21

175,Mr SPEAKER,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,The time of the Minister has expired.,21
176,Mr GREGORY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"Dampier) [4.19] - I have some sympathy with the Minister in being asked to discuss a question without having been given proper notice. At the same time. I think that, with the information we have, and which, I presume, was available to him, he should have been able to give a very definite answer to the question raised by the honourable member for Macquarie. To my mind, the answer given by the Prime Minister yesterday was quite misleading. I am strongly of opinion, and I am supported by the information before us, that the Department of Home Affairs is preparing plans for a factory which is going to house, not only the plant that has been ordered, but also the plant at the present time at Lithgow. As the Minister has said, it would be absurd to have two factories going; and if a straightforward answer had been given, the House would doubtless have been informed that it is the intention of the Government, as soon as it is necessary, to move the machinery from Lithgow to Canberra. I have no particular anxiety for the residents either of Lithgow or Canberra in dealing with this matter. To me the only question is as to what is best in the interests of the Commonwealth, and I can see not the slightest justification for the suggestion that the Small Arms Factory ' [201] should be removed. The site at Lithgow did not appeal to me at any time.",21
177,Mr SAMPSON,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"It is not the best, but it is a good one.",21
178,Mr GREGORY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"Captai n Clarkson, who also objected to it, pointed out in his evidence before the Public Works Committee that the site at Lithgow was so far away from any large centre of population that he thought that the labour difficulty would become acute. Had he had his way, Engineer Clarkson said, he would have established the Factory near Melbourne or Sydney. In answer to a question by myself, Captain Clarkson said he did not think it would be a good business proposition to move the Factory to Canberra, and he repeated that if he were to select a site he should look for one near a centre of population. If any change is to be made in the location of this Factory, according to the expert evidence, it should be to some site where the management would be able to get plenty of labour, and have a good choice of workmen. How are we going to improve the position from this point of view by going to Canberra? Lithgow already has a magnificent water supply, coal, gas, and other conveniences. We have iron and steel there, and I believe that if the requirements of the Small Arms Factory were sufficiently great, we should be able to get all the steel we require either from Lithgow or Newcastle. The same cannot be said of Canberra. The last balance-sheet issued in respect of the Factory's operations in 1913 showed a deficiency of about £190,000, after a heavy expenditure on machinery and stocks. We know, also, that there was a big initial loss, which might occur again at Canberra, and are we going to repeat that loss simply because somebody with a fad thinks we can use the Lithgow Factory for some other purpose than that to which it is now put? T agree with the member for the district in what he has said regarding the schedule that has been placed before us. In that it is suggested that a factory can be built at Canberra for less than the additions at Lithgow would cost. I say now, after giving full consideration to the statement. I ' am making, that I believe these statements were made either without proper care, or that they were deliberately misleading. Misleading statements were made in regard to the value of the land at Lithgow. It was pointed out in the evidence before the Public Works Committee, in the first place, that 10 acres of land at £300 an acre would be required.",21
179,Mr KING OMALLEY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,I thought it was room to be £150 an acre.,22
180,Mr GREGORY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,We were told that if we wanted this 10 acres we might have to pay £300 an acre. We were also told increase the output of rifles. that 50 acres would be required at £250 an acre.,22

184,Mr GREGORY,REMOVAL OF LITHOOW SMALL ARMS,"The honourable member knows perfectly well that it would be impossible to obtain 50 acres of land in Lithgow similar to that referred to without going out of the town, and I am quite certain that land could have obtained for £ 6 0 or £ 7 0 an acre. estimate of 50 acres of land at £250 an curred acre appeared twice in the schedule. No explanation was given to the Committee why this was done, and the duplication was not discovered unless one carefully perused the schedule.

Vide Ministers statement to Inter-State Conference, which is as follows:Statement Presented to Delegates from State Governments, Chambers of Manufactures, Chambers of Commerce, Universities. & c , at Conference held in Melbourne on Wednesday, 14t/i July, 1915. When the Commonwealth Munitions Committee was formed, it was asked to consider the following qiiestions:(1) The supply of material to Australian Government by Australian manufacturers. (2) Government manufacture of war materiel. (3) Contracts between War Office and Australian manufacturers. And in its investigation it was instructed to consult with sectional trade committees which might be formed, or with individuals. For the information and satisfaction of the delegates of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures and Commerce, States Governments, universities, &c, the following brief resume of the work of the. Commonwealth Munitions Committee is given:(1) The Supply of Material to Government by Australian Manufacturers. Large quantities of war materiel of Australian manufacture have been, and are still being, supplied to the Commonwealth Government for the equipment of the Expeditionary Forces. f2) Government Manufacture of War The Committee is collecting information for the preparation of a report on how best to increase the output from Government workshops of rifles, small arms, 18-pr. cartridges, cordite, & c , and what new factories should be erected for the manufacture of machine guns, tubes, fuses, & c , so as to render Australia independent of outside sources for the production of munitions of war, and the raw materials used in the manufacture thereof. (3) Contracts between War Office and Australian Manufacturers. The Associated Chambers of Manufactures bave been asked to supply a list of munitions of war (exclusive of shells and ammunition) which it considered its members could supply, and the Commonwealth Munitions Committee now awaits this information. Light rails, sleepers, and waggons, which the Committee was informed could be expeditiously supplied in large numbers, were offered to the British Munitions Department, but a cable reply was received yesterday (12th July), that the supply of these items in Britain exceeds requirements. When the report of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures is to hand, other items will be submitted to the Home Government with a view to securing contracts. As regards shell bodies, cartridges, & c for same, the manufacture of these could not be commenced until the Commonwealth Government had from the British Government some definite assurance that it wanted shells, inforriiation as to type of shell required, and whether Australian-made shells would be accepted. Because of the huge amount of work [201]- 2 entailed in the organization of the new Department, the British Munitions Department was unable to give early attention to repeated cabled' requests for information from Australia, but a reply has now been received that high explosive shell are required, and will be purchased at a price, and that full specifications and drawings have been sent, but until these arrive, the work of making shells cannot be proceeded with . Meantime, every preparation possible has been made: a specification of the steel to the correct formula has been issued, sample casts have been made by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and a sub-committee of experts is at present in Newcastle inspecting the processes of manufacture of the steel with a view to making physical and chemical tests. To commence, it is proposed to make forgings of shell bodies at two selected centres (preferably one in JTew South Wales, and the other in Victoria), to facilitate inspection, and for the same reason the number of firms asked to finish the first shell bodies will be limited u n t i l the best procedure of handling, manufacture, and inspection of shells has been discovered and approved, when provision will be made for the instruction and training of mechanics in the making Australian of shell bodies. In order to further facilitate this work and secure uniformity in all manufacturing centres, the Commonwealth Munitions Committee think it desirable that the various subcommittees in each State, comprising Government representatives, Chambers of ManufacMateriel. tures and Commerce, universities, labour organizations, and large engineering firms, &c, should amalgamate, forming what may be styled State Munitions Committees. The subcommittees in each State would be represented on, and would report to, the State Munitions Committee, which in turn would report to the Commonwealth Munitions Committee in Melbourne. All instructions, &c., from the Commonwealth Munitions Committee would be issued through the State Munitions Committees. Letters have already been addressed to the Premiers of each State suggesting the above amalgamation. I propose to this Conference that each State Committee should be asked to nominate a member to represent that State on the Central Munitions Committee. Co-operation of various educational bodies and large engineering firms is desired in the matter of selecting suitable inspectors for shell. Gauges for high explosive shell are now being made, and, as soon as tested and approved, the necessary number will be completed. Twenty-five provisional drawings of high explosive shell will be issued immediately. Provisional specification for manufacturing is now being compiled, and instructions for, and duties of, inspectors have been almost completed, so that until drawings and specifications and the forged blanks are available, much further advance cannot be made. It is, however, recommended that intending manufacturers of shell bodies should select and prepare such existing lathes and grinding machines as they may have available in their shops, so that no time may be lost when the forgings are ready for them. Shops will be inspected as soon as reported as suitable manufacturing shell, but the Commonwealth Munitions Committee desire to draw attention to the repeated warnings in cablegrams from the High Commissioner that many difficulties are encountered in the of shell bodies, and that the percentage of rejections have in the early stages of manufacture been extraordinarily high. For purpose of conducting experiments, the sum of £2,000 has been approved by the Minister on found the recommendation of the Commonwealth tion Board, Munitions Committee. Attention is also called to the demand for the following items:Binoculars, Field wireless sets, Telephone equipment, Magnetic compasses, Prismatic compasses, Table knives, Clasp knives, Signalling electric lamps, Cable (various), and samples of these will be made available for the inspection of the Associated of Manufactures at the earliest possible moment. .Toluene - The manufacture of toluene from gas tar is being investigated for the purpose of export to Britain, and the Commonwealth Munitions Committee is hopeful of securing satisfactory supplies.

212,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Bass-Minister for the Navy) [4.38] - That is a very difficult question for a Minister to answer, as it depends upon the extent of the injury and the state of incapacity. If a soldier is only partially incapacitated, he will, in all probability, be able to earn a certain amount of money.",26
213,Mr JH CATTS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I mean, what allowance is made while he is wounded and under hospital treatment?",26
214,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"A soldier gets his full pay until he is discharged. He is, bf course, in receipt of pay while in hospital at Alexandria, on board ship, or in hospital in Australia.",26
215,Mr RILEY,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"South Sydney) [4.40]. - I would like to hear an explanation from the Minister in connection with a case in my own district.

216,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The honourable member can discuss that case under clause 12, which deals with the amendment of section 8 of the principal Act.",26
217,Mr MCGRATH,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Ballarat) [4.41] - I do not know whether we can discuss under clause 12 the matter discussed by the Defence honourable member for South Sydney, but it is one of very considerable importance. I know of a case in which the circumstances are similar.",26
218,The CHAIRMAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The honourable member will not be in order in discussing it on this clause; he will have an opportunity later on.,26
219,Mr MCGRATH,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The case I have in my mind is that of a mother who has two lads at the front. One has been killed, and the other is still serving. The father is unable to work, and yet the mother cannot claim that she is wholly dependent on one of the sons, as both were contributing towards her support. I think the amendment circulated by the honourable member for Richmond might meet this case; but we ought to get a declaration from the Minister in charge of the Bill. It will be foolish to pass the Bill without provision to meet cases of this description. I fear we are going to be landed in endless trouble because of the manner in which the Defence Department have been circulating statements regarding the pensions to be paid. In one poster, signed "" George Pearce, Minister of Defence,"" it is stated that dependants of a lieutenant will receive £90 a year as a pension, but I know of two cases in my constituency in which one lady receives £65 a year and another £54 a year. Naturally, these people feel that they are not being justly treated. The circular should never have been issued, because it is misleading. Those people, of course, were under the impression that they would get that amount of pension, but when one of them made a declaration the other day, she was quietly informed that, as she was the widow of a deceased clergyman, and in receint of a pension from lhat source, she could not get the amount stipulated in the departmental statement.",26

I do not know whether the M in ister has received the information which I sought from him yesterday as to the pensions paid in Great Britain , New Zealand, or Canada, compared with those paid in Australia. It is a well-known fact in connection with the old-age pensions that the Minister is sometimes appealed to, and I would like to see something of that kind included in this Bill .",27
226,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Bass-Minister for the Navy) [4.46] - It is provided in sub-clause 4There shall be a Commissioner of Pensions, who shall, subject to the control of the Minister, have the general administration of this Act. Therefore, that matter will be under the control of the Minister.",27
227,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Darling Downs) [4.47]. - The position will be the same as under the Old-age Pensions Act. clause quoted by the Minister places the Ministerial responsibility in this House for the administration of the Act upon the Minister. This might mean the Treasurer, or other Minister in charge of the administration of the Act. This power coincides with section 5 of the In valid and Old-age Pensions Act, which statesThere shall be a Commissioner of Pensions, who shall, subject to the control of the Minister, have the general administration of this Act. The Minister will be in the same position. He will not be able, under this Bill , auy more than under the Act 1I have mentioned, to act contrary to the provisions of the law. It will be his duty to see that the law is carried out, just, as the Minister today sees that the old-age pensions law is carried out. At the present time all war pension recommendations have to be submitted to the Minister for his approval. I think that the system will work well, because responsibility for the administration of the law will rest with the Minister, who will see that its provisions are observed. In the interests of the claimants themselves, definite rules of law must be laid down, and the Committee is now engaged in laying down such rules. The registrars will take evidence respecting claims, and forward it to the Deputy Commissioner of their State, who will consider it , and give By his decision on the case, and an anneal fro m his decision will lie to the central authority.

228,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Richmond) [4.52] - I move That the following new sub-section be added:"" (3) In assessing the rate of pension due to a dependant the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner shall assess it at a rate not less than the amount contributed by the member for the support of the dependant during the period of twelve months prior to his death or being incapacitated : provided such - assessment shall not exceed the amount specified in column two of the schedule opposite to the rate of pay of the member."" I hope that the Government will accent The sub- the amendment, or something like it . When speaking on the second reading. I indicated what was in my mind in regard to this matter, and the case cited this afternoon by the honourable member for Ballarat is an example of the sort of case in regard to which I think a definite rule sbould be laid down for the guidance of those who are to administer the law. The widow of a clergyman of the Church of England, who is in receipt of £ 2 6 a vear from church funds, has lost at the front a son who was a first lieutenant. The Act provides that the maximum pension pavable to the dependant of a first lieutenant shall be £ 9 1 per year, but the Pensions Board, in dealing with the case, apparently argued that the intention of Parliament was that £ 9 1 a year was the maximum income that should be assured to a pensioner, and, tlierefore, allowed to this widow only £ 6 5 a year, which, with the £ 2 6 that she receives from another source, makes up £ 9 1 . In my opinion, it was not the intention of Parliament that pensions should be allotted in that way. What was intended was that dependants should be paid for the loss of the breadwinner the full amount of compensation set down in the I desire, therefore, that it be enacted that if a person can show that for twelve months prior to the death or incapacitation of a soldier, he or she was dependent on him, the Commissioners shall assess the pension at an amount not less than the support contributed, so long as that amount does not exceed the maximum pension provided in the schedule.  sions definitely ?",27
229,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I am not opposed to that being done. Under my amendment, if a person could show that during the twelve months preceding the death or in capacitation of a soldier, he or she ceived £100 from him by way of mainwere tenance, the full pension of £ 9 1 be given.",28
230,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"If a sister had been reof "" dependant."" ceiving as a g if t £150 a> year f r o brother killed at the front, would she be entitled to a pension ?",28
231,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I do not think that that is a case in point, unless the sister was dependent on her brother, and it should be easy to establish dependency. In most cases, the amount that is given by way of support is paid regularly, weekly or fortnightly, and the amount of a pension should not be reduced by the amount of any other income that the deis pendant may have.",28
232,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Many brothers give allowances to their sisters. Would such sisters be dependants?,28
233,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The Deputy Commissioners would be guided in their decisions by the evidence in each case. The word "" dependant"" is defined in the Act, and my amendment would not have any force except in regard to those who proved that they were dependants. If the claimant had been receiving gifts only, and was not a dependant, he or she would not be entitled to a pension. I am confident that honourable members do not desire that the War Pensions Act should be administered on the lines on which the Old age Pensions A ct is administered. Parliament has decided that no person wna has an income of £ 1 a week shall receive an old-age pension. If a person has. an income of £ 2 6 a year, the old-age pension may be £ 2 6 ; if the income is £3U the pension may be £ 2 2 , and so on, the principle being the greater the income Act. the less the pension. In regard to war pensions, however, the full amount stated in the schedule should be paid to all persons who prove that during the twelve mouths preceding the death or incapacitation of a soldier they were dependent on him.",28
234,Mr MCGRATH,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Ballarat) [5.2] - I trust that the Minister will accept the. amendment. It seems to me to be an. eminently reasonable one. In the case I cited,.the mother is no better off because of assistance that she receives from a church f u n d than if she had no> assistance at all , and it was not anticipated by Parliament that the War Pen- sions Board would take into consideration rethe fact that the dependants of soldiers drawing small pensions from otherwould sources. The amendment does not in crease the number of persons entitled to pensions, and does not alter the definition In my opinion it m a merely secures to dependants what Parliament in the first instance decided that they should get, that is. the full pensionset out in the schedule. I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that in a poster and advertisement issued by the Department, bearing his signature, it is stated that the dependants of lieutenants killed at the war are entitled to a pension of £ 9 1 a year. This statement will cause a lot of trouble, because the fact that it is only the dependants of a first lieutenant who are entitled to a pensionat that rate, the pension for the dependant of a second lieutenant being only £ 7 7 10s. Nothing is said in the advertisement of two rates of pensions for the dependants of lieutenants, and many persons do not know that there are first and second lieutenants. Two or three cases, in addition to those T have mentioned, have been brought under my notice, where pensions less than those advertised are being paid, and are quite in accordance with the Act. I am complaining, not of the amount that is being paid; but of the misleading advertisements published by the Defence Department as to the pensions actually payable. If the Government wish to avoid trouble, they should withdraw these advertisements, and publish others which will show the actual position. I am quite in accord with the amendment. I do not believe that the mother of a man who has been killed at the front should be awarded less than the full amount of the pension to which his position entitled her merely because she happens to be drawing a small pension or allowance from some other source. Why, for in stance, should the widow of a clergyman, who is receiving a small allowance from the deceased clergy f u n d , receive a smaller pension on the death of her son than is given to the dependant of another man who is not in receipt of such an allowance? Surely it was not intended that the mother of a deceased lieutenant should receive a pension of only £ 5 4 instead of the full pension of £91 per annum, because she is drawing a small allowance from some other fund .",28
235,Mr WEST,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Fro m what other f u n d is she obtaining this allowance?,29
236,Mr MCGRATH,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"In one of these cases I am told that the lady is the widow of a clergyman, and is drawing a small allowance from a deceased clergy f u n d . I have heard honourable members of Parliament read from public platforms advertisements published by the Defence Department, setting out pension rates which now prove to be incorrect. I am sure honourable members on both sides desire that justice shall be done to those who have allowed their sons to go to the front. Surely their financial position today should not be allowed to be worse than it was prior to the enlistment of their sons. It is our duty to see that they suffer no financial loss by reason of the death of those on whom they were dependent. I hope the amendment will receive favourable consideration.",29
237,The CHAIRMAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The honourable member for Fawkner has intimated that he desires to move a prior amendment.,29
238,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I am prepared to allow my amendment to be temporarily withdrawn. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",29
239,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Fawkner) [5.10] - It is with regret that I have to say that some of those who have gone to the fron t did not make provision for their mothers to receive out of their pay the amounts to which they were properly entitled, and I fear that, under the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Richmond, a grave injustice might be done to the parents of such men. Sub-clause c of proposed new clause 5A provides that each Deputy Commissioner shall be charged with the duty ofassessing the rates of pensions of members of the Forces and their dependants, and determining the dates of the commencement of such pensions. I move as an amendment That the following words be added:-""pro viding that such assessment shall not be less than £52 per annum."" If my amendment be carried, it will be provided in the Bill itself that the amount of the assessment of a pension shall not be less than £ 5 2 per annum.",29
240,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The honourable member's amendment would apply to the case of a man who had been only slightly injured as well as to the man who had lost his life. Many men might be only slightly injured, and entitled therefore to a pension of only £ 1 0 or £ 1 5 a year.",29
241,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"My chief object is to insure as a right the payment of a pension of not less than £ 5 2 per annum, where a soldier has lost his life, or has been totally incapacitated. As the law stands at present, the dependants of a man who has lost his life have to plead poverty, so to speak, before they can secure a pension.",29
242,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"They have not to plead poverty. Where a pension is claimed on the ground of total or partial incapacity a doctor's certificate as to the in j u ry received must be produced, and to that certificate great weight is attached in determining the amount of pension. Each case is dealt with equitably.",29
243,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The production of proof of injury or death has nothing ever to do with the financial position the claimant. Under the principal Act, inserted. even as amended by the Bill as it stands, the father or mother of a man who has been killed at the front will have to before the Commissioner and plead straitened circumstances in order to secure a pension. The parents of a young man who have allowed him to go to the front should be able to claim a pension least £1 per week if he falls. They should be able to claim it as a right, and not merely because they are in straitened circumstances.",30
244,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Would the honourable member allow them to claim it irrespective of their financial position ?,30
245,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Yes . The financial able service. position of the parents of fully 90 per cent, of those who have gone to the front would not put them above the claiming Bill. of this pension.",30
246,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"If the mother or father of a man who had fallen were well off, would the honourable member allow that mother or father to receive a pension not less than £52 per annum ?",30
247,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I would rather allow the small percentage of persons so ated to draw such a pension as a right than require others less fortunately placed to claim it as charity. Unless amendment be made, men and women deserving well of their country, because of the services rendered by their sons, who have fallen in defence of the Emwent pire, will have to appear before the missioner, and, in all humility, their poverty in order to obtain a pension. I maintain that these pensions should be claimable as a right-as a reward for services rendered. In endorsing the marks made this afternoon by the honhave orable member for Ballarat, I must say that the posters and advertisements pubpoverty lished as to the rates of pensions have misled a number of those who have gone to the front. Many have gone to thp front, believing that should they be inpleading jured, they will be entitled to a vides for that. pension in proportion to the pay they receive, and apart altogether from their financial position in life. The position of the wives and children soldiers who have been killed or totally pendent. incapacitated is clearly defined in this Bill, but the doubt in the Act, and in these amendments, is in regard to the whatparents of soldiers.

I was sorry to hear the Minister state yesterday that a pension would be granted because the applicant was needy. I think a pension should be granted as a right, and not because the claimant is in need of it. Ts a man who has been injured expected to plead that he is a. pauper before he can receive his pension? A soldier who has been totally incapacitated is entitled to a pension of £52 per annum, but am I to understand that the soldier must prove that he needs the pension before he can draw it?",31
257,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,I think I was discussing dependants when I made the remark to which the honourable member refers.,31
258,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The Minister stated that if a pensioner was convicted, and sent to prison, he was being maintained by the State, and, consequently, he was not entitled to draw his pension during the term of incarceration, because that would be equivalent to a second maintenance. The inference was that the pension was given only to persons who needed it.",31
259,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,That remark related only to dependants.,31
260,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"If the Minister had a son who had been injured at the war, would that son be deprived of his pension because his father was in a position to maintain him?",31
261,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I have never suggested such a thing. I replied to the honourable member for Batman yesterday that a pension was to bo given to a man for injuries received, irrespective of his class.",31

269,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Dependant s are entitled to a pension now, provided they prove they are dependants. Why sliould they not prove that?",31
270,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,But we have been told of cases where a certain portion of the pension has been deducted because of the fact that the recipients were in receipt of some other allowance.,31
271,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,That is according to the principal Act.,31
272,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"This is an amending Bill, and I am in favour of altering the Act in this respect. It appears, from what we have heard this afternoon, that if it can be shown that a dependant is in receipt of some other pension or allowance, his pension under the War Pensions Act is reduced to that extent.",31
273,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,That is so.,31
274,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"There is quite a number of honourable members who think that it should not be so; at any rate, the principle is not applied under the Maternity Allowance Act, by which a mother, irrespective of her position, is entitled to £5.",31
275,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The principle that the honourable member is advocating is not applied in the case of old-age pensions.,31
276,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Personally, I have always advocated its application to oldallowance. age pensions. I suggest that the honourable member for Fawkner should withdependants draw his amendment, and allow me to move one which will go as far as he sires, and further. The case has been cited of a woman who receives a pension of £26 from some church fund or other. tion. I take it that if that woman were to give up that allowance she would be entitled to claim the full penwhole sion under the War Pensions Act. At present a dependant can get a penschedule. sion only when it is proved that he or she is a dependant, and the amendment I suggest, although it would increase the paid. amount paid, would not increase the number of dependants. A father, for instance, in fairly good circumstances is not titled to claim under the Act, but if children ? within five years he can show that he requires the services and support of his son who has been killed at the front, he as the wife. is entitled to claim. Then there is the other case of parents who are in poor instance, circumstances today, but who in five years' time may have had some good forpendent on that son. tune, and be independent of such assistance as the Act affords. Is there anything in this Bill to say that the pensions shall then cease?",32
277,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Such parents then cease to be dependants.,32
278,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Is there any provision for such cases? Have those people come forward every year and declare that they are paupers ?,32

280,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"That covers some the objections I have raised, but I submit that the Act is not based on a legitimate riglit, but upon practically charity. Many of the men who are gohave ing to the front are, in my opinion, too young; and this means practically that those who become dependent are mainly fathers and mothers. Wives and chilis dren are entitled to the pension in any case; and it would not mean money to carry out the suggestion I have made, and so assert what I regard as sound principle.

288,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"That is so; but I do not wish, it to be incumbent on mothers to have to declare that they are paupers before they are given pensions. The very fact that she is the mother of the man killed ought to entitle a woman to a pension, if, of course, the deceased man has to neither wife nor child.",32
289,Mr WEST,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"If , unfortunately, the honourable member's son were to lose his life, I am sure that the honourable memwould not like his wife to take a penof £52 a year for the rest of her life. That is the position the honourable memof ber is putting to the Committee.",32
290,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Not at all. I do not say that every woman should take a pena sion; but if, under the circumstances I indicated, a woman asks for one, she is entitled to get it without answering all the questions that have been drawn up. As I say, the only question to be decided whether she is the mother of the deceased man, and, if she is, she ought to much more be entitled to a pension.",32
291,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Richmond) [5.501 - I a am inclined to think that an amendment on the lines suggested by the honourable enmember for Barrier would go a good deal and further than either the honourable member the Committee would desire. I underhis stand the honourable member wishes the pension to become practically an inalienable right attached to enlistment,32
292,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Unde r the voluntary system it ought to be.,33
293,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,To be legally inherited by any person who is a dependant.,33
294,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"So it ought to be. While a big majority of our people have cold feet, these who have gone to the front should have a fair and square deal.",33
295,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"As far as I can make out, the honourable member desires that the next of kin shall be legally entitled, on the death of a member of the Expeditionary Eorces, to draw whatever pension appeai-s in the schedule opposite the actual amount of his remuneration while a member of the Forces. The honourable member for Pawkner argued on somewhat similar lines, with the difference that he would l i m it the pension to a certain sum.",33
296,Mr WEST,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,To not less than a certain sum !,33
297,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"That is so. I am inclined to think that if the Act ""were amended in accordance with the ideas of those two honourable members, it would go further than the Committee would desire, and further than the country's resources would warrant. Whilst I contend most emphatically that those who are dependent upon the pension due on the death of a member of the Expeditionary Forces are entitled to the whole of the pension, whatever it may be- I think that was the intention of the original Act-ye t to say that this pension shall be an inalienable right, passing naturally to the next of kin of a deceased soldier, irrespective of his or her position in life, is to determine upon a pension bill that w i ll be simply staggering. It is unfortunately true that a large number of those who have already gone to the front have sacrificed their lives, and, as far as we can see, the war is not yet nearly at an end. The number of troops required at the front will be very great; and whilst we ought to treat those who go with the utmost liberality that our finances will permit, the Committee should hesitate a long time before committing it self to the payment of pensions as a legal right possessed by the next of k in .",33
298,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The main Act Refines whom the dependants are.,33
299,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,But the honourable member wants to go a good deal further than the original Act .,33
300,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,He said the pensions should be paid as a matter of right.,33
301,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,To those who are defined as dependants.,33
302,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,How can a mother and father be dependants if they are well off ?,33
303,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"What the honourable member for Barrier was contending for was that it should not be incumbent upon these persons to prove that they were dependants-that all that they must do was to say, "" I am the mother,"" or '' I am the father,"" and receive the pension.",33
304,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Decidedl y !,33
305,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"But we must go further than that. We must know that they are dependants before they receive a pension, so that there must be an investigation. T do not think that it is possible to go as far as the honourable member for Barrier desires, and in my view it is absolutely necessary that we should lay down the principle that, as the pension is to be payable to dependants and dependants only, they must prove the extent of their dependence before some sort of inquiring tribunal .",33
306,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The cost of an investigation would be as much as the amountof the pension.,33
307,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I doubt if it would be any more costly than the investigation new made under the Old-age Pensions Act. But we ought to insist upon dependence being established. Having done that, then those who are entitled should receiv* tlieir full pensions under the schedule.",33
308,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,That is all I am asking for.,33
309,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I think the honourable member went a good deal further than that. I thought that the Government might hesitate before committing themselves even to that extent, and, consequently, I framed my amendment on the lines that, provided a person could show definitely that for twelve months he or she had been in receipt of an amount of money from the member of the Force either equal to the amount of the pension or exceeding it , the assessment of the pension should not be less than the pension specified in the schedule.",33
310,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The widow of a deceased soldier has not to prove her dependence. She has simply to prove relationship.,33
311,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Exactly .,33
312,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I want the same principle to be applied to the mother and father, always providing that the pension shall not be less than £52 per annum.",33
313,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"It seems to me that if we are to go on these lines we cannot very well lay down that the minimum shall be £52. In my view, the minimum should be that stated on the schedule itself.",34
314,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The wife of a soldier is his dependant. The father and the mother may not be.,34
315,Mr WISE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The wife and children may not be dependants; they may have an independent income.,34
316,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The honourable member for Gippsland has touched upon a point I was going to bring forward. I understand that when a widow proves that she is the widow of a deceased soldier, she will get her pension, but I understand the Pensions Board has made inquiries as to whether a widow has been in receipt of a private income.",34
317,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,That inquiry is provided for under the Act.,34
318,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"That is the whole point for which I am now contending. What is suggested is that, notwithstanding that a widow may be in receipt of a private income, if she can show that she was in receipt of a contribution towards her support equal to or exceeding the actual rate of a pension specified in the schedule from a member of the Force, then the Commissioner should be prohibited from assessing her pension at a less amount than that specified in the schedule. To that I heartily subscribe.",34
319,Mr WEST,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"East Sydney) [6.1] - I hope the House will insert in this measure some definite regulation regarding the payment of pensions, and not leave the amount at the discretion of the Commissioner. I take it that the widow of any member of the Force killed at the war is entitled to her pension as a widow, spective of what private income she may be in receipt of. Similar provision, I understand, is made for children. They arc entitled to their pensions owing to their being the children of a soldier killed on active service. On that point, the Act seems to be clear. I also see nothing in the Act that gives the Commissioner, or any other person, power to alter the sum payable to a soldier who is totally incapacitated.",34
320,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,But they are altering them.,34
321,Mr WEST,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Then , in my opinion, they are going outside their powers. In the matter of the dependants, however, the position is different. Assuming that 1 had a son killed at the war, under the scheme suggested by the honourable member for Barrier my wife would be able to claim £52 a year for the rest of her life because my son is killed. I do not think it was the intention of the Government that this should be so.",34
322,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,It is not the intention of the Government; you are quite right there.,34
323,Mr WEST,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"In the case of a parent who was dependent upon the son prior to his going to the war, the pension should be paid, and I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner that no pension in such circumstances should be less than £52 a year. It was never intended that pensions should be provided for all persons who might lay claim to any sort of dependence, but I think consideration might be extended to any dependants who are really suffering. I am sure that it was not intended that, because the honourable member for Barrier and myself have sons at the war, our wives, should those sons be killed or totally incapacitated, should draw war pensions for the rest of their lives. That, however, seems to be the proposal of the honourable member for Fawkner. Certainly, the dependants of those who are killed or incapacitated should receive assistance, and the amount paid to them should be at least £52 per year.",34
324,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Bass-Minister for the Navy) [6.7] - I hope that the Committee will not support the amendment of the honourable member for Fawkner, which if agreed to would entirely alter the principle of the Act. The effect of the amendment would be so serious that the irre- Government sbould have had notice of the intention to move it , so that Ministers might consider whether they are in a position to increase the pension expenditure in the manner proposed. A large sum of money is involved.",34
325,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Does the proposal involve anything that is unjust?,34
326,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"There are many things which Parliament cannot provide for although they may be just. What I understand the honourable member for Fawkner to propose is that the parents of any soldier who may be killed or in capacitated shall be entitled as of right to a pension of not less than £ 5 2 per year each. It must be remembered that a soldier may leave a large number of dependants. The persons who may be dependants are the members of a family who comprise the wife, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, step-father, step-mother, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, step-son, step-daughter, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, adopted child and mother-in-law. But neither the father nor the mother of a soldier who falls may have been dependent upon him.",34
327,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The wife may not be a dependant.,35
328,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The Act provides that the wife may receive a pension.,35
329,Mr MCGRAITH,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Sh e has to fill in form.,35
330,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Yes , but she has a claim to a pension as of right. The conthe tention of the honourable member for Fawkner is that no parent should be comliable pelled to claim a pension by way of charity. He says that if a mother has lost her son at the front, she is entitled as of right to a pension, without making any declaration of dependence.",35
331,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Sh e sliould obliged to plead poverty in support her claim.,35
332,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"If we are going to pensions to every father and mother whose sons fall in the war, we shall involved in an immense annual expendiand ture on pensions.",35
333,Mr MCGRATH,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,We cannot help that.,35
334,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The soldier who falls sheds his blood in the service of the country. He foots the bill , and we have to find the money. Ours is an easier sacrifice than his.",35
335,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"We are intrusted with the care of the public purse, and the question we have to consider is whether we should provide for the giving of 'sions to persons not actually in need of them. The Act provides fairly well for widows and children of fallen soldiers, and those arrangements in regard to them are not being interfered with, exthing, cept to the extent of further protecting the children of a fallen soldier whose widow may die and leave them to the care of some one else.",35
336,Mr MCGRATH,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,What about the amendment of the honourable member for Richmond 1,35
337,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I shall consult the At torney-General regarding it , and if he sees no objection to its acceptance, I shall offer no opposition to it I have only to add that the Act now provides that, should a father or mother, within five years of the death of a soldier son. fail into a position in which, had the son been alive, they would have been dependent on him for support, they may he given a pension.",35
338,Mr WISE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Gippsland) [6.17] - I do not see why we should not amend the principal Act if in any particular it has been passed without sufficiently careful consideration. The Minister seems to think that wives and children are entitled to pensions as of right, but, in my a opinion, they, just as other persons, are required to prove their dependency on ths fallen soldier. Section 3 says that upon death or incapacity of any member o' the Forces, the Commonwealth shall be to pay to him or to his dependants, or to both, pensions at the rates set out in the schedule. Dependants are defined as such members of the family of the soldier as were wholly or in part dependent on his earnings at the time of his not be death, and members of the family is of elude, among others, wife, son, and daughter. Pensions are payable only vo pay dependants. Dependants are members of the family of the soldier who were wholly be or in part dependent on his earnings, include wife, son, and daughter. Section 8 says that the rates of pension shall be so much to a widow, so much '-o a child, and so much to other dependants. Really a wife or child is entitled to a pension only if a dependant, and i * they apply for a pension are liable to the same questioning as any other applicant In my opinion, this is a humiliating position in which to put them. I take che view of the honourable member for Fawkner as to the sacrifices made by our pensoldiers. I think that we do not value the sacrifice of life as highly as we should value it . The honourable mrmber says that the soldiers who fall give their lives to the country. That is, they give everyand all we are asked to do is t i foot the bill. We, for our part, should be only too thankful that we are left to foot the bill . The best that we may do will never make up for the loss of the man who has gone.",35
339,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Darling Downs) [6.20]. - There is some force in the point raised by the honourable member for Gippsland, and it would be well for the Minister to consult the Attorney-General upon it , as weil as in regard to the other matters mentioned by him. I fail to see why the Government should not accep*t the amendment moved by the honourable member for Richmond. It was the intention of Parliament, when passing the original measure, that the dependant of a soldier killed or incapacitated while on active service, should receive a pension equal to the amount of support which the deceased was contributing, but limited, of course, by the amount fixed in the schedule. The Leader of the Opposition, however, pointed out yesterday that this intention was not being carried out. He cited the case of a soldier killed at the front, whose widowed mother was not receiving, by way of pension, a sum equal to the amount which he was contributing towards her support prior to his death. The payment to her was less than the full pension rate allotted to a man of his rank. The honourable member for Richmond's amendment would get over that difficulty, inasmuch as by its adoption we should declare in the Bill itself that the Commissioner, in assessing the payment to be made to a dependant, should fix it at a rate not less than the amount contributed for twelve months prior to death or incapacity, provided that it did not exceed the scale in the schedule. I do not think that this would involve an excessive appropriation. It would certainly carry out what is the evident wish of the Committee, and the Minister should have no hesitation in accepting it.  [6.22] - I do not agree with the proposal before. made by the honourable member for Fawkner and the honourable member for Barfather rier, inasmuch as in adopting it we should be absolutely in the dark as to what its effect was likely to be. We are asked to agree to the making of a payment which we cannot compute, and which might ingoes volve the country in an altogether unreathe sonable expenditure. If we knew how many were likely to come under the proposal, the position would be different, but I am not prepared to vote in the slark. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Richmond is a reasonable one, and goes quite as far as honourable members generally, in my opinion, are prepared to go. The honourable member for Barrier asks that the relatives or next of kin of any man killed or totally incapacitated at the front shall receive the full amount payable by way of pension under the schedule to the principal Act, whether that next of kin is or is not a dependant. If that were provided, a difficulty might arise. Very many of those who are going, or have gone, to the front have no dependants, and many prior to enlisting were dependent upon those whom they have left behind.",36
340,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"In many cases, under the honourable member for Barrier's proposal, the pension would go to a father who was well off.  doubtedly. I know of several young fellows who have gone to the front, and who have never contributed, and have never been asked to contribute, a penny to the support of those whom they have left behind. On the contrary, those whom they have left behind have been contributing to their support. If the honourable member for Barrier's proposal were adopted, these persons would be entitled to the full pension.",36
341,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"If they - asked for it. The point is that those persons have allowed their sons to go while others have kept their sons at home.  prepared to admit that that is so. Those who agreed to their sons enlisting did so in a spirit of patriotism. Persons who were not dependent upon a relative who went to the front will not require, in the event of his death, to have something by of pension which they never enjoyed",36
342,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Tak e the case of a who has sacrificed himself for the sake of his son-wh o has spent hundreds of pounds in the education of his son, in the hope that later on that son will be of some advantage to him. If such a youth to the front, and is killed, surely father sliould be entitled to the full exactly amount of the pension.  trouble is that, under the honourable member's proposal, not only would men so situated receive the full amount of the pension, but those who had never received or wanted any contribution from their sons would be treated likewise.",36
343,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"They would represent, perhaps, 5 per cent, of the total.  tunately, we do not know to what expenditure we should be committing the country by adopting the honourable member's suggestion. The honourable member for Gippsland has raised a question concerning which we ought to have a definite statement from the Minister. The wife of a deceased soldier is required to fill in a printed form, and so make out a case for the payment of a pension before she can secure it . 1 understood that under the principal Act the widow and children of a fallen soldier were entitled in any circumstances to a pension.",37
344,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"We all thought that was the position, but it appears that it is",37
345,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The widow of a fallen soldier has to make application and fill in the printed form just as any other dependant is required to do.  very wrong.,37
346,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,But is she entitled to a pension on making application?,37
347,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Yes , if she can show Act, that she was dependent on the deceased.  the law in that respect needs to be accepted, amended.",37
348,Unknown,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4-5  always been of opinion that there should be no necessity for the wife of a fallen soldier to be put to the trouble of filling up an anrdication form for a pension. According to the spirit of the Act, the widow is entitled* to a pension without going through the form of proving that she is a dependant, but the Minister says that it is necessary for her to go through that form. In that respect, the Act should be amended.",37
349,Sir JOHN FORREST,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Do you mean to say that a widow should receive a pension, no matter how rich she may be?  as widows are concerned, I would make no distinction; but in regard to other pendants, I am in accord with the amendafternoon, ment proposed by the honourable member for Richmond. I understand that the pTOnosal of the honourable member for Barrier is that the next of kin, in any [202] . enmstances, should be entitled to the full pension, irrespective of his or her position in life. If we were to adopt that proposal we should be taking a step in the dark, because we do not know what expenditure it would entail. We ought to see that the letter of the Act is brought into conformity with its spirit, and then, after the war is over, or at some future date, we could reeulate the nensions scheme in accordance with the financial capabilities of the country. It is the administration of the Act which is at fault at the present time. I know of one case of hardship in my own district. A private who has been killed at the front left two children to the care of his mother, his wife having predeceased him by some years. The grandmother of the children is allowed 5s. per week for each child, but for herself she is allowed nothing, although she was pracnot. tically dependent on the deceased soldier. I do not think it was the intention of the Act that a woman who was dependent should be cut off entirely from all pension assistance. In that case the soldier'^ mother comes under the operation of the section relating to dependants, and I think it is the administration, and not the that is to blame for her being refused the assistance she deserves.",37
350,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"If my amendment be such an injustice will be impossible.  the virtue of the amendment of the honourable member for Richmond is that it will make such cases impossible. The Act is not being administered as sympathetically as it should be. The Minister having said that the widow must fill in the form certifying her dependence, the Bill should not be allowed to leave this Chamber until that objectionable feature has been amended. It should be sufficient for a woman to prove that she had been the wife of a fallen soldier.",37
351,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Barrier) [7.55] - 1 quite recognise that some of these amendments are of a far-reaching character, and the Minister was not in a position to accept them without consulting the Godevernment. When I spoke earlier in the I was under the impression that the widow had to prove that she was dependent; but two or three legal members of the House assured me that that cirwas not so. It is now clear that under the terms of the Aet the widow is obliged to prove her dependence.",37
352,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,I think the regulations compel her to do so.,38
353,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"As the regulations are in accordance with the Act, we cannot find fault with them, because the Act must be administered according to the form in which it is passed by Parliament. The officials can take no heed of the intentions of Parliament, but only of our enactments; otherwise they would find themselves in a dilemma. When it was contended that we need only make provision to give a full pension to the father or mother, seeing that the widow and children were automatically in receipt of a pension, I expressed the opinion that the increased amount of money required would not be very much. However, the Minister has since admitted that the pension does not fall to the widow automatically.",38
354,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The regulations say that, no matter what the relationship of the applicant to a member of the Forces may be, a pension cannot be paid until dependence is proved.",38
355,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The Minister formerly was of opinion that the widow was entitled to the pension by the mere fact of being the soldier's widow! Therefore, if an amendment is made to insure the payment of the pension to the widow, no objection can be raised by the Minister on account of increased cost, because the Commonwealth will not be called upon to pay more money than he thoueht it was liable to pay prior to his discovering his error.",38
356,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"That was my own view, but it may not have been the view of the other members of the Government. think that what we have now discovered is news to many honourable members.",38
357,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"It is so. In view of the fact'that it has been proved very conclusively that the widow is not entitled to a pension without proving dependence, it would be wise to adjourn the further consideration of the Bill until next week. The discussion this afternoon shows how necessary this amending Bill is. I think it would be advisable to postpone its further consideration, however, until next Wednesday, the Minister in the meantime to consider whether it is possible to meet the wishes of a number of honourable members. If it can be shown that what the honourable member for Fawkner and myself desire will not prove a crushing burden on the country, I think we shall have the support of the honourable member for Indi, whose objection is that we may be called upon to vote in the dark.  jection of the Minister.",38
358,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"And it is a very fair objection; By next Wednesday the Government might be prepared to accede to our request, or show conclusively it is impracticable. There is, I think, one objection to the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Richmond, which, as I understand it, provides that a widow shall receive an equivalent to what she had been receiving from her son before he went to the war. A son of 'eighteen or nineteen may earn only a small salary, and yet give his mother the greater part of it,"" while the son of another woman may earn a larger salarv and give his mother more than the former, but no more in proportion to what he earns. I take it that under the amendment of the honourable member for Richmond, the mother of the last-mentioned son would receive a higher pension.",38
359,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"That is not so, because I have used the words "" not less than."" It does not mean that she sball receive the same amount, but that it shall not be less.",38
360,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,But in some cases a mother could receive more than £52 ?,38
361,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Certainly .,38
362,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"And beyond £52, the amount would depend to some extent oo how mftch the son had previously given to his mother? I Mr MASSYGREENE - No , that is not what I endeavoured to express, or what 1 think I expressed.",38
363,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,We shall have an opportunity of discussing that later on.,38
364,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,If the matter is left over until next week I shall not be here.,38
365,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Howeve r that may be, this is a Bill which, I am sure, every honourable member desires to make as effective as possible. I should like to see the form under the regulations, if any have been issued, which a man who has been wholly or partially incapacitated has to sign. Acts of Parliament are peculiar things even to lawyers, and we have seen some difference of opinion between the honourable member for Darling Downs and the honourable member for Gippsland. The honourable member for Darling Downs gave us to understand that under the Bill a widow, as a widow, is entitled to the full pension.",38
366,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,I said that that was the intention.,39
367,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,I understood the honourable member to say that that was the law.,39
368,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,I asked the Minister to look into the question.,39
369,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"And the Minister seemed satisfied that the law was against the honourable member, and in favour of the view of the honourable member for Gippsland. The Minister now assures us that a widow is not entitled to automatically receive a pension, but only to receive an allowance to the extent that she was dependent on the deceased. Under all the circumstances I suggest that the consideration of this matter should be postponed, if only in view of the fact that it may probably mean considerable expenditure,- and that the Minister does not see his way to decide the point "" off his own bat.""",39
370,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Wimmera) [8.7] - I think that the request for a postponement might be acceded to by the Minister. The discussion has been such as to warrant our giving some reconsideration to important clauses, especially that which defines - '' dependant.'' I am in agreement with the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Richmond, but I am not quite sure that the requirements of the Act in regard to dependants will not put another difficulty in the way. It seems to be competent for the Commissioner to make a pro ratd reduction if shown that the claimant is in receipt of a certain income; and if the Act makes it mandatory to pay not less than the amount received by the claimant previous to the death of the soldier, the Commissioner may more strictly interpret "" dependant."" Under all the circumstances, I think that the Minister might consider the arguments advanced today with a view to introducing an amendment making the provision more elastic. I have in my mind a case of a lieutenant who was killed shortly after the first attack at Gallipoli. Previous to joining the Forces, this lieutenant was the right-hand man of his father in a small business. He received no salary, but had his living, and no doubt pocket-money; and the small amount sent to the father while the son was at the front was some kind of compensation for the absence of the latter. There is a probability that if the father sent in an application for a pension he would have to prove that he had been dependent on his son, and, as the father has some property of his own, that might be dimcult, although there is no doubt that he is entitled to some consideration for the loss he has sustained. We may be sure that there are hundreds of similar cases, and the Minister would do well to allow the clause to be postponed, with a view to introducing some provision to meet the wishes of honourable members.",39
371,Mr RILEY,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"South Sydney) [8.12] There are several amendments with which I disagree, and other proposals that I consider require amendment. I suggest that if we consent to pass this clause, the Minister should give us an assurance that the Bill will be recommitted next Wednesday. This would give us an opportunity to obtain the opinion of the Attorney-General on some of the clauses. I referred earlier to the case of a lady who has two sons at the front, and whose husband is how ini a hospital, and has been unable to earn anything for the last seventeen years. Under these circumstances, this lady cannot make an application, because she is not a widow, although really and truly she is one, and entirely dependent on the Bons.",39
372,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Coul d not she sign an application as a mother t,39
373,Mr RILEY,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Sh e would only get what one of the sons liked to leave her. One son is married, and his wife, of course, has to be provided for, so that the mother it is is really dependent on the other. This lady desires to have the 10s. a week proposed to be given to widows; and such cases ought to be provided for. If the Minister will not accept the suggestion I have made, an amendment will have to be moved.",39
374,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The whole matter is provided for. My marginal note on the subject escaped my eye, but such cases are covered by section 8 of the Act now. The honourable member for Darling Downs has looked into the matter.",39
375,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Darling Downs) [8.15]. - The point raised by the honourable member is one of importance. The Bill was (only introduced yesterday, and the second reading debate took place before we had time to closely examine it, and I have not had time myself to do that yet. I understood that the Minister stated that an alteration was being made by the Bill providing for the payment, in every case, of pensions at the full rate to widows and children in cases of death or permanent incapacity. Section 8 of the original Act merely sets out that the rate of pension shall not exceed a certain sum, which seems to suggest that pensions may be less than the amount specified, and therefore, under this Bill as submitted, provision is made that "" the rates of pensions payable under this Act shall be as follows."" This fixes the amount to widows and children in case of death or total incapacity. The Minister explained such to be the alteration yesterday.",39
376,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The honourable member is referring to section 8. We have not come tn it yet.,40
377,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,I think the feeling of the Committee is that widows and children shall receive the full amount specified in the schedule in cases of death or total incapacity of a member.,40
378,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,It is intended to provide for that in an alteration which will be submitted later.,40
379,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The honourable member for Gippsland also pointed to an ambiguity. He admitted that that was the intention of the Bill, but he raised grave doubts as to whether that intention would be given eifect to in the Bill as it now stands, pointing out that the definition of "" dependant"" was such that, read alongside section 8, it might be that, though a widow and child ultimately received the full amount specified in the schedule, they would be called upon to prove actual dependence before receiving anything at all.",40
380,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Will they have to do bhat, or will they not?",40
381,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"That is the point raised by the honourable member for Gippsland, and I think there is some force in his argument. I suggest that the Minister should put this point of view before the Attorney-General, in order that all possibility of doubt may be removed, because the intention of the Committee, so far as I can gather, is that widows and children shall not receive pensions simply because they are dependants, but that the pensions specified in the schedule shall come automatically to them, no matter how rich or how poor they may be.",40
382,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The proposed alteration to section 8 will bring that about.,40
383,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I would suggest to the Minister that that point should be brought before the notice of the legal officers of the Crown, in order that it may be cleared up beyond doubt.",40
384,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,3 can promise the Committee that if the Attorney-General has any doubt on the point the clause will be recommitted.,40
385,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,That is perfectly fair.,40
386,Mr WISE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Gippsland) [8.22] - There is another matter which I should like the Minister to bring before the notice of the Attorney-General. Section 3 of the old Act simply says that the Commonwealth shall be liable to pay to dependants, and it seems to me that unless the words "" widow and child "" are added to section 3 in addition to the word "" dependants "" they will receive pensions, not as the widow and child, but as dependants.",40
387,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The Attorney-General, I think, should also look into that point, in order to place it beyond doubt.",40
388,Mr FENTON,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Maribyrnong) [8.25]. There is a clause in the regulations that makes me doubt how the dependants of a soldier who might be killed in camp would fare. Clause 7 of the regulations seems to suggest that the Act will only apply to a member of the Commonwealth Naval or Military Forces on active service outside Australia. In case death occurs as the result of evolutions in camp in Australia, will not widows and children be entitled to a pension?",40
389,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"They are. They are entitled to their pension, should death occur, as soon as a man has enlisted and is sworn in. I am given to understand that pensions have already been paid in respect of deaths which occurred under such circumstances.",40
390,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I was told of one case where a pension had been refused in respect of a man who became ill , on the ground that he was not engaged in warlike operations.",40
391,Mr FENTON,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The definition, as I read it, seemed to indicate that pensions are only payable in resnect of those who go outside Australia. With the Minister's assurance that such is not the case however, I am content.",40
392,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Pension s are payable in respect of members of the Military Forces ""enlisted or appointed for active service."" Men in camp are "" appointed"" for active service.",41
393,Mr FENTON,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"What about the words "" outside Australia "" ?",41
394,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,They are appointed to go outside Australia.,41
395,Mr FENTON,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I am satisfied with the Minister's assurance. There may be difficulties with some of the succeeding clauses, to which amendments may be required, and I want to add my request to those already made to the Minister to recommit any clause upon which difficulties may occur, after he has had a consultation with the* legal advisers of the Government, in order that we may have the matter before us in a form that will be more clearly understood.",41
396,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Richmond) [8.27] Jn my view there is no question that the widow and children of a deceased soldier are entitled to pensions. It may be as the honourable member for Gippsland has pointed out, that further amendment will be required to clause 3, but that will not affect in any way the proposal I submitted in the amendment that I have for the time being withdrawn. I should like the Minister to give me some assurance that if this Bill is held over till next week, the ends. point I raised will receive some consideration. Mr JENSEN:- I will give the honourable member a similar promise to that I have made to other honourable members. I will bring the honourable member's suggestion before the notice of the Cabinet, so that the Government may consider whether the point shall be taken up as a Government matter.",41
397,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I hope the Minister understands what it is I have in mind. I want to make quite sure that where a dependant, other than a widow, shows clearly that he or she has been in receipt of an amount from the member of the Force who is dead, either equal to or exceeding the pension awarded by the assessment, that fact shall be presumptive proof of dependence to that extent, and that it shall then be incumbent upon the Commissioner to grant a pension not less than that which appears in the schedule. In asking fpr that, I am asking only for what is reasonable and fair, and what is, 1 think, the general desire of honourable members.",41
398,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Fawkner) [8.31] - The Minister has assured the Committee that men who are invalided home are entitled to pensions.,41
399,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"If a man recovers Qis health in a hospital, and is discharged well, and fitted to earn his livelihood, he is not given a pension, because he is not incapacitated.",41
400,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I hold that a man is to be regarded as on active service from the moment he is sworn in and goes into camp, and is entitled from that time to all the benefits of the Pension Act.",41
401,Mr GREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,That is the intention cf the Act.,41
402,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I think so, but it is not being administered in that spirit - I have brought under the notice of the Department the case of a soldier who was injured on a transport while engaged in duties allotted to him, and who was put ashore at Fremantle, brought back to Melbourne, and discharged. For ten or twelve weeks subsequent to his discharge he was practically a crinnle, but, afteT his discharge, he did not receive a penny from the Department by way of compensation. The position of the Department seems to be that directly a man is discharged its responsibility in regard to him",41
403,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,How was this man injured ?,41
404,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"He was assisting in the cooking, and his foot was badly scalded.",41
405,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"If the honourable member will lay all the facta under my notice, and they bear out his statement, I shall see that the man is properly dealt with.",41
406,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Every man should be cared for by the Department until a doctor has certified that he is medically fit to earn his own living.,41
407,Mr GROOM,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Or , in the case of incapacitation, until his pension has been arranged for.",41
408,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Did the man to whom the honourable member refers in any way contribute to his accident by having drink aboard ?,41
409,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,No .,41
410,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Is he quite well now ?,41
411,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Yes , but for a considerable period he, his wife, and two children were in distressed circumstances because of the unsympathetic treatment of the Department.",41
412,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Did he enlist soldier or as a cook?,42
413,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"As a soldier, but volunteers were asked for assistance in the culinary department, and he was one of those chosen. So far we have got no satisfaction from the Defence Department. I understand that the Minister has promised to recommit certain parts of the Bill in the event of his obtaining certain advice from the Attorney General.",42
414,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The Government taken a certain stand in regard to pensions, and if there is a doubt as to whether effect is given to our intentions, the Bill will be recommitted to remove it. .",42
415,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I should like Ministers to look at the matter from my point of view, and to provide that pensions shall be given as a right, and not by way of charitable dole.",42
416,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,They are given to dependants as a right. The honourable member goes a little beyond the proposals of the measure.,42
417,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The Minister and I differ as to what is a dependant. I say that the mother of a young man who goes to the front is, to some extent, a dependant, and she, having sacrificed her son to the service of the country, should not have to plead poverty to obtain a pension.",42
418,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Mother s are not, dependent in every case.",42
419,Mr HANNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"In the majority of cases they are. I know the contention is that if we give pensions to all parents, the Commonwealth will be compelled to pay away an enormous sum of money; but I am not impressed by that argument. We should not consider £52 a year an exorbitant payment to parents who have had the courage to consent to their sons going to the front, should those sons lose their lives in the service of the country. I do not like the idea of persons having to expose their circumstances in life in order to make good a claim fund. Have I an assurance from the Minister that the Bill is likely to altered in the manner I advocate?",42
420,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The proposal of the orable member entails such a large diture that it would have to be considered by the Cabinet.,42
421,Mr HAJSTNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I admit that it means a large expenditure, and the inas a creasing of taxation; but the privileges which our people will enjoy in the future will have been maintained for them by the voung fellows who are laying down their lives in Gallipoli today. I desire that the fathers and mothers of these young men shall be able to claim pensions as of right, instead of being compelled to plead poverty to obtain them. Although this will increase the expenditure of the Commonwealth, we should not shirk our duty, or failto show appreciahas tion of the sacrifices of our fallen soldiers and their parents.",42
422,Dr MALONEY,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Melbourne) [8.43]. - The subject of pensions opens up a very wide question. I have always held, and still hold, that there should be only one pension, and that every man and woman should receive an equal sum. The most up-to-date Socialistic view- I think . it is that of Bernard Shaw-is that, while it may be impossible to get equality of brain and equality of muscle, it is possible, in a well-ordered community, to have equality of revenue. It has always seemed to me that the widow and children of a private should not be treated differently from the widow and children of an officer. I am the guardian of what is known as an ex-nuptial child, so branded by the infamy of law, man-made, not by the great Creator. The father, who has gone to the front, has made an allowance to that child, and has asked me to be his guardian; but it is doubtful whether, should the father die, the child will be able to get a pension as a dependant. I understand that some doubt has been expressed as to what would be the position of the mother in the event of the father's death. An honourable member of the Opposition, who is a member of the legal profession, has stated that she is properly secured, but if, upon consideration, it is found that a further amendment is necessary, I am sure that the Minister will agree to recommit the Bill.",42
423,Mr RILEY,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,The Minister has agreed on a pension to recommit the clause.,42
424,Dr MALONEY,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Then I shall say no be more about the matter. I am sure that we are all anxious that this Bill shall be honheld up as a monument of fair play to expenthe dependants of those who are risking their lives at the front. I confess that I never refer to the subject of war without feelings of hatred and anger because of what I have read in the Book of Kings. I hope that at the end of this war there will be no room for Kings or Kaisers or War Lords, and that when the Allies march through - the streets of Berlin, every male member of the Kaiser's family will be strung up at the street.corners. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 8 and 9 agreed to. Clause 10After section seven of the Principal Act the following section is inserted:"" 7A. If any pensioner is convicted of an offence and sentenced to any term of imprisonment, the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner may suspend his pension during the term of his imprisonment or any portion thereof or forfeit any instalment thereof accruing during such term or portion.""",42
425,Mr CHARLTON,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Hunter) [8.49] Under this clause the Commissioner may suspend the pension of any pensioner convicted of an offence and sentenced to any term of imprisonment, or forfeit any in stalment accruing during his imprisonment, or any portion thereof. The honourable member for Batman last night took exception to the clause in its entirety, holding that a pension, once having been granted, should not be withheld in any circumstances. Whilst I do not go as far as that, I think that the clause as it stands is not equitable. It was urged last night that if a pensioner committed a crime which led to his imprisonment, it was only reasonable that his pension should be suspended, since while in prison he would be maintained at the expense of the country. On the face of it , that seems to be a reasonable argument; but if the clause be passed as it stands, I am confident that it will give rise to a great deal of hardship. A soldier who is totally incapacitated is entitled to a pension of £52 per annum, and his wife to £ 2 6 per annum, while a pension of £ 1 3 per annum is allowed in respect of each child. If a pensioner with a wife and two children were convicted of an offence, his wife would lose the £ 5 2 per annum to which he was entitled, so that the total allowance drawn by the pensioner and his family would be reduced by one-half. Thus, in addition to the husband being imprisoned for his offence, his wife and children would be penalized. contend, would be unjust. I do not think honourable members would care to place a woman and her children in such a position because of some act on the part of her husband which we could not condone. I therefore move as an amendment That the following words be added:-""provided that in the case of a pensioner with dependants upon him the amount forfeited during the term of his imprisonment shall be paid to such dependants."" If the clause were so amended, the pension, or any portion of the pension, payable to a pensioner, but suspended by the Commissioner, would be drawn by his wife and children during his imprisonment. It would not affect the position of a single man without dependants. His pension would be suspended while he was in gaol, and neither he nor the country would suffer.",43
426,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Why not use the words "" w if e and c h i l d r e n "" instead of "" d e pendants "" ?",43
427,Mr CHARLTON,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Because the word "" dependants"" is used throughout the Bill.",43
428,Mr MCGRATH,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,A pensioner convicted of an offence might have a widowed mother dependent upon him.,43
429,Mr CHARLTON,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Quite so, and if the words "" wife and c h i l d r e n "" were used, a widowed mother who was entirely dependent upon a pensioner convicted of an offence would receive nothing during his imprisonment. I hope the amendment will be agreed to.",43
430,Mr RILEY,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"South Sydney) [8.54] I support the amendment. Why should we deprive a man of his pension under this measure because he happens to ba convicted of a misdemeanour? Public servants who are entitled, under the State law, to a pension are not deprived of it when convicted of any offence, or in the event of their bankruptcy; and where a man has earned a pension by fighting for his country, why should we provide that it shall be payable to him only during his good behaviour? I hope the clause.will be negatived. We do not desire to have an army of detectives watching the conduct of pensioners under this law. If a man is awarded a pension, it should be given to him for life, free from all conditions.",43
431,Mr BRENNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Batman) [8.57] I gave reasons last night why, in my opinion, the whole clause was bad and That, J ought to be omitted. I have not departed in any way from the views I then expressed. It is true that the Minister for the Navy answered the - points I raised with the contention that these pensions were merely given by way of compensation for injuries received in war, and not because of service at the front. But we should put the whole scheme upon a higher ground by declaring that every man who becomes entitled to a pension under this measure shall receive it-fre e from any grudging condition or restriction-as an absolute right covering the whole period of his life. If we give him anything less than that, we shall place him at a disadvantage, as compared with an ordinary citizen in his own walk of life who has given no service to the community as a soldier. Surely at this very time, when we all feel a sense of gratitude to, and pride in, those who are entering upon the risky and onerous work of soldiering, we are not going to look ahead to a time when possibly one of these men who comes back and is awarded a pension shall in some way or other transgress the law. Surely we are not going to hold up to him an Act of Parliament in which we say, "" Although we think you worthy of this pension, we want you to remember that if you should at any time, because of weakness or. acting on a sudden impulse, transgress the law, so as to be cast into prison for a few days, we shall stop the payment of this pension which you have earned.""",43
432,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,He may be committed to prison for exercising the right of freedom of speech.,44
433,Mr BRENNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"There are many slender grounds on which a man may be nut in m-ison, and, on the other hand, there are persons guilty of culpable conduct who are not put in prison at all.",44
434,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"The administration of this clause will be at the discretion of the Commissioner. If the offence were a trivial one, no doubt the pensioner would get sympathetic consideration.",44
435,Mr BRENNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Sectio n 7 of the Act provides for a review of the assessment or determination. That ought to be sufficient, without holding before men who have served at the front the threat, that they will be liable to lose their pensions if they are guilty of unlawful conduct. By agreeing to this clause we shall be putting the soldier in a worse position than the ordinary citizen. Suppose two men, one a pensioner, who has served his country at the front, and the other a waster, jointly commit an offence, and are sentenced to the same term of imprisonment. The less worthy member of the community, having served his sentence, is considered to have expiated his offence and to be entitled to go free, as he ought to be. He has paid the penalty, and the law says that a man shall not be saddled afterwards with the consequences of his offence. Why, then, saddle the consequences of his offence on the second offender, the man who has rendered signal service to his country, by depriving him of portion of his pension? The proposal is illogical, but even if it were not, we shall be treating these men grudgingly if we hold before them the threat that, should they undergo imprisonment for some offence, they will also suffer a proportionate loss of their pension. I hope the clause will be negatived; but, if it is not, I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter. The Commissioner ought to be in the position to hand over the money, to which the pensioner would be entitled in other circumstances, to his wife and children, so that they, at all events, might not be the sufferers through his lapse.",44
436,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Wimmera) [9.5] I do not favour the elimination of the clause. It is quite competent for the Commissioner, as custodian of the funds, to see that the pension is properly directed. The pension of a widow ceases when she re-marries, though one would think that was a commendable action on her part. We also reserve the right of disfranchising persons who have committed certain crimes. In this clause we are only following the same principle, and holding a kind of censorship over those persons who, by their own act, have deprived themselves of the right to enjoy the privileges of citizenship. I agree with the honourable member for Batman that the pension, once granted, should have a reasonable permanency associated with it, but the State should retain the right to direct that the pension be paid to the person really entitled to the use of the money, so that it can be expended for the support of the dependants in accordance with the inten ion of this Parliament. I think all requirements will be amply met by the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter.",44
437,Mr THOMAS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Barrier) [9.7] - I would prefer to see the clause struck out rather than that the amendment should be carried. I take the view that the pension belongs to the person who has won it by risking his life and suffering incapacitation. If a person commits a crime he is punished by the law of the land, and it is not just to further punish him by taking away his pension. It is a reflection on the men who have gone to the front to suggest that there will be such a percentage of law-breakers amongst them on their return as to make necessary such a provision as this. Section 9 of the Act makes it possible to commute a pension by the payment of a lump sum, and I imagine that it is not the desire of Parliament that, if a pensioner is imprisoned after he has received such a lump sum, portion of the money shall be recovered from him. Yet it would be equally unfair to interfere with his pension if he were receiving it in periodical instalments. I shall vote against the amendment, in the hope of having the clause struck out.",44
438,Dr MALONEY,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Melbourne) [9.10]. - In the very serious libel case, Ronald v. Harper, the man who was convicted of having suborned witnesses to commit perjury in behalf of the defendant, and who was sentenced to imprisonment f o i three years, did not lose his pension.",45
439,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Who was the man?,45
440,Dr MALONEY,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Padd y Hill. That person showed the vilest ingratitude, because it was Mr Ronald who had obtained for him his pension. I think this clause must have been culled from the Old-age Pensions Act. Frequently in the Courts of Melbourne old-age pensioners have been sentenced as vagrants for having no visible means of support. A magistrate who would sentence an old age pensioner as a vagrant either says that the Commonwealth does not pay the pensioners enough to exist upon, or he does not understand what he is talking about. I was hurt to find the Commissioner of Old-age Pensions taking a month and a week to answer a letter inquiring which magistrate it was who had sentenced a certain old lady; and when I got the reply it was simply to say that no record was kept. If that was the only reply that could be sent, then I think it ought to have come by return of post. That old lady's pension was taken away, and I resented that action, as I should any similar action taken under the clause before [203] us. If the Minister cannot see his way to withdraw the clause, I hope he will accept the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter, which, at all events, would limit the power of the Commissioner, and insure that, in the case of a serious criminal offence, those dependent on the criminal would not be deprived of pensions. In the case of the electoral law, a man who has served a sentence is allowed to resume his citizen rights after a short interval; and, surely, similar consideration may be shown in the case of war pensions.",45
441,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Bass-Minister for the Navy) [9.18] - This clause is inserted because there is a similar provision in another Federal Act; and I myself think it is necessary. It is provided that if a pensioner is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, the Commissioner "" may "" - no t ' ' shall ''-suspen d his pension during the term of the imprisonment, or any portion thereof, or forfeit any instalment accruing during such term. It will be seen that the whole matter rests with the Commissioner, who, I take it, as a man of common sense and judgment, will investigate every case. Of course, if a man is only convicted of some such trivial offence as that of being intoxicated, the Commissioner, I take it , would not interfere; but, no doubt, he would if a man were sentenced to imprisonment for five or ten years. In any case, the offender's wife and children should not be called upon to bear a double privation. The amendment will not cause any extra expense, and, under the circumstances, I am prepared to accept it . Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 11 (Amendment of section 8).",45
442,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Richmond) [9.20] This clause proposes to amend the section by inserting the following in relation to payments to dependants: (iv.) to the other dependants such rates as are assessed by the Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioner, as the case may be, but not exceeding in the aggregate the rate specified in column two of the Schedule opposite to the rate of pay of the member plus Fifty-two pounds per annum: Provided that the maximum rate of pension payable to any one dependant of a member shall not in any case exceed the amount specified in column two of the Schedule opposite to the rate of pay of the member; and I should be glad if the Minister would explain what is meant by this paragraph. It appears to me that the effect - will be that, if dependants are in receipt of £ 5 2 a year, the full pensions - will be paid, but that if they are in receipt of more than £52 per year a pro ratd reduction will be made; and, personally, I do not think that ought to be. The principle I wish to see embodied is that if dependants can show that they have been dependent on the earnings of a member of the Forces prior to his death, up to a certain point, either the equivalent to or more than the actual pension, then the pension should be granted in full , irrespective of what the income may be beyond that. Take, for instance, the case of one of our Generals who was killed the other day. I do not know of the circumstances of his dependants, but if they are in receipt of an income of, say, £ 1 5 0 per year, this clause will absolutely do away with their pension rights, except, of course, in the case of the widow.",45
443,Mr JENSEN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Bass-Minister for the Navy) [9.25] - It is practically a legal point that the honourable member has raised, and being a layman I shall have to consult the Attorney-General with regard to it . I take it that this amendment is inserted in order to insure that the A ct shall work smoothly; but if the clause be passed as it stands, I shall have to make inquiries, and if there is any serious amendment required it may be considered when the Bill is re-committed.

445,Mr JH CATTS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Cook) [9.33] - I am glad the Postmaster-General is present. From a report which appeared in the Sydney Sun of Tuesday, 27th July, it appears that great dissatisfaction exists at the General Post Office, Sydney, in regard to a matter that I brought under the Minister's notice a couple of weeks ago. The reference is in Hansard, No . 41, page 4499. This is a brief statement of the positionThe mail branch of the G.P.O. is on the verge of striking and holding up the delivery and despatch of the business houses' letters. The men say that they were told by. the present Government to appeal to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for a redress of their grievances. This they did, but, instead of receiving benefits, they have been cut down in salary, and are now worse off than ever. The letter carriers appealed to the Court for an award, which came into operation on 1st July. On 16th July the postal heads are declared to have committed a breach of the award. The men state that they approached their head, who refused them any redress. The result was that the whole of the letter carriers threatened to walk out of the G.P.O. unless their demands were satisfied. The Department then agreed to the terms under the award. The postal sorters then received their award, which is to date from 1st August. Even in the face of that award, it is stated that the Postal Department has introduced provisos and barriers which Mr Justice Powers did not stipulate. The officials have communicated with the central executive in Melbourne to make representations to Parliament, and if their demands are not satisfied, an ultimatum will be sent to the Prime Minister threatening to cease work on a date to be decided upon. Mr Christie, superintendent of mails, does not regard the threat to strike very seriously. He says that the sorters are a reasonable lot of men, and he does not believe that they will resort to extremes. Mr Christie explained that the trouble with the letter carriers had arisen from a misunderstanding on the part of an official who had unwittingly worked a man overtime, but this matter had since been rectified. It appears that there is more in this trouble than is admitted by the Superintendent of Mails. I do not expect the Postmaster-General to be in a position to give a definite replv to this matter offhand, though the probabilities are that it has been brought under his notice during the last couple of days by Sydney officials. If that is so, and the honourable Minister can say whether an inquiry has been made, I shall be glad to know what in formation he has got. Otherwise I will ask him to have inquiries made, in order to discover whether the dissatisfaction cannot be redressed.",46
446,Mr MCGRATH,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Ballarat) [9.35] - I also desire to bring before the notice of the Postmaster-General a matter concerning casual letter carriers. Prior to the award of the Arbitration Court, men of between eighteen and thirty-five years of age were engaged to do this work, but since the award was published, the Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria- I do not know what is happening in other Stateshas issued an order to postmasters in all inland towns, instructing them that, where possible, they must engage youths to do this work. This means that, whereas under the award it would be necessary to pay 8s. 6d. a day, the Deputy Postmaster General proposes to employ boys, and pay them 5s. 4d. a day. It seems to me that some officials take a special delight In defeating an award of the Arbitration Court. I have written to the Postmaster-General on this subject, but so far I have had no reply, though the matter is, I think, one of urgency. In the House the Minister stated that the Department were not going to dispense with the services of any of the casual letter carriers. It may be perfectly true that they are not going to dispense with any who have not served for six months, but when the six months is exhausted others will be employed. I do not suggest that youths are not fit to do this work. If they are fit enough to go and fight for this country, as they have been fighting in Gallipoli. they are fit enough to earn more than a paltry 5s. 4d. a day. The position of a letter carrier is one of some responsibility. No Liberal Administration ever made any attempt to bring in cheap labour to do the work these men have to do, and it remains for the Postmaster-General in a Labour Administration to send broadcast through Victoria the order to which I have referred. I trust the Postmaster-General will see that it is cancelled.",47
447,Mr BRENNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Batman) [9.40] - As we have the Postmaster-General witn us, I should like also to bring forward a matter for his consideration. Some time ago I asked him whether it was a fact that the young women in the Telephone Branch of the Postal Department were to be called upon to work all night. The Postmaster General then assured me that, as far as he knew, there was no such intention, but that nothing would be done without consulting the young women concerned. I am now informed that this reform-if it is a reform; I think it is a retrogression[203]- 2 is to be brought about, and I understand that it is alleged, also, that the women concerned have been consulted. I am satisfied, however, that they have not been consulted in the proper sense of the word. In this matter, also, it seems that only the will of the departmental head has been considered.",47
448,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,What staff are you referring to?,47
449,Mr BRENNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,I am referring to the Melbourne staff. I am told that it has been reported to the Postmaster-General that it is the wish of the staff that this change should be made. Such is not the case.',47
450,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,I have not heard a single word about Melbourne.,47
451,Mr BRENNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,Then I think that is a just ground for complaint. Why has not the Minister heard of it? I have heard of it .,47
452,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,I understood the honourable member's question referred only to Sydney.,47
453,Mr BRENNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I referred only to Melbourne. The honourable member for South Sydney raised a similar question regarding Sydney. I know there is im-. mense dissatisfaction on the part of the young women who have been called upon to work all night at the Melbourne Exchange. It is neither proper nor neces' sary that this should be, and I would point out to the Postmaster-General that the reason alleged for these young women being employed all night is that the young men who formerly did that work are anxious to go to the war, and that they are to be encouraged in their desire. But the fact is that this work was previously done by lads of between sixteen and eighteen years of age, and nobody under the age of eighteen can go to the war. I would ask the Postmaster-General 'to consider whether it is either fair or necessary that this change should be made. If it is not absolutely necessary, I would urge him to take a vote amongst the ladies themselves in order to discover what their attitude is. If the change is necessary, I do not object; but I do not think that the change should be introduced by the Postmaster-General under any misconception as to what the wishes of the people themselves are. The lady telephonists are worthy of consideration. They are. as a class, courteous, conscientious, and quick witted, and, I am bound to say, in marked contrast to some of the men employed in the telephone exchanges. I hope that consideration will be given to what appears to me to be a just complaint, and that the female telephonists will not be compelled to work all night.",47
454,Mr FENTON,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Maribyrnong) [9.46]. - I wish to give the Minister timely notice of a complaint with which I intend to deal with more fully on some other occasion. Of recent years, it has become the practice of the Department, especially of the Telephone Branch, when engineers are required, to appoint men from overseas, alleging that the men trained in Australia, and acquainted with Australian conditions, are not capable of ing the more important positions. Honourable members know, however, that the undergrounding of the telephone wires in the main cities of the Commonwealth has been carried out under the supervision of able engineers, who learned their profession and acquired their experience in Australia, and naturally such men resent the giving of the plums of the service to engineers from Great Britain and other places. Some years ago there came under my notice the case of a young man who was fully qualified for a certain position, and had been performing its duties to the satisfaction of his superior officer; but the Public Service Commissioner held that, as he was only twenty-six years of age, he was too young to receive the salary attached to that office, which was £310 per annum as a minimum. That is no way to encourage smart young Australians. The Postmaster-General, I know; is willing to give encouragement to Australian industry and to Australian workmen, and he does not object to the men joining associations so that they may express their grievances firmly and obtain redress. Surely Australian-born and Australian-trained men are entitled to more consideration than men from overseas. We have it on the best authority that there were telephones in Melbourne before there were any in London, but the Department is bringing from Great Britain men of limited experience who have no knowledge of Australian conditions, and some of these men have put the country to considerable expense by julling down useful works in order to erect others of their own design, which may suit London, but not Australian cities. I hope that the Postmaster General will look into the matter, and see that no more appointments of this kind &3TQ IXUtdfia",48
455,Mr BURNS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Illawarra) [9.50] - The letter-carriers of the city of Sydney have a half-holiday on Saturday afternoons, and so, I understand, have the letter carriers of Melbourne and its suburbs; but the letter-carriers of the suburbs of Sydney do not enjoy the Saturday halfholiday. I brought the matter under the notice of the last Postmaster-General, and he promised to look into it . I have received several letters from letter carriers to say that no change has been made.",48
456,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Darling-Postmaster fillGeneral) [9.52] - Wit h regard to the matter referred to by the honourable member for Cook, all I know of the alleged trouble at Sydney is the statement published in the Sydney Sun, which I am loath to accept as reliable. Since the award was made, the definitions adopted by the Judge have been carefully drawn out and submitted to the Deputy Postmasters-General, and the instruction has been given that the conditions of the award are to be observed. The postal service is practically fully organized, and the executive officers of the unions do not neglect the interests of their members, but, very properly, promptly bring complaints under the notice of the authorities. Therefore, I think that the press statements are incorrect, nothing having come to my ears either from the union or from the Deputy Postmaster-General at Sydney. But I have asked the Central Office to inquire into the matter. Of course, when a new award comes into operation, some changes are necessary. It has been stated that no increases have been given; but the award itself contains certain increases-in the case of letter sorters, for example. Sometimes there is a difference of opinion as to the interpretation of a clause of the award, and then matters are referred to the Public Service Commissioner. Certainly, the policy of the Department is to give effect to the awards. As to the matter referred to by the honourable member for Ballarat, I see nothing wrong in the circular to which he draws attention. Boys employed in country places are paid the rate awarded by the Judge. It is not necessary in many small towns to employ regular letter-carriers.",48
457,Mr MCGRATH,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Ballara t is not a small country town, and the instruction is being put into force there.",48
458,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"It is not intended to aptply where regular letter-carriers are employed. As to the employment of female telephonists all night in Melbourne, it is news to me that any request for their Bervices has been made. Adelaide, the female telephonists petitioned to be employed at night. was a surprise to the departmental heads, and the Chief Engineer looked into the matter, and, he being satisfied, we complied with the petition, and provided every comfort for the operators. report is that the arrangement is satisfactory, and that the operators are content. Every one knows that lady telephonists do their work well. small suburban exchanges only males are employed at night. There is very little justification for keeping open some of these exchanges, but it is.urged that it may be necessary to use the telephone now and again in cases of sickness. One would not dream of putting a lady in charge of such an office all night. to the position of Sydney, it is to be remembered that the extension of automatio exchanges will practically abolish telephone operators, and we are making every effort to prevent the telephonists from losing employment.",49
459,Mr BURNS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,What is going to be done with the men who are losing their work!,49
460,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"No maletelephonist over twenty-one years of age is employed. It was decided to allow two of the female telephonists in Sydney to visit Adelaide, the Department paying their expenses, to report on the arrangements there. at a meeting, the Sydney telephonists decided not to appoint any one to go. The Adelaide supervisor was then sent to Sydney to explain the Adelaide arrangements, and a meeting was called to give her an opportunity to state the position, but that meeting was boycotted, those immediately concerned not attending. is the stage at which the matter stands. I decided that nothing should be done until I could visit Sydney and look into the question.",49
461,Mr RILEY,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,It is said that the girls have received an intimation that the alteration will come into effect next month.,49
462,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I do not Believe such statements. I have no knowledge of any such instruction having been issued, and such an instruction would indeed be contrary to the policy that has been laid down. I ordered that no action should be taken until I had visited Sydney. I do not know of any such direction having been given in respect of the female teleIn phone attendants in Melbourne.",49
463,Mr BRENNAN,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,I am told that they This also have been advised that the change is to be made.,49
464,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"They sometimes become very excited, perhaps naturally, The when any change of the kind is suggested. I am not expressing any opinion as to the wisdom or otherwise of such a policy. I shall visit Adelaide this week-end, and In the shall make inquiries as to how the system is operating there. Random statements have been made that the female telephone attendants were coerced into all-night work. Tbere is no evidence, so far as I can discover, to support such an allegation.",49
465,Mr WEST,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,In what year does the honAs orable gentleman propose to visit Sydney ?,49
466,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"Thre e weeks have elapsed since I was la&t in Sydney. It is the first time for many years that I have been so long away from it . As to the position of the engineers to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I may say at once that no engineer in the Department is going to suffer by reason of our aotion in bringing from the Old Country two electrical engineers. They are not to take the place of any man at present in the Department. But Mr .EENTON - They will prevent the promotion of others.",49
467,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"I have heard what the men in the Department have to say on the subject, and it has been made clear to them that their promotion will be in no way affected by the engagement of these two engineers. The two men coming out That will not pass over them. One of the first proposals of which I approved on taking office was one for the training of men required for every section of the service, including that of engineers - It is proposed - w e nave yet to obtain a vote for the purpose-to establish here an institute similar to that in connection with the Postal Department of the United Kingdom, and in which our young men will be trained. I think it is also a good plan to send officers from time to time to the Old World as well as to the United States to gain information that will be of service to the Department. That has been done in connection with the telephone branch. Unfortunately, owing to the outbreak of war, the officers whom we sent to Europe were not able to visit Germany, but they brought back some valuable information from America and elsewhere. Upon their return a conference of heads of Departments from the different States discussed the suggestions which they had to make, and some were approved, and are now being put into operation. I repeat that the two engineers ta whom reference has been made are not being brought out to take the place of any man already in the Department. There is a shortage of such engineers in Australia, and I do not think any harm will be done by the introduction of a little new blood into the service. Upon their arrival, steps will be taken to give men already in the service tome training regarding the conditions operating in the Old World. I know that some of the men have expressed the fear that they are going to be ""shunted."" I should be loth to allow anything of the kind. It would be unfair to displace any of our own men. The authorities agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong that our engineers are as good as those of any other country. No complaint or reflection is made regarding Australian engineers. It is not suggested that the men who are coming out are better than our own. The trouble is that we are short of such men, and that private enterprise does not train men for us.",49
468,Mr BUHNS,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,What about the letter carriers ?,50
469,Mr SPENCE,MILITARYRAIDON BUSINESS,"So far as it is possible to introduce the Saturday half-holiday system we are doing so. It is not possible to bring it into operation all over the Commonwealth. In some cases local bodies are opposed to it , but we are hopeful of extending it very considerably.",50
