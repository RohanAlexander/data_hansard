It seeks to enable electronic commerce that ordinary commerce has enjoyed under common over 100 years now.

Yet we are encouraging the public to after much effort, has only just proposed to long way to go in this debate. It is time the government said, 'This whole on the public using very high levels of encryption, be using 768-plus bits of encryption. For really It is overkill, of course, but it does guarantee transactional identity and it does guarantee transactions against invasions by criminals.' Some people will say and the law enforcement listening in on other people's transactions. to exchange communications over the Internet deciphering and decrypting child pornography they can already use very strong public key Internet.

(Extension of time granted) Obviously, one of the few ways we can address enter into some treaties with countries reciprocal obligations and rights b-tween our these countries and to allow export and development I think the government should then proceed, in this regard, to review its domestic laws adopted here last year-for example, to force decrypt on demand of the government any I debated with honourable members in legislation which mandates the decryption without of any encrypted message which an ISP encrypted. That technology itself, once the undermine confidence in electronic commerce. and criminalise the use of cryptography for and remove those laws which provide for the undermine public confidence.

Main Committee adjourned at 1.06 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Croft Health Care Pty Ltd: Complaints (Question No. 793) Mr Zahra asked the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, upon notice, on 9 August 1999: (1) Has the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) received complaints or expressed concerns about the behaviour of (a) Croft Health Care Pty Ltd, (b) Croft Health Care Vic. Pty Ltd, (c) Croft Health Care Properties Pty Ltd, (d) G&L Croft Pty Ltd, (e) Millennium Aged Care Pty Ltd, (t) Ringwood Drive-in Shopping Centre Pty Ltd, (g) Croft Management Services Pty Ltd, (h) Gracedale Manor Pty Ltd, (i) P&C Nominees Pty Ltd, (j) Sixty Ninth Octex pty Ltd, (k) Private Hospital Management Systems Pty Ltd and (1) Third Ocwood Pty Ltd; if so, in each case, (i) \Yhat was the nature of the complaints or concerns and (ii) what action did ASIC take. (2) Is he able to say whether there are instances of a company referred to in part (1) not meeting all its requirements under corporations law; if so, in each case, (a) which company, (b) which requirement was not met and (c) when did the breach occur. Mr Hockey-The answer to the honourable tives member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) It would be inappropriate for me say publicly whether the Australian Securities Investments Commission (ASIC) has or has not received complaints or expressed concerns about any particular company. As complaints are not always well founded and substantiated, disclosure that a complaint has been made could harm the business and reputation of a company which is operating within the law. In other cases, such disclosure could compromise ASIC investigations. Partly reflecting these concerns, ASIC is subject strict confidentiality requirements under section of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989. Western Sahara: Human Rights (Question No. 837) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for FortheAustralia eign Affairs, upon notice, on 11 August 1999: (1) Does the Government have a policy in regard to the north west African state of Western Sahara. NA (2) Has the Government's attention been drawn to alleged human rights abuses in this area; if so, what assistance has the Government provided to the UN in order to stop the abuses from occurring. (3) Has the Government made representations to the Moroccan Government about the alleged human rights abuses in the Western Sahara. (4) Will the Government (a) re-introduce its contingent to the UN mission in the area and (b) consider sending independent observers to monitor the UN referendum scheduled for July 2000. (5) Has the Government provided humanitarian assistance to the Saharawi people who have been described as refugees. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia considers the Polisario Front to be representative of an important body of West Saharan opinion, but does not regard it as the sole representative. Australia does not recognise the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), proclaimed in Algeria in February 1976. Australian Parliamentarians and officials may meet the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquila elHamra and Rio de Oro (Polisario Front) representainformally. Since many PoIisario representatives also hold SADR positions, Australian Ministers do not normally receive them, because to to do so might be presented as Australian acceptance and of the SADR as the government of Western Sahara. (2) The Government continues to monitor the human rights situation in the Western Sahara as part of its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights internationally. While Amnesty International's Reports on the Western Sahara dated June and August 1999 outline the ' organisation's continuing concerns over the human to rights situation, in particular on torture and ill127 treatment in detention, freedom of expression, association and movement, the organisation acknowledges there have been improvements in recent years, including in the release of hundreds of ""disappeared"" and also of prisoners of conscience. contributed defence force personnel to UN MINURSO Mission in the Western Sahara from 1991-94. One of the functions of the MINURSO peacekeeping operation was to ensure the release of all Western Saharan political prisoners and to oversee the exchange of prisoners of war. Australia has joined consensus on the UN General Resolution on the Question of Western Sahara which stresses the importance of a full, fair and faithful implementation of the settlement plan and the agreements aimed at its implementation. (3) Over the last few years, individual cases of alleged human rights abuses in the Western Sahara have been brought to the Government's attention through a long standing arrangement set in place whereby Amnesty International ""Urgent Action"" cases are pursued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on behalf of the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group. The Australian Embassy in Paris, which has responsibility for Morocco, has made representations to the Moroccan authorities. (4) (a) Australia contributed defence force personnel to the UN Mission for the Referendum in the Western Sahara (MINURSO) from September 1991-May 1994. The Australian withdrawal in no way reflects a diminution of Australian support for the UN operation. There are no current plans for Australia to re-introduce its contingent. (b) The Government would carefully consider any formal request to send observers to monitor the UN referendum scheduled for July 2000 taking into account our established policies on peace-keeping and the fact that the Western Sahara is not central to Australia's foreign policy interests. (5) Australia has not to date provided any direct humanitarian assistance to the Saharawi people of the Western Sahara. However, in 1998, through AusAID's emergency standby staffing arrangement with the Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief Australia (RedR), two Australian hydro-geologists were deployed to the Western Sahara for four months to identify water resources for the Saharawi people. Australian Embassy: Copenhagen (Question No. 847) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 August 1999: (1) When did Australia first establish an embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. (2) Did the Howard Government close the Australian Embassy in Denmark; if so, (a) when and (b) why.

(5) At the time of its closing, (a) what was the address of the Australian Embassy in Copenhagen, (b) what was the total annual running cost, including staff salaries, of operating the mission and (c) how many staff were employed at the embassy. (6) At the time of its closing, did the Commonwealth rent or own the building in which the embassy was located. (7) If the Commonwealth owned the building, did it sell it once the embassy was closed; is so, (a) for what price was it sold, in Australian dollars. (8) If the Commonwealth maintained ownership in the event it decided to re-open the embassy at a later date, has it been rented throughout the period since it was closed; it sos (a) by whom and (b) for what annual rent in Australian dollars; if not, why not.

(10) Will the Commonwealth purchase or rent a new building for its new embassy in Denmark; if it has purchased a new building, (a) for what sum, in Australian dollars, was it purchased and (b) from whom; ifit will rent a building, (c) for what sum, in Australian dollars, and (d) from whom. (11) Before the embassy was closed, was the residence of the former Australian Ambassador located at the same site; if not, (a) where was it located and (b) did the Commonwealth sell it when the mission was closed; if so, for what price was it sold, in Australian dollars; if it maintained ownership of the residence, has it been rented throughout the period since the embassy was closed; if so, by whom and for what annual rent, in Australian dollars; if not, why not.

(14) What will be the estimated cost of completely refitting both (a) the new Australian Embassy in Denmark and (b) the residence of the new Australian Ambassador to Denmark in order to bring both buildings up to the standard required for an Australian Embassy and Ambassador's residence. (15) How many staff will be employed at the new Australian embassy in Denmark. (16) Was the decision to close the mission ill considered; if not, why not. (17) Does closure and subsequent re-opening of the Australian Embassy in Denmark portray Australia's foreign policy in Europe, particularly in relation to Scandinavia, as unplanned, haphazard, thoughtless and undermine Australia's credibility in dealing with nations in that region; if not, why not. (18) Has he decided upon the new Australian Ambassador to Denmark; if so, who; if not, (a) when will he make a decision and (b) will he rule out announcing a former liberal or national party State or federal member of parliament or Senator as the new Australian Ambassador to Denmark; if not, why not. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) November 1970, when the Consulate-G-neral in Copenhagen was raised to the status of an Embassy. (2) Yes. (a) May 1997. (b) Australian Government budgetary pressures at the time. (3) Yes. The Danish Government expressed its regrets and disappointment about the decision to close the Embassy, but conveyed its wish to continue developing close and friendly ties between Australia and Denmark. (4) Yes. (a) It is expected that an Embassy will be reopened around May 2000. (b) The decision to re-open was made in light of Australia's growing trade interests in Denmark, the Australian Government's commitment to boost bilateral relations with Denmark and to enhance our ability to represent Australia's interests within the European Union and Scandinavia. (c) In addition to the reasons provided in (4) (b) above, the budgetary pressures which impelled the closure are no longer applicable. (5) (a) Kristianigade 2 1, DK 2 1 00, Copenhagen, Denmark. (b) The total running cost, including staff salaries was $1,885,216. (c) The Embassy employed S Australian based Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) staff, 9 locally engaged DFAT staff, 3 10cally engaged Austrade staff and 3 locally engaged Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs staff. (6) The Chancery was Commonwealth owned. (7) As the building was Commonwealth owned, this question should be directed to my colleague the Minister for Finance. (8) As the building was Commonwealth owned, this question should be directed to my colleague the Minister for Finance. (9) No. (a) A decision on this matter has not been made. (b) It is expected that an Embassy will be reopened around May 2000. (10) A decision on this matter has not been made. (11) No. (a) Solbakkevej 23, GentoRe, Copenhagen Denmark. (b) As the building was Commonwealth owned, this question should be directed to my colleague the Minister for Finance. (12) No. A decision on where the new Ambassador's Residence will be located is yet to be made. (13) It is likely that the Commonwealth will rent a residence for the Ambassador when the post is opened. This decision will be taken following market analysis after the post is opened. (14) Such costs can only be established following selection of appropriate premises. (15) Preliminary planning is for the Embassy to have 3 Australian based DFAT staff and 5 locally engaged DFAT staff. (16) No. The decision to close the Embassy was appropriate in the prevailing circumstances. (17) No. The Australian Government has continued to pursue its interests effectively, and to maintain close, friendly and cooperative relations with Europe and Scandinavia. (18) No. (a) and (b) I will not speculate about fixture appointments. Standard practice is that issue press releases on all Head of Mission appointments when it is appropriate to do so. When the Government makes a decision on an appointment to Copenhagen, it will be announced in the usual way. Australian Embassy: Damascus (Question No. 848) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 August, 1999: (1) When did Australia first establish an embassy in Damascus, Syria? (2) Will the Howard Government close the Australian Embassy in Syria; if so, (a) when and (b) why. (3) Has he received correspondence from the SYl;an Government or its representatives registering an opinion on this decision; if so, is he able to say what is the Syrian Government's opinion, if not, why not. (4) What is the address of the Australian Embassy in Damascus and what is the total annual running cost, including staff salaries, of operating the mission. (5) At the time of his decision to close the embassy, how many staff were employed at be embassy. (6) Does the Commonwealth rent or own the building in which the embassy was located. (7) If the Commonwealth owns the building, will it sell it once the embassy is closed; if so, (a) for what price is it expected to be sold, in Australian dollars. (8) If the Commonwealth intends to maintain ownership in the event it decides to re-open the embassy at a later date, will it be rented after it is closed; if so, what annual rent, in Australian dollars, will it seek. (9) Is the residence of the Australian Ambassador located at the same site; if not, (a) where is it located and (b) will the Commonwealth sell it when the mission is closed; if so, for what price does it expect to sell it, in Australian dollars; if it will maintain ownership of the residence, will it be rented after the Ambassador departs; if so, what annual rent, in Australian dollars, will it ask. (10) Did he state in June 1998 that Australia valued its relations with Syria and looked forward to achieving a deeper dialogue on a range of political and economic issues; if so, how will Australia's relationship with Syria progress and develop without Australia maintaining its embassy in Damascus. (11) Does the closure of the Australian Embassy in Syria so soon after announcing his hopes for a close and developing relationship between Australia and Syria portray Australia's foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly in regards to Syria, as unplanned, haphazard, thoughtless and undermine Australia's credibility in dealing with nations in that region; if not, why not. (12) How many persons annually access the Australian Embassies in (a) Syria, (b) Jordan and (c) Israel, seeking to travel to Australia as (i) a visitor, (ii) a permanent resident, (iii) a refugee or (iv) other categories. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 28 December 1978. (2) The Australian Embassy in Damascus closed to the public, except to deal with emergency cases, on 19 August and will cease all operations on 17 September 1999. (b) The decision to close the embassy in Damascus was the result of a wider Government review of where it could best utilise the resources at its disposal in Australia's overall national interest. (3) The Syrian Foreign Minister, Mr Farouk AISharaa, wrote to me seeking a review of the Government's decision. In response I noted that the decision would stand and had been based solely on resource considerations. I emphasised that the decision in no way reflected the value Australia placed on maintaining a sound and mutually productive relationship with Syria, that we remained committed to that relationship and that we would be concluding arrangements as soon as possible for effective diplomatic accreditation to Syria from one of our other regional missions. (4) The Embassy is located at 47 Karabi Street, Mezzeh, Damascus.The total running costs in 1998/99, including staff salaries, was $1,457,772. (5) The embassy's staffing numbers were: 2 Australia-based officers; 10.5 DFAT permanent locally engaged staff (LES); 2 DIMA LES; and 0.5 LES Austrade officers. There were also 2 DFATcontracted LES. (6) The Chancery is rented. (7) N/A (8) N/A (9) The residence of the Australian Ambassador is leased and is not co-located with the Chancery. The address is, 17 Refai Street, Mezzeh, Damascus. (10) As I indicated in my recent letter to the Syrian Foreign Minister, Australia certainly continues to value its relationship with Syria and looks forward to achieving a deeper dialogue on a range of political and economic issues. Our decision to close Damascus is in no way a reflection of the value Australia places on maintaining a sound and mutually productive relationship with Syria. The Government is confident that Australia's interests in Syria can be pursued effectively with nonresident accreditation. (11) The Government's decision was taken purely on resource grounds and reflected an assessment of where scarce resources would be best utilised for support of Australia's national interests. It was part of a wider review of representation which also saw the closure of Australia's embassy in Kazakstan and the opening of new missions in Copenhagen and Los Angeles. It thus demonstrably did not reflect a ""haphazard"" decision in relation to the Middle East. On the contrary, Australia has moved to strengthen its ties with the Middle East, especially in our major trading partners, including through the opening this year of an embassy in Abu Dhabi. I should note that Australian exports to Syria in 1998-99 amounted to $14.3 million, compared (for example) with exports to the U.A.E of $834.8 million in the same year. Australia is conscious of the important role Syria plays in the region. We look forward to continuing to develop a sound relationship with Syria in the years ahead. (12) In 1998-99, the Australian embassy in (a) Damascus issued 614 visas, 145 for permanent residency and 469 for temporary residency. (b) In the same year, the embassy in Amman processed a total of 773 visas; 212 for permanent residency and 561 for temporary residency. Syria and Jordan's refugee and humanitarian cases are processed from Beirut. The Australian embassy in Tel Aviv (c) issued a total of 13.021 visas, 236 for permanent residency and 12,785 for temporary residency. Its refugee and humanitarian cases are processed from Athens.

Aviation: Hawk Aircraft (Question No. 892) Mr Horne asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 30 August 1999: (1) Will the Hawk lead in fighter be phased in as the fighter trainer at RAAF Base Williamtown during 2000. (2) Has his Department conducted an environmental impact statement on the impact of the Hawk aircraft on the area around RAAF Base Williamtown and the Salt Ash Bombing Range; if so, do the noise levels of the Hawk aircraft vary significantly from the existing Macchi trainer. (3) Has his attention been drawn to letters to residents from the commander of RAAF Base Williamtown stating that the noise level contours fo,. the Hawk aircraft are not the responsibility of the RAAF. (4) If it is not the responsibility of the RAAF to determine noise level contours, (a) is it his and his Department's responsibility and (b) will he, as a matter of urgency order that noise level contours for the Hawk aircraft be determined for areas adjacent to RAAF Base Williamtown base and the Salt Ash Bombing Range. (5) What measures will be taken by his Department to ensure that residents in the area around RAAF Base Williamtown and the Salt Ash Bombing Range will not be adversely affected by the variation in aircraft. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No. Data currently available indicates that the noise level of the Hawk aircraft is slightly higher, when compared to the Macchi aircraft at the same flight configuration, power setting and altitude. However, the Hawk will be capable of a higher rate of climb and faster transient speed and is expected, therefore, to have less noise impact on the ground. (3) No. However, correspondence issued by RAAF Base Williamtown on the issue infers that the Defence Estate Organisation within the Department of Defence has prime responsibility for preparing Australian Noise Exposure Forecasts (ANEF). (4) (a) Yes. (b) The Department of Defence will arrange the production of a revised ANEF for RAAF Base WiIliamtown and the Salt Ash Air Weapons Range, following the introduction of the Hawk aircraft. (5) The RAAF is acutely aware of the impact flying training has on the local community near the Salt Ash Air Weapons Range and at RAAF WiIIiamtown and tailors its operations to minimise any disturbance for residents in the area. The introduction of the Hawk aircraft will be closely monitored to ensure its operation accords with this policy.
