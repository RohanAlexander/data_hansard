With the 1996 to be successful-we had been given certain effect.

From that point on, the Howard government's United Nations was completely poisoned.

But that meeting became a wake way ahead. I will never forget sitting in the when the foreign minister of the time, DFAT colleagues-I won't name him-slapped mate-who cares anyway?'

It was very frustrating for the attitude that was evidenced against United on the ground under that great man Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was a good friend of mine, the UN headquarters, with whom I had worked-people Younes. They were all great people, who would forward in Iraq after the terrible problems and legitimacy in that operation because UN processes through and because the war itself was A lot of time was wasted on the ground in bombing of the Canal Hotel.

There was a total lack of the importance of the UN to our neighbours. of not doing her job when, in fact, she was in Africans and the Indonesian Prime Minister. Of that the UN is important to our neighbours and our relationship with Africa is really because of the lack of support of Africa and That was also not understood by the Howard process has been the successful re-engagement the $25 million that was spent on this bid, that was spent on a bid; this was $25 million engagement, which was going to produce a pay off It is not well understood by the coalition that operating in Africa these days.

So it was important for us to re-engage. blue beret-someone who has been very, very engaging with Africa-it was a great delight to is hard for us to work out in fact any country great outcome of the investment and the process. Mr Abbott's comments not only displayed his comments we saw coming from shadow foreign Opposition was like going to a Wallabies match team.

Also, there is no room for the opposition seeks to put forward its critique walk down a path of isolationism in the arguments directly on our region, as if to take an interest to our region, that worries me. When I hear a the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile-one of the one of the most important areas of Australian in astrophysics-I get worried.

I am sure that you, Mr Deputy is experiencing some of these issues, will be what we saw overseas and how we hope that will undertaking very shortly for our report for the as a result of the parliament's annual program of two Asia-Pacific countries. In choosing Canada to the parliament, we were hoping and be learned from the shared experience in those mining activity and the interactions that were populations, and those mining developments. I think we were all hopeful that this would be all surprised at just how much we felt we learned. another country how much relevance there whether they will actually be relevant and contribute question. I think we have come back with a strong from what we saw on our trip that we Before I forget-I do not want to leave it anyone-I say a big thank you particularly to who did a terrific job in distilling our thoughts should be chosen to undertake this trip.

The delegation got off to such member for Riverina will correct me if provincial government in Newfoundland and Labrador government in Labrador City in the western operations have been operating for quite some time. We got a really strong sense from that community is experiencing with expansions going was quite a different attitude-or at least take charge of and drive some of the decision So I got the sense that local government equivalent local governments in Australia and they did have. I am talking about things like mines and very particularly as to the question mining development at the construction phase. had to feel like they were in the I got the very strong sense that the provincial the same page and working together in strong empowerment and engagement with the development talked about the benefit agreement that effectively terms and conditions, which companies agree and local content and royalties come back what they wanted to get out of the development, a very valuable delegation, but we were probably You are never quite sure when you go to will be. You will see interesting things, but to solutions here in Australia is another sense that there are things that we will take will bring into our committee report. till the end because I would hate to overlook Siobhan Leyne, who is the committee secretary, and our arguments for why our committee did a great job on that submission, putting job in organising the program and liaising with Of course, the International and Community I also want to say thank you to the DFAT staff in us.

A similar role was carried out in in Seoul, and Dean Woodgate was there also. International at the embassy in Seoul. we started our trip in Canada. We flew all the which was quite an experience. That is where we a great start, because our very first meeting-the I am wrong-was with representatives from the and also representatives from the local part of the province, where very big iron ore meeting of some of the similarities in what the on in the iron ore industry, but also there more power available to the local government to making around their local community. there were possibly more empowered than our certainly were not afraid to use the powers that planning and licensing powers, both for the of temporary accommodation to facilitate So they really did use whatever powers they driver's seat for their community. and local governments were very much on partnership towards similar goals of community that was going on around them. They companies have to sign up to and about the to, that make sure that benefits like local jobs to the province. They had a very strong view of so it was not just a one-way thing where it was what the company could get out of the resource about what the province and local community We went from there to speak to one of the a Rio Tinto subsidiary. We were very impressed us their taking the initiative. They are not talked to us about how they as a company felt other companies operating in that region to local government, to talk about what was going could be managed while building that shared aspire to and how they could partner with the some of the problems that might arise. So there those expectations of companies and the companies those obligations and be genuine partners in the region. We went from there to Alberta and saw represents Moranbah in my electorate, felt Riverina mentioned, it has something like a are fly in, fly out workers living in camps around last 10 years. So Fort MCMurray gave us a real some of the problems that local communities impressed in Alberta by the initiative, one of provincial government officials, of the coordinating role within the government government look at development that is happening That was sitting within Treasury and the idea approach that we have particularly in Queensland. The Queensland experience is that everything government department just dealing with activities in a fairly piecemeal approach. The an application comes in the provincial government then, across the government, look at all the with the application but with what arises government, with local government involvement, similar to a recommendation that the committee to us by the Mayor of Mount Isa, who is a former and so knows a bit about some of these structural committee to think about. We then went through to a very different think about and had just as much to teach us. more official, focus. As representatives of Australia's friendship with Mongolia, particularly of the establishment of diplomatic relations that friendship and to look for ways that our journey of development and in activity. So there was a very strong view expected to get out of it as well. companies involved, Iron Ore Canada, which is by their attitude and they really described to the only company operating in that region, so they an obligation and took the initiative to bring the the table, together with provincial officials and to be happening and how some of these things picture of what the community could expect and community to get the benefits and ameliorate seemed to be a real environment that fostered seemed to show a willingness to meet Fort MCMurray, which to me, as the member who like Moranbah on steroids. As the member for population of 100,000 but at least half of those the place. The population has doubled in the snapshot of some of the opportunities but also over there are trying to deal with. I was very that was described to us at a meeting in Edmonton Alberta Oil Sands Secretariat. That has a so that the government can take a whole of in the oil sands region and communities. was that it be rather than the very piecemeal is quite reactive and you have got one applications for mining licences and mining Alberta Oil Sands Secretariat is about this: when develops a mechanism by which you can implications of that so you are dealing not just out of that application and how the provincial can respond to some of the issues. It is has heard from Mount Isa council. It was put state minister for resources in Queensland matters. So that is something for the country-but one that gave us just as much to Part of the trip in Mongolia had a different, our parliament, the committee sought to reaffirm given that this year is the 40th anniversary between our two countries. We wanted to reaffirm country can continue to support Mongolia on its making the most of its resources.

Sure, a profit, but they also believe very strongly-and eyes-in creating something which belongs from. Those benefits will come not only through but also through the very significant investments building. Here in Australia, the committee has been for mining to be viable. But then we saw what per cent of the workforce at this copper mine, Mongolian. Rio Tinto surveyed their workforce. here with our families.'
