1,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,Unknown,In this morning's Melbourne Aye it is reported that it is proposed to create a new department to take control of the naval defences of the Commonwealth. I wish to know from the Minister representing the Minister for Defence what truth there is in that report.,14
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"This is the first that I have heard of the matter. I think the report must refer to a casual remark of mine-that I thought that there should bo one department for the control of our naval defences, instead of a department in each State, as there is at 'the present time. I do not know whether it will be possible to deal with that matter at present, or whether it will have to remain in abeyance; but I think the present arrangement a bad one. METEOROLOGICAL DEPARTMEN T Mr L. E. GBOOM - I should like to know from the Minister representing the Prime Minister, what is the present position in regard to the negotiations with respect to taking over the Meteorological department of Queensland 1",14
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have despatched a telegram to the Premier of Queensland, informing him that the Government consent to the temporary arrangement suggested by him in connection with the tentative proposal .which he has submitted to the Premiers of the other States. It involves upon our part the continuance of the telegraphic and postal facilities which the Queensland bureau has hitherto enjoyed. I hope the House will shortly have an opportunity to consider this and similar concessions when dealing with the Postal Rates-Bill. REMISSION OF FODDER DUTIES.",14
4,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Is the Minister representing the Postmaster-General prepared to make an announcement in connection with the suggested remission of the duties upon fodder?,14
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I hope to have an in terview with the Attorney-General of New South Wales this afternoon, and afterwards to be able to make an announcement to the House upon the subject. NA",15
6,Mr HUGHES,NEW SOUTH WALES NAVAL,"H as the Minister for Home A f fair s arrived at any determination, and if so what, in regard to the naval forces of N e w South Wales ?",15
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES NAVAL,"I have n ot com. pleted the new proposals, but their preparat i on is far advanced, and they will show some retrenchment. I cannot, however, give the honourable member any details, because the scheme is not so complete that it may not be slightly altered. SUPPLIES FOR SOUTH AFRICA .",15
8,Mr GLYNN,NEW SOUTH WALES NAVAL,"Yes t e r d a y the Minister for Home A f fair s, in reply to questions asked by the honourable members for South Australia, Sir Langdon B o n y t h o n and Mr . V . L . Solomon, stated that the prices for supplies for South A f r i c a asked by South Australian tenderers were much higher than those asked by V i c to r i a n tenderers. I forwarded to South. Australia the following letter which I received from the department upon the subject. I am directed to inform yon that in connection Cap, Crimean with some recent South Australian tenders for Housewife supplies, to the South African contingents, the Cholera Belt attention of the Minister has been called to the Adapting Jackets, to fit 0 9 0 very high rates for some of the articles as comAdapting Pantaloons, to 0 5 0 pared with the prices paid in other States. - The reply I have received from a South K it Bags Australia n merchant is as followsRunning down through the schedules published Squad Bags in the Commonwealth Gazette, we are forced to the Horse Blankets conclusion thab the very reverse is the case, and Razors that South Australian prices are very much lower Bugles than the Melbourne prices. Would you ask the Minister for Defence if he would kindly compare the price of bandoliers here and in Melbourne The price of sets of saddlery here and in Melwere bourne. On the rates which are higher, for 7s. each. instance,, k it bags and section bags, our contract for supplies in the colony of this line is only 2s. 9d. for k it bags, whereas k it bags land were 5s. 6d., and Victoria 4s. each. The ki t bags supplied to the contingents were different to the ordinary kit bags, in that they were made of tan canvas, water-proof lined. The one liue costing us 6s. a yard for material, the other under Is. There were no standard samples to which to tender for these lines. blankets were made specially good quality at !)s. 6d., and were cheap at the price, whereas those supplied to the Victorian contingent 38 A 2 of quite different material altogether. Victoria charged 6s. each for her head ropes, South Australia's price was Is. 6d. So on with many other lines we could reply to Mr Collins'unfair remarks. The only line in which there were standard samples to tender to, and on which there is any comparison between both colonies, was the sets of saddlery. Even in these our price was lower than Victoria; we have a good reply to it if the FORCE S. question ever arises in the House. Has the Minister any reply to make to these statements ? If they are true, should he not m o d if y w h a the said yesterday in regard to the t w o sets of prices, afte r a bald comparison of the prices themselves with o u t regard to quality or other explanation ?",15
9,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES NAVAL,"I cannot come t/o any conclusion immediately, from the figures which the honourable and learned member has read out, but the informatio n which has been supplied to me on the subject is as follows W i th reference to the contracts submitted from South Australia, in connection with the Australian Commonwealth Horse, I would call attention to the very big prices of some of the articles compared with the prices afc which they could be purchased in this StateArticle.

U p o n that I wrote the following minute :The difference between the South Australian and Victorian prices is very considerable, and in and many cases the South Australian charges ""aro exorbitant. I think they should have been Horse referred to head-quarters before acceptance. . Mr Glynn - In view of the diswere crepancy between the statement which I have read and the document quoted by the Minister, will he inquire fully, not only into the prices asked, but also in regard to the quality of the articles supplied, and the general conditions regarding the tenders, and put fully before the House the true position of affairs 1",15
10,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES NAVAL,"There may be some difficulty in obtaining information as to the quality of the articles supplied, because they have been sent away from the State, but I shall make further inquiries. The document which I have read is the only one which has been laid before me. It is an official paper, and no doubt compiled from the actual price-lists in the possession - of the Defence department.",16
11,Mr GLYNN,NEW SOUTH WALES NAVAL,"Althoug h there may be .some difficulty in testing the comparative prices of the goods in relation to their qualities, will the Minister do all in his power to .test the fairness of the comparisons which have been made on his official list from the point of view of quality as well as price. In - the letter which has been sent to me, it is stated that the k it bags and horse blankets which appear on the Minister's list as being supplied at higher prices were quoted at lower prices in the South Australian tender than in the other States, while the quality of the horse blankets supplied under the South Australian contract is stated to be much better than that of those supplied by the Victorian tenderers.",16
12,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES NAVAL,"I shall do all I <can to test whether the articles supplied .under the South Australian contract were of better quality than the Victorian articles for which prices were quoted. At the same time, I may say that from the experience I have had in the past the articles supplied by the Victorian manufacturers are fairly good. - COMMONWEALTH STATUTES.",16
13,Mr HIGGINS,NEW SOUTH WALES NAVAL,"Will the Minister presenting the Prime Minister make arrangements to supply the public with copies of the Commonwealth statutes at a price no higher than is necessary to pay the expenses in connection with their publication 1 It has been the practice of the Victorian Government to make a profit out of the sale of public statutes, but I think that is a mistake.",16
14,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WALES NAVAL,"I think that what the honourable and learned member desires is being done. I had recently an interview with the Government Printer, during which he suggested a scale of charges, commencing I think, at 3d. an Act, and increasing according to bulk.",16
15,Mr HIGGINS,NEW SOUTH WALES NAVAL,Copie s of Victorian Acts cost from Is. 6d. to 5s. each.,16
16,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WALES NAVAL,I do not think that any of the Commonwealth statutes will cost more than Is. 6d. NA IMMIGRANTS.,16
17,Mr THOMAS,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister, ' tuithout, notice, whether he has noticed a report which appeared in the newspapers of yesterday that certain Mexican and Greek immigrants were prevented from entering New South Wales at Albury 1. The report states When the express reached Albury the Customs officers refused to let the foreigners land in New South Wales, and the whole batch, numbering 38, were taken back to Wodonga by the train which brought them over. No accommodation could be secured for them for the night, so they camped the best way they could in the vicinity oÂ£ the Wodonga railway station. Rain fell during the night, but the platform afforded shelter. The difficulty reached an acute stage this morning, when one of the women became unwell. A room at the station was placed at her disposal, and a few hours later she gave birth to a daughter. I should like to know whether the report is correct, and if so, why these people were allowed to land in Melbourne. If 'it were right to allow them to land in Melbourne why were the)' prevented from entering New South Wales 1 I should also like to know whether, in the event of any further immigrants of a similar character being permitted to land here, the Minister will do all in his power to prevent a repetition of barbarity such as that referred to ?",16
18,Mr DEAKIN,MEXICANAND GREE K,"The Commonwealth reGovernment are responsible for allowing these people to land in Melbourne. Hearing that they had arrived, I arranged to secure the services of the most experienced officer in Charge of immigration affairs- Mr O'Brien - who subjected the intending settlers to a very severe test, and was entirely satisfied. In view, however, of the reports in the newspapers as to the undesirable character of a previous party of these immigrants who had been allowed to pass into New South ""Wales, and, in order to make assurance doubly sure, I sent a second special officer from the department to examine them. This gentleman was satisfied that they were what they ported to be, hard - working agriculturists. They were possessed of money sufficient to provide for their immediate requirements, and of letters of credit that probably represented a good deal more. There appeared to be no reason why they should be rejected. Consequently were admitted to the Commonwealth, and for that we are responsible. U p to the sent time, however, the States Acts lating to the exclusion of undesirable immithe grants have been enforced inland, and we are not in any way responsible for any notion taken by the States Governments under those Acts.",16
19,Mr THOMAS,MEXICANAND GREE K,In whose employ is the officer in Albury who prevented the migrants from entering New South upon Wales?,17
20,Mr DEAKIN,MEXICANAND GREE K,"He is a Commonwealth officer, but in this case was acting for State. Mr THO.MAS - Then there are two masters more akin for the one officer ?",17
21,Mr DEAKIN,MEXICANAND GREE K,Yes .,17
22,Mr THOMAS,MEXICANAND GREE K,"It is about time a of change was made. In view of the very unence. satisfactory working of the Immigration Restriction Act, and of the education test applied under it , does not the Minister think that it would have been better to adopt the colour test, as was proposed when the Bill was under discussion ?",17
23,Mr DEAKIN,MEXICANAND GREE K,"In the first place, I respectfully deny that the A ct is failing its purpose. I would direct the honourable member's attention to the fact that not single coloured alien entered the Commonwill wealth last month, and if any have entered this month I am not aware of it .",17
24,Mr THOMAS,MEXICANAND GREE K,It was not intended to keep out those who were not coloured.,17
25,Mr DEAKIN,MEXICANAND GREE K,"We are not doing so. STANDING ORDERS COMMITTEE. Resolved (on motion by Sir WILLIAM paratively unimportant, LYNE)That Mr Deakin be a member of the Standing Orders Committee during the leave of absence granted to Mr Barton. ELECTORAL BILL . SECOND READING.",17
26,Sir W ILLIAMLYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Hume-Minis purter for Home Affairs - I move That the Bill be now read, a second time. I am very glad to have an opportunity during the first session of this Parliamentto introduce this Bill, which I hope will meet with the approval of honourable members. The trouble that was experiencedthey during the last federal elections points strongly to the necessity of passing a measpreure of this kind without any unnecessary redelay. Honourable members are aware that Bill was first introduced into this Chamber, but that, owing to the pressure of business, it was withdrawn from the noticer paper, and submitted for the consideration of the Senate. It has been passed by the other branch of the Legislature, and is now presented for our consideration. The Elecimtoral Acts of the States have been drawn as far as possible in the framing of this measure. The States Electoral Acts differ very widely, and this measure will producethe harmony and uniformity of method and. action. Many of the provisions are to the Acts of South Australia and Western Australia than to those in force in the other States. I venture to think, further, that it will be one the most liberal electoral laws in existCertainly the Bill as it stands contains more liberal provisions than are to befound in any of the State Acts, and the Commonwealth is to be congratulated upon the fact that the measure has been pressed , forward to its present position, and that no further general election will take place except under its provisions. This Bill worked in in conjunction with the Franchise Act, which recentty became law, willperhaps bring abouta many changes; but I believe that they be of a wholesome and democratic character. I have always felD that it is best to confer a liberal franchise, and to pass liberal electoral laws. In explaining this measure I shall refrain, as far as possible, from dealing with details of a minute character. I shall refer briefly to the more important provisions of the Bill, in the order in which they appear. The greater part of Part I . is combut clause 4 contains a special provision that the Bill shall not apply to any by-election that may take place during the continuance of the present House of Representatives. It would have been almost impossible to apply the provisions of this measure to any by-election for some time to come, because honourable members must recognise that a great deal of work will be involved in the framing of the new rolls.",17
27,Mr WILKS,MEXICANAND GREE K,Could we not have a general election until this Bill is passed 1,18
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,Yes; but we should have to use the existing rolls.,18
29,Mr WILKS,MEXICANAND GREE K,Then there is no urgent necessity to pass this Bill.,18
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I think there is. My experience is that it is necessary at frequent intervals to revise the rolls. In New South Wales the rolls have in times past become very much overloaded with the names of persons who were no longer entitled to hold electoral rights. Within fifteen months after the last referendum we revised the rolls in New South Wales, and made 250,000 alterations. As I stated the other evening, the process of purging the rolls is being carried out as far* as that is practicable at the present time under the existing law. But it is only possible to purge them to a very limited extent, because no such provisions are extant as those contained in this Bill. In clause 4, provision is made that this Act shall not apply to the election of a new member to fill any vacancy happening in this Chamber during the continuance of the present House of Representatives. could not very well be made applicable to - such an election for a variety of reasons, one of which is that if a State which at present returns its representatives as one constituency were subdivided, we should have to select some particular district, instead of the whole State, to elect the new member. Though the Bill was originally framed with that object in view, I found upon analysing the question that, owing to the intricacies and difficulties which surround it, it was really impossible to give effect to the original intention. Thus it is that clause 4 has been inserted in the Bill. Part II . deals with the general administration, which, to some extent, resembles the general administration in most of the States, with this difference-that we now provide for one chief electoral officer, and also for an electoral officer in each State to control the elections x in that State. The latter will be subject only to the Chief Electoral Officer. In addition to that, power is given to appoint a returning officer for each division. That officer will be under the chief electoral officer of the State, as the latter is subordinate to the chief electoral officer of the Commonwealth. In dealing with this question I do not wish honourable members to become alarmed at the extra expense involved in the appointment of new officers. We have recently heard a good deal about the appointment of officers in my department, although, as I have previously stated, that department is very meanly administered. We intend, as far as possible, to utilize the services of existing Commonwealth officers in the performance of all the work that is necessary. They will be chiefly postal officials and such others as can be efficiently utilized for the service. They may have to be paid a small additional sum for the services required of them, but I wish it to be distinctly understood that it is not intended to appoint an entirely new staff to cope with this work. Power is also given to appoint assistant returning officers, if necessary, for such districts as the Northern Territory, &c, 'as well as electoral registrars. These are the main features of Part II . of the Bill.",18
31,Mr MCCAY,MEXICANAND GREE K,Will the divisional returning officers be public servants 1,18
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Not necessarily. In some cases it may be impossible to get public servants to perforin It this work, but as .far as practicable it is intended that those undertaking it shall be Commonwealth officers. I believe that in the Postal department we shall be able to secure nearly all the public servants required, but if not, we may utilize the services of the inspectors under the Public Service Act, or those of other Commonwealth officers. Part III . is an important one, because it creates the divisions of each State, so far as the House of Representatives is concerned. Save for dealing with general elections, this Bill refers more particularly to the House of Representatives than to the Senate. It is proposed to appoint three commissioners to subdivide each State. That practice has been adopted in one of the States upon a previous occasion, and it has also been followed in other countries, notably in England and New Zealand. It is better to deal with the matter in this way than for the Government to undertake the work themselves. . Of course, there should be no inducement to define the boundaries of a division in other than a fair manner; but if the Government undertook the task, they might possibly be accused of cutting up the electorates in a way to suit their own party.  commissioners for each State ?",18
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I cannotanswer that question at the present time. I think it is mote than likely that one or two commissioners will act in all cases, and that in determining the limits of the electorates, they will be assisted by a gentleman who has been for a considerable time resident in the particular State affected. They will thus be less liable to error than would otherwise be the case.",19
34,Mr A MCLEAN,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Do these divisions refer to the existing electorates, or will they involve the creation of new electorates ?",19
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,I am speaking of the subdivision of those States which at present vote as one constituency for the return of members of the House of Representatives.,19
36,Mr A MCLEAN,MEXICANAND GREE K,A r e not the States already divided ?,19
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"No ; for intions ? stance, Tasmania and South Australia elect representatives voting as one constituency.",19
38,Mr MCCAY,MEXICANAND GREE K,Is it proposed to re-divide those States which are already divided ?,19
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"N ot unless I that course is considered absolutely necesmore sary. The Bill does not compel done. ""For instance, in New South Wales or Victoria, which have already been there divided into electorates for the members to this House, population may have increased in one division and decreased in another, and the variation of the boundaries of a division may therefore betime. come necessary. The commissioners will deal with these alterations of boundaries.",19
40,Mr THOMSON,MEXICANAND GREE K,"There is the female vote to be considered, too.",19
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Yes. The I female vote will be exercised to a greater less extent in every State, and consequently will cause a re-arrangement where such found necessary.  become permanent oflicers ?",19
42,Sir WLLIAMLYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Not necessarily the honourable member need not be alarmed upon the score of expense.  expense about which I am concerned, but I thought that the Minister might have a few more New South Wales friends.",19
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"That is not a very kind remark to make, seeing that I am dealing with States other than New South Wales. When the honourable member refers to "" my friends in New South Wales"" he should recollect that, having lived in that State for so long, I know more of the personal attributes of men there than I do of individuals in other States, who no doubt are quite as worthy. These divisions are to be made upon a population basis. ' They are to be based upon a quota, and the quota will be found by dividing the total number of electors in any State by the number of members which it can return. There is a somewhat elastic but necessary provision that the quota of electors shall be the basis for the distribution of the divisions, and shall be adhered to as nearly as practicable, but may be departed from to the extent of one-fourth, more or less.",19
44,Mr MCCAY,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Is it proposed that the commissioners shall exercise their discretion, or will they receive Ministerial instruc",19
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"They will exercise their discretion, but they are not to go either above or below one-fourth. The principle of the Bill is equal representation. f the number of electors exceed 1,000,' or less, the reason for not adhering to it to be the quota must be stated.",19
46,Mr A MCLEAN,MEXICANAND GREE K,Does that mean that is to be an equal population in town return of and country electorates ?,19
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,Yes .,19
48,Mr A MCLEAN,MEXICANAND GREE K,Then the Government will never carry it ; they will have a lively,19
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I may tell honourable members that I gave one Ministry in New South Wales a lively time upon this very question, but I was defeated upon it . am quite sure that the honourable member or for Gippsland will not give me a lively time in connection with it , because at is heart I am with him, but I know what the people want. I do not propose a variation between town and country, such as I am inclined to favour, because it will be recog- nised that the Government must concede what they conceive the bulk of the people require. I repeat that there is an elastic provision in the Bill which permits of the otherwise hard and fast rule in relation to the quota of electors as the basis for the distribution of the divisions being departed from to the extent of one-fourth or one-fifth, below or above what would actually constitute equal representation. The divisions have to be laid before Parliament, and I would direct particular attention to the fact that on a resolution of either House disapproving of ' any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the commissioners to propose a new distribution. The report and map have to be laid before Parliament within seven days after their receipt, if the House is in session, and if not, within seven days after its next meeting. Both Houses of the Legislature must pass a resolution approving of any proposed distribution before the Governor General can proclaim it, and either House may cause a fresh or new distribution. The principal instruction which is given to the commissioners is that they must pay serious regard to three points, namely, community or diversity of interest, means of communication, and ""the physical features of the country. These three points must be considered, but otherwise the commissioners have a reasonably free hand, and are not subject to undue influence on the part of Ministers. Part IV . deals with polling places. It gives power to proclaim and annul polling places in any locality 'which is desired in the public interest. P a r t V . deals with the electoral rolls, and it is proposed to have a separate roll for each division. The rolls for each division will be so subdivided that an elector may see at a glance the polling place at which he has to record his vote. A similar plan works very well in New South Wales.",19
50,Mr MCCAY,MEXICANAND GREE K,Will there be one subdivision for every polling place 1,20
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"No ; but the roil will be grouped in polling places, and the rolls will show where the electors are to vote.",20
52,Mr OMALLEY,MEXICANAND GREE K,Can an elector vote in any part of the district?,20
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"He may, under certain conditions, which I shall explain. Under clause 33 any person is entitled to have his name placed on the roll, copies of which will be exhibited. All persons qualified to vote at any election lor the Senate or House of Representatives, or who would be qualified so to vote if their names were ' iiijon a roll, shall be qualified and entitled to have their names placed upon the' electoral roll for the division in which they reside.",20
54,Mr GLYNN,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Has the Minister noticed that, under section 41 of the Constitution, any person eligible for the local roll may vote at Commonwealth elections, whether or not he is on the Commonwealth roll ?",20
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I shall deal with that matter later on. In reply to the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, I may say that power is given under sections -120 to 124 to issue voting certificates for, I think, three days before polling day to persons who expect that they will not be able to be at a particular polling place on election day. These certificates entitle an elector to vote at any place in the electorate where he may be on the dav of election.",20
56,Mr THOMAS,MEXICANAND GREE K,Where is the necessity for a certificate ? A man ought to be able to vote at any place in his own electorate.,20
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I know that this provision in the Bill will be discussed, but I have dealt with a great many knotty questions as fairly as I could. I do not pretend to say that the B i ll cannot be improved, and I shall be glad of the assistance of honourable members in committee. Clauses 40 to 55, and 70 to 88 very liberally provide for appeal courts, revision courts, and supplementary rolls, which may be issued immediately before an election. Part VI . deals with additions to and alterations of rolls and transfers of names. Clause 57 provides that claims may be made under Eorm B, which honourable members will see on reference to the schedules. If a person resides, it may be, a great many miles from where there is a registrar, or an electoral officer, he may make application, on receiving which the registrar is compelled to place his name upon the roll, even in the absence of any witnesses as to bona fides. I a m rather inclined to think that that is almost too liberal a provision, and that it would be wise to have the application supported by the signatures of one or two persons known to the registrar. When the lists are exhibited any one may object to a claim on givin"" twenty days' notice, and the claimant, if he feels that he is being unfairly objected to, may depute an agent to act. for him instead of travelling perhaps hundreds of miles in order to appear in person.",20
58,Mr HIGGINS,MEXICANAND GREE K,Is there no official whose duty it is to watch the lists 1,20
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,Only the registrar. - Mr OMALLEY - There ought to be no objections.,21
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I ask the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, to be fair and reasonable. If there be no provision for objections, what can be done if a name appears on the rolls which ought not to be there? I hope the proposals will be keenly criticised when we come to deal with them in committee, but in the meantime I am explaining the provisions of the Bill. As to transfers, an elector who has resided in any other division may have his name transferred.",21
61,Mr MCCAY,MEXICANAND GREE K,What happens if an election takes place during that month ?,21
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,In that case the elector will not have resided a month in the new division.,21
63,Mr MCCAY,MEXICANAND GREE K,And he loses his vote because he has ceased to reside in the first division ?,21
64,Mr SPEAKER,MEXICANAND GREE K,"This is a discussion on the second reading of the principles of the Bill, and details ought to be thrashed out not in the House, but in committee.",21
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I am very glad to hear, expressions of opinion as I proceed because they give me an opportunity of judging the feeling and temper of honourable members on various points. There is only one alternative to the proposal in the Bill, and that is to have no term of residence. We might, of course, reduce the term to a week, a fortnight, or three weeks, but there must be some arbitrary period fixed if a residence condition is to be enforced.",21
66,Mr OMALLEY,MEXICANAND GREE K,A day is sufficient.,21
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"But very serious abuses might creep in by an unexpected swarming. The Bil l provides that there is to be no alteration of the roll between the date of the issue of the writ and the closing of the poll except for transfers. Th6 date for the holding of revision courts will be fixed by proclamation. A revision court will be held before any election, especially a general election, and it is compulsory to have a revision of the rolls at least once in three years. Part VIII . deals with writs for elections.  be returned ?",21
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"In the elections for the Senate, the Commonwealth electoral officer will return the writ to the Governor of the State in which ' it was issued. In the elections for the House of Representatives the returning officer will return them through the Commonwealth Electoral Office. ",21
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"In some cases they are issued by the Speaker and the President, and in the case of a dissolution they are issued by the Governor General. Writs* for the election of senators or members of the House of Representatives may be in the form (-! or H respectively in the schedule, and shallfixthe dates for(ft) The nomination. \b) The polling, and (c) The return of the writ. I desire to direct attention to this foot-note in the Bill *See sections J2, 32, and 33 of the Constitution. 12. The Governor of any State may cause writs to be issued for the elections of senators for the State. In case of the dissolution of the Senate, the writs shall be issued within ten days from the proclamation of such dissolution. 32. The Governor General in Council may cause writs to be issued for general elections of members of the House of Representatives. After the first general election, the writs shall be issued within ten days from the expiry of a House of Representatives, or from the proclamation of a dissolution thereof. 33. Whenever a vacancy happens in the House of Representatives, the Speaker shall issue his writ for the election of a new member, or if there is no Speaker, or if he. is absent-from the Commonwealth, the Governor General in Council may issue the writ. That, I think, answers the question of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Poynton. Nominations must be made within from seven days to 21 clays of the issue of the writ, and the polling must take place from seven days to 30 days after the nomination. The general elections for the House of Representatives are to be held on the same da\\ And at the same time, I think the spirit of the Bill is that the Senate elections shall all be held on the same day. And they may, when practicable, be held on the same day as the elections for the House of Representatives.",21
70,Mr GLYNN,MEXICANAND GREE K,"It does not matter in the case of the Senate, the members of which are elected by each State as a whole.",21
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,That is so; but I think the spirit of the measure is that the Senate elections shall be on the one date.  In the case of a dissolution the Senate is not dissolved.,21
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I am afraid there is some misconception. It is proposed that the members of the House of Representatives shall all be elected on the same day, and that the senators shall be elected on the same day, so far as they themselves are concerned. The two Houses are absolutely dissevered, but I-think the same principle should be acted on in regard to both Houses.",22
73,Mr WATSON,MEXICANAND GREE K,"In the case of a double dissolution, expense would be saved by having all the elections on one day.",22
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"That cannot be provided for in the Bill, but I should think that in the case of a double dissolution, or on the expiration of Parliament, it would be wiser to have all the elections at once, and thus save expense.",22
75,Mr LE GROOM,MEXICANAND GREE K,That could be done by administration.,22
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Of course it could. Part IX . of the Bill deals with nominations, clause 99 providing :Ho nomination shall be valid unlessf a j The person nominated consents to act if elected. (h) The nomination paper is received after the issue of the writ and before the hour of nomination. (<:) The person nominated, or some person on .his behalf, deposits with the Commonwealth electoral officer or divisional returning officer at the time of the delivery of the nomination paper the sum of twenty-five pounds in money or in bank notes or in a bankers cheque.",22
77,Mr HIGGINS,MEXICANAND GREE K,If clause 99 be read with clause 3 it will be seen that the nominations must be made three months before the day of election.,22
78,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,I do not think that applies in this case.,22
79,Mr GLYNN,MEXICANAND GREE K,It applies to offences under the Act j it does not apply to nominations.,22
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Nominatio n papers must be signed by six electors. Clause 104-, which is a very important one, provides thatJfo nomination shall be rejected by reason of any formal defect or error therein if the Commonwealth electoral officer or officer receiving the nomination is satisfied that the provisions of this Act have been substantially complied with. If the measure were now in force effect would have been given to that connection with the petition in regard to the recent Tasmanian election. Part X . is one of the most important in the Bill, and embodies a principle which is almost a novel one, though it has been partly recognised heretofore in some of the States. Clause .109 provides for application being made for "" postal vote certificates,"" and clause 112 shows how an elector who has received such a certificate is to record his vote. If an elector resides more than five miles from the polling place, or thinks that he is likely to be absent on polling day from the polling place at which he is entitled to vote, or will be prevented by serious illness or infirmity from attending there on polling day, he can apply to the returning officer for the division in which he resides for a postal vote certificate. The Bill provides for voting by post in much the same manner as the voting of the members of some of our insurance companies, and especially of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, is done. An elector who has received a postal vote certificate will get with it a postal ballot-paper, with a counterfoil attached, and also an envelope addressed to the returning officer at the chief polling places of the division. He must then go before a ""postmaster, officer, police, stipendiary, special magistrate, or head master of a State school,"" and record his vote in the presence of such officer, but in such a manner that the contents of his ballot-paper will be secret. Having marked the ballot-paper in the manner prescribed by the Bill, and signed his name on the counterfoil, he must enclose it , with the counterfoil attached, and witnessed by the officer before whom the voting is done, in the special envelope, and hand it to a postmaster for posting, or post it at a post-office. When it is received by the officer conducting the scrutiny, he, without unfolding the ballot-paper, or allowing it to be inspected, must compare the signature on the counterfoil with the signature to the application, and allow the scrutineers to inspect both, and if the vote is allowed he must tear off the counterfoil, and insert the ballot-paper in the ballot-box ; but this will be done in such a manner that no one will be able to ascertain for whom the elector divisional returning has voted.",22
81,Mr OMALLEY,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Will the candidate's agent be able to take postmasters round the country with him, as is occasionally done in provision in South Australia?",22
82,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I have not heard-of that being done, but no doubt the honourable member's experience will prove of value to the House. As every one knows, a large part of the population of States like Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia is always travelling about. Teamsters, drovers, labourers, shearers, cane cutters, and seamen are constantly on the move, and the provisions to which I have referred have been inserted in the Bill in order to prevent their disfranchisement. I believe that some honourable members desire a still further extension of the principle, but I think that these provisions are very liberal, and I hope that the House will regard them as adequate. Part XI . deals with voters' certificates, and Part XII . with the polling. The schedule contains a copy of the form of the ballot-papers which are to be used. These ballot-papers will have a square opposite the name of each candidate, and the elector, instead of striking out either the name of the candidate for whom he wishes to vote, or the names of those to whose return he is opposed - both of which practices prevail in the States - must indicate his vote by making a cross in the square opposite the name of the candidate, if the election is for the Senate; and by placing the number "" 1 "" in the square opposite the name of the candidate for whom he wishes to vote in the first instance, and the numbers, "" 2,"" "" 3,"" "" 4,"" and so on in the squares opposite the names of the remaining candidates, to indicate the order of his preferences for them, if the election is for a member of the House of Representatives. When the Bill was before the Senate, it was proposed that what was called the principle of exhaustive votingunder which the balance of the votes cast for a candidate who has obtained the quota, and is therefore elected, are distributed amongst the other candidates in a certain way-shoul d be adopted in regard to Senate elections, but it was not agreed to, and the ordinary arrangement will continue in regard to them. In regard to elections to the House of Representatives the system of contingent voting has been provided for. The ballot papers are numbered in the way I have described, and where there are more candidates than one the votes indicated by the number "" 1 "" are first counted, and if no candidate then obtains an absolute majority a second count is made. On this second count the candidate obtaining the least number of votes is rejected, and the ballot-papers counted to him must be added to the votes obtained by the remaining candidates, according to the order indicated on the ballot papers, but so that each ballot-paper is counted only once, and the exhausted ballot papers rejected. If no candidate then obtains an absolute majority, the process must be repeated until one candidate does obtain an absolute majority, the candidate to be rejected in each instance being the candidate with the least number of votes. That system, which is a modification of the system which is now in use in Queensland, is outlined in clause 165.  rotten system. Sir ' WILLIAM LYNE - I shall be glad to hear the honourable member's criticism of it later on. Part XIV . provides for the return of the writs. Clause 169 provides that the Commonwealth electoral officer for the State in which the election is held shall, as soon as conveniently may be after the result of the election has been ascertained, declare the result, and return the writ to the Governor of the State in which it ' was issued. Of course, a date will in every case be fixed for the return of writs, but it may sometimes happen that because of floods, droughts, or other reasons it will be impossible to return them by that date, and under the provision I have read any informality in that regard will be overcome. Part XV . deals with thelimitation of electoral expenses, clause 173 providing that in elections for the Senate no candidate shall exceed an expenditure of Â£250, and, in elections for the House of Representatives, an expenditure of Â£ 1 0 0. I do not think that those sums are too large. I , know that in my own case travelling expenses and printer's bills have often cost me more than Â£100. Part XVI . deals with electoral offences, such as breaches of duty, bribery, undue influence, and other offences under the A.ct. The provisions in this part are similar to those contained in the various States Acts, and I do not think there is any need to refer to them in detail. Part XVII . deals with the Court of disputed returns. It is proposed to remove the dealing with election petitions from the control of the Committees of Elections and Qualifications, to which such matters are now referred, and have them tried by the Full High Court, but until the establishment of the High Court the Supreme Court of each State will be the court of disputed returns. The High Court is to have jurisdiction either to try the petition, or refer it for trial to the Supreme Court of the State for which the election was held or the return made, and the powers conferred by the clause-198maybe exercised by a single Justice or Judge. A case occurred in regard to a disputed election for the Senate in Western Australia last year, which illustrates the wisdom of this latter provision. If such a case should occur in the future, the High Court, instead of trying the petition itselr, may refer it for trial to the Supreme Court of Australia, and the matter will be settled there at much less cost to the parties, and with much less inconvenience to the witnesses and all concerned, than if it had to be tried in the State in which the High Court was sitting. While I do not think that any great objection will be taken to these provisions, I whether it is wise to require these matters to be referred to the Full Court. XVIII. contains miscellaneous provisions. Under clause 212 all electoral papers may be transmitted through the post free of charge, and, under clause 213, where it is impracticable to communicate by post without undue delay, any telegraphic advice will suffice as though the matter graphed had been communicated in the manner provided by the Act. Clause 215 gives the Governor General power to make regulations for carrying out the Act: but all such regulations must be notified in the Gazette and laid before both Houses of Parliament within 30 sitting after the the making, if Parliament is in session, and if not, then 30 days after - its next meeting. very important matters are not provided for in the Bill at present. there should be some improvement upon the present arrangement under which allowances are made to honourable members. For various reasons, honourable members may not be able to attend the House to be sworn in, and, in some cases, Parliament may not meet for some four or five months after an election. It is rather hard, under such circumstances, to deny an honourable member payment of his allowance until he can take the oath. I do not propose that the allowances shall commence from the <SiV William Lyne. date of election, but from the return of the writ.",23
83,Mr SALMON,MEXICANAND GREE K,An honourable member may refuse to take the oath subsequently.,24
84,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"That would be a very extreme case. It may be stipulated that an honourable member shall not receive his pay until he takes the oath, but he should be entitled to receive pay from the date upon which the writ was returned. Another matter which was referred to when the Franchise Bill was under discussion was the definition of the word "" residence,"" regarding which we must be very careful. In the larger States, where persons are travelling about for the best part Western of their time, and have no permanent place of residence, it is very unfair that they should be disfranchised owing to any technicality, and I hope, with the assistance of honourable members, to insert a provision that will prevent the possibility of any voter being prevented from exercising the vote simply because he has no permanent place of abode. question I think we ought also to consider whether it is possible to frame a provision other than Part that which is now included in the Bill for voting by post. If I can frame any provision that will render it more easy for electors to vote in any part of the State in which they may be on the day of election, I shall do so. I have not taken up more time than has been necessary to explain briefly and clearly tele- the most important parts of the Bill.",24
85,Mr HIGGINS,MEXICANAND GREE K,The Minister has not mentioned the Hare - Spence system of voting.,24
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"There has been no occasion to do so, because it is not emdays bodied in the Bill. I am glad that I have not been called upon to explain the Harewithin Spence system of voting, because I found it Three very difficult to understand, and I must admit that Professor Nanson's explanation I think left me a little more in the dark than I was before. I hope honourable members will give me their assistance in improving the Bill. I have tried to frame it upon the most reasonable and liberal lines, so that every facility shall be afforded for every man and woman to exercise on the day of election the broad and liberal franchise which has now become law under the Commonwealth Franchise Act.  plain what the Bill proposes in regard to scrutinies ? Is a scrutiny to be held at each polling place, as in Victoria?",24
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"The scrutiny will take place wherever the polling papers are counted. Debate (on motion by Mr Glynn) adjourned. In Committee: Consideration resumed from 4th June (vide page 13310). POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. Division No. 131 (Expenditure in New South Wales), Â£787,513.",25
88,Mr GLYNN,MEXICANAND GREE K," I wish to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to one or two complaints which have been forwarded to me with reference to tenders for supplies to the department. I believe that, according to the rules under which tenders for supplies are called, samples are supposed to be provided for inspection by intending tenderers in all the capitals, but that rule not been observed. Where tenders have been called for supplies required in Queensland or in Tasmania, samples have been sent from those States to Adelaide ; but where tenders have been called for supplies required in Melbourne or Sydney, samples have not been sent to South Australia. This seems to be a case of partiality, perhaps due to carelessness rather than intent, and a change should be made as soon as possible. Through the absence of samples, the merchants and manufactures in Adelaide are precluded from tendering for supplies in the more important States. tenders were called for the supply of telephone arid telegraphic material for twelve months. Tender's were to be handed in by 1st July, and the advertisements in the . Commomuealth Gazette stated that the schedule .and specifications were to be obtained in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, and Hobart, where samples might be seen. I am informed by letter this morning that some Adelaide firms, on applying to the comptroller of the stores in that city, found that no samples had been sent to him. Of course, it will be impossible for Adelaide merchants and manufacturers to tender unless samples are provided for their inspection, and I hope that there will be no repetition of this negligence on the part of the postal authorities.",25
89,Mr THOMSON,MEXICANAND GREE K," The Minister did not mention anything with reference to the payments to be made by the States for services l-endered by officers of the Post and Telegraph departments in connection with the Post-office Savings Banks and the payment of old-age pensions SUPPLY. through the post-offices. I should like to know whether the Commonwealth is paying its servants to perform this work for the States, or whether we are to be recouped.",25
90,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MEXICANAND GREE K," The claim of the Commonwealth to compensation for the services rendered under the circumstances referred to has been recognised, and negotiations are now taking place with a view to arriving at some satisfactory arrangement.",25
91,Mr MAHON,MEXICANAND GREE K," It is the practice of the Postal department when calling for tenders for the annual mail contracts to insert huge advertisements in the newspapers of the capital cities throughout the Commonwealth. For example, an advertisement occupying a whole page, will has sometimes appear in a Melbourne journal, inviting tenders for mail contracts in Gippsland and other remote parts of the State. The people who are likely to tender for such contracts, probably never see these advertisements, and their insertion is nothing more nor less than gross extravagance. Why should not a small advertisement only be given to the daily newspapers, directing attention to the fact that the ful l text of the advertisement inviting tenders may be found in the Commonwealth Gazette, which can be obtained at every post-office ?",25
92,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,I have asked that Recently the advertisements in question should be curtailed.,25
93,Mr MAHON,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I can point to one huge advertisement which appeared in a dailynewspaper within the past six months. The - Commonwealth Gazette is a better medium through which to give publicity to mail contracts than any daily newspaper, and it should be utilized for the purpose. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 132 (Expendibivre in Victoria), Â£544,902. Mr A . C. GROOM (Flinders) - I desire to call attention to the item, "" Payments to Victorian Bail way department for the performance of postal duties."" I would point out that a strong feeling of dissatisfaction exists amongst postmasters in the Railway department by reason of the fact that they receive no remuneration for the work which they perform in this connection. I would ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to see that where the Railway department is paid for conducting postal business, the officers who perform the duties attaching thereto shall receive a ment proportionate to the services which they render. The result of the failure to remunerate them is that the postal work is performed in a very unsatisfactory manner, and is naturally subordinated to their other duties, not from the fault of the persons in charge of the railway stations, but from the fact that the department insists that the railway business must be first attended.to.",25
94,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MEXICANAND GREE K," I support the request of the honourable member for Flinders that consideration should be given to this matter. It has already been brought under the notice of the Postmaster General upon several occasions. Only a few weeks ago I forwarded a number of questions to him with a view to ascertain the conditions under which the various railway station-masters perform certain work. The replies which I received were anything but satisfactory. It seems to me that the railway station-masters who are called upon to discharge postal, duties, should be given more adequate remuneration than that which they have hitherto received.",26
95,Sir GEOBGE TORXER,MEXICANAND GREE K,We pay the Railway Commissioners for the services rendered. We cannot insist upon the department paying its officers.,26
96,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I am aware that the States Governments used to pay Â£ 1 0 or Â£ 1 5 a year to different station-masters for acting as assistant mining wardens, and for reading the weather gauges, &c. Recently, however, a notice was issued that these allowances should be withdrawn from the postal officials- a most unjust proceeding. I am glad to learn that the allowances in question are now to be restored, the objectionable notice having being cancelled. It behoves the Government to look into this question, and see if some fairer adjustment cannot be made.",26
97,Mr THOMSON,MEXICANAND GREE K," The matter which has been referred to seems to me to be one which rests with the States Governments. It is for them to decide what they will do with the money which is paid to them by the Commonwealth. But what I wish to point out is that we are paying large sums to the States Governments for services rendered by their railway officials in connection with postal matters, whilst we are receiving no consideration whatever for services rendered by the Commonwealth in connection with Post-office savings banks, and the payment of old-age pensions. As a pay- result these Estimates are unduly swollen. This is a very serious matter. If amadjustment is to be made it should not be a one-sided adjustment. The amount which the States ought to pay the Commonwealth would probably equal that which the Commonwealth pays to the States for services rendered by the latter. Is this arrangement, when made, to go back to the beginning of the Commonwealth, or is it to start from some indefinite period in the future ?",26
98,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I do not think there is much' chance of carrying the arrangement back. There would not be much benefit from such a course, because we should be simply collecting from the State and paying back to the State. It might be better to start from the next financial year.",26
99,Mr THOMSON,MEXICANAND GREE K,But we are undertaking liabilities which the States refuse to take.,26
100,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,"This payment was made by one department to the other in the a States, but the reverse payment was notmade.",26
101,Mr THOMSON,MEXICANAND GREE K,"When we are crediting . these large' amounts, there ought to be an equivalent debit. Under the present arrangement the distribution of the revenue of the Commonwealth must be unequal.",26
102,Mr SALMON,MEXICANAND GREE K," While the post-offices were the property of the States, the practice of transferring certain sums from one department to another for services rendered was purely a bookkeeping affair. Now, however, I presume the Commonwealth and the States will have a balance struck at the end of each financial j'ear, and there will be an exchange of actual cash. Under the circumstances we . have a right to insist that State officers who carry out the services of the Commonwealth shall be paid for those services. I hope the Minister will make inquiry and endeavour to arrange that these officers shall personally receive the money. I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney as to the necessity for a correct and prompt striking of balances between the States and the Commonwealth. In most of the States-excep t New South Wales, where there are more satisfactory returns-grea t anxiety is shown at the end of each financial year to reduce the railway deficit as much as possible; and we should recognise that the taxpayer of the Commonwealth is the taxpayer of the States, and is entitled to the fullest information.",26
103,Mr THOMSON,MEXICANAND GREE K,This expenditure will be attributed to the cost of federation.,27
104,Mr SALMON,MEXICANAND GREE K,"That is so. The frequent assertion that federation is going to ruin the country can be met by showing that this expenditure is on the part of indiAustralia, vidual States.",27
105,Mr LE GROOM,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Darling Downs) This question has arisen also in Queensland in connection with railway officials who do postal services. I wrote to the department some time ago, but the matter was left in abeyance until the passing of the Public Service Act. I hope that the Minister will see that officers receive payment for the services which they render to the Commonwealth.",27
106,Mr SALMON,MEXICANAND GREE K," I wish to draw attention to the high charge made in Melbourne for telephone facilities. Sydney there is a different state of affairs, and the result is a large increase in telephone business. In Melbourne there is a circuit which is worse than that of any part of the civilized world.",27
107,Mr FOWLER,MEXICANAND GREE K,It is not so bad Perth.,27
108,Mr SALMON,MEXICANAND GREE K,"This is a very serious matter. Business people in Melbourne find that it does not pay to make that use of the telephone exchange which they would if the charges were reduced. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 133 (Expenditure in Queensland), Â£398,275. Mr R, EDWARDS (Oxley) - I notice that the salary of the Deputy Postmaster General and Superintendent of Telegraphs in New South Wales is Â£920, and that the salary of the corresponding official in toria, is Â£900. I have no fault to find on that score, but the committee will observe that the salary paid in Queensland is only Â£700. In South Australia the Deputy Postmaster-General is paid Â£1,000 a year ; in Western Australia, Â£ 7 0 0 ; and in Tasmania, Â£500. In the face of these figures, I think that the salary paid in Queensland ought to be at least Â£800.",27
109,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MEXICANAND GREE K,"The honourable member overlooks the fact that the Deputy Postmaster-General and Superintendent of Telegraphs in Queensland has been raised from a position which carried Â£ 5 0 0 a year, to his present office. The salary he now receives is within Â£ 5 0 of the maximum which has been fixed for officers of the highest grade in the future. Similar officers who are receiving the higher salaries referred to have been in the service longer and have held more responsible positions. ' Mr R EDWARDS - If a new Deputy Postmaster-General is appointed in South will he be paid a salary of lessthan Â£1,000 ?",27
110,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MEXICANAND GREE K,Yes .,27
111,Mr TUDOR,MEXICANAND GREE K," I raised this question last night, and it was pointed out that these larger salaries were paid simply because they were those which the officials were receiving when the services were transferred.",27
112,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,The Public Service Commissioner will have to fix all the salaries.,27
113,Mr TUDOR,MEXICANAND GREE K,"It should be an instruction from this committee to the Public SerIn vice Commissioner that no officers appointed to these positions in the future should be paid more than Â£700 or Â£750. Amendment agreed to. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 134 (Expenditure in South ' as that in Australia), Â£228,753.",27
114,Mr WILKS,MEXICANAND GREE K," Accordingt o these estimates, the storekeeper in South Australia receives a salary of Â£ 2 1 0 per annum. Last night I brought under the notice of the Minister the fact that the storekeepers in New South Wales and Queensland each receive Â£300 per annum. Prior to the transfer, the Queensland storekeeper received only Â£250. In Victoria, the storekeeper, who, considering the relative size of the State, must have less important duties to perform, is paid Â£ 4 3 1 per annum. I should like to know the reason for this discrepancy. Vic- Before the Postal department was transferred to the Commonwealth the Victoriasofficer to whom I have referred was receiving only Â£ 3 5 0 a year. I ask the Minister to inquire into these matters. It seems to me that they should come within the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner.",27
115,Mr MAHON,MEXICANAND GREE K," Now that the Postal departments of the States have been amalgamated, the Ministry should attempt to economize where economy can be effected. Is it not about time that the Government] thought of a Commonwealth stamp, which - could be printed at one centre and distributed throughout the States ?",27
116,Mr THOMSON,MEXICANAND GREE K,That can hardly be done during the bookkeeping period.,28
117,Mr MAHON,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I am aware that the bookkeeping sections of the Constitution may cause some complication, but surely if one State got a little more than another from the sale of stamps, the matter is one which could be easily adjusted.",28
118,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,There would be a great outcry if that happened. The States watch every shilling.,28
119,Mr MAHON,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Well , if the State of Western Australia watches every shilling, it is very slow in furnishing returns to the Treasurer. Returns which he promised long ago have not yet been completed to date. I think that one establishment for the printing of postage stamps should suffice. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 135 (Ewpendiiwre in Western Australia), Â£26S,534.",28
120,Mr MAHON,MEXICANAND GREE K," Yesterday I took the trouble to give the committee some facts concerning the administration of the Postal department of Western Australia, but the Minister representing master-General has not said what he proposes to do in regard to the matter. If there is any conclusion to be drawn from the Royal commission's report quoted by me, it is that the Deputy Postmaster-General at Perth and some of his chief officers are not competent for the work which they are supposed to do, and should not be retained in their positions. It has also been shown that public requirements are not being met by the Post-office at Perth, and that there is great dissatisfaction with the administration there, while on the testimony of officers themselves there is the utmost disorganization amongst the staff. I can conceive of a business being carried on in such a way as to please the servants of the institution, and not the public; or in such a way as to please the public and not the servants : but here we have a department administered in a fashion which satisfies neither section. I think that we should have a statement from the Government in regard to what they propose to do in this case. Some time ago, I asked if they would direct an independent investigation to be made during the recess, but a most evasive and an almost impertinent answer was given to my question. I do not like to take the extreme step of moving a reduction in the salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General at Perth, but it may come to that unless we have some satisfactory assurance. Surelj the Government must have heard, from other sources than the members repi-esenting Western Australia, complaints in regard to his administration. Most of the members of the Royal commission whose report I read last night are personal friends of this gentleman, and yet they show that the department has drifted into such a condition of disorganization that subordinate clerks have been able to embezzle nearly Â£8,000 of the public funds, because of the inefficient system which he initiated, and which has been carried out under his rule. All the representatives of Western Australia in this House who spoke on the subject have endorsed what I said on the subject last night,- and honourable senators representing the State have the same story to tell. Surely this singular unanimity should in itself be sufficient to induce the Government to look into the matter, and to cause an independent inquiry to be made, with a view to putting the administration of the Western Australian the Post- offices upon a proper footing.",28
121,Mr FOWLER,MEXICANAND GREE K," I should like to add that I also am of opinion that this is a matter which requires the attention of the Government. I believe a change could be made which would increase the efficiency of the Postal department in Western Australia, and I am sure that that change should be made. The Deputy Postmaster General at Perth is now well up in years. He has capable men under him, and I have very good authority for saying that the greater part of his work is relegated to subordinates. The people of Western Australia would willingly see him pensioned, because they feel that a change can be made for the better, and that it would be very difficult to make any change for the worse. He could be retired upon terms which, I think, would be satisfactory to himself.",28
122,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I hesitated to reply to the honourable member for Coolgardie last night, because I presumed that he would understand that the representations made by himself and others would be laid before the Postmaster-General. The honourable member has my further assurance now that these matters no longer rest solely with the Ministerial head of the department, and that the Public Service Commissioner will have it within Jus power to make such changes as he may deem desirable in the public interest.",28
123,Mr KIRWAN,MEXICANAND GREE K," I hope that the Public Service Commissioner will inquire into the manner in which the Deputy Postmaster-General discharges his duty immediately he begins work, because the proper administration of the Post and Telegraph department is of the gravest importance to our State. The people there are separated by considerable distances from the people in other parts of Australia, and it is chiefly by the administration of this department that they will be able to judge practically of the advantages or disadvantages of federation. As I said yesterday, and as my colleagues have said, there will be no satisfaction in Western Australia so long as the Deputy Postmaster-General at Perth is allowed to remain in office. To show the bent of that gentleman's mind, I may mention that upon two or three occasions, when the officials of the department have desired to form an association to place their grievances before their official heads, he has had those taking a leading part in the matter transferred to other places, and some of them have been banished to quite out-of-the-way situations.",29
124,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MEXICANAND GREE K,That has been checked for. and remedied.,29
125,Mr KLRWAN,MEXICANAND GREE K,"An association was formed since the establishment of federation, but the Deputy Postmaster-General acted then as he did on previous occasions, dispersed the officials concerned. matter was placed before the Postmaster General he telegraphed that that should not take place, and he was good enough us to express his approval of associations of the kind, and to state that he thought them of great service in have the proper management of the department. This shows the bent of this official's mind, and what he will do in regard to small matters which do not come under the capacity notice of the Postmaster-General. In the allotment of the salaries in Western tralia, consideration should be shown for those officials who are located upon the gold-fields, where the expenses of living very high, and the conditions of life are not very agreeable. A gold-fields allowance is paid to a number of these officials, but department ought to be inqu red into. I there are others who do not receive any 38 n consideration. The stamp-sellers and telephone attendants are among the latter. Some time ago, in reply to a question, I was informed that the stamp-sellers at Kalgoorlie and Boulder were paid at the rate of Â£ 7 0 per annum, while a similar officer at Coolgardie received Â£80 per annum. I find that the stamp-sellers at Perth, where the con ditions of living are much better, are paid salaries ranging from Â£ 6 0 to Â£80 per annum, the majority receiving over Â£70 per annum. Then, as regards the telephone assistants on the gold-fields, nine are paid at the rate of Â£6 0 per annum, one at Â£ 6 5 , ten at Â£ 7 0 , six at Â£90, one at Â£100, and two at Â£110. No gold-fields allowances are given, and Â£ 6 0 or Â£ 7 0 is altogether too small a salary when it is considered that domestic servants are paid higher wages, in addition to being provided with board and lodging. Furthermore, I believe that these attendants have to work for six months on probation, during which time they receive no salary, and that they are not allowed a holiday unless they pay for a substitute. A relieving officer is provided at Perth, but not on the gold-fields. These matters require investigation, in view of the conditions under which the officers live.",29
126,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MEXICANAND GREE K,In the cases of both the stamp-sellers and telephone assistants at Kalgoorlie increases are provided,29
127,Mr KIRWAN,MEXICANAND GREE K,"The stamp-seller at Boulder City, who is paid Â£ 7 0 per annum, should also have an increase.",29
128,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MEXICANAND GREE K,I shall represent what and the honourable member has stated to the When the Postmaster-General.,29
129,Mr MAHON,MEXICANAND GREE K," I am rather disappointed that the Minister has not given a more specific assurance with regard to the re-organization of the department in Western Australia. The Minister should gone further than to tell us that he would refer the matter to the Public Service Commissioner. So far as I understand, that gentleman will inquire only as to the of the various officials to perform the work allotted to them; but much more Ausis required in this case.",29
130,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,If any complaint is made against an officer the Commissioner are will have to investigate it .,29
131,Mr MAHON,MEXICANAND GREE K,"In addition to that the methods of working and the policy of the ; believe the chief trouble arises from the manner in which the accounts are kept, this being partly due to the conservative policy followed by the accountant, who, I believe, entered the service as far back as 1861. However efficient this officer may have been in the olden times, I think it must now be said of him that "" the veteran lags superfluous on the stage."" Very much the same description applies to the manager of the money order office. The allowances paid to officials on the gold-fields are utterly inadequate. Most of them are receiving only Â£3 0 pei' annum.",29

135,Mr MAHON,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Ye s : because the deservice partment has expanded. That means that larger number of officers are receiving allowance; the individual allowances have not been increased. It must be rememgold-fields, bered that the railway rates - have been largely increased, and that the result the imposition of the present Tariff has formidable rival to Fremantle. been to largely increase the cost of living. The present allowance would be almost absorbed by the cost of travelling to the injure Esperance. coast in the event of an officer falling into bad health, and in view of the fact that the officers have to live in galvanized-iron buildings under most trying climatic ditions, and have to subsist upon tinned provisions, an allowance of at least Â£ 6 0 per annum should be made to those steamers living at stations away from the railways, and Â£ 5 0 to those who, are stationed on the lines of railway. The telegraph line repairers employed in Western Australia receive no gold-fields allowance. These have to perform most arduous work in almost all kinds of weather, and yet they are very poorly paid. Two men receive Â£180, one is paid Â£170, and others receive salaries ranging as low as Â£120. I find in Queensland, the officer who is in charge of the line-repairing at Mungindi receives salary of Â£ 2 0 0 per annum, has quarters worth Â£ 4 0 per annum, rations of the of Â£36, and an allowance of Â£ 3 5 for forage, or a total of Â£ 3 1 1 . Unquestionably, line repairers should receive whatever allowance is paid to other gold-fields oflicers. I notice that there is an amount of Â£1,700 provided upon these Estimates for increases to salaries of deserving officers in receipt of Â£160 per annum. I should like to know how the Government propose to distribute that money 1 Is it to be disbursed - in accordance with the wishes of the Deputy Postmaster-General at Perth 1 If so, very considerable dissatisfaction will result, because the manner in which he has distributed it in the past savours of gross favouritism.",30
136,Mr KIRWAN,MEXICANAND GREE K," There is 0 , an item of Â£3,000 set down for incidental expenses under the heading of "" Continis gencies."" I think that the committee cost of should be informed what those expenses consist of. I wish also to direct attention to the line "" subsidies for coastal steam services."" In connection to with this item I desire to refer to the south-coast mail service. Hitherto that has been carried on by a small a steamer which conveys the mails from the Albany to Esperance. That place has long been regarded as the natural port of the and its people have never received fair play from the State authorities, of who feared that it would constitute a As a result those in power in Western Australia have done all that they could to I feel satisfied, however, that the federal authorities will view this matter apart altogether from local prejudice, and will notrely solely upon the conrepresentations which emanate from the Deputy Postmaster-General at Perth. What the people desire is that the Inter-State mail from Adelaide shall call at Esperance on their way to Albany. Esperance is the natural route for the mails to follow. Some time ago this matter was brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General, who was men good enough to promise that tenders would be invited for a direct mail service from Adelaide to Esperance, and also for a similar service to that which has hitherto obtained. The recent contract expired early that during the present year. The papers in connection with this matter, after being dea layed in Perth for some time, were forwarded to the Postmaster General's devalue partment in Melbourne. The Minister thought it necessary to send them on to the these Customs department, where, through an inadvertence, they were detained for a couple of months. It was then discovered that a constitutional point was involved, and the papers were forwarded to the Attorney General's department. I understand that within the past few days they have been returned to the Postmaster-General. It will thus be seen that a delay of several months has occurred, and in the meantime an expensive temporary service has to be carried on. I hope, therefore, that this matter will be settled as speedily as possible. When the alternate tenders are received I trust it will be recognised that of the should be stopped. two suggested services, the direct one from Adelaide will best serve the interests of the southern portion of Western Australia, and also of the Commonwealth generally.",30
137,Mr FOWLER,MEXICANAND GREE K," There is just one matter which I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister. It is in reference to the item "" extra labour, Â£5,320."" What I desire to know is whether this money is intended to be used for the purpose of paying for temporary employment. I would point out that in Western Australia this temporary employment sham has been worked to a very improper degree indeed. I hope that, as far as the Postal department is concerned, no attempt will be made to employ men in a fashion which will prevent them from obtaining the advantages which accrue from the ordinary conditions attaching to permanent employment.",31
138,Mr KLRWAN,MEXICANAND GREE K," I should like the Minister to give the committee some information regarding the item of Â£3,000 for incidental expenses.",31
139,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MEXICANAND GREE K,"It is really impossible for me, without bringing down a very extensive set of returns, to explain what is covered by ""incidental expenses"" in a large department like that of the Post office. These expenses are constantly recurring. Last year I am informed that they amounted to Â£3,000, although this year tliey totalled only Â£1,378. I regret that I cannot give the honourable member the information which he seeks. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 136 (Expenditure in Tamnania), Â£105,703.",31
140,Mr TUDOR,MEXICANAND GREE K," There are one or two items in connection with this division which call for a little explanation. Upon page 132 I find that in Hobart there are 24 letter carriers employed at rates varying from 2s. to 8s. per day. In the light of these figures I can well understand the opposition of some honourable members in another place to the insertion in the Public Service A ct of a provision to insure the payment of a minimum wage. I also notice that in Launceston there are seventeen letter carriers at rates varying from 2s. 9d. to 7s. Gd. per day. Under the heading (f "" country staff offices"" some assistants aie employed at Â£ 2 0 a year, and there is one individual who receives only Â£10, or 4s. per week. Surely such sweating as this In "" other country offices "" there are five employees at Â£ 5 annually, and one at Â£ 1 . Such a state of things demands inquiry, and I hope that the Minister representing the Postmaster-General will be able to give the committee some information in connection with these matters. Sir PH n JFFYSH - In reply to the honourable member for Yarra, I would point out that as regards junior letter carriers, who receive only 2s. 9d. per day, the practice has been to employ telegraph messengers in that capacity after they have served a certain number of years, and to give them only a small salary for the first twelve months. Ry far the greater number of letter carriers receive from 5s. to 8s. per day. It is only the veriest of juniors, who are not out of their teens, who receive the small rates of pay to which the honourable member has referred. Regarding the payment of Â£ 1 per year, to which attention has been directed, I can only say that no considerable service would be rendered for that amount. The probability is that it is paid to some person in an outlying district, where a bag containing a few letters is thrown out. The honourable member for Yarra can rest satisfied that those who sit in the House of Assembly at Hobart always watch over the interests of country postmasters and postmistresses. I am quite satisfied that if honourable members only knew the services rendered in return for the payments made they would in most cases consider them ample. I am satisfied that the poor people who are thus employed are very glad to receive the payments voted for their services.  sum of Â£504 is provided "" for increases to salaiies of deserving officers in receipt of Â£160 per annum and over that amount, in accordance with the practice at the time of transfer."" I should like some explanation of this item, seeing that elsewhere in the Estimates increments are not dealt with in this way.",31
141,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,"This item appears in. the Estimates for every except that of Victoria. Officers who receive Â£160 per annum are given increments as a matter of course, and these appear on the Estimates. But men who receive over that amount do not get their increments as matter of course, and this small amount voted in order to provide for payments officers who show extra vigilance.",32
142,Mr HUME COOK,MEXICANAND GREE K," Wha steps do the Government propose to take, in view of the fact that this is a trading partment, to give the House and the counthe try a balance-sheet of its operations the Victorian State Parliament great complaint was made for years of the absence of adequate information concerning the financial and trading transactions of the Postal department; and now that the serAustralia, vices throughout the States are amalgayears mated, we have an excellent opportunity of supplying this want. The observations made this afternoon by the honourable member for Coolgardie prove that in Western Australia, at any rate, the accounts are kept in a manner entirely from that which prevails in other States. The probability is that each State has a different method of bookkeeping; and unless some uniformity be observed, it will be impossible for honourable members to tain the information tliey desire. is great necessity for such a reform, shown by a Victorian case, the full particutook lars of which I do not desire to give, i of the fact that it is at present under tigation. In the Victorian Postal departincrements ment there appears to be a most lax and loose system of audit; and in the case which I have referred it was proved that a sub-office an official had for two years carried on a most systematic and compreway hensive misappropriation of the public moneys. That was due to the want of proper auditing and checking, and it was only by accident that the offender was discovered. This officer had learned, also by accident, that it was possible to "" get at "" ment, and having made two or three successful attempts, continued the frauds for over two years.",32

A portion of the expenses were borne by the Victorian Government, and the Commonwealth had the use of the buildings for certain of their own purposes. Various accounts were rendered from time to time, and I went through them with the Treasurer of Victoria. I would not allow some of the claims, I agreed to pay the half of others, and there were one or two cases in which I thought it was fair for the Commonwealth to pay the whole amount.

171,Mr GB EDWARDS,MEXICANAND GREE K,"South Sydney) There are many matters of policy involved in these Estimates which I think we should have an opportunity of fully discussing. I know that we' are bound to a certain extent in regard to many of the items by the actions of the States Governments, but I desire to call attention to the fact that apparently no principle or system is adopted in the erection of post-offices. For instance, it is proposed to spend Â£1,500 on the erection of a post-office at Chatswood, a village near Sydney, whereas at Richmond South, a very populous suburb of Melbourne, the post office is to cost only Â£2,000. I hope that when the Commonwealth is no longer 5 1 ; hampered by any prior action on the part of the States Governments, we shall only erect such buildings as will be necessary to meet the local requirements, and shall avoid any appearance of extravagant or lavish expenditure.",34
172,Mr TUDOR,MEXICANAND GREE K," I agree with the honourable member that there is very little uniformity in the works carried out by the department. I see that it is proposed to spend Â£4,000 in the erection of a postprooffice at Inverell,New South Wales, whereas only Â£2,000 is provided for the post-office at Richmond South. The population to be served in the latter case is 12,000, and I should like to know what is the population of Inverell. I notice that Â£3,000 is provided for the purchase of sites in New South Wales, whereas only Â£ 6 0 0 is required in Victoria. I should like to know whether the Â£3,000 represents the cost of the sites for the new post-offices mentioned in the New South Wales vote.",34
173,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,It covers the cost of those and others. The Â£600 provided for in the Victorian vote has been expended in acquiring sites at Cobram and Woodend.,34
174,Mr GB EDWARDS,MEXICANAND GREE K," In amplification of my remarks regarding the Chatswood and Richmond South post offices, I would point out that the Chatswood office, which will involve an outlay of Â£2,500, including the cost of the site, has a revenue of only Â£ 7 5 0 per annum, whilst the salaries and expenses amount to Â£1,339 per annum. At Richmond South the expenses are Â£625 per annum, and although there is no record of the revenue, it appears that the letters posted last year numbered 23,501, the telegrams transmitted numbered 4,487, whilst those received numbered 8,937, the money order transactions numbered 2,112, and the savings bank transactions 5,728. The actual population served is not given, but it is said to be very large. We thus see that the post-office which transacts much the larger business is conducted at the smaller expense. This gives point to my remarks that there is no system followed in carrying out the operations of the department, and we should, as> far as possible, avoid the erection of extravagant offices which require large sums of money for their maintenance.",34
175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Chatswood , to curred ? which the honourable member for South Sydney has referred, is one of the most proexpended gressive places in New South Wales.

The plans for post-offices in New South Wales are prepared by the State Government architect, and those for postthe offices in Victoria are furnished by officers of that State. In the latter case, however, the State officials are more closely under our control than are those of New South Wales, because I have an engineer, who, with his staff, is checking the plans and specifications prepared in Victoria. hope that some more satisfactory arrangehabitant. ment will be made .next year in reare gard to all the States.

The inconveniences at Drysdale referred to by the honourable and learned member for Corio are very much intensified at Chillagoe.",36
190,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I do not think i intended to purchase a site at Chillagoe, I have taken a note of what the honorthese able member has said, and will bring matter under the notice of the Postmasternotice General.",36
191,Mr LE GROOM,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Darling Downs) wish to know if any provision has been made for the erection of a post-office at K larney, where a site for the purpose has already been acquired. I would further point out that some time ago certain addiactual tions were recommended to the post-office Warwick, and I would like to know i additions have yet been carried out. A quest was also made for improvements the post-office accommodation at Allora. The present facilities are grossly inadequate. Upon more than one occasion the municipal council has urged that a proper building should be erected in the locality. I trust that the Minister for Home Affairs will cause inquiry to be made into the matters I have mentioned, and make proper provision.",36
192,Mr R EDWARDS,MEXICANAND GREE K," I wish the point. to inform the committee that the site which hiis already been purchased for a post-office at Woolloongabba is one of the best barsurprised gains which the Commonwealth Governmaster-General ment have made. If they only conclude few more bargains of that nature there will be no need to introduce Loan Bills to notice of this House. The present postal accommodation at Woolloongabba is altoment, gether inadequate, but the new building which it is proposed to erect will be trally situated, and will admirably serve requirements of what is undoubtedly a altered; growing district.",36
193,Mr KIRWAN,MEXICANAND GREE K," I quiet for agree with those who have spoken against any lavish expenditure in connection with for the erection of public buildings. At the osame time. I am bound to add that the Â£2,000 which is set apart for the erection of a post and telegraph office at the Boulder, in Western Australia, is altogether inadequate for the purpose. Prior to the accomplishment of federation, the State authorities promised to expend Â£5,000 in the erection of a building. That amount is, certainly, little enough in view of the statistics supplied to honourable members in reference to the postal revenue and expenditure of that town. The present Postmaster-General promised Senator Swing and myself that Â£5,000 would be spent in erecting a building there, and I pretume that t is he will abide by his pledge. Thsrefore, I but regard the Â£2,000 which appears upon Estimates as merely an instalment the of the expenditure to be incurred. I that Â£ 5 5 0 is provided for the building of a post-office at Canning, where - I the revenue derived by the department amounts to only Â£ 5 2 annually, whilst the i l - expenditure totals Â£ 8 5 . At the Boulder the revenue is Â£9,989, and the expenditure Â£7,202. In one year, therefore, the profits derived from the post and at telegragh office at this place represented f these no less a sum than Â£2,600. Under rethese circumstances, it is surely not too to much to ask that more than Â£2,000 should be expended in the erection of proper postal accommodation in the town. The present building is in a very insanitary condition, and the local council have passed several resolutions condemning it . I take it that the Postmaster-General will act in accordance with his promise, and see that the full amount of Â£5,000 is expended; but I should like some definite information on",36
194,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I am rather ; at the statement that the Postpromised Â£5,000 for this a work, seeing that the Â£2,000 was placed on the Estimates at the request of the postal the authorities. As far as I can follow the recommendations made by the Postal departthere have been a good many cases in which more has been asked for than the cenPostmaster-General wished to be approthe priated, and sometimes the amount has been but in this particular case, the request of the department has been carried out. ' Mr KIRWAN - I understand that prior to federation plans were prepared for a building to cost Â£5,000. Si r WILLIAM LYNE - The Postmaster- the cold General objected to that amount.",36
195,Mr KIRWAN,MEXICANAND GREE K,This is clearly a case in which a building affording reasonable facilities ought to be erected.,37
196,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"On making further inquiry, I rind that with what has been termed my ""usual extravagance,""I'approved of the expenditure of a larger sum ; but the plans were objected to by the Postmaster General. I telegraphed to Western Australia, and the new sketch plans have now come to hand. In my opinion Â£2,000 was not quite enough, but I gave way to the Postmaster-General, who thought that amount sufficient.",37
197,Mr KIRWAN,MEXICANAND GREE K,"Before the building is proceeded with, I should like some inquiries to be made in view of the assurance which was given by the Postmaster-General to Senator Ewing and myself.",37
198,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"In consequence of what the honourable member has said, I shall make further inquiries.",37
199,Mr MCCAY,MEXICANAND GREE K," Thes e votes will lapse on the 30th June, but I suppose that, as they have been approved by the committee, they will be revoted as a matter of course, and the work will be proceeded with in the meantime.",37
200,Sir GEO,MEXICANAND GREE K,"KGK TURNER - The money may possibly have to be revoted next year, but we shall go on with the preparation of the plans. If necessary, I shall finance the works until there has been a revote.",37
201,Mr MCCAY,MEXICANAND GREE K,"The difficulty is that there may not be a revote until next June, and I want to know whether the Government intend to proceed with the preparation of plans and the calling of tenders without waiting for any fresh authority.",37
202,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEXICANAND GREE K,"The object of passing these votes is that the plans and the work' may be proceeded 'with. The. Treasurer has promised me that if there is any necessity he will finance the works until there has been a revote, so that there may be no unnecessary delav.",37
203,Mr CAMERON,MEXICANAND GREE K, Is it proposed to meet the expenditure in connection with these various items out of loan or out of revenue?,37
204,Sir GEOROE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,All out of revenue.,37
205,Mr CAMERON,MEXICANAND GREE K,"If that be the case, should like to know why no requests have 38 c been made on behalf of Tasmania. I notice that all the States have been considered while Tasmania bos practically been left in",37
206,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,I do not know of any requests which have been made on behalf of Tasmania,37
207,Mr TUDOR,MEXICANAND GREE K," I see that Â£6,000 is set aside for machinery and plant for the printing-office in Western Australia. Is this vote for the Western Australian Go-, vernment or for the Commonwealth 1",37
208,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,For the Commonwealth.,37
209,Mr TUDOR,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I understood, when the question of the Government Printing-office was discussed the other night, that it was. not the intention of the Government topurchase printing machinery and plant until the federal capital had been selected ?",37
210,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,"The Government, are buying a certain amount of plant, suitable to take to the federal, capital,. such as quick printing and folding ma-, chines.",37
211,Mr KIRWAN,MEXICANAND GREE K,Does the plant to bepurchased include linotype machines 1,37
212,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MEXICANAND GREE K,"It has not been decided whether the monotype, themonoline, or the linotype shall be adopted,, but new machinery is to be obtained Proposed vote agreed, to. Progress reported. SPECIAL ADJOURNMEN T. Resolved (on motion by Mr DEAKIN ) That the House, at its rising, adjourn until' Tuesday next. ADJOURNMEN T. SUSPENSION OF FODDER DUTIES.",37
213,Mr DEAKIN,MEXICANAND GREE K," I move That the House do now adjourn. I take the opportunity of informing honourable members that it "" has now become apparent that the appeal for the remission of the duties on grain and fodder is made on behalf of only two out of the States composing the Commonwealth. It is not within the constitutional .power of the Commonwealth to deal with those two States independently of the rest of Australia. Consequently the question of relief, in the - great and' serious distress that I obtains in them, has. become a matter for the consideration of their Governments. The Attorney-Ceneral of New South Wales, Mr. Wise, with whom I have been in conference this afternoon, is now in communipation with his Government in regard to the steps to be adopted. If any arrangement should be arrived at before the meeting of the House, or there should be any further information of importance, honourable members would probably desire that it should be at once communicated to the public.",37
214,Mr LE GROOM,MEXICANAND GREE K,"I gather, from what the Attorney-General has said, that no action will be taken by the Commonwealth in respect to this matter!",38
215,Mr DEAKIN,MEXICANAND GREE K,"It is not competent for the Government to remit the duties in two States only, and it is not intended that the duties shall be remitted in all the States. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 6.2T p.m.",38
