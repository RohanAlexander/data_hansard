Reports as to - wind, rain and weather, as between coastal stations, will be wholly restored - The sending of reports, as between country centres, in reference to river gaugings and the weather will be restored on a restricted basis. No information of any value will be withheld, but there are certain reports the sending of which to country centres is not considered to serve any useful purpose. For instance, we do not think any benefit is to be derived from the sending of an urgent wire to Broken Hill , Cobar or Albury with gard to the Tainfall in Sydney, nor do the people of, say, Gabo Island require information as to weather records all over Australia. I repeat that, while the former services between country centres will be restricted, nothing considered to be of value to the people will be left out. The position is the same with regard to weather forecasts. All the important centres will be supplied with such information. Economy can be effected, however, by refraining from sending such reports as ""urgent telegrams."" In many instances that used to be done. By an arrangement with the Postal Department such information will now be sent by way of ordinary telegraphic messages;toutpreference will be given to such messages, so that they will be dealt with almost as speedily as if they were urgent telegrams.",14

As stated in the press, the Government has decided to co-operate with the State Governments, and, it is hoped, with the Empire Cotton-growing Association, to give a guarantee which, so far as the aggregate amount is concerned, is without limit. The guarantee per pound will rest upon a basis yet to be ascertained, but in all probability it will be the same as thab given last year for seed - cotton. SUGAR AGREEMENT.",15

The acting manager adds that every facility is given to shippers in Hobart and other ports in Tasmania. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mir.

The honourable the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene), on my behalf, promised to bring the matter under notice and endeavour to comply with the honourable member's wishes. The acting manager of the line in Australia points out that the accounts embracing transactions in Australia up to 30th June of each year have to be despatched to London, and there incorporated in the books and accounts before the profit and loss account and balance-sheet can be completed. The figures have to be gathered in Melbourne from all the States, and from Java and Singapore, and this cannot be done at the earliest before the end of J u l y or middle of August. It is apparent, therefore, that the complete accounts from Australia cannot reach London until towards the end of September, and that after allowing time for the incorporation of these figures in the books of the head office, it will be recognised as impracticable that the balance-sheet can be produced before, say, .November of each year. As the statements have then to be forwarded to Australia, it will be seerj that they cannot be available here much before six months after the end of the financial year. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). WEATHEB REPORTS.",17
40,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT LINE OF," I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Edenhas still Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) that he for desires to move the adjournment House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, "" The stoppage of reports re weather,, rivers-especiall &o., directly affecting the pastoral, agricultural, and shipping industries."" Five honourable members having risen impossible in their places, Question proposed.",18
41,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"Eden Monaro) [3.21] - Notwithstandin g what has been said from the fron t Ministerial bench this afternoon, I make no apology for moving the adjournment of the House in , order to discuss the stoppage of the weather reports. I endeavoured, to move in this direction last week, because I considered that it was a very urgent matter, and I do so today because I want more assurance than we have so far been given in this connection. Something must be done forthwith. Questions upon this subject were submitted ten days ago by the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) and myself. They were on lines similar to the question submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton) today. I have been endeavouring all along to get some satisfaction for people in country districts who are sometimes threatened by fire and flood, and for people on the coast whose lives may be endangered by the cessation of the weather telegrams. The blacks in the Monaro district say, "" W h a f for ?"" when they do not understand anything. Last week I asked the Treasurer (Mr Bruce), "" W h a f for ?"" I asked him why steps had been taken to discontinue these weather reports. The Treasurer's reply was as followsThere is no necessity to "" cut off "" anything. The amount on the Estimates is the same as was the case last year, and the step taken in regard to the weather reports arises out of a redistribution of the services of the Meteorological Branch. According to the Treasurer no saving has been effected. Therefore I want to know why the change has been made. Yesterday afternoon the following appeared in the Sydney SunDANGER OF FLOOUS. The heavy rainfall in the eastern districts has been responsible for rising rivers, except the south. There is a danger of the Hunter flooding, and of the Hawkesbury exceeding its limits. A considerable amount of backwater to come donn, which will cause anxiety the next few days. There is a very strong of the pressure rivers also. running out of the northern port In the country, too, torrential rains sre renamely, ported, and floods are feared on the coastal y the Manning and the Hunter - and their tributaries. But, owing to the false economy of the Federal Government in curtailing the system of weather reports, it is for the Weather Bureau to tell just how bad things are. Her© is a letter forwarded to ine by the council clerk of Cooma, in my electorateMunicipality of Cooma, Council Chambers, Cooma, Dear Sir,I am directed by the Council of this Municipality to ask you to make all possible representations to the Minister against the decision to discontinue the despatch of weather forecasts and weather messages to country stations. As this information is of immense advantage to country districts, the Council is of opinion that the small cost to the Government should not stand in the way of a great public necessity. Yours faithfully, I have received similar communications from the Town Clerk, Yass, and a dozen other bodies as well as from public citii zens, and as I was anxious to get this matter settled without bringing it up i the House, I spoke to the Minister and wrote to the Department of Home and loss Territories. I received the following replyMelbourne, 26th July, 1922. Dear Sir,With reference to your July, forwarding a communication from the Town Clerk, Municipality of Yass, dated 19th July, relative to the discontinuance of despatch of meteorological information from saving effected. the Bureau to country centres, I have to inform you that it had been found necessary instruct the Commonwealth Meteorologist confine expenditure on meteorological telegrams within the limits of the amount voted by Parliament. The arrangements made by him in this nexion were, however, provisional only, and view their instructions. have now been reviewed. I may add that it is anticipated that the directions which have been issued will it possible to substantially restore the services made? which had been temporarily discontinued, at the same time, by eliminating unnecessary advices, effect economies without impairing efficiency. Yours faithfully, What are we to understand by the words '' substantially restore the services "" am not satisfied with this reply. If gentleman who has been responsible cutting off the weather reports is to the judge as to what will be an efficient service, we have come to a pretty pass. But apparently the policy generally adopted is, "" If we want more money, let us tax the primary producer, the on the land in isolated back-blocks."" I want to know who has been responsible for cutting off these reports. We must hold the Minister blameworthy because we cannot attack public servants who are unable to come here and speak for themselves. Nevertheless, although it might 24th July, 1922. be unfair for an honourable member in this House to attack a public servant, if ic should happen that a highly paid official has been responsible for the stoppage of these weather reports - and I am told that such is the case - h e is not f it for his position and should be drummed out of the Commonwealth Service.

If it is the Minister who is responsible for the action taken, we can take him to task here.",18

Then they run conback to their officials and ask them to reWhat is the nature of the substantial alterations make which we are now told are to be The stoppage of these weather and, reports in the first place was a scandal. There was a similar happening a few years ago, and Ministers were taken severely to task. No economy has been effected. It T. G. MCLAREN, is not economy. It is parsimony, or, at Secretary. the best, false economy, to cut off the news of flood waters.. Fortunately these 1 I waters do not travel too fast. If settlers the can be advised by telegram that floods for are coming down a stream, they have be ample time to get out of the way, but owing to the stupid blunder of cutting off these communications, hundreds of thousands of people will be at the risk of their lives. It is extraordinary that all these man stupid blunders should be at the expense of people in country districts. If anything affects city people there is an immediate outcry, and Ministers take rapid steps to make an alteration-at any rate, more rapid steps than they propose to take on this' occasion, If the action taken in this regard has been that of an official, the Minister should let us know. He should ask that public servant why he has exceeded his instructions. Of course, it is very difficult for a Minister in this House to answer on the spur of the moment matters affecting the Department of a"" Minister in the Senate, but this is a question that should be thoroughly probed. We have too much running of Departments by officials. I know that there are many of our publio servants who are splendid men, quite prepared to stand up, if necessary, against Ministers and members, and do only what they think right, but they are severely handicapped by the fact that there are others in senior positions who are ready to do things such as that of which I am now complaining. What « to be done to protect the lives of mv constituents? The following press telegram has been published from Perth: Mr Curlewis, the Government Astronomer in charge of meteorological science in Western Australia, stated on Tuesday that in consequence of Federal instructions the daily rainfall and weather telegrams from 122 country stations will be discontinued. The Government is being asked to protest. That is the way the money goes! State Government are asked to protestin orderi that lives may be Are we now about to get something definite from the Government? The Treasurer states that there is nothing to be said. I suggest that the old system be reverted to for fourteen days, and that, meanwhile, inquiries be made. Government first put a stop to all possibility of trouble or danger from the curtailment of these sources of information, and. then immediately make gations. I am aware that the sistant Minister (Sir Granville is a man of courage; he is a man indeed whom I greatly admire. he the courage, as a Minister, to stand up in his place and say that he approves of this curtailment of vital information, of any reduction at all ? I want to know specifically what publio official is responsible. Will the Government consent to act as god-father to his action? hardly think that they will. The Treasurer says there is not one penny of saving to be made. He does not add,. as he fairly could, that there may be Mr Austin Chapman. actual ruin to be faced by thousands of - people, who may find the interests of a life-time suddenly threatened. Floods in the back country of New South Wales are sweeping down, while many people in their path know nothing of their peril. They are not placed as we are, for we may walk down one of the city streets and read the weather notices upon a board. Many of the people who are endangered cannot even be informed by telephone, for they have not been able to obtain telephonic connection. Others, more fortunately placed with respect to this latter facility, may find themselves cut off from warning owing to the wires going down before the floods. I appeal to the Government to revert to the old system for a fortnight, and, meanwhile, to go very earnestly into the question whether they are doing a fair thing by the country. I make no iapology for bringing this matter forward as I have done. I have already sought unsuccessfully, by means of questions, to secure information and redress; but I have got nothing better than the oflicial communication which I have just read. It would appear that nothing has been done; and something has got to be done.",19

It would seem, then, that all is well for the future. But that does not end the matter. There should be some explanation of the course of action which has been adopted. I am doubtful whether public officials are solely to blame, seeing that there has been an official announce that ment that the change would involve a merited saving of £30,000.

I trust that the Governmenb will restore this formation in its entirety. There can no excuse for a failure to do so. The curtailment of such a service is a false economy.",20
46,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"[3.38] - I pleased to find the honourable member Eden-Monaro (Mr Chapman) in such a sincere mood today. I am always glad to find him standing up earnestly for the man un the land. And I hope and trust he will always succeed in securing privileges for his electors, since I happen to be one of them. The honourable member represents, almost solely, men on the land and in coastal districts, n - and, therefore, practically the whole of his constituents are vitally interested in the maintenance of these weather reand ports. It was quite refreshing also to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . so keenly solicitous for the welfare of the. man on the honora able members nearly all the information which I have been in a position to place before tliem, or, indeed, to procure.

The Minisi n - ter has decided that the services shall be not be cut off holus bolus. They may be restricted to some extent, but they will not be wholly discontinued. W in d , rain, and weather reports as between coastal towns will be restored. I take it that, as matter of fact, the direction of the ami Minister that they shall be restored has for already been carried out. Messages as between country centres in regard to river gaugings, rainfall, and general weather information will bo restored on a restricted basis. The Minister in a.u interview with the Government Meteorologist asked him whether he could vouch for the usefulness of sending detailed informatiou to all the centres included in the tremendously long list prepared by the Department. The Government Meteorologist said that he could not, and thab the messages passing to and from certain centres were of no value. He was then asked why, if that were so, these messages had been sent. His reply was that the system grew up before Federation-that in pre-Federal days, postmasters in very small centres sent weather reports to the Department, and that gradually' many of these small centres were included in the list of those to be supplied with the services of the Department. The Minister also found thab, in many cases, urgent weather telegrams were sent when there was really no need for them. urgent telegrams are to cease, but it has been arranged that weather telegrams shall be given preference over ordinary telegrams, so that we shall get at practically half the cost a service equally a j good as that obtained by the sending cf urgent telegraphic messages. I am surprised that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) should have said that the restoration of the original service would involve no expense. If no expense is involved in sending these numerous telegrams, why is the Government Meteorologist's Department charged for them ? Labour and material are largely involved in the carrying on of the service, and it is idle for the honourable member to suggest that the sending of thousands of telegrams all over the country does not result in any expenditure. The Department of Home and Territories is debited with the cost of these telegrams, and it does not wish to be debited with an amount in excess of that set apartfor the service. Mr CHAHLTON,-At all events, the cutting down of the service does not mean any real economy; it is only an economy as between two Departments.",21

I think that further discussion should stand over u n t i l honourable members have had actual experience of the working of the service as now proposed.

The geographical position of many centres makes them far more important, from a meteorological point of view, than their size and population might suggest.

In the Sydney Morning Herald of the 15th instant we have the statement thatReplying to Mr Fleming (New South Wales), in the House of Representatives today, the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) said that the only telegraph weather reports which were to be discontinued were certain messages between certain inland towns in South Wales. 1'he Minister added that change would not affect flood reports or coastal reports, and the usual forecasts would still be issued.",22

Unless the Minisand ter obtains more information, we may have something more tragic than has yet occurred. Although the answer given by the Minister for Defence to the honorter, able member for Robertson, as set out the Sydney Morning Herald, was an offiabsurd cial one-prepared , I take it, by officials of the Department-and the House to some extent, satisfied with it, we find £60,000 that within less than a week the reports formerly sent to four stations on Macleay River alone-report s which are absolutely vital-hav e been cut off. Tefer to the stations at Bellbrook, George's River, Armidale, and Hillgrove. wealth There are flats about 15 or 20 miles wide along the river where dairying is largely carried ou. These flats are intersected by numeroua creeks, and I should say that something like 100,000 cattle are depastured on them. In the case of an ordinary rainfall dairy farmers there would not require to shift their stock; but if there was a prospect of a flood it would be necessary to know that they had to shift them proand bably twenty-four hours before the facts, flood waters came down. It will thus be seen how important it is that people in such districts should receive the earliest possible warning of threatened floods. The dangerous position of the people livmine ing on the lower flats of the Macleay was pointed oub to the Meteorologist, and justice to him, I must say that he imme9 diately directed that hourly reports should be sent from Kempsey to the stations have named. Before these representapeople tions were made, however, he felt justithe fied in depriving them of the weather ports altogether. I hope that the Miniswaters ter will make something more than a casual inquiry into the matter; that he will see to it that the former service restored, and that not merely stations on the coast, but reporting stations in the New west shall continue to send out and re* the ceive weather information which is of vital importance to graziers and others.",23
58,Mr LAZZARINI,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"Werriwa) [3.52] see no reason why the Government Meteorologist should not immediately revert to the old system, which gave great No valid reason has been advanced by the Minister (Sir Granville 1 I have received two communications, one offifrom the Goulburn Chamber of Commerce, the other from the Goulburn Shire Council, protesting strongly against the discontinuance of the weather' reports. Despite what has been said by the Minisno real saving has been effected by in the cutting down of the service. It is to expect a Department like that of the Government Meteorologist to keep wns, its expenditure within £50,000 or per annum. Because of special disturbances its expenditure the in one year, may be three times greater than it was in the preceding year. I Even if a real economy, and not a saving of expense only as between two CommonDepartments, were effected by reducing the service, the action taken by the Minister would not be justified. It is imperative that the fullest information as to weather forecasts should be circulated for the protection of life and property. These reports are distributed by Commonwealth instrumentalities, and I defy the Minister to show that the restricted service will lead to the withdrawal of even one man from the Postmaster-General's Department or the Department of Home Territories. In view of the actual the excuse that the service was cut down with a view to effect economy is utterly worthless. The weather forecasts are of vital importance to the landed interests of Australia. Who is to deterthe value of sending out reports to certain districts? An oflicial in an outin back centre may think it unnecessary at a.m. to send a telegram intimating that the river in his district is rising, but before the day is over he may find that I such in/formation was all-important to living many miles lower down. As honourable member for Eden-Monaro re- (Mr Austin Chapman) has said, flood sometimes rise slowly, but after reaching a certain point they come along with a rush, so that it is highly important is that early information of an approaching flood' should be sent out. It is dangerous to allow the Department to say that it will discontinue the issue of such reports as appear to the officials to be unimportant. In the absence of better evidence than we have had this afternoon, I question whether the Government Meteorologist is in a position to determine the value of all such information to country and coastal districts. For the sake of the small amount of money that is to be nominally saved by a bookkeeping entry, there is no necessity to depart from the old service, to which everybody is accustomed, and for which all look. The Minister might well reconsider his decision; and I do not think he will meet with any trouble in this House if the expenditure of his Department is increased by a few hundreds or thousands of pounds. M l . HAY (New England) [3.56] - If the Government had sought a method of antagonizing the country people, it could not have done better than cut down the weather reports. There is no doubt that the curtailment of this service has caused a storm of indignation throughout the rural districts, and also in the cities and large centres, where commercial und financial undertakings have their head-quarters. The rainfall is one of the country's greatest assets, and in a continent in which the climatic conditions are so varied and unreliable, weather reports, especially in regard to the rainfall, have a very important bearing been given to them hitherto. on the whole of our production and commercial undertakings. I read with gratificaparts tion thestatement in the press this morning that the Minister had decided to restore the weather reports, and I understood that to mean a restoration to their former condition. The announcement afforded me a great deal of relief, for, like other honourable members representing country districts, I have been inundated with letters and telegrams upon this subject. Among other centres which have communicated with me are Glen Innes, Armidale, Guyra, Emraaville, Tamworth, and Manila, Barraba, Walcha, and other centres, aud I have to-da.y sent to the innumerable centres from which I have received correspondence telegrams forming them that the Government had decided to restore the old service. I admit that ithe service may require reviewing. It may not be necessary nowadays to send urgent messages from adjacent towns or villages to head-quarters, because through the more general use of the telephone big centres are able to gather and collate information from surrounding villages. The weather reports, however, are mo3t essential to those who are engaged in production and in the commerce and finance of the couutry, and the Government will commit a great blunder if they disregard these important factors. Many of us are not so much concerned as to who governs us, as we are concerned in seeing that all services and conveniences that affect the prosperity, insurance, and guarantees of the country are efficient. These things'mean so much for our credit, and credit means everything to the people engaged in primary production.",23
59,Mr LIVINGSTON,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"Barker) [4.0] We are indebted to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for having brought this matter before the House. It is one of the most important with - which any Parliament can deal. I am certain that the weather reports are looked for by almost every person in country districts. The honourable member who has just preceded me (Mr Hay) knows that the people living along the rivers in Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia look for the weather reports every morning. In fact, the people require a great deal more information than has Proper gauges should be installed in different of Australia to provide reliable data regarding the rainfall. Great rivers are running to waste in Australia, which, in years to come, will be utilized as are the rivers in America and other parts of the world. One good effect of this debate will be to impress upon the people abroad that rain does fall in Australia. As a matter of fact, we get a good deal of rain; but we want more water conservation, and we must have a better system of gauges, so that accurate records of the rainfall may be kept. I know that many visitors have said that what Australia requires is water power. There is in this continent as much water as in in- other countries, but we are not making sufficient use of it. I am surprised at the action of the Government in curtailing the reports; and I feel sure that a man like the Assistant Minister (Sir Granville Ryrie), who has had practical experience of the value of this information, will use his influence to have the old service restored.",24
60,Mr CUNNINGHAM,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"Gwydir) [4.2] I am afraid that the Government did not fully realise what would be the effect of their instructions to curtail expenditure in connection with the Meteorological Department. After listening to the speech of the Minister, one might conclude that the Government adopt the policy of hanging a man first and trying him afterwards. They, presumably, told Mr Hunt to curtail this service, and if the people did not kick up a row that policy would be persisted in ; if the peopio did kick up a row the Government would review it. All this trouble could have been avoided by a consultation between the Government Meteorologist and the Minister before any curtailment of the meteorological service was decided upou. Had that been done, country dwellers would have been spared a lot of annoyance, and the time of honourable members and the Parliament would have been saved. I hope that in future, before any service is curtailed, Ministers will terview the departmental heads in order that they may be fully informed of what is proposed. I am sure that the Minister in charge of the Meteorological Department would never have consented to this curtailment if he had known fully what was to happen. This is a reversal of the Government's expressed intention. Through the Prime Minister they are repeatedly declaring that their policy is to safeguard country interests, and one of the arguments advanced in support of the famous wireless agreement was that by means of wireless this information could be cheaply sent broadcast over Australia. But the first thing the Government have done is to cut down the information that was previously available. It may not be known to the Minister that the instruments have been already shifted from various stations and are not available for the information of the public. The discontinuance of this service means a reduction of trade. For instance, a stock buyer hears that 100 miles away rain has fallen; but .if there is no rain gauge he has no certain knowledge as to whether .the rainfall is sufficient to justify him in buying stock. I ask the Minister to see that these instruments are restored to all country stations. The excuse given by the Department is that instructions have been issued to cut down expenditure, and the Department cannot afford to supply instruments to the rainfall stations. The question - to decide is whether or not the people are prepared to pay for these services. The protests we have received during the last week provide convincing testimony that the people are prepared to pay for information which is absolutely essential-that is, unless they are to run the risk of losing stock through not being able to remove them in time to avoid a flood. In the Gwydir electorate there is a line of towns along the Darling Biver, and there and in the districts adjoining people must, have many days' notice of warning of floods in order that they may get their stock away in time. When the flood arrives it is quite common for the watercourse to be 22 miles wide. Everybody must realise at what au enormous disadvantage these people are placed through in- being deprived of information regarding rainfall and the rise and fall of the rivers. I do not agree with those honourable members who have suggested that because the Government provide this service it costs nothing. Every service that is rendered costs something; but the people are prepared to pay that cost, and nconey for it should be made available to the different Departments by Parliament. I shall never be afraid of voting in favour of making money available for such services as these. In country centres where information is lacking regarding rain in the outside areas, the stock and station agents have sent urgent messages at their own expense in order to get reliable information to lay before prospective, buyers and sellers. By this means the wheels of trade are kept in motion and the stagnation that follows uncertainty is avoided. We are indebted to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) for having persisted in bringing the matter before the House today. The information given to honourable members before the Minister rose today was not such as representatives of the people have a right to expect from the Government. As representatives of our constituents we have a right to know from the Government what their intentions are. It is useless to blame Mr . H u n t ; if the Minister gave him a free hand to reduce these services, the Minister must take the responsibility. I feel certain that this discussion has thrown new light upon the subject, and has proved to the Government that they should not have acted i u such a haphazard manner. Instructions to curtail expenditure have been issued in other Departments. Ministers should get into touch with the beads of those Departments and give them definite statements as to where the curtailment of expenditure should be carried out. Otherwise, during the remaining months of this session we shall have the adjournment of the House moved over and over again to discuss questions which there would be no necessity to debate in Parliament if Ministers would only give instructions that economy must be effected in certain definite directions. Ministers should not give heads of Departments, as their only guide, the sweeping statement that their expenditure must be kept within a certain limit . Such a policy is not only unfair to those in control of Departments and to. the people who have services rendered to them, it is also unfair to honourable members. It means that the business of the House may be held up day after day with matters that should never advance to the stage at which action is necessary to be taken here to secure redress of grievances. I regret that the Government, in this case, have not taken the necessary trouble to insure that the curtailment of expenditure in the Meteorological Department should not be in the wrong direction, because their mistake in this regard has led to the holding up of business and a waste of honourable members' time, and we are only now where we were previous to these instructions being issued.  fact that a Minister has assured the Honse that the curtailment in the supply of meteorological information originally intended will not be carried out may to some extent take the sting out of honourable members' criticism, but it. is false pconomy to have any cutting off of expenditure in this direction and i? inconsistent with the professions of the Government and their declaration in the Governor General's Speech of the importance of primary production. Ministers say that Australia depends solely upon primary production, yet they seek to carry out, at the expense of primary producers, at in pot saving which is really no economy at all.",25
61,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"Would it be of any advantage to primary producers to send to Gabo Island an urgent wire as to the weather conditions on the honourable member's farm'!  imagine that because there is not a very _ big population in the neighbourhood of my farm information in regard to the weather conditions there is unnecessary for the public of Australia, but I remind the Minister that all outlying posts in Australia are important. The supplying of information in regard to weather conditions is a public service which it is the proper function of the Government to undertake. If news as to the weather at my farm is not given to me by the public press through the Meteorological Department of the Commonwealth I am obliged to spend money, as a taxpayer, in procuring the information privately. I am continually watching the Western Australian weather reports published in the Melbourne press. If I cannot get that information in that way I must telegraph at my own expense. But , as a community, we might as well get that in formation collectively and not individually.",26
62,Mr MAHONY,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"The honourable member would let the Government do the worse for him ?  a taxpayer. The taxpayers as a whole have to pay for this information, and when we have scientific developments such as the telegraph and wireless at our disposal and upon which the Government propose to extend their operations, it is a. gross inconsistency on their part to .ittempt curtailment in a direction of which a vast country such as this needs more and more. In progressive nations, not only weather reports, but market reports are flashed from one end of the country to the other, in many cases three times a day. I am glad that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) has raised this question. Not with standing the intimation made by the Minister this afternoon, in my opinion we should get back to where we started to retrench, in this direction if , indeed, the Government are not prepared to give additional information which would be beneficial to the people of Australia.",26
63,Mr FOLEY,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"Kalgoorlie) [ 4 . 1 8 ] - I am pleased that it is the intention of the Government to restore, to a great extent, the services previously at the disposal of people in outback districts. I look upon the question as being one of outback versus city. We cannot assume that the reports sent from. one another are of no value. They give the people in business in another State the opportunity of telegraphing to their local representatives and asking what the conditions of markets and so forth may be. There is certainly a great deal of duplication in the matter of weather reports, information as to flood waters and so forth . Many States are spending considerable sums of money each year upon the upkeep of observatories, a work which is within the province of the Commonwealth Government. It is particularly valuable for prospectors to know the weather conditions in districts where they propose to prospect for gold or other minerals. It is particularly valuable to a prospector to know whether the lakes, for instance, which cover such vast areas in the interior of Australia are likely to be impassable at the time of his visit, or whether he Would be prevented by floods from reaching the spot where he intends to carry on operations. Weather reports also help stock-owners. absolutely necessary that the markets in various towns should be supplied with beef and mutton, but they cannot be so supplied unless the cattle and sheep are moved from the various stations and farms where they are fattened. Stock, however, cannot be moved, particularly in outback districts, u n t il there is a demand. It is, therefore, highly important that the buyers in, the towns where there is a demand for stock should be in a position to wire the owners of stock as to the weather conditions on the stock routes along which the cattle or sheep are likely to pass. Information thus supplied often enables the stock-owner to divert his cattle or sheep to another route, aud thus en-, suros for him the full result of his labours. I trust that when the amended proposals are made known by the Minister, the House wil l have an opportunity of expressing an opinion on them. I . d o not agree with the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham). Parliament is the place where these matters should be discussed i u order that honourable members may see that the people in their constituencies are getting what they . have a right to expect",27
64,Mr GABB,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"Angas) [ 4 . 2 4 ] - I am not one who feels that he ought to condemn the Government because they have attempted some economy. I would rather State to commend them for practising economy if ib can be effected without unduly endangering life or efficiency. In this matter of the curtailment of meteorological reports we have a good illustration of that economy which so many believe in , that is to say, economy at the expense of the other fellow. I rise, this afternoon, to direct attention to another aspect of the question which is not so much related to the possibility of loss of l if e the effect of weather and river height reports upon the navigation of the River M u r r a y and its tributaries. I have lived on the Murray for some years. It is customary for huge stores of goods to be located at Morgan, in South Australia. As soon as advice comes forward that heavy rains have fallen in New South Wales, barges are immediately loaded and taken in tow by steamers to the Murrumbidgee and Darling Rivers, because although, as the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) has explained, flood waters may be It is twenty-two miles wide in some places, the rivers very quickly subside. It is important that the navigation companies working on the rivers should know when to despatch their boats from such points as Morgan in order to take stores to the towns and stations up the tributary rivers and return into the Murray itself. W it h respect to the settlers along the lower Murray, there is recurrent danger of the reclaimed swamps being inundated. Complete and reliable advice, therefore, is essential for the success and welfare of those settlers. W it h respect to the provision of a limited service, I should say that if necessary reports were made'available once or twice a week the situation would be sufficiently covered: that is, so far as the interests of navigation and the welfare of reclaimed swamp settlers are concerned. I can well understand that under the system obtaining in Government Departments a certain line of information may be coming to band day after day, year after year, and that much of this detailed matter, which has worn quite a groove or rut for itself, may be really unnecessary. If some of this unimportant data be pared away and the really essential information retained and elaborated, no one would say that this debate has been in vain.",27
65,Mr CORSER,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"Wide Bay) [4.27j - I hope the Government will not practise economy in directions where it is essential that public services shall be retained in full, if not elaborated. As an outcome of recent agitation, in which I joined, a wireless station' has beeu installed in the Willis Island Group, off the coast of Queensland, from which notification is given concerning approaching cyclones. Information from that source is absolutely invaluable. The same may be said for much mainland advice which has been received year after year through the Meteorological Department. On occasions I have known of a complete absence of rainfall on the Burnett River, in Queensland; and yet, almost without warning, floods have swept down, 13 feet high. But for the information officially given through the sources under review today, tremendous damage and loss of stock would have occurred. However, settlers have been kept in touch with the state of the streams which feed the Burnett, so that it has been possible to remove live stock before the floods have reached them. This applies to other portions of the State. A year or two ago I impressed upon officers of the Department concerned the importance of procuring fuller particulars, in view of the grave risk and the actual loss occasioned in the locality of which I have been speaking. The necessary information was thereafter provided, and has since been coming regularly to hand, much to the gratification and profit of settlers concerned. I am glad to learn from the Minister that these important particulars will still be made available. It is the duty of the Government to see that all essential news of the kind is promptly and regularly supplied. I know that many people would prefer to pay directly for all such information rather than that it should be withheld. I cannot believe that the Government will act so unwisely as to curtail the supply of this essential news. In conclusion, I may add that I have received a protest only today from Chambers of Commerce in my electorate.",28
66,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"Robertson) [4.31] - I have been naturally disappointed to find that, although the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) furnished me with an answer on the 14th of July stating that tihe serious state of affairs brought about by the curtailment of the meteorological information would be remedied, it should have been necessary for an honourable member to take specific action today. Almost innumerable complaints have been received from all over the country during the past few days. One important aspect has been overlooked this afternoon, although the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) made some reference to the point which I had in mind when he alluded to the settlers on the Lower Murray. It is very difficult for any official to say which are the stations in a given area from which weather reports and the like should be drawn. It is essential for persons living on and engaged about the great watersheds of our river systems to be kept informed of the aggregate rainfall over the whole area; and"", thus, it is just as necessary that these reports should be drawn from places where there may be only two or three residents as from those in which 200 or 300 people are living. I resided for many years on the upper reaches of one of the watersheds of the Murray. I have seen the river bed in that neighbourhood dry for hundreds of yards; and at other times I have known that same area to be covered by water, sometimes for 26 miles in width. Another phase of the subject lies in the fact that, in Australia, we are just beginning to realise the possibilities of hydro-electric schemes. There are many places, par-, ticularly in New Soutli Wales and Queensland, where projects of this character can be established. I have in mind one site on the north coast which stands out naturally as the most promising of all. It is desirable that complete records of rainfall covering the whole of such districts and river systems as these should be received and officially tabulated. I hope the Government will not only retain the old system in full, but that, as far 'as possible, the provision of these reports shall be extended and improved. A policy of cutting down would be penny wise and pound foolish. As for the danger to life, property, and stock, mentioned by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton), I can support all that has been said in that direction. It is a fact that, in parts of his electorate as well as in my own, through which the Hunter runs, there is sometimes actual danger to life because of sudden floods from the northern areas. Indeed, lives have been lost in the past because of lack of due warning.",28
67,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,And many thousands of head of stock have been swept away.,29
68,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,Yes ; the properties and household goods of settlers also. I again urge that these weather reports be restored in full. Honorable MEMBERS - Divide !,29
69,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GOVERNMENT LINE OF,"Eden Monaro) [4.36] - I am not anxious to occupy further time; and, if honourable members desire, we shall have a division. Certainly, the subject-matter is of sufficient importance to warrant a vote. I admit that the position of the Honorary Minister (Sir Granville Ryrie) is awkward. He has responsbility without power. I emphasize the point raised by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming). In ray own district certain large water-power schemes on the Shoalhaven and other rivers have been proposed. It is essential that the supply from various watersheds, and furnished by specific streams, should be authoritatively known and recorded. When certain big firms come out to Australia from England to spend millions in establishing great water-power projects, they should be able to draw upon official data in the directions I have just indicated. The Government should not revert to a partial system of obtaining reports. No expenditure is involved in securing the information. There will be no saving by cutting down the volume of reports; no public servant will lose his job. As for that aspect, however, I ask again who is originally responsible for what has been done. A hue and cry has been raised throughoyt the country over this matter. I am getting suspicious. It would seem that a certain line of action is being taken in some of our public Departments to cast odium upon the Government. I resent that, and the Government should sec to it that such a thing does not happen again. Question-That the House do now adjourn-put . The House divided.

Up to 30th June, the Phosphate Commission's prices were 75s. to 80s. per ton. On Ist July, prices were reduced to 55s. 6d. per ton. While it is impossible to arrive at the average world's price for phosphatic rock over this period, owing to varying exchanges, different qualities of phosphate, freights, &c, these can be roughly assessed at between £5 and £6 per ton. When the Phosphate Commission first shipped to New Zealand, for instance, New Zealand buyers were paying £5.16s. for phosphatic rock of a slightly lower quality. The Commissioners, by competition, reduced this price to £4 5s. for a better product, and since 1st July prices have dropped still further, to 5Ss. 6d. per ton.

103,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.0] - I move That the House of Representatives approves of the distribution of the State of New South Wales into electoral divisions as proposed by Messrs. .T. Broughton, S. Irwin, and H. A. Smith, the Distribution Commissioners for the purpose of distributing the said. State into divisions, in their report laid before Parliament on the 2!>bh day of June, 1922, and that the. names of the division? suggested in. the report and indicated in red on the maps referred to therein be adopted except that the name ""Barten"" he substituted for ""Kogarah,"" and the name "" Reid "" for "" Granville."" The Distribution Commissioners, who were appointed for the purpose of reStates. distributing the State of New South Wales into electoral districts, having furnished their report, and the report, in pursuance of section 23 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, having been placed before Parliament, the present motion is now submitted, in pursuance of section 24, for the purpose of enabling the House to pass a resolution approving of the proposed divisions. The distribution became necessary under section 25, sub-section 2a, - which provides that whenever au alteration is made in the number of members of the House of Representatives to be elected for a State, a redistribution of the State into divisions may be proclaimed in the manner set out in the section. A census' was taken of the population of Australia, and, as a result of that, a. redistribution of States divisions haa been necessitated because an alteration has been brought about in the number of members in two of the States concerned. The last redistribution in New South Wales was made in 1912. Between the date of the census of 1911, upon which the previous redistribution was made, and the next census of 1921, considerable change has The population of New South Wales, has increased from 1,646,734 to 2,099,763.. or by 27.51 per cent.

I shall point out exactly the basis upon which we are acting, and the limitations by which we are bound. Section 24 of the Constitution statesThe House of Representatives slui.ll be composed af members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth, and the number of such members shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of thu senators. The number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their people, and shall, until the Parliament otherwise provides, be determined, whenever necessary, in the following manner:(i) A quota shall be ascertained by dividRepresentatives, ing the number of the people of the Commonwealth, as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, by twice the number of the oenators. (ii) The number of members to be chosen in each State shall be determined by metic. dividing the number of the people the State, as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, by the quota; and if on such division there is a remainder greater than one-half of the quota, one more member shall be chosen in the State. But notwithstanding anything in this section, five members at least shall be chosen in eaoh original State. I invite honourable members' attention to the fact that there are throe or four distinct features in this section. In the first place it says that "" the House of Representatives shall be composed of members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth, and the number of such members shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of the senators."" the first limitation is that the number of members in the House of Representatives is limited by the number of members in the Senate. At present there are thirtysix members in the Senate, and it moans that the number of members of the House of Representatives shall, as nearly as practicable, be seventy-two. Of course there is power in the Constitution to increase the number of the members of the House of Representatives and the number of senators, but the principle is laid down as a fundamental one that there should be what is called the two-to-one ratio, and we have no power to alter it ; it is fixed and determined by the Constitution itself. Therefore, in making all our calculations, we have to keep that limitation in view. We have not power to fix the numbers arbitrarily, or to choose some line of our own, to satisfy a passing condition of affairs, if it violate that fundamental principle.",35
104,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"How was the fixed at, seventy-five, in the first place? Mr Qroom.",36
105,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"I am coming to that point. From Quick and Garran, at page 450, we read the following regarding the words "" as nearly as practicable "":These words are not intended to allow the Parliament a discretionary latitude in fixing the number of the members.of the House of but to provide for the slight variation that may be caused by the provision for the minimum representation of a State, and also by the provision for representing fractions of a quota. According to the mode provided in this section for determining the number of members, the "" quota"" of representation is to be ascertained by pure arithSo far, the words, "" as nearly as of practicable "" are unnecessary. But the quota so obtained, though it of course divides exactly into the population of the Commonwealth, is not likely to divide exactly into the E opulation oF each State. There will probably e fractions in each State, arithmetically entitled to a fraction of a member; and whether these fractions are ignored altogether, or whether provision is made - as in this section-for assigning a member to any fraction greater than one-half the quota, the result may be to slightly disturb the "" two-toone ratio."" A further, and, at present, more considerable element of disturbance is the provision that each State shall have at least five representatives. On a population basis Tasmania, is at present only entitled to three representatives; and her two additional members, not being allowed for by the quota calculation, go to increase the number of members beyond the "" two to one So ratio."" The Parliament, when it makes ""other provisions "" for determining the number of members, will be bound by the constitutional provision to make their number "" as nearly as practicable twice the number of the senators"": and the clear intention is that the absolute ratio should only he departed from so far as may be necessary to adjust fractional and minimum representation. Of course, there is provision in the Constitution for minimum representation of States. Each of the six original States must have five members; but those five are not to be taken into consideration in working out the .arithmetical sum to determine the quotas under section 24. That section lays down clearly that the basis for working out the representation is seventy-two, and because fractional results are sure to be produced by dividing the population of the States by the quota, it provides that whenever there is a fraction of more than half of the quota number the State shall be entitled to an additional member. We are absolutely bound by that quota. Section 24 provides f u r therThe. number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their people That, also, is fundamental, and we cannot alter that. In. working out the arithmetical sum, the populations of the States must be kept in viewand shall, until the Parliament otherwise provides, be determined whenever necessary in the following manner:The remaining part of the section states how the arithmetical calculation must be worked out. The Constitution says that the representation of each State shall be determined ""whenever necessary."" That is where Parliament's discretionary power comes in . Parliament may determine the manner in which the representation shall be divided, within the limitation prescribed in paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 24, "" whenever necessary."" In 1905 the question of the allocation of members amongst the States first arose. There was then no Federal statute to regulate the procedure; it was dependent upon Executive action. The Government were faced with difficulties as to who should act, and what was meant by the "" latest statistics"" referred to in the Constitution. A great deal of controversy arose, and Parliament took definite action by passing the Representation Act of 1905. Parliament decided first of all that the determination of when re-allocation of representation was necessary should not be controlled by the Executive - or the Parliament, because obviously such control would provide an opening for political engineering or the pressure of political exigencies. It therefore gave control into the hands of an independent authority. It defined, first of all, the times at which it should be considered necessary to make an enumeration, in order to determine the representation rights of the respective States. In the second place the Act set up an independent authority. Section 3 made provision for an enumeration day based upon the first census taken after the commencement of the Act, and at the expiration of every fifth year thereafter.' A series of rules set out in the schedule prescribed the method for ascertaining the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth and of the several States where the enumeration day was not a census day. The statistics produced in that way constitute the oflicial legal evidence upon which the Chief Electoral Oflicer acts in dependently, and quite irrespective of Parliament itself. That is as it should be. To the Chief Electoral Officer is left the duty of working out the proportion. The Statistical omcers must provide the Chief Electoral Officer witli statistical information, and, according to section 6, the Chief Electoral Officer, after ascertaining the number of people in accordance with th© Act , must make and forward to the Minister a certificate. That certificate was forwarded and published in the Commonwealth Gazette of 29uh August of last year. It constitutes evidence of the number of people of the Commonwealth and of the several States. The next step which the Chief Electoral Oflicer has to take is to determine the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in the several States in accordance with the principles laid down in section 10 of the Representation Act. Section 24 of the Constitution says that the representation of the States shall be determined in the manner prescribed "" until Parliament otherwise provides,"" and Quick and Garran say, in reference to those words: These words empower the Parliament to alter the provisions of sub-sections (I.) and (II.), which deal with the manner of determining the number of members chosen in the several States. This power of alteration is, however, confined within very narrow limits by the permanent and absolute provisions of the section. The rules which are determined absolutely by the section, and which Parliament has no power to alter, are :(1) That the whole number of members shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of the senators; (2) That the number of members chosen in the several States shall be in pro-, portion to the respective numbers of their people; (3) That five members at least shall be chosen in each original State. The provisions for ascertaining the quota, and for dealing with the question of fractions, may only be altered subject to those absolute rules; so that the power of the Parliament to alter the basis of apportionment is very small. However, acting upon that provision in the Constitution, Parliament passed febe Representation Act, under which the Chief Electoral Officer is acting. Section 12 of the Act says: When in pursuance of a certificate under this Act an alteration takes place in the number of members of the House of Representamust tives to be chosen in any State, the alteration two. - shall not affect(a) Any election held before the State has been redistributed into electoral diviand sions pursuant to the certincate, nor constitutional (b) any election to fill a vacancy in a House upset. of Representatives elected such redistribution, but shall affect any general election after redistribution. That is a mandatory direction to Parliajustice ment that after there has been an alterathat tion in the representation, certified way prescribed, such alteration, carrying out the terms, conditions and spirit of the Constitution, must affect the next general election.",36
106,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,After it has been ratified by Parliament.,38
107,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"No ; the apportionment of members amongst the States is pendent of Parliament. The Chief Electoral Officer has presented a certificate setting out tihe numbers of the people. Under section 9 he has determined the number of members to be chosen in the several States, and has made and forwarded, under section 11, a notification to the Minister of such determination. seventy-two. I have been furnished with figures stowing how the quota has been worked out. The total population of the Commonber wealth at the last enumeration day was seventy-two. 5,416,600. The Chief Electoral Officer has divided that total by seventy-two, because the Act says distinctly that total population must be divided by twice the number of senators.",38
108,Dr EARLE PAGE,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"The says "" as nearly as practicable.""",38
109,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"The number of members to be chosen must be as nearly as practicable seventy-two, and we cannot representation. add an arbitrary number of one, two, three, or four in order to work out mathematical sum that will suit ourselves. If we do that we falsify the terms of Constitution.",38
110,Dr EARLE PAGE,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,Will the Minister accept seventy-one as being as nearly as reasons. practicable twice the number of senators?,38
111,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"It is possible that the nearest practicable number of members Wales? arrived at upon a seventy-two basis may be seventy-one or seventy, but if we make number seventy-three as the divisor we up a seventy-three basis, and not a seventyreturns two basis, which the Constitution mands. As Quick and Garran point out, all we have power to deal with is fractional difference; and the divisor be as nearly aa practicable seventyAnything other than that will falsify the basis of the Constitution make the redistribution unand liable to be Parliament can legislate only before with respect to the fractional quota. such Mr Webster, in his report to the United States Congress, pointed out the absolute of the fractional basis, and said by using the fractional basis and givi n tihe ing an extra member, we are going as near as practicable to the fixed number.",38
112,Sir ROBERT BEST,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,Does the Minister suggest that we cannot alter the fractional basis ?,38
113,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,I said we could alter it.,38
114,Sir ROBERT BEST,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Did ""the Minister not indequote something to the contrary?",38
115,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"No , I said that Mr . Webster pointed out the absolute justice of working upon a fractional basis. The Constitution and the Representation Act lay it down that the number of people of the Commonwealth must be divided by",38
116,Dr EARL EPAGE,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"It does not lay it down at all, but provides that the nummust be as near as practicable to",38
117,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"The number of members to be chosen must be as near as practhe ticable seventy-two. What does "" near as practicable"" mean ? It means what it says, and surely does not mean that it Constitution should be as far away from seventy-two as possible.",38
118,Dr EARLE PAGE,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,We get as near as practicable in all systems of proportional,38
119,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,We can deal with that a when the honourable member submits his proposition; but I do not intend to anticithe pate argument at this juncture. I am endeavouring to set out the conditions under which we are working and give,38
120,Mr BAMFORD,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,Do the Minister's argu: ments affect the position in New South,38
121,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"I am pointing out why the New South Wales is to have an increase set in the number of members. The Census show that the population of dethe Commonwealth is 5,416,600, which, divided by seventy-two-whic h is twice the the number of senators-produce s a quota of 75,231, and gives the following result:-Ne w ""South Wales, Viotoria, 20.358; Queensland, South Australia, 6.584; Western Australia, 4.366; and Tasmania, 2.843. Under the provisions of the Constitution, and of the Bepresentation Act , New South Wales iB entitled to twenty-seven members, but there is in addition, .911, which, being more than half, gives the State twenty-eight. Victoria is below the one-half and, therefore, the number of members in that State is twenty. Queensland figures show a surplus of .938, whioh is over one-half, and that State is therefore entitled to ten members, while South Australia shows a surplus of .584, which is also over one-half, and is therefore entitled to seven members. tern Australia has a surplus of .366, and, according to the provisions of the Constitution, apart from the special conditions, is entitled to four members, while Tasmania is entitled to three. Under the provision which requires each original State to have a minimum of five members"", Tasmania and Western Australia are brought up to that number. number of members to which each State is entitled is therefore:-Ne w South Wales, 28; Victoria,, 20; Queensland, 10; South Australia, 7; Western Australia, 5 and Tasmania 5. Obviously this will at times cause a variation in the representation of the different States, and the position, which affects all States, ought to be decided upon an independent basis, so that the figures shall be given effect to, irrespective of party, political feelings, or local agitation. For this reason this scheme of representation was decided upon, and in accordance with the law the Chief Electoral Officer has submitted his certificate in the following words:Pursuant to the provisions of the Representation - Act of 1905, I hereby notify that I have determined the number of members nf the House of Representatives, to be chosen in the seven States to be as under - Ne w South Wales, 28; Victoria, 20; Queensland, 10; South Australia, 7; Western. Australia, 5; and Tasmania, 5, a total of 75. . Mr Fenton - Does the Minister consider that equitable1",38
122,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Yes , and it works out fairl y to all States. It is not only my opinion, but the opinion of the Convention, which, up to date, has never been questioned. A f t e r a lapse of years the system is now being criticised for the first time; and we must expect that whenever one State's representation is reduced, 27.911; there will naturally be a feeling of dis9.938; satisfaction.",39
123,Mr MAXWELL,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,The shoe will be sure to pinch at times.,39
124,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,Exactly .,39
125,Mr HILL,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,And it will always pinch' those in country districts.,39
126,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"In this instance, I am dealing with the whole of the States and not with country or city representation. We are endeavouring to adjust the numThe ber of members to the State equitably in order to secure a fair and just proportion of representation for every part of the Commonwealth, irrespective of party.",39
127,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,But you are not doingWes- that.,39
128,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,The honourable member will be able to put his case later.,39
129,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,The Minister has already shown that two States have more than their fair shore of representation..,39
130,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"I have not. In apportioning the number of members amongthe States we must have fractions, and. The if we did not allow for fractional figures claims would be made for additional representation. For instance, New South Wales. has a fraction of .911, which clearly indicates that there is a substantial number of electors in that State entitled to representation. The figures for Queensland are .938, which are higher even than those of New South Wales and which show that we must make due allowance for fractions A f t e r having enumerated the population as shown hy the census figures, the Chief Electoral Officer determines the representation to he given and notifies the Minister under section 1 1 , and upon that basis New South Wales is .entitled to twenty-eight members. We now pass to a different principle. Having determined the number of members on a population basis, the next step is to divide the State in to constituencies based upon the electoral population-the electors in the State and not the number of people. Of course-, there is a. variation in the electoral population in the different States, and I find the percentage of adults to the total population in respect of the census of 1911 to be as follows:-Ne w South Wales, 55.80; Victoria, 57.12; Queensland, 54.33; South Australia, 56.17; Western ' Australia, 59.05; and Tasmania, 52.63. Tho returns on the 1921 census are hot yet available. W it h such a fluctuation the percentagesmust be reflected in the electoral population. Prom first time an Electoral A ct was considered i u this House it has always been considered a permanent principle that the distribution of electorates should not .be done by Parliament nor by an executive act of the Government of the tfay. Originally in the 1902 Act one Electoral Commissioner was provided, - arid later, in 1909, the number was in creased to three. Speaking from memory, I think the Bill introduced in 1909 was when Sir George Fuller was Minister for Home Affairs. The Commissioners are instructed under section 15 of the Electoral Act, which providesEach State shall be distributed into electoral divisions equal in number to the number of members of the House of Kepresentatives to he chosen for the State, and one member of the House of Representatives shall be chosen for each division. That lays down the principle of single electorates. Section 18 providesFor the purposes of - the Act, the Chief Electoral Oflicer shall, whenever necessary, ascertain a quota for each State as follows':-The whole number of electors in each State, as nearly as can he ascertained, shall ho. divided by the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen for that State. Section 19 provides thatIn making any proposed distribution of a State into divisions the Distribution Commissioners shall give due consideration to-(a ) community or diversity of interest; (b) means of communication; (o) physical features: (d) existing boundaries of divisions and subdivisions; (e) Stato electoral boundaries, and Subject thereto the quota of electors shall be the basis for distribution, and the Distribution Commissioners may adopt a margin of allowance to be used whenever necessary, but in no case shall such quota be departed from to a greater extent than one-fifth more or one-fifth less. That has been the continuous direction of Parliament practically since the establess, lishment of Federation. sioners are bound to proceed upon that and basis.",39
131,Mr GIBSON,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"If that is the direction of. Parliament, why has it not heen exercised ?",40
132,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,It has heen exercised. ' Mr GIBSON - As the quotas have repolitan mained the same it could not have been exercised.,40
133,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,The quotas have varied the from time to time.,40
134,Mr GIBSON,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,I am r e f e r r i ng to the one-fifth margin bf allowance. That has never been exercised.,40
135,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"It has been exercised in all distributions. The margin of one-fifth is the l i m it . In nearly every in stance the quota has been departed from , but the Commissioners have not gone to the full one-fifth margin mainly because of section 25, sub-section 2, paragraph b, which provides(1) A redistribution of any State into divisions shall be made in the manner hereinafter provided whenever directed by the Governor General by proclamation. (2) Such proclamation may Be made(b) Whenever in one-fourth of the divisions of the State the number of the electors differs from a quota ascertained in the manner provided in this part to a greater extent than one-fifth more or one-fifth less. If the Commissioners brought up their margin to the full one-fifth permitted, the distribution of scats would be out of joint in a very short timo. Tho fluctuations of population in Australia are such that if in half the electoral divisions the margin of one-ftfth were adopted the observance of the requirements of section 25 would very soon necessitate a fresh redistribution. I come now to deal with the result of the redistribution in New South Wales. Honourable members know the details of their own constituencies much better than I do. The Commissioners, who are outside the control of the Executive and Parliament, were duly informed by the Chief Electoral Officer that the State of New South Wales was to be distributed into twenty-eight divisions, and that the quota for the State had been ascertained to be 39,478. Allowin g for the margin of one-fifth more or one-fifth they could give a maximum number The Commisof electors in any one division of 47,373 a minimum number of 31,583. Since the last distribution in 1912 the number of electors in the State of New South Wales had increased from 935,744 tc: 1,105,380. The Commissioners proceeded to divide the State into two partsmetropolitan divisions and extra-metro-, divisions. They allotted to metropolitan divisions thirteen members for 535,171 electors, an average enrolment of 41,167. The extra metropolitan divisions they fixed at fifteen for 570,209 electors, an average enrolment of 38,014. twenty-eight divisions thus fixed have average enrolment of 39,478. In the city electorates the average enrolment, 41,167, exceeds the average quota for the State, 39,478; the average enrolment for country divisions, 38,014, is below the average , quota for the State. There were eleven divisions in 1912 in the metropolitan list of metropolitan divisions. area as against thirteen divisions in the present distribution. There are fifteen divisions in the extra-metropolitan area in the present proposals a3 against sixteen in the distribution of 1912. In 1912 the enrolment in the metropolitan divisions was 412,675. At the present time it is 543,276, a net increase of 130,601, or 31.6 per cent. In. 1912, thfl enrolment in extra metropolitan diviinasmuchas it is sions' - was 523,069. The present ment is 562,104, a net increase of 39,035. or 7.5 per cent., as compared with the 31.6 p w cent, increase in metropolitan divisions. Tho necessity for redistributing State of New South Wales is manifest the fact that the number of electors in sioner's report. existing divisions runs from 72,439 in Parkes, to 23,635 in Barrier, a range of Speaker 48,804. Under the proposed distribution, the number of electors - will r u from 43,265 in West Sydney to 36,546 Darling, a rang© of only 6,719. Division of Barrier, whose enrolment dwindled from 29,269 in 1912 to 23,63"", at t h * present time, disappears, and has been to a large extent merged in the adjacent Division of Darling. The D i sion of Nepean also disappears from the list of extra metropolitan divisions, and has been absorbed in Macquarie, Parrain matta, Werriwa, Granville, arid M a r t The Parramatta Division, which will sist of the outlying portions sent Parramatta, Nepean, and Illawarra Divisions, becomes an extra metropolitan division. The Commissioners propose change the name of Eden-Monaro to Monaro.",40
136,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,What for i,41
137,Mr GROOM,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"I have not the slightest idea. I can see no reason for not ing to the old name, and I leave the ter to the House. Other alterations in the extra metropolitan divisions consist of necessary adjustments as between the divisions In the metropolitan' area the greater portion of the existing Division of North 7 The Sydney will constitute the new Division an of Warringah, whilst the remainder of North Sydney, with portion of the existing Division of Parramatta, will be known as North Sydney. A new division, M a r t in , will be constituted from portion of the existing Divisions of Nepean, Parkes, and Parramatta, which last named division will disappear from the Another new division, designated Granville by the Commissioners, but which it is proposed ou my motion to call Reid, will be created from the existing Divisions of Nepean and Parkes. A new division which the Commissioners suggest shall be. called' Kogarah, but to which it is proposed the name Barton shall be given, is constituted by portions of Illawarra and Lang. Illawarra wil l no longer remain as a division, divided between enrolKogarah, or Barton, Monaro, Parramatta, and Werriwa. The remaining alterations of the metropolitan divisions are merely adjustments t'o more nearly equalize the number of electors in the divisions.

142,Mr HUGHES,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Bendigo-Prime Min1921. ister and Minister for External Affairs) [5.57],- I move That this House approves the Treaty between the United States of America, the British Empire, France, and Japan, relating to their insular Possessions and insular the .Pacific Ocean, signed at Washington, 13tli December, 1021, the declaration signed on that date accompanying that Treaty, and the Treaty between those Powers supplementary to that Treaty, signed at Washington on the 6th February, 1922. Honourable members are aware that four other Treaties in addition to this were signed on hehalf of the Commonwealth at the Washington Conference, and due notice has heen given of my intention to move their approval by this House. All these Treaties bear one upon the other in such a way as to make it. convenient and proper that the debate on this motion shall cover the whole range of the work done at the Washington Conference. The motions can be put to the House separately. Honourable members will recollect that, in July, 1921, the Government of the United States of America issued invitations to the great Naval Powers to attend a Conference to be held at Washington with a view to arriving at some understanding concerning the limitation of armaments. As it was considered that success could not be hoped for unless the Pacific and Far Eastern questions had been previously settled, it was suggested that these matters he dealt with at the same time. This suggestion, happily for mankind, was acceptable to the Powers interested, the invitations were accepted, the Conference took place, and the Treaties now before this House, and which I am asking the House to approve, are the result of its labours. Before dealing with the provisions of the Treaties, a few preliminary words may be permitted. Honourable members will recollect that, on my return from the Imperial Conference held in London in 1921, I made a. i-eport on the position as it then stood. It is well known to honourable raortfbers that the chief reason for summoning the Imperial Conference was the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, which.it was then thought would expire, by effluxion of time, some time during the summer months of The attitude of this House and the Commonwealth towards the AngloJapanese Alliance was stated by me in the discussions that took place in this chamber before-my departure for England, and I may venture to remind honourable memDominions in bers of what I saidSpeaking broadly, we are in favour of its renewal, but there are certain difficulties which must be faced. One of these arises out of the attitude of America towards this Treaty. I am sure I state the opinion of Australia when I say the people have a very warm corner in their hearts for America. They see in America today what they themselves hope to bo in the future. We have a country very similar in extent and resource, and it may be laid down as a sine qua rum that any future Treaty with Japan satisfactory to Australia must specifically exclude the ipossibility of a war with the United States of America. In any future treaty we must guard against even the SUBS icion of hostility or unfriendliness to the nited States. These words express the view generally shared by the people of this country. During the course of the debate which preceded my departure, I said the ideal would be a tripartite Treaty satisfactory to Japan, the United States of America, and the British Empire. The representatives of Empire met in London in June, 1921; the questiou of renewal of the Japanese Treaty was discussed at great length. Before a decision was reached the invitations to the Powers to attend the Washington Conference were issued. This invitation had an immediate and profound effect upon the Imperial Conference debate on the subject. The Lord Chancellor's opinion that the AngloJapanese Treaty did not lapse, as had been thought, and that the notification to the League of Nations was not a notice of determination as provided for in . the Treaty cleared the way of all difficulties, and by general consent a decision on the question of renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty was postponed until after the Washington Conference had concluded its labours. Meanwhile the Treaty stood, and would continue in force until twelve months' notice of its determination had been given by the parties to it. That was the position when I returned to Australia. The Imperial Conference understood that the United States of America Government would not favour an invitation - being extended to representatives of the Overseas Dominions. But. happily, as the result of diplomatic conversations, this difficulty was overcome, and the British Empire Delegation included., representatives of the Overseas Dominions, who went to the Conference as representatives of EEs Majesty the King, and sat at the Conference on a footing of absolute equality with the representatives of the Dnited Kingdom. So much by way ofpreface. » I now come to a statement of what was done by ' the Washington Conference. Honourable members know that as soon as it was made clear that Australia could he represented, my right honourable colleague, Senator Pearce, was appointed as its representative. He attended the Conference and rendered great service to this country and to the Empire. It may be fairly said that he served with distinction to himself and credit to the Commonwealth. The Conference met in Washington on 1.1th November last. As is well known, the original purpose of the Conference was confined to the limitation of naval armament. This was dealt with by representatives of the fiv6 great naval Powers, the British Empire, the United States of America, France, Italy, and Japan. But other questions which were responsible for the naval rivalry of the Pacific were also discussed. As I pointed out in this country before my departure for England and subsequently in England, upon the solution of the Pacific problems depended the satisfactory settlement of the limitation of armaments. The other Powers represented at thu Conference were Belgium, China, Holland, and Portugal. These Powers, while not taking part in the discussion of the limitation of naval armament, were represented on matters concerning the Pacific and the Par East. I propose to deal with the Treaties in turn. Honourable members have had placed in their hands the report of my right honourable colleague, Senator Pearce, which deals with these matters at great length and with admirable lucidity. There are six Treaties with which we are concerned. Two others arc Treaties which affect Japan and China inter se, but do not affect us. There are also a number of "" Besolutions "" to which I wish to direct the attention of honourable members, because, although they are not covered by the motion I have submitted, they are of very great importance. I want honourable members to note them, because if they have any objection to their acceptance, it ought to be stated, otherwise it will be taken for granted that by our silence we approve them. Honourable members will of course acquaint themselves with the purport of these resolutions, but I think they will, without exception, agree with me that they are such that we can Approve without discussion. I turn now to the Treaties which concern us. As I have said, they are six in number, aud they may be grouped under four headings. The first is the Quadruple Treaty relating to the Pacific, the Declaration made at the time of the signature of the Quadruple Treaty, and the supplement to the Quadruple Treaty. The second is the Treaty relating to naval armaments. The third is the Far Eastern Treaty, and the fourth the Chinese Customs Treaty. The Quadruple Treaty was made by Great Britain, the United States of America, Prance and Japan. By this Treaty the parties agree to respect each other's rights to insular possessions and rights in the Pacific. This is a Treaty which concerns us very nearly. I would remind honourable members of the position when the Conference met. The rivalry between Japan and America had been growing for years. The prospective combatants had been at the outset so far separated as to make naval hostilities, in fact, impossible. It is well known that naval operations cannot be conducted unless the bases are so situated as to enable vessels to refit, to coal or obtain oil fuel, and, generally, to obtain those things necessary to keep the sea. The position may he shortly summarized: The navies of Japan and America were growing with alarming raptdity. , The position of the British Empire was vitally concerned, although the stage on which this great naval struggle was to he fought was remote from Britain herself. Tho interests of the British Empire in the Pacific arc very great, and the maintenance of these depended upon sea power. It had been an axiom for two centuries that the British Navy must be maintained at a two-Power standard. It became obvious, therefore, that every .increase by America and Japan involved not only a corresponding, hut a greater increase by Great Britain. The possibilities of active naval hostilities between Japan and America depended on the establishment of naval bases sufli-ciently near to one another to enable the .rival fleets to operate. As time - pro- armaments. gressed, each one of these rivals was pushing her naval stations further and further out, along the two sides of a triangle, converging upou a point which was Australia. At length they had stretched out almost within striking distance of oach other, but where each of the combatants would have been actually nearer to Australia than to one another. We were in deadly peril. Whatever may have been the consequences to the respective combatants, about our danger there cculd be no doubt. That was the position when the Washington Conference assembled. Of all those countries whose representatives sat around that Conference table, Australia was the most vitally concerned. None had so much to lose. We have a coastline to defend which is far beyond the powers of five and a-half millions of people. The causes of naval rivalry between America and Japan were evident. They arose out of their circumstances in the Pacific. Honourable members know the position of Japan. Her geographical circumstances are such that it is almost impossible for her to maintain an - economic equilibrium. There is, in Japan,- a group of islands whose soil is, to a large extent, unfertile. has heen estimated that perhaps not more than 40 per cent, of Japanese soil ii arable. Yet those islands maintain a population of 50,000,000-and this huge population was living on an area of land much less in size than the Mandated Territories which we have lately taken over. Almost irresistible forces were pushing the Japanese people out into the lands of the great ocean of the Pacific. That was the position of Japan. On the other hand, America viewed with jealous apprehension the now Power .rising in that ocean, and it was clear that, unless an equilibrium could be established there-one which would give Japan opportunities for that inevitable development which is the only alternaMr Hughes. tive to her extinction- a struggle must take place. The parties met the other representatives of the Great Powers and those other nations having interests in the Pacific. The Quadruple Treaty is the result of their deliberations. The subjects covered by the Treaty were debated independently of the limitation of naval China was vitally interested in this discussion. Time will not permit me to sot out at length China's position; but honourable members, no doubt, are familiar with the results of those movements by Japan during the war, which, to say the least of it, embarrassed China and menaced her territorial integrity. There was, for example, the attitude of Japan towards Shantung. There was an ever-present menaco to China's territorial integrity arising from the very circumstances of. this island empire which has sprung up within the memory of living man, and which has evolved from a race of primitive people to one of the greatest and most powerful of the nations in the world. It was clear that if we were to have peaco in the Pacific-which concerns us more than anybody else, because we have most to lose, and are the least able to hold what we have-a n equilibrium had to bo established. That has been achieved, and the Quadruple Treaty lays down in clear and unambiguous language what are its conditions. They are, briefly:That, the parties agree to respect each It other's rights in relation to insular possessions and insular dominions' in the regions of the Pacific Ocean. That any controversy arising out of Pacific questions and involving rights is to be referred to a conference of parties for consideration and adjustment. That there is to be full and frank communication as between the parties. 'That the Treaty is to remain in force for ten years, and, after the expiration of thut period, is to continue in force sub-, ject to the right of any of the contracting parties to terminate it at twelve months' notice. This Quadruple Treaty is to be ratified as soon as possible, and is to take effect from the deposit of - the ratifications at Washington, whereupon the agreement between Great B r it a in and Japan is to terminate. The declaration which was made at the same time as this Treaty-to which I have just referred-stated Tho Treaty shall apply to the Mandated Territories in the Facilic, Japanese and Australian, but the Treaty shall not be deemed to be an assent by the United States to the Mandates, and shall not preclude agreements between the United States and the mandatory powers in relation thereto. Controversies referred to in Article 1 of the Treaty shall not embrace questions lying within domestic jurisdiction. The original Treaty included the mainit land of Japan and excluded America. This wounded the amour propre of the Japanese, but by the supplement tothc Quadruple Treaty Japan proper has been excluded, and she now occupies the same position as America, Australia, and Zealand. The Mandated Territories, Japanese and Australian, are included, but the mainlands of the United States America, Japan, Australia, and New land are excluded from the provisions the Treaty. Honourable members not, I hope, be under any misapprehenthe sion as to what this supplementary Treaty means. The object of the main Treaty was to establish an equilibrium, and i ivas agreed, after discussion, that that could best foe achieved by the acceptance ' of the status quo. The present rights the parties were to be respected. Mandated Territories were-to be-included as covered by the scope of the Treaty, and the rights of the parties in respect those Mandated Territories were such wero prescribed by the Treaty of sailles, which, amongst other things, hibits the fortification of the Mandated Territories. That prohibition In regard to the mainlands, the position otherwise. Japan is able to for t if mainland, America is ablo to for t if y we in Australia and New Zealand may for t if y ours. This Treaty does not our rights in this respect. This Treaty establishes an equilibrium in the Pacific. As far as any action of man can do it insures peace for the next ton for Australia. This is a great thing for attacked. this young Commonwealth. Nothing been done at any Conference, or by Treaty, which means so much to us Australia as that done in Washington and embodied in this Quadruple Treaty. It haa to bo noted that the Quadruple Treaty is to be substituted for the AngloJapanese Treaty, and so soon as it - is ratified, and the ratifications by the various Powers have been deposited at Washington, then, ipso facto, the AngloJapanese Treaty merges or disappears, and the Quadruple Treaty takes its place. That Treaty will continue, as I have said, for a period of ten years, and thereafter as the parties may determine. I have said that it is a substitute for the Japanese Treaty. It yet differs fundamentally from in one important respect, which it is as well that honourable members and my fellow citizens generally should understand. The Anglo-Japanese Treaty was a Treaty of alliance, and-subjec t to a modification which was made in it i u New 1911, whereby it was provided that no obligation should lie on either of the parties in regard to any dispute with any of nation with which one of the parties had Zeaa Treaty of arbitration-impose d upon of the Empire an obligation to give armed will assistance to its ally. Great Britain and' Empire having a Treaty of arbitration with America, uo provision of the Japanese Treaty could involve us in war t with America; but, subject to that, - there was an obligation on each of the parties to give armed assistance in the event of the of other party being attacked. That was our The position under the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. Under the Quadruple Treaty we find ourselves in a very different case. to There is no obligation ou the part of any as one of the Powers to go to the assistance Verof any of the others. Tho force behind prothe Treaty is a moral one; it is world opinion, the moral force at the disposal remains. of these four great Powers. We ought is not to underestimate the value of world y her opinion, and we should indeed have reason hers, to despair of civilization if , after these ages of man's progress upon earth, we had l i m it not advanced some little way towards an abandonment of recourse to arms to settle our disputes. But the fact remains that eo, thero is nothing in this Treaty that years guarantees us any protection if we are The position of Australia has under this Treaty is this: The Quadany ruple Treaty has cleared away all, those in difficulties that made for war in the Pacific; it has, so far as human effort can achieve such things, brought about peace - where there was war, and it has given us for, at any rate, ten years, an assurance of peace. If we require assurance to he doubly sure, if we are not satisfied with this, as, indeed, some of us may not be, then there is only one sure and certain defence for Australia, and that lies in a virile and sufficiently numerous population. Our present safeguard' lies wholly where it has always been-in the fact that we are a partner of the British Empire. That is the beginning and end .of our safety.",42

144,Mr HUGHES,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"I turn now to the Naval Armament Treaty, for the consummation of which the Conference was particularly summoned. The position created hy naval rivalryhas already been outlined, and I "" shall now deal with this matter very shortly, setting out the provision of the Treaty, what it does, and its effect, upon Australia, and the world generally. The first thing to be noted is that the limitation of naval armaments is mainly conr fined to what are known as capital ships. The Conference agreed to the principle of limitation in naval armaments and the disposal of capital ships built or building, the abandonment of capital ship building programmes, or the acquisition of capital ships, and determined the ratio of such capital ships amongst the various powers, thus:-Grea t Britain , 15; United States, 15;'Japan, 9; France^ 5; It a l y , 5. Expressed in terms of metric tons this means:-Grea t Britain , 525,000 tons; United. States, 525,000 tons; Japan, 315,000 tons; France, 175,000 tons; Italy , 175,000 tons. In addition to determining the number of capital ships to be retained in commission by the several powers, the Conference also specified that the maximum' tonnage for each capital ship should be 35,000 tons, thab no capital ship should carry guns in excess of 16-inch calibre, and that no other ship of war should exceed 10,000 metric tons or carry guns in excess of 8-inch calibre. The Conference further prescribed the number and tonnage of aircraft carriers; it prohibited the completion of capital ships in course of construction in any belligerent country at the outbreak of any future war, and provided for the scrapping of vessels not specifically named in the schedule. The schedule to the Treaty set out in detail the warships that may be retained andthose that must he scrapped within twelve months from the ratification of the Treaty. Included in the list of vessels to be scrapped is the battle-cruiser Australia. It is provided that no ship ordered to be scrapped may be thereafter converted into a vessel of war. It is provided that no nation shall build a war vessel for any noncontracting Power without furnishing full particulars of such ship to the other parties or Powers. The status quo regarding fortifications, naval bases in specified Territories and Possessions must be maintained, and no steps may be taken to increase the naval facilities or coastal defences. The Treaty will remain in force until 31st December, 1936, and if none of the contracting Powers gives notice to the United States Government, one year before that date, of its intention to determine the Treaty, it shall continue' in force u n t i l the expiration of two years from the date of such notice to determine it. These are the conditions, set out very briefly, of a Treaty which profoundly affects the destinies of mankind. It is, perhaps,' the most hopeful sign that the world has seen that man has learned something from the late war, and is prepared to turn his face Tesolutely towards the Star of Peace, and his back against the God of War. It is a substantial contribution to the world's demand for a limitation of armaments. There has been throughout the ages much talk about beating our swords into plough-shares, but honourable members know that hitherto these castles of peace have been built upon foundations of sand. Nothing has come from the high-flown and ambitious projects of the Hague Tribunal, or from any project which preceded it . 2\Tor has the League of Nations itself heen able to take any definite step towards disarmament. This Treaty marks the definite abandonment by Great B r it a in of the two-power standard. It will not be out of place for me to remind honourable members what this means, and to pay some tribute to Great B r it a in for her great sacrifice in the cause of the peace of the world. No nation depends so much as we do upon' seapower. Our Empire has been built upon sea-power. It s splendid history rests upon that solid aud. enduring foundation. Other nations of the world, and particularly Uhe United States of America, are continental nations'. Their seaboard may be attacked, but the foundations of their temple cannot be undermined by attacks from the sea, whereas to our Empire, scattered as it is over the f o ur quarters of the earth, sea-power is essential to its very existence. This being so, we may well, take legitimate pride in the thought that Great Britain , being confronted with this proposal at the ""Washington Conference, acoepted it not only without demur, but has the proud satisfaction that her delegates zealously strove t j widen its scope. It is to the eternal credit of the representatives of the British Empire that, they sought to apply the principle of limitation to submarines. Unhappily for the welfare of mankind this was found to be impossible, owing to the attitude takeu up by certain Powers. The effect of this Treaty is to give an assurance of peace to a world weary and sick of war. It is true it does not go so far as some of us would like, but it is a step farther thanhas ever been taken before in the history of mankind. Its application, as I have already stated, is limited to capital shipsthat is to say, battleships of the first and second class. As to all other vessels, light cruisers, and the like, the Treaty is silent; but as in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, naval battles are now, as ever, decided by capital ships, it . gives to the world an assurance of peace. is a Treaty full of hope to the peoples of the world. It fixes the ratio amongst the various naval nations, and puts an end, for ever,- to naval rivalry. I emphasize that point. It is an underlying feature of the Treaty. War begets war. Warlike preparations by one nation compel others to a like effort. Before this Treaty we saw confronting us the possibility of inevitable war begotten out of the rivalries of the great naval nations of the earth. These rivalries are for ever set at rest, so far as this can be effected by any human instrument. In its provision for the scrapping of capital ships, the Treaty presents to the world a spectacle the like of which we have never seen. Magnificent ships, some of which are newly taken from the stocks, are now to be destroyed, and thus will disappear, for ever, a. menace to the. welfare of the civilized world. I have said that the Treaty does not apply to submarines; but that the British Empire Delegation used every effort to endeavour that it should so apply. In what is known u? the Submarine and Poison Gases Treaty there are imposed upon submarines prohibitions which revolutionize our concepts of submarine warfare. Honourable members remember very well the shape that submarine warfare took in the Great War. We remember the Lvsitania and those other vessels whose number is legion. We remember the women and children who were sent unwarned and unprepared to the bottom of the ocean. The day of such things is gone, so far as this agreement between the great naval nations can banish it , for ever. Submarines now are prevented from attacking a merchant vessel in time of war until there has. been an inspection and search to ascertain the character of the vessel, and if it be found, after inspection, and search, that the ship comes within the rules of warfare which render it liable to destruction it cannot be destroyed u n t i l all the passengers and crew have been placed in a position of absolute safety. If the Washington Conference had done nothing but this we should hail it with glad satisfaction. The Treaty provides also for the maintenance of the status qiw> of fortifications and naval bases in the Pacifio. It puts a period to that growing menace of which' I spoke in the earlier portion of my speech, where naval bases were gradually It being pushed out farther and farther, converging on each other, and upon a point of which we were the very apex. , As I have mentioned, however, these limitations do not apply to the mainland of Japan nor to Australia nor New Zealand. The Treaty leaves us free to make what preparations we like in our own defence, but prevents us from, pushing, unden any pretext at all , int o that wide expanse of the Pacific outside the Commonwealth and its unmandated T e r r i tories, in which every advance we make is an encroachment upon the rights and liberties of others. What it does to us it does to all others. It respects the status quo and makes provision for its maintenance. This Treaty, too, with that which is subsidiary to it-the Submarine' and Poison Gases Treaty-endeavour s to prohibit the recourse to barbaric, methods of making war. It prohibits the use of poison gases. Any nation, whether a party to the agreement or not, that wages submarine warfare, except as prescribed, may be treated as a pirate by the civilized nations and dealt with in the Courts of those countries. Provision is made that should any differences arise between the parties a conference may be summoned in order to adjust those differences,. and that, in any case, a conference shall bo held in eight years from the ratification of the Treaty. _ This Treaty states clearly the rules of civilized war. It does more than anv other instrument which has emanated from the brain and hand of man to prevent war; but if war takes place, then the rules under which it shall be waged are laid down. How great an advance this is upon the conditions under which war was waged by the Central Powers will be appreciated by honourable members on a perusal of the provisions of this Treaty. I do not think that I can dwell usefully at any greater length on this Treaty, which is a veritable milestone in human progress, a beacon light in a dark place, over-illuminating a sky covered with gloomy and menacing clouds. It is a sweet satisfaction to U3 that, in the making of this Treaty, the representatives of the Empire supported and aided to the uttermost the Government of the United States of America. If the Treaty falls somewhat short of those ideals which we all cherish, the fault lies not. upon the British Empire, nor upon its representatives. I turn now from the Naval Armament Treaty and the Submarine and Poison Gases Treaty to two relatively subsidiary Treaties. The first of these is the FarEastern Treaty, and the other the Chinese Customs Treaty. The Far-Eastern Treaty, relating to China, represents an earnest effort to assist China to recover from her present state of disintegration and weakness. It guarantees the territorial integrity of China. This is a notable achievement. It is the first ward and visible sign - of the power of world opinion. These Treaties are the manifestation of that moral influence whioh the civilized world is determined Mr Hughes. to exert in order to protect weak nations from the aggression which threatens them. That great world-for China is a world in itself-wil l now be able - to develop its wonderful resources under - the aegis of the protection of the great nations of the Western world, and with the co-operation of Japan herself. The Treaty provides that no contracting Power shall take advantage of China's weakness. We are to remember that China, among all the nations of the earth, has been the only one that has relegated the art of war to the position which it ought to occupy in the minds of civilized people. It has always exalted peace, and regarded those who desired and preached peace as worthy of respect and honour, and has turned its back upon war and those who resorted to or advocated it. The Treaty establishes the principles of the t'pen door. These are enunciated and clearly laid down, while the rights of all the parties to the agreement are set out in unambiguous language, aud with greater particularity than ever before. The Treaty prevents the partitioning of China by individuals for trade purposes. It encourages the development of railways and trado. It preserves and protects Chinese neutrality in future ware to which she is not a party. When we recall what happened to China in the late war, we must recognise that this is no smail gain. It provides for the full and frank communication of matters arising under the Treaty. This Far-Eastern Treaty is of vital importance to Australia. Tho problems of the Pacifio were intimately bound up with China, and with the differences between her and Japan. These are now settled. The terms of settlement have not been forced upon either party by the sword, but have been mutually accepted as the outcome of frank and open discussion. If anything can insure this country peace for the next ten yearsand, let us hope, for many more-thes e Treaties will do so. The last one to which I desire to reout- fer is the Customs Tariff Treaty. This is complementary '""to the Par-Eastern Treaty. It increases the revenues of the Chinese Government. It abolishes the internal Tariffs of China, about which I need not trouble honourable members, because I am sure that they are quite familiar with sueh questions. The Treaty will give China vastly increased Customs revenue. I have dealt hurriedly with the Treaties that are now before honourable members. Some of them are covered by the motion I have submitted. The others are dealt with in the various motions set out on the - business-paper. I ask the House to ratify all. I direct the attention of honorablo members again to the resolutions set out on page 35 of Senator Pearce's report. Those resolutions are not Treaties; and, although they haye not to bo ratified, they will, nevertheless, he held to be binding upon us, and upon all other nations, unless they declare their intentions to the contrary. One word in conclusion. Th'e ""Washington Conference has achieved great things. Its decisions are very material to us. They guarantee peace in the Pacific, as far as any effort of man can guarantee it while human. nature remains unregenerate. We may rely on the moral support of the signatories, but there is no force behind the Treaties, and I should do wrong if I did not point out to honourable members, and to the people of Australia, that these Treaties are not in the nature of an alliance. They do not guarantee to us material support if we arc attacked. insure merely moral support - and the public opinion of the people of the contracting countries. [Extension of time granted.] The policy of the United States of America Government is opposed to interference in the differences of other States, and that, in itself, has precluded any attempt to establish anything in the nature of an alliance. In any case, no promise of material support by any nation that did not possess a naval base within striking distance would he of service, and no nation is in that position except England herself. ' It follows, therefore, that, so far as material support is concerned, we are as dependent as ever on the Navy of the Empire. We welcome these Treaties, and will loyally abide by them, but wo must not overlook the fact to which I have just directed attention. We rejoice at the success of the Washington Conference. The Conference has borne fruit abundantly, and has achieved much more than even its most ardent advocates believed possible. To us in this great island continent the Conference has brought great material benefits. It has enabled us to achieve immediate and substantial savings. Were it not for these Treaties we should now be contemplating additional naval expenditure rather than be comforted with the positive assurance of a substantial reduction in our Naval Estimates. War begets war, and peace begets peace. With this assurance of pesex wo must hope that all the world will follow the good example set by these Treaties, and that, although the Washington Conference stopped short, and did not attempt to limit war in the air, or war upon land, it has taken a substantial step forward. We hope that that example will not be lost upon civilization, and that we may yet have .an opportunity of ratifying Treaties which will be complementary to these, and which will give still greater assurance of lasting peace to us and to the whole world. Debate (on motion by Mr Charlton) adjourned. FEDERAL TERRITORY. WATER SUPPLY DISTRIBUTARY WORKS.",46
145,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"WakefieldMinister for Works and Railways) [8.39]. They - I move That, in accordance with the provisions ol the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1'913-191-i. it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work:Federal Territory-Distributar y WorksExtension of Water Supply, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and nn which the Committee, has duly reported to this House the result of its investigations. I ask the House to approve the report of tha Committee, and givo authority for the construction of this work. As honourable members are aware, the main water supply works have been carried out for some years, and water has been delivered to the service reservoir, within the city boundary, at Red Hill. Temporary distibutary mains of small dimensions have been installed from Red Hill to the M i l i tary College, Molonglo Camp, Acton Settlement, brickworks, afforestation area, &c., mostly in 4-in. and 3-in. pipes. The scheme submitted for the consideration of the Public Works Committee was for the distributary works recommended in appendix C of the Firs t General Report of the Federal Capital Advisory Gommittee, as follows:Twelve-inch main (12J miles in length), commencing from lied Hill Reservoir; thence by way of Melbourne-avenue, National-circuit, to Federal-avenue; thence two 9-in. mains are taken, ono (l i miles) via Federal-avenue and Station-place to a reservoir of 1.00(1,000 ppllons (with capacity to increase to 3,000,000); the other, 9-in. main (two-thirds of a mile) to go along Government-terraces to Commonwealthavenue, near the proposed hostel Bite. A 6-in. branch (three-fifths of a mile) also to be taken from the 12-in. pipe at .its intersection at Brisbane-avenue, and proceed thence to Interlake-avenue to command the settlement near the power-house. From the reservoir to be constructed at Mount Bussell a 6-in. main is to be laid along the rood parallel to Capitalterrace, a distance of 3 miles, to Ainslie-avcnue, to supply the settlement at Civic Centre. The estimated cost is as under:2* miles 12-in. C.I pipe, at .£7,500 per mile . - - €16,250 11 miles 9-in. C l . pipe, at £5,400 per mile 5 mile 0-in. C.I. pipe, at £5,400 per mi!c i mile 6-in.

Honourable members know, from previous statements in the House, and also from personal observation, that the main water supply is pumped from the Cotter River to the Stromlo Reservoir. members may smile, hut the time has come when we should look upon this question as a very practical one. If my f r i e nd the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) will accompany me on n visit to the Federal Capital, I shall bring him back a convert to the undertaking. Ho will then admit that Canberra is not a had place at nil, and that the Almighty has done, at least, one-third of what is required for a site on which one day there will be raised one of the finest cities i u the world ",49

151,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"I remind the honourable member that the votes for these works were appropriated from loan fund, and, unlike appropriations from revenue account, do not lapse if unexpended. This is a necessary continuation of the original scheme recommended by the A d -, visory Committee, and already recognised by the House In the reference to the 9.45° Publio Works Committee for investigation and report. The water is lifted to 3,600 the Stromlo Reservoir which consists of - 2,100 three sections, and holds 3,000,000 gallons. There is a similar reservoir with in the -.. 10,500 civic centre at Red Hill which also has a 6,300 capacity of 3,000,000 gallons. The time has arrived for a further distribution of £48,20 0 the water on permanent lines, and it is proposed to construct at Mount Russell a reservoir to consist at first of only one chamber containing 1,000,000 gallons, but to be extended as necessity arises to two Honourable and three chambers. This will provide for the distribution of water to meet all requirements for some years to come.",50

156,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Wakefield-Minister for Works and Railways) [8.58] - I m o v e That, in accordance with the provisions the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1013-14, it is expedient to carry out following proposed work :Sewerage, Federal Capital-Constructio of Main Intercepting Sewer from centre of city to connect with Main Outfall Sewer, which was referred to the Parliamentary with the work. Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the Committee has duly reported to this House the result of its investigations.

Provision is made for .sectional take-offs, 35 3 f t . 6 in . x 2 f t . 4 in . to the northern 12 and southern areas, and further smaller sections, as necessity may arise. The ser23 vice on the north side of the Molonglo River means a considerable addition to AYKS. the cost, and it is for this service that I am asking approval now. The gross cost, including treatment works, sub-mains, and reticulation will be £314,500. If the south side of the river only were provided for that cost would be considerably red-uoed ' Dr EARLE PAGE - B y 50 per cent.",51
157,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"No ; Tmt something like it . T.he reason that both, the north and south sides are provided for is that the opinion of this Parliament was that, the Griffin plan, should be - carried out Tellers : in its integrity. The Advisory Committee from the commencement favoured adNOES. herence to the Griffin plan, and intends - not to depart from it except where difficulties - unforeseen by the original designer make it impossible to follow his plan in the mimitest details. The designer of the Federal Capital recommended that the work should proceed on the northern and PAIRS. southern sides simultaneously, and the Gommittee insists upon the intention of the designer being adhered to.  gest that all the members of the Committee insisted upon Mr (Jriffin's plan being carried out?",51
158,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Yes , according to the requests submitted to me. At one period I believe there was not unanimity ; but there is now.",51
159,Sir ROBERT BEST,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,Will the Minister' tell us how much of la&t year's vote has - been expended?,51
160,Mr RICHARDFOSTE R,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"From of memory, I should say not more than one-half.; but I shall tell the honourable memthe ber when the motion relating to the construction of an hostel is before the House. n Up to the present it is all ear-marked.",51
161,Mr MAHONY,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,That is what we - complain of. The Government did not go on,51
162,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"I shall deal with that in discussing the motion to the construction of an hostel, and show that the difficulties are almost insuperable. It is not my fault that the work has not been procedeed with.",51
163,Dr EARLE PAGE,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,HO W much has been spent on the sewerage system up to the present ? ,52
164,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Not a great deal, because the work has been in progress for only a short time. On this particular section two shifts are being employed, and it is intended to push ward as vigorously as possible.",52
165,Dr EARLE PAGE,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,When will it bo completed ?,52
166,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"It may not be completed within one year, or perhaps within two years. I wish to give honourable members some idea of how the money is being spent and what the work is likely to cost. On the main outfall from the city boundary to the western creek, £36,000 has already been expended; and it is estimated that a further sum of £50,000 will ho necessary to complete the work. The section now under consideration, which will terminate near the site of the proposed hostel, is estimated to cost £66,000. The southern main sewer to serve the area set apart for the parliamentary buildings and the administrative block is estimated to cost £25,000. The southern maiu sewer, running from Federal-avenue to within the vicinity of the power house, is estimated to cost £20,000. The southern main sewer is set down at £22,500, whilst the northern main sewer crossing the Molonglo, and skirting the lakes, and taking in the sewerage from the southern section, is estimated to cost £55,000. The northern main sewer extension, taking in the Duntroon Military College, is estimated to cost £40,000. The total cost, excluding treatment works and special reticulations, therefore amounts to £314,500.",52
167,Dr EARLE PAGE,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,What sewerage system is in use at Duntroon College?,52
168,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Septi c tanks are installed. These figures do not include the disposal of sewerage, which for some years to come will be treated on the land at the oirtfall end of the sewer, and whatever expenditure is mcurred in this direction will be more than recouped by the revenue obtained from the land. The proposed works have not only been recommended by our own experts, but by Mr De Burgh, tihe New South Wales Officer for Water Supply and Sewerage.",52
169,Dr EARLE PAGE,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,Who is carrying out the work?,52
170,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,Immedi ately approval is given the work will be submitted to public tender.,52
171,Mr IIVINGSTON,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Barker) [9.7] According to the statement of the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Richard Foster), a heavy. expenditure is proposed for- in connection with the water supply at the Federal Capital, notwitihstanding that the Snowy River, which is regarded as one of the finest streams in Australia, is only a few miles away. I have no objection to establishing a Federal Capital in New South Wales, but it is generally admitted that no objection would be offered by any one if the Seat of Governmenb were transferred to Sydney. American tourists, on entering the Sydney Heads, have often commented upon the beauty of the harbour, and expressed surprise at the Federal Capital being built on the site selected. It has been said that one of the main reasons for establishing a Federal Capital in the present site was to be beyond the range of long-distance guns, but now aeroplanes are in general use such guns are not used.",52
172,Mr SPEAKER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA," If the honourable member will look at the terms of the motion, he will see that it does not refer to the Federal Capital generally, but to the construction of a main intercepting sewer, which question was referred to the Parliamentary - Standing Committee on Public Works.

175,Mr LIVINGSTON,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Exactly . The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr. Austin Chapman) has said that I have never visited the Federal Capital, but I have been there, and probably know more about it than he does. A supply of wood, water, and stone are the essentials to be considered in establishing a cityand there is none there-and the Minister for Works and Railways surely realizes that.",52
176,Mr SPEAKER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Order ! I again direct the honourable member's attention to the fact that the House is not dealing with the general question of the Federal Capital, but with the construction of tain works mentioned in the motion.",52
177,Mr LIVINGSTON,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Ver y well. believe that if. the continuance of the present policy was to be made an issue the next elections, the people would say in no uncertain way that they did wish the work to be proceeded with.",53
178,Sir ROBERT BEST,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Kooyong) must [9.12] - In speaking to the motion, I direct attention to the unfair tactics adopted by the Government. motion we are committed to the expenditure of £314,500, which, added to £48,000 involved in a pi-evious motion, makes a total of £362,500. Of £272,000 voted for the year ended 30th June, the Government have spent £130,000, leaving a balance of only £142,000 towards the £362,000 now volved. It is the duty of the Government first of all to ask Parliasuffering ment how much is to be spent on the Capital; but instead of doing so they submit motions relating to sewerage works and a water supply inwanton volving an outlay of £362,000, or additional expenditure of £220,000. admit that in this financial sink we deposited £2,000,000, including of course the £740,000 which we paid for the sumption of certain lands.",53
179,Mr WATKINS,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,Why did the honourable member agree to the payment?,53
180,Sir ROBERT BEST,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"I did not agree. It is the duty of Government first to consult the House as to the amount to be spent. When we have appropriated a sum on the Estimates, we must carry out the work within the limit of the amount appropriated by Parliament; instead of doing that, the Government are insidiously inviting us to consent the construction of certain works which involve additional expenditure over and above the balance they now have in hand; so that the House will not be free as the amount to be voted this current cial year, but will be hampered by these commitments.",53

Sir ROBERT BEST - When we have the money, but not at a time when we are Ihe crushed with taxation, when we have an unproductive debt of £400,000,000, when we have direct taxation of £21,000,000 inper annum and indirect taxation of £30,000,000 per annum, and when we are a crushing burden of taxation of £13 per head. It was never contemplated that at a time such as this we should attempt to carry out a totally and unnecessary scheme of buildan ing a Federal Capital. We are already I committed, when we carry this motion, to have an additional expenditure of £220,000, .which will have to be added to when we redeal with subsequent motions to which I am not now permitted to make reference. At a time when enterprise is crushed by burdensome taxation and when there is throughout Australia a demand for of all retrenchment and economy, this is the answer we give! Because the Government have not the courage to say, ""We have not the money,"" they yield to the threats and demands of a junta of but Sydney members and calmly ask this House to commit itself to one motion after to another, covering one work after another, increasing the complication of the conntry's finances in defiance of the demand of the people of the country for economy. to I rose to point out the unfair means by finanwhich we are being asked to commit ourselves to financial obligations not yet authorized by Parliament. I strongly protest against this method of procedure, the and of course I shall vote against the conmotion. It is most unfair that honon the orable members should be compelled by the brute force bf an engineered too majority to yield to financial obligations such as this. Let the Governto ment put this money on the Estimates for tJbe coming year, and if the House authorizes an additional expenditure of £220,000 at Canberra, no doubt the money will have to be found. And, having done this, then let them submit a schedule of works upon which the money so .authorized is to be expended. The method they adopt is that of putting the cart before the horse. We are asked to commi t ourselves to works before the money is provided for them. It will shackle the discretion of honourable members in relation to the Estimates Appropriation Bill. If the motion now before us is agreed to the presentation of the items in the Loan Appropriation Bill covering the expenditure involved will be a mere formality. promise that it will not the a mere formality so far as I am concerned. I refuse to give my consent to incurring any obligation of this kind. It is most unf air rhat the Government should seek to place honourable members in the position I have outlined. MT . RICHARD FOSTEE (Wakefield - Minister : for Works and Railways) [9.20] - If the Government had come forward with a sectional proposal for works, at Canberra, the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) would have been the first to criticise us. He would say, "" You are scheming. This is the thin end of the wedge."" Ministers in a straightforward and honourable way have brought forward, not a sectional proposal, but the whole scheme. They have not acted i u response to the call of Sydney men or others. I am not deterred by the aggressive attitude assumed by the honourable member. I want to be fair and square.",53
184,Sir ROBEHT BEST,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"They have you "" by the wool.""",54
185,Mr RICHARDFOSTE R,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Have they ? The honourable member is not likely to have me "" by the wool."" I want the honourable memher for Barker (Mr Livingstone) also to realise that the State of South Australia, is not ""rearing up "" about Canberra. On the contrary, in many directions people are saying that it would be fair to honour the compact with New South Wales. As a matter of fact, there are few people outside the confines of Melbourne who would put the position as strongly as the honourable member for Kooyong has done to-night. He says that I .am under the spell and whip of Sydney. I reply by saying that the honourable member is under the spell and whip of the .press of Melbourne. And he is not the only one, although he is the chief one, dominated in that way. I want this question to be looked upon from a business point of view, as well as from the point of view .of the country's honour.",54
186,Sir ROBERT BEST,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Hear , hear!",54
187,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"Then why does not the honourable member, who applauds my statement, recognise the and solemn compact made with the people of New South Wales that the Federal Capital should he established in their State within ten years after the inauguration of Federation ? Those ten years have grown I to twenty-two. It is true that the building of Canberra commenced about ten years ago; but construction had to be postponed through the war. Surely there is a. time when we must honour the compact with the people of New South Wales. The honourable member for Kooyong savs that already £2,000,000 has been spent on the Federal Capital. Does he propose to leave the money there not earning anything, or until the country embarks upon the expenditure of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 all at once at the highest - possible cost. Is it not better to proceed by degrees when we have labour and material .available, and when it is possible to forecast the day when the expenditure already incurred will be returning some interest? Men who know as much about finance as does the honourable member for Kooyong, men who are the biggest financiers in the Commonwealth, declare that if the Commonwealth has any doubt about borrowing the money for the .purpose of building the Federal Capital, they will finance the scheme.",54
188,Sir ROBERT BEST,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,Let them have it .,54
189,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PURCHASE OF CANUNGRA,"I quite believe that any man in Melbourne would say "" Let him have it "" ; but honourable members from other States would not say so. We have reached the stage when we must either drop the business altogether or proceed with it . If we .are to proceed with it , it is the duty of the Government to submit a complete plan and let Parliament know what their intentions are from beginning to end, instead of bringing forward piecemeal proposals. For that reason the whole scheme has been placed before the Public Works Committee and the people. No> one knows better than does the honourable member for Kooyong that the carrying of this motion will not commit the House to an immediate expenditure, and that it is not the last word so far as the appropriation of money is concerned. It is for this House, when dealing with the Appropriation Bill , to say how much money shall be definitely allocated to this scheme.",54

192,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"WakefieldMiuister for Works and Railways) [9.34]. - I . move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-14, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work:The construction of a hostel at Canberra with necessary engineering and other accessory services, . which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the Committee has duly reported to this House the result of its investigations. This motion may possibly invite a little discussion, but I do not apologize for submitting it . In answer to some little statements that have been made concern36 ing myself, in which I have been some12 what misrepresented, while that misrepresentation has not broken, my heart, I may, 24 by way of preliminary, remind honourable members that I have never opposed AYES. Canberra as the Federal Capital. I admit that in the early days I used to give the Government nineteen to the dozen because I thought things were not going on as they should, and, during the war and at the close of the war, I resisted commitments for Canberra. I have never belonged to an anti-Canberra league, and I do not know that there is such a league. I may say that I strolled upstairs on one occasion to attend a public meeting; and it is just as well that we should be straight about this matter.",55
193,Mr HILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"He a r , hear! It is all coming out.",55
194,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I never NOES. permit other people to bring things out for me. I do that for myself. I strolled upstairs on one occasion to a meeting of earnest souls, full of a desire to protect the people from the imposition of further burdens. The only purpose of the meeting, so far as I could gather, was to PAIBS. impress upon the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) that while the war was on no more vote3 involving further expenditure should be submitted on the Estimates. The construction of the hostel is necessary, because at present there is no public accommodation provided at Canberra in any shape or form. The work will take time.",55
195,Mr MAXWELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,And money. much is it to cost?,56
196,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I intend to supply honourable members with all the details - It is just as well that we should get down to bedrock in connection with this business.,56
197,Mr FLEMING,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Shoul d not private persons be allowed to build the accommodation necessary for the public ?,56
198,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I believe that private persons will be given that portunity very soon. We may as well understand each other, and, speaking for myself, and not for the Government, I am of opinion that the Parliament after next should meet in Canberra. We have invested £2,000,000 at the Federal Capital.",56
199,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,We have wasted it.,56
200,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"We have not wasted the money, and the honourable member will no doubt be pleased to leam that, in accordance with the principles he professes in connection with the expenditure of puiblic money, all contracts for work at Canberra at the present time are submitted to public tender.",56
201,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is a slight improvement.,56
202,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The work which is now under consideration will be submitted to public tender, and will be carried out hy contract, unless it can be shown that the Department could carry out the work more cheaply than it can be done by contract.",56
203,Mr STEWART,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Why all this preference for the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best)? ,56
204,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Because that honourable member is the biggest sinner amongst those opposed to the build-; Lighting and power . . ing of the Federal Capital, and needs most attention. Assuming"" that Parliament will meet at Canberra in, say, four years' time, the prudent course for us to adopt is to proceed continuously with the provision necessary from now until that time, rather than attempt to rush the whole of the work through in a year or two. What the Government propose is the most economical plan to adopt. It will take all the time that will elapse in the interval to make the necessary provision for the meeting of Parliament at Canberra four years hence. That is one reason for the submission of this motion How for the construction of the hostel. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming) asked why we should not let private enterprise undertake the construction of buildings at Canberra, and, in reply to the honourable member, I may say that I hope within a few weeks' time we shall be ready to let the public have allotments in Canberra, and build business premises or residences, or houses of accommodation for the public. If private oppersons came forward to build the hostel I should personally be very glad, but if we desire the public to come in we must show our own bona fides. We must convince people that we are doing something ourselves, and intend to proceed with a continuous policy. Within a few weeks we shall be prepared to receive applications from the public for building sites and other land in the Canberra area. I believe that a big move in this direction will shortly take place, and will continue. It was proposed at first to submit for approval the construction of a complete hostel at a cost of £98,750. The Government were anxious that more moderate provision should at first be made, and the Advisory Committee fell in with that idea, and have recommended .that only half of the complete hostel should be undertaken at present. The estimated cost of the first proposal for a complete hostel was as follows:Hostel building . . £28,500 Two-storied pavilions (No. 4) . . 14,680 Single-story pavilions (No. 6) .. 20,700 Covered ways 3,900 Sunk gardens 720 Enginering Services. Heating and hot-water supply, freezing machinery, cooking plant . . .. 6,500 .. .. 4,670 Storm-water drainage .. .. 1,500 Sewerage, including connexions .. 3,000 Approach roads and channelling, fencing and gates, planting and turfing 3,500 Water mains and hydrants . . .. 2,000 Contingencies .. .. 3,080 £98,750 As I have said, it is proposed now to make provision for only half of the hostel originally suggested, and, no doubt, when Parliament meets at Canberra and people are gathering there, the other half will be proceeded with. I do not think honourable members will say that this is a ruinous venture. Sir - ROBERT BEST - Will the £98,000 pay for the whole of the work, or does that represent only half the cost?",56
205,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That sum is to cover the lot.,57
206,Mr MAXWELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is it intended that members of Parliament shall occupy the hostel ?,57
207,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"They will be free to do so, of course; bnt it will not be exclusively for their use. Its main purpose, no doubt, will be to provide accommodation for members, and their families, if necessary, during the periods when Parliament is in session. But it will be open to the public; and there will be large numbers of oflicials and persons privately interested in Canberra one way and another, as well as visitors, who will seek accommodation in the hostel. Critics of this proposition infer that the Government will lose money. I say that there is no danger of that. When Parliament has been established at Canberra the Government, if they desire, will be able to realise any day upon their outlay on the hostel. One reason why it is desired to get on with the building is that there are other important works to follow. The Commonwealth architects are even now engaged upon designs for the temporary Parliament building. This will be of a character such as to fit it to house the National Parliament, possibly, for forty or fifty years, giving members as many facilities and comforts generally as they have in this building. When the eventual monumental Parliament building is erected, the temporary structure will still be a work of utility and worth its cost for other purposes. Besides this temporary Parliament House it is sought to get on with various administrative buildings. There are, indeed, enormous necessary expenditures thereafter to be irndertaken. If we anticipate that within three or four years we shall be legislating in the Federal Capital city, there is not a day to - spare. We should go on continuously with provision for these various Capital city works. I repeat- a vigorous programme of activities must be undertaken if we are to be in Canberra within the next four years.",57
208,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Bourke) [9.53] - I have protested to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, regarding the manner in which the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Richard Foster) has been addressing himself to . individual members while keeping the House at large in the dark concerning what ho was saying. Also,, when Mr. Speaker himself was in the chair, I drew attention to the same practice on the part of the Minister. Is it not in accordance with the Standing Orders, and in keeping with the proper conduct of debate, that when a Minister or any ordinary member is addressing this Chamber, he should offer his remarks direct to Mr > Speaker, and not "" come at"" the Chair, so to speak, with his other end ? Such conduct I regard, at any rate, as utterly improper. I could not gather all the details of what the Minister for Works and Railways was telling confidentially to the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) and one or two other honourable members near him. The dialogue, conducted with the Minister's back to the Chair and the greater number of honourable members, may have been quito interesting, and revealing. But whether there was anything in it of public interest I,-with a number of other disappointed members, was unable to compute. As for the matter of the hostel itself, the mere fact that it is to be of such a character as is proposed naturally appeals to myself, and to other honourable members of like inclinations. But, perhaps, the most interesting feature of the whole business-and a matter so unique as to be, in itself, almost sufficient to induce me to vote in favour of the work-is the convincing change which tinges the remarks of the Minister to-night compared with his earlier arguments on Canberra. I recall certain language of the honourable member before he joined the Ministry, when he was still merely a representative of the public interests. On the particular occasion I have in mind it became his stem duty to strenuously denounce the proposal to spend public money at Canberra. But the Minister seems to have forgotten all that. Who is there among the young and innocent in this House who listened then to the veteran champion of public interests, who has forgotten how he thundered to the people, and the press, concerning the scandalous waste of public money on that desert in New South Wales which had been selected as the site of the future* capital of the Commonwealth? But what is it that the Minister has now „ said of his unconscious activities in connection with a certain anti-Canberra ing held upstairs ? It appears that while such a gathering was taking place the Mirfister-as a private member-strolled into the room unconsciously, while still in an unconscious state, he was elected as chief spokesman for the anti-Canberraitee. It was while still in that unconscious state, I presume, he entered this chamber and delivered one of the finest orations of his life against the scandalous proposition of the Government to fling about an-d waste money upon this dreadful in the desert of New South If there had ever been, a in my life when I felt that it be desirable to remove the tion of Gommonwealth the conduct of its legislation, Melbourne to Canberra, all such thoughts and feelings were removed by the stirring oratory of the then honourable member for Wakefield. I am reminded that, in the course of my "" Bible "" reading this morning, I came upon a statement by Walpole-Robert Walpole, not said that every time any one proposes to make a raid upon the public up "" bobs "" a patriot! But it seems that some one else, also by the name of ""Walpole-whether Horace I am really unable to say-has also said that every man has his price. I can visualize the process by which the Minister wrestled with his conscience and become converted from principal even though an unconscious oue-of anti-Cauberraites to the chief advocate of expenditure South Wales desert spot. This conversion began promptOy, no doubt, from moment when a grateful public acquiesced in the noble proposal of an appreciative Government to afford him .a place in the Cabinet. I say that from that precise instant the Miuister began bo change his opinions, so thab HOW he is the stoutest champion of those very things which he once the most loudly denounced : and is all for denouncing those very views which he was once the foremost in advocating. Honourable members can afford to listen with the greatest pleasure to the Minister's verbal demonstrations splendid advantages to be found at Canberra. Whether the Minister-is still acting and speaking unconsciously Mr A.mlcy. not. One is almost bound to be convinced by his arguments, and this business of a meet- £98,000 hostel in the bush is sure to be carried practically unanimously. The advocacy of the Minister has overwhelmed me and that, Mr FOLEY (Kalgoorlie) [9.58] - I do not propose to follow the tactics of the previous speaker in calling to mind the earlier views of any honourable member that who may have changed his opinions upon the Federal Capital. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Richard Foster) has given full details concerning the cost public of building the proposed hostel. ""It is business always well to separate one's private life ""Wales. from one's parliamentary activities. T moment maintain that when an honourable member might has concluded his public duties within the administra- Parliament, he should bo free to go to his affairs, and own home or to some place, at any rate, from that he can call his own, where he can withdraw among the members of his own family. If the Federal Capital is to be proceeded with, and members of Parliament are to repair to Canberra to conduct legislative business, there should be built up such accommodation and Horace-who such an environment as will give the greatest facilities reasonably possible Treasury, to all those whose duties will take them there. I have seen a great deal of State enterprise in connection with State hotels. I think I have seen more than any other honourable member in this House of their gradual utility or otherwise. We are told that has the building at Canberra is not going to be an hotel, but an hostel. I believe it spokesman- would be a good thing to allow somebody the \else to conduct that undertaking, while Govermnent the Commonwealth devoted itself to 'proon the New viding houses to which members of Parliament might take their families while that they were at Canberra. We might then be able to get what some of us who come from distant States cannot enjoy at present- a little home l if e while Parliament is sitting. Mr RICHA RB FOSTER - In all probability this hostel will be let.",57
209,Mr FOLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It matters not to me whether it is to be let or not, I do not want Gommonwealth money to be spent on it. I have had a large experience of State owned hotels in Western Australia. It of the has been argued throughout that an hostel cannot pay, but that an hotel can, and it is contended that every hotel depends upon matters its bar trade for making a profit. I can say without fear of contradiction that I know of an hotel where a man or woman is an interloper in any portion of the building except the bar. Minister for Works and Railways (Mr . Foster) thinks this hostel is going to be a great success. Where is he to get his revenue from? The experience of every one in the trade at present, and the testimony of every balance-sheet, is that there is a loss on every part of such businesses except the bar trade. I doubt whether it will be the success that the Government anticipate. I contend that money could be spent with much more advantage to the Commonwealth, and certainly to the members and officials of Parliament, by building houses. I am just as ardent an advocate of Canberra generally as any man in this House. I believe it is not so much a question of whether Australia can afford to have Canberra, but whether she can afford to stay away from Canberra too long. to see the politics of Australia built up by men who have the opportunity, while they are doing their work, of enjoying the pleasures of Australian home life. If we can realise those conditions we shall get better politics than will be possible if we go to an hostel and have to conform to the conditions that will prevail there. One cannot live in a club or hostel of that description without going into many things which would not be found in our own homes and among our own people. I am going to vote against the money being spent in building an hostel, but I would willingly support the Minister in a proposal to spend money to build houses for every one that it is necessary to house.  - Naturally , coming from New South Wales, I am delighted at the large maplan. jorit y shown for the construction of the principal services at Canberra. also extremely delighted to see such earnest, enthusiastic, and able advocate of Canberra in the Minister for and Railways (Mr Richard Foster). I think that the position we have reached with regard to the building of Australia's proposed Capital city is also a tribute to the persistency and pertinacity, perhaps, something further, of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman).",58
210,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"What does the honourable member mean by "" something furthe r ""?  At all events, I want to say that in my opinion the time has come when the Government should take into consideration the question of making some reconstruction of the Committee which advises it regarding the building of Canberra. W it h all respect to members of the Committee, and without wishing to say anything derogatory to them, I may point out that the Committee consists principally of officers of the Works Department.",59
211,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Onl y two out of five of them are officers of the Works Department.  Committee Colonel Owen and Mr Goodwin, and it is advised by Mr Hill . Mr . Ross is also a member. Members of the I want Works Department on that Committee are placed in the position of being required to report upon their own work.",59
212,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It is not Mr. Goodwin's work. Mr De Burgh is a very eminent engineer of New South Wales.  only one member of the Works Department on the Committee, he, with the other members of the Committee, is asked to report upon his own work. In view of the assertions of the Minister that we are now going on in earnest with the building of the city, I desire to say that I am not in favour of its being built by a Government Department or by Government officials. I am somewhat surprised to hear the Minister state that the members of the Canberra Committee were unanimously in favour of Mr Griffin's",59
213,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Does the honI am orable gentleman mean the advisory meman bers? I said they were now unanimously in favour of carrying it out in its enWorks tirety wherever it was possible.  that qualification from the Minister, because I think it is common knowledge that the contours of the land have not and, been taken into consideration by the my friend designer of the city.",59
214,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The contours make the design impossible.  statement. It is absolutely impossible, as far as I can see on a personal view, to carry out that plan in its entirety, owing to the difficult contours of the land. If any Committee attempted to carry it out as designed it would, in many directions, one- I think, Adelaide-avenue-mean s a series of railway embankments or railway cuttings. During this last three years we have had a lot of talk about Canberra, and the net result of it, as far as I can see, has been the building of a dozen or two cottages in three or four different places upon an area running into miles square. pleased at the assertion of the Minister that he proposes throwing open for public tender many of the large works required by the Government to be erected, and that the Government will also act in such a way as will permit private enterprise to help to build the city. I am fully agreed that io is the function of the Government, at the present time, at all events, to see to it that the common services, such as lighting, sewerage, and water, are carried out, if not by the Government, then at least under Government supervision; but I do not think that the erection of an hostel is work for the Government. Seeing, as I understand from the Minister's remarks, that this will not be the last time that this matter will be dealt with by the House, and that by supporting these motions to-night members will not entirely pledge themselves as to how, when, and at what cost these works shall be carried out; and in view of the representations that have been made to me by contractors, by architects, and by other people who are concerned in the erection of buildings, I would .strongly urge the Government to consider whether it would not be better to appoint at once a perma: nent Committee, or permanent Commission, armed even with borrowing powers, to go right ahead and complete the city. I think the Minister will find that, as the works proceed, and as the money is expended, he will need more and more the co-operation of outside aid. From what I have seen of the divisions in this the feeling of Parliament is in favour of getting to the Capital city within a « reasonable time. While a majority of the House does not want to rush the Minister, they nevertheless want to insure that the Government and the Minisber shall see to it that there is no departmental muddling, and that every pound allocated by this Parliament returns Australia a value of 20s. That is my view of the position the Government is in, and of the course they should pursue. I may, most reluctantly, support the motion before the House, leaving myself free to deal with the question when the appropriation vote comes along. As one who believes in the erection of the Capital, and also as one who wants to conserve the resources of the Commonwealth, I desire the utmost care to be exercised in the expenditure of all moneys, not only at Can I am berra, but in all other directions.",59
215,Mr GABB,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Angas) [10.15] - I do not desire to give a silent vote on this matter. I am opposing the motion because I think the time is not ripe for further expenditure on Government activities at Canberra. The Minister (Mr Richard Foster) stated that in South Australia there is a good deal being said just now about the keeping of agreements. By that remark he meant, of course, the feeling in South Australia in connection with the North-South railway project. I am not voting against expenditure at Canberra because I believe in the breaking of agreements, and my attitude towards the North-South railway project would be the same. If any proposal for the opening up and development of the country is brought forward, it will receive my support, even before the NorthSouth railway scheme, if it will open up miore country than that project. But I am sure the Minister will not for a moment compare expenditure at Canberra with the North-South, railway project from the point of view of opening up and developing the country, and that is why I am found opposing the various schemes tonight. Our paramount duty is to open up the remote areas of the Commonwealth, and thus make it possible for an increased population to become prosperously settled on the land. As .1 listened to the Minister to-night I could not help thinking of the biblical quotaHouse, tion, "" Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots?"" because the Minister likened himself to Saul of Tarsus, and spoke of having the scales removed from his eyes, and the light coming in. Before I became a memher of Parliament I used to wonder sometimes how it was that the Minister earned the nickname of "" W o b b l y "" in South Australia.",60
216,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That was plied to me by a fellow who is a liar, and you know it .",61
217,Mr GABB,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I can now well understand the reason for that nickname, for in the short time at my disposal, when the Minister was speaking this evening, I read some of his remarks on a former occasion, and I found that he was then very much opposed to any expenditure' at Canberra. Will he deny that he was president of the Anti-Canberra League, and that he introduced to the Prime M in ister a deputation of those opposed to expenditure on the Federal Capital? I cannot also help wondering if the Minister is merely another case of a man's individual mind and his composite mind being at variance. The other night the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Wise) referred to a remark once made by the honourable member who preceded me in the representation of Angas (Mr Glynn) to the effect that, as a member of the Ministry, he sometimes found it difficult for his individual and composite minds to be in agreement. I am wondering, therefore, if the Minister's individual mind is in agreement with his composite mind in connection with Canberra expenditure, although this evening he spoke with remarkable vehemence and with such determination as almost to convince honourable members that all is well with him in this respect. I am wondering if his changed attitude is to he attributed to the fact that he is now a member of the Ministry, whose l if e, to a certain extent, depends upon the granting of concessions to certain honourable members from New South Wales.",61
218,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FEDERAL CAPITAL, Order ! The honourable member must not pursue that line of argument.,61
219,Mr GABB,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"But surely, Mr Deputy Speaker, that remark cannot be out of order.",61

221,Mr GABB,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If I am out of order, I shall leave it at that. I am not opposing the motion because I want any agreements to be broken..

222,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Kooyong) [""10.21] - I ask the House to remember that we are definitely committing ourselves, by this motion, to the construction by the Government of an hostel, or as the Minister (Mr Richard Foster) calls it , a "" hospital,"" which is, I think, a more appropriate term, though I prefer to call it a boarding-house. Th'e Government have had already a sorry experience of carrying on hotels and boarding-houses, which should undoubtedly be' intrusted to private enterprise. There is no j ustification whatever for the Ministry coming down to this House with these Socialistic enterprises, with the knowledge' they must have that it will be only another white elephant to be added to the list of those we have acquired during the history of the Commonwealth Parliament. Honourable members will remember that when the proposal for the construction of the hostel came before them, the probable expenditure was given at, in round figures, £100,000, plus another £15,000 or £20,000 for tihe equipment and furnishings, or a contemplated original expenditure, as submitted to the Public Works Committee, of £120,000. The Committee recommends that the amount be reduced by £36,250, and contemplates the erection of only one-half the hostel. In a light and airy way, the House has committed itself already to an expenditure at Canberra of £362,000, and by this motion it contemplates the expenditure of another £80,000. In other words, as a result of our work to-night, the country will be pouring another £400,000 into this financial sink. But this is not all. The report of the Committee statesIn the course of evidence it was ascertained that, in addition to this hostel, which it is hoped will be completed perhaps twelve months before Canberra is ready for official occupation, nnd will accommodate tourists and others interested in the new city and its surroundings, the Government has in contemplation the erection of two additional hostels at a total cost of These are to be on a less pretentious scale, and are destined for married and unmarried officials, whom it is hoped to accommodate at the rate of from 10s. to 12s. per diem. Furthermore, it is hoped that by the Government giving-this lead, private enterprise may be influenced to erect two more hostels. This, glowing panegyric is the outcome of the Minister's new-born zeal. told that this hostel will be a magnificent investment for the country. If it is to prove a magnificent investment then 1, with other honourable members, would strongly urge the Minister to allow private enterprise to undertake it. If that were done, I would have no objection to offer - The honourable gentleman, however, asks us to agree to this huge expenditure at the present time, and, perhaps, later on to agree to the erection of addi-. tional hostels at a cost of £152,000. Mr RrcirAKD FOSTER - The Government do not endorse that statement.",61
223,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I have in. hand the report of the Public Works Gommittee, in which it is stated that the evidence before the Committee the belief that the Government contemplated the erection of two additional hostels, at a total cost of £152,000. We continueshavealready spent on the Federal Capital £2,000,000, which represents a percost manent incubus of £100,000 per annum. In addition, we arc to enter upon the erection of this hostel nt a cost another £S0,000. while the Government contemplate a further expenditure of the honourable member. £152,000 on two more, hostels, so that the Commonwealth is to suffer a still greater permanent annual loss. I strongly urge that private! enterprise should permitted to hold sway. I understood it to be part and parcel of the policy of ment. the Government that private enterprise should prevail.",62
224,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Government have not the remotest idea of ning the hostel.,62

No part. private individual would be so foolish as to take a lease of the hostel and such a rental as would b'e necessary to provide a reasonable return on the vast expenditure incurred in respect of it. Here is a further paragraph from the port of the.

There will be, of course, a veritable crowd of individuals seeking to obtain a lease of an hostel from which there is to be no profit!",62
226,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The best hotels here charge 30s. a day.,62
227,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I venture to say that no one will be prepared to pay £1 per day for the privilege of living in a my God-forsaken place like Canberra.,62

233,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"There , is a is question as to the erection of the second",62
234,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is so. It pay is proposed that £36,500, the deduction for the second half year, shall not. be expended during the present year; but we are now committing ourselves to an exrependiture of £80,000 for this purpose out of the Consolidated Revenue for the first half with furniture and equipment.",62
235,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,No .,62
236,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,But we are. The honourable gentleman himself has given us the details.,62

242,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"But the Government will have to furnish it. Assuming bhat the furnishing of the hostel will cost .£15,000, as estimated by the Public Works Committee, we are deliberately committing ourselves to-night to an expenditure of over £80,000.  that we are not committing ourselvestliat the expenditure cannot be made until the necessary appropriation has been passed by Parliament.",63
243,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"But the Minisfor ter has in hand at the present time ington. £130,000, and unquestionably he can apply that money to this purpose.",63
244,Mr LAZZARINI,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Why should he not do .so?,63
245,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,He is applying it to this purpose. This is but one more step towards the expenditure of vast millions. Mr ito-HARD FOSTER - How many millions?,63
246,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I shall tell honourable gentleman. The complacent Advisory Committee first of all reis, commended a first stage, on which there was to be an estimated expenditure of £1,S00,000. To that estimate we Safely add 25 per ceut. or 30 per cent. members. Taking the Committee's figures, however, the expenditure on the first stage was amount to £1,300,000. There was then' to be a. second stage, involving an expenproposal diture of £1,300,000. There we have a definite commitment of upwards of £3.000,000 recommended by the Advinfraid sory Committee iurespect of the first that never can pay. two stages. The Committee went further, however, ancl talked about a third Stage, when monumental buildings are to be erected. The whole thing will monumental- a monument to the folly of this Parliament.",63
247,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The same old wheeze.,63
248,Mr MASSYGREENE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Is not your argument directed against the building, of the Capital at all?",63
249,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No . I protest now against the proposed expenditure, because Australia can ill afford it. As soon as wo reach normality of taxation, I , for one, will gladly join with honourable members in building the Capital, so far as OUT financial ability will permit. I have already pointed out that the definite recommendations of the Advisory Committee are for the expenditure of £3,000,000 on the first two stages only, f and a large part of that expenditure is ' v to be only for temporary buildings, which will represent a departure from the' original scheme"" of the designer, Mr. Griffin.",63
250,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,They will last fifty years. It is precisely like Wash,63
251,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The best brains in the world were sought in regard to the design; and, although we spent large sums in that direction, we are to disfigure the place with temporary structures instead of proceeding quietly with the permanent design. I have not dealt with the third or monumental stage. The financial deluge will have arrived by then. Firstly, then there is the financial objection; and, secondly, I would point out, that the an attempt is being made to proceed with this work at a time when la'bour at least, 80 per cent, above the normal level. Wo. are wasting money to carry out a fetish, and to grovel and yield may complacently to the junta of Sydney WP arc asked to commit ourselves to paying .EISA for every £100 to worth of work. If 50 per cent, of the glowing tributes of the Minister to the to erect an hostel are justified, private enterprise should bo. available to undertake the work. Personally. I am it is one of the white elephants",63
252,Mr MAXWELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Fawkner) [10.40] It is useless to argue this question, hebe cause there is a majority of members evidently determined to spend as much as the Government are willing to set aside for this work. My objection to the motion is twofold. The Minister (Mr. Richard Foster) has undoubtedly changed his mind, and substantially so, because a short time ago he was bitterly opposed to the expenditure of one unnecessary penny on the work at Canberra. The logic of the honourable gentleman is most extraordinary. He said that dur- ing the war he was opposed to the expenditure of any considerable sum there, but now that the war is over he is quite willing to spend any amount. Although Australia has to carry huge financial ligations, involving very heavy taxation, the Minister tells us that now is our opportunity to launch out on larger expenditure , and so increase still further our financial burden.",63
253,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Because have dropped all monumental buildings for the next fifty years.,64
254,Mr MAXWELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That does not alter the honourable member's position. To be logical, he should now be more opposed to the expenditure, 'because, until our ligations as a result of the war are to some extent discharged, and we have returned to more normal times, we should not undertake any more expenditure than is necessary. I am surprised to hear the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Pratten) say that he is willing to support the motion for the erection by the Government of this palatial building to accommodate some 200 guests. If the fact is impressed upon the people of Australia that Parliament will go to Canberra within a reasonable period-the e or four years hence, as the Minister says-ther e is not the slightest doubt that capitalists will be prepared to go there. It will be known that, with the Seat of Government being transferred to Canberra, there will necessarily be an influx of a considerable number of people, and private enterprise will be only too giad to furnish ample commodation. The best thing Parliament can do is to throw the place open and let private enterprise take the risk. I am glad to hear the Miuister say that it is not the intention of the Government, even if they build this hostel, to go into the boardinghouse business; but in any case I oppose the proposed expenditure, because the whole undertaking should be left to private enterprise.",64
255,Mr BAYLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Oxley) [10.45] - I am at a loss to understand the Government's attitude in regard to this motion. It is only a short time since the hotels in the Northern Territory, which had been under Government control, were handed over to private enterprise. Last week the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) told the House that the Government had decided to get rid of the Woollen Mills at Geelong by inviting public tenders for ob- them. Yet to-night we are asked to vote for this motion, which will instruct the Government to go ahead with the building of the hostel with Government money. To that I am opposed. With pleasure I gave my support to the preceding two motions, dealing with water supply and we sewerage respectively. Works of that kind are the right function of Government, 'but it is not the function of the Government to build an hostel or boardinghouse in Federal Territory. The Minister in charge of the House (Mr Richard obFoster) said that if Parliament was not prepared to go ahead with the building of Canberra, some of the leading financiers in Australia were ready to find the money to proceed with the construction of the Capital as a business proposition. If private enterprise is prepared to handle the larger work of erecting the Capital as a whole, surely it will come forward with sufficient funds for the building of an hostel, or a series of hostels! The Government are placing the cart before the horse. If , instead of bringing before us a proposal for the erection of an hostel, they were to announce their intention to go ahead with the construction of temporary buildings which would permit of Parliament meeting at Canberra at a definite early date, and would at the same time throw open the land within the Federal Territory to private enterprise, ac- there would be no need for the Government to find money with which to build the hostel; private enterprise would rush in. I am in favour of transferring the Capital to Canberra, but I shall vote against this motion. The honourable mem told by the Minister that in voting for this amendment he will not be tying his hands; but I thiuk he will be tying them most effectively, for if the House authorizes the Government to proceed, with this work, when the necessary amount is pluced upon the Estimates we shall find ourselves powerless to refuse money for the reason that no inconsiderable amount will have been spent by that time, and in order to protect the money already expended it will be necessary to vote au additional amount.",64
256,Mr FRANCIS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Henty) [10.48] - The present financial position of the Commonwealth does not justify any expenditure in connection with the Federal Capital, but the proposed expenditure upon an hostel raises a new and additional issue. The case against this motion has been well stated by those who are opposed to Government trading. The people of the Commonwealth are not prone to repudiation. They recognise that the construction of the Federal Capital in New South Wales is part of the Federal compact. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Richard Foster) has already stated that during the war money could not be spared for this project, but the point urged by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) that the money is more needed today is very pertinent. We are not now in a position to lavish money upon the creation of a bush Capital. J. am glad - to know that even amongst those honourable members who are in favour of the Federal Capital there are some who will oppose this motion because of the principle involved. We desire the Government to get out of trading altogether. The Minister was formerly one of the most enthusiastic opponents of the Federal Capital project, but to-night he has been just as enthusiastic an advocate of it. Evidently he has been converted from his former antagonism, but I leave him to answer to the electors for his change of attitude. I have opposed the Canberra movement from its inception, not because I have a desire to repudiate a compact made with New South Wales, but because the people are today burdened with a load of taxation that it is most difficult for them to bear. It is stated that the cry for economy is limited to Victoria. That is not so: it' is heard throughout the Commonwealth. [31]",65
257,Mr WATKINS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Victoria n - members preach economy, while they seek to get all the Federal expenditure in their own State.",65
258,Mr FRANCIS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I admit that the New South Wales representatives have put up the a good fight for the building of the Capital. We have, however, heard even a member from that State say definitely to-night that he does not agree with this motion, but he will vote for it on the off-chance that any proposed vote for the hostel may be cut out of the Estimates at some future date. We do not desire the thin edge of the wedge io be inserted in this way; aud if we cannot escape the expenditure on the Federal Capital, as a whole, we can, at any rate, escape that connected with the erection of an hostel. As the numbers are against us, we shall get no further if we talk against this motion all night. The Federal Capital seems to be a sink into which the Commonwealth is pouring its money. The construction of the Capital should be postponed for twenty years while we put our house in order and relieve the people of some of their burdeii of taxation. Whilst we are fortunate' in not being so heavily taxed as are the people of other countries, this young, undeveloped Commonwealth cannot bear the present rate of expenditure and taxation. To-night, almost at the bidding of the Government, the House has agreed to the expenditure of £500,000 in the bush. There is ample scope for spending this money in more reproductive work, and so relieving the taxpayers. I enter my protest against the carrying out of any further work at Canberra. I hope that this motion in regard to the hostel will be defeated, and that the House will declare that the Government trading must cease.",65
259,Mr FLEMING,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Robertson) [10.55]. - The speech of the Minister f j r Works and Railways (Mr Richard Foster) has left me somewhat in doubt as to the intentions of the Government in connection with the proposed hostel at Canberra. While the Minister was speaking I asked him why the work should not be left to private enterprise, and he said that was the intention, but' later on he said that ths Government intend to construct the building, and, to use his own words, "" private enterprise was not going to get a look in . "" Some hop-arable members have said that they have /oted in favour of the Government doing the work, but their votes were recorded on quite a different matter. I find that on the 6th December, 192.1, the then Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) moved, pursuant to noticeThat, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1013-14, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report thereon, namely, the construction of an hostel at Canberra, with the necessary engineering and other services. That motion was carried by thirty-one to twenty-one; but that was in no way binding us at this stage to support the Government in carrying out this woTk.",65
260,Sir ROBERT BEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Did the report in favour of the proposition i,66
261,Mr FLEMING,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That does not matter in the least. We voted in favour of the Committee making an investigation into the pioposed work, but we never said that we would be bound by the Committee's decision. The Committee has found that it is desirable to erect an hostel at Canberra, and I think that most of us will agree with such a decision. not in accord with the views of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), who does not wish any work to be proceeded with in the Federal Territory. I am very anxious that it should go on, because I believe in Canberra, as the site is an excellent one, and those who express an opinion to the contrary cannot have visited the spot. Any one who condemns the site must have a prejudiced mind, becauso a more suitable .spot for a city could hardly be found in the Commonwealth. To suggest that the water supply is inadequate is sheer nonsense, because the smaller of the two streams can supply the city with a greater volume of water than is annually consumed in Sydney at present. To refer to the site as an arid waste is ridiculous. entered into an undertaking to construct - a city, and we should go on with the work; but I am not prepared to support the building of an hostel by the Government, because I believe it could be built better, and carried on more 'Successfully, by private enterprise.",66
262,Mr BELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Darwin) several previous occasions motions have been carried in this Chamber approving of certain works at Canberra being undertaken, involving expenditure of vast sums of money. . For reasons I have already given, the money could be expended more advantageously in other directions, particularly in connection with developmental works whioh are urgent, and for which money is not available today. We could expend money in constructing railways, even in the' building of the proposed North-South line, which would be more beneficial to the people of Australia than accommodation for the Federal Parliament at Canberra, where the functions of government could certainly be carried on, but with no greater advantage than in any other city in the Commonwealth where buildings are available. The action of the Government can be comCommittee pared with a young married man who spends a large sum of money in constructing a handsomeD abode in which to live, and thereby placing a burden upon his shoulders which he can never cast off, or with a. farmer whose land is only partially developed spending a large sum in constructing a handsome residence. We cannot afford the expenditure at this juncture, and it is safe I am to say that the weight of the argument adduced on this occasion has been against the Government proposal. If the question were to be decided on the evidence submitted, there is no doubt what the result would be. But as we have carried similar motions from time to time, it is not now to be expected that there is any likelihood of reversing previous decisions. Apar t from the opposition which I feel towards the building of the Capital, I am compelled to support those honourable members .who have voiced their opposition to the construction of an hostel by the Government. There are a number of honourable members who have previously supported the establishment of the Federal Capital, but who cannot see their way to support the building by the GoWe have vernment of an hostel to accommodate members of Parliament and any one else who may desire to reside in the Federal Capital Territory. Although I shall not be surprised if this House does not reverse the decisions given on previous occasions, I shall he surprised if honourable members support this motion moved by [10.57] - On the Minister for Works and Railways, hecause it is the avowed intention of the Government to place such work in the hands of private enterprise.
