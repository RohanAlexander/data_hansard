0,NA,Unknown,"Tuesday, 31 May 2011 The SPEAKER (Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 14:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA Australian Defence Force Personnel: Afghanistan",19
1,Ms GILLARD,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, last Tuesday when the House came together, we spent our first moments talking about the loss of Brett Wood. Today, unfortunately, just a week later, we need to mark the fact that overnight we have lost two more of our defence personnel in Afghanistan. At this stage, their names have not been released to the public. That is in accord with the wishes of their families. At the appropriate time when their names are known, of course we will have a condolence motion which honours them in full and honours the details of their service to the Australian nation. What we can say today is that one man, an Australian Army officer aged 27, lost his life when the helicopter he was in crashed. Five others were injured in that crash. They are in a satisfactory condition. He was not the pilot at the time, but he was a pilot and he had been deployed in East Timor and also on Queensland Operation Flood Assist during the course of our very devastating summer when the work of the helicopters was just so important to Queensland communities in search and rescue, in evacuation and in ferrying supplies around. The second young man who lost his life lost it in a separate incident. He was 25 old. He was at one of our forward patrol bases in the Chorah Valley. He was on guard duty. He was there with an Afghan National Army soldier. Whilst the details are still not clear, it appears that the Afghan National Army soldier shot and wounded the Australian soldier and, despite very prompt medical attention, he died from those wounds. The Afghan National Army soldier fled the scene. Of course, all steps are being taken to apprehend him and the incident will be fully investigated. I understand that many Australians hearing the details of the incident which are available to date would feel a sense of puzzlement about why something like this would happen and would be asking themselves, 'Given we are there to help, what explains this-that an Afghan National Army soldier would shoot and kill an Australian soldier?' I think many in our community probably feel a sense of anger as they hear this news. As people go through those emotions, I would say to the Australian community that we do need to fully investigate this incident before we draw conclusions and before we start speculating about what this means for the circumstances of our deployment in Afghanistan. I conclude by saying the following two things. Firstly, whatever details we learn in the future about the helicopter crash or about this shooting, first and foremost today our minds are on the two Australian families who have been required to face up to this news overnight and in the early hours of this morning. They are bearing a huge burden and all of our thoughts and all of our good wishes are with them. Secondly, whilst I understand on hard days like this one the Australian community does question our involvement in Afghanistan, I think that is very natural and very understandable too. To years Australian community members who are asking themselves that question: it is in our nation's interests to continue our deployment in Afghanistan, to see our mission through and to make sure that Afghanistan does not again become a safe haven for terrorist training. If we were to leave a vacuum there in the security circumstances, we know who would fill it-it would be terrorists from around the world. So we do need to see our mission through. But today, of course, the burden of the cost lies on our shoulders and the shoulders of the Australian nation. But, first and foremost, it lies on the hearts of the families who are grieving today and our thoughts are with them.",19
2,Mr ABBOTT,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I rise to support the remarks of the Prime Minister. On behalf of the coalition, I offer condolences to the families of the soldiers who have been killed and I express the coalition's continuing support for the mission in which those soldiers were engaged. As the Prime Minister said, there will be a time to consider the circumstances under which these deaths have taken place and to draw the appropriate conclusions. But I think there are two observations that are worth making at this point in time. First, there is no such thing as casualty-free combat. Regrettably, as long as our soldiers are in Afghanistan there will be sad moments for our country and, obviously, sad moments for this parliament. The second point to make is that serious countries do not slip out from under their responsibilities no matter how hard those responsibilities become. Our soldiers should not stay in Afghanistan a moment longer than is absolutely necessary but it is necessary that they stay while there is a vital task that only they can perform.",20
3,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,Order! As a mark of respect I invite honourable members to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their places,20
4,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I thank the House. NA,20
5,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS, I inform the House that the Assistant Treasurer will be absent from question time today as he is unwell. The Treasurer will answer questions on his behalf. NA Carbon Pricing,20
6,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister and I refer the Prime Minister to the latest version of the Garnaut report, in particular at page 17 where this statement is made: Australian households will ultimately bear the full cost of a carbon price. Let me repeat that: Australian households will ultimately bear the full cost of a carbon price. So I ask the Prime Minister: how can she continue to maintain that her tax only makes big polluters pay?",20
7,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his reference to the Garnaut review, which Professor Garnaut gave me earlier today and about which he has been speaking at the National Press Club. I have the review in my hand. It is the product of seven months work and I think we should thank Professor Garnaut for it as an Australian parliament and as an Australian nation. I do not anticipate that everybody will agree with every view put forward by Professor Garnaut, but that should not stop us actually thanking him for his work and respecting him in his professionalism in doing it. In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, given he has talked about the question of cost, yes, Professor Garnaut makes some observations about costs. There is one on page 77 of this report and it uses the terminology 'direct action', as the Leader of the Opposition would use to refer to his policy. I would refer to it as a policy in which polluters are subsidised. But Professor Garnaut says this: Using direct action measures to achieve similar amounts of emissions reduction would raise costs",20

9,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition may be interested in these wordsmuch more than a carbon price but would not raise the revenue to offset or reduce any of these ways.  of order. The Leader of the Opposition's question could not have been more specific. It quoted a sentence from the Garnaut review and it asked the Prime Minister how she could continue to maintain that only the biggest polluters would pay. After quoting from the Garnaut review, the Prime Minister is not even attempting to answer that question. I would ask you to bring her back to the question.",21
10,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. At the time that the member approached the dispatch box the Prime Minister was relating a further reference in the report to carbon pricing.,21

12,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,21
13,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What he does say about the measures that are proposed by the Leader of the Opposition is that they would raise costs much more than a carbon price but would not raise the revenue to offset or reduce the cost in any of these ways.,21

15,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,21
16,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The costs might be covered by budgetary expenditure but this affects who pays the cost, not whether the costs are there, and other people's taxes have to rise to pay for expenditures under direct action. So what Professor Garnaut is putting there, and what is a clear contrast between the policy that the government stands for and the Leader of the Opposition's policy, is that we are putting a price on carbon that big the costs in polluters would pay. ",21
17,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt is warned. Mr Sidebottom interjecting,21
18,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Braddon is warned.,21
19,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have always been clear about that, that big polluters would pay the price and by paying that price they would have the incentives they need to act to reduce the carbon pollution that they emit. We have also been very clear with Australian families-and I said this when I first outlined the carbon pricing mechanism to the Australian community-that there will be price impacts that flow through to Australian households. That is why we will use the majority of the revenue raised from pricing carbon to assist Australian households with those impacts, to generously assist Australian families who need that assistance the most. And we will use the remainder of the revenue to protect Australian jobs and to fund programs which help our move to being a clean energy economy. As Professor Garnaut says, the Leader of the Opposition's plan is about putting costs directly onto the shoulders of Australian taxpayers-that is, onto the shoulders of Australian families without any compensation at all.",21
20,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. It is again to the Prime Minister. Before the election the Prime Minister said that there would be no carbon tax under the government she leadsand we know that that is wrong. Now she says that only the big polluters will pay-and we know that is wrong.",22
21,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: a supplementary question has to be just that-a question.",22
22,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition has the call.,22
23,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister was deceptive before the election. She said in her answer just a moment ago that only the big polluters would pay. But we have here on page 17 of the Garnaut report: Australian households will ultimately bear the full cost of the,22

25,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,22
26,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A point of order, Mr Speaker: it goes to standing orders, and the standing order that requires no argument. We have had 36 seconds from the Leader of the Opposition and there is not a resemblance of a question. If we want to have the suspension of standing orders that we get every day at ten to three so he can talk for 10 minutes, he should so move, but the question is out of order.",22
27,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,22
28,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! English expression may not have been my best subject at school, but it is true that there has not yet been a question mark. The Leader of the Opposition has the call. It is an extremely long preamble but he has the call.",22
29,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Given that the Prime Minister has been caught out yet again, this time by her own report, how can anyone believe anything that this Prime Minister says?",22
30,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I say to the Leader of the Opposition: just because you bellow things does make them right. Once again, here we have the Leader of the Opposition deliberately not telling the truth to the Australian community. He has just said to me 'your report' the Prime Minister should withdraw the imputation against the Leader of the Opposition.",22
31,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The expression used was an expression which has been allowed. I would hope that this exchangeboth the question and the answer-is the end of the overly-used debate in both questions and answers. As I have said before, the simplest thing that the House could do is to change the standing order so that there is no debate allowed in both the question and the answer. Having allowed the debate in the question, I have indicated before that that opens the door. The Prime Minister will now respond.  of order: the phrase used by the Prime Minister is one that I and the member for Indi were asked to withdraw only, I think, last Thursday. I ask you to ask the Prime Minister to withdraw because accusing somebody of deliberately not telling the truth is the same as accusing someone of being a liar, and I ask you to ask her to withdraw it.",22
32,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call. I have given my ruling. Mr Alexander interjecting,22
33,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Bennelong may be a newcomer, but he should be very careful in reflecting by way of interjection. The Prime Minister has the call.",23
34,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My very simple point was that in his question to me the Leader of the Opposition referred to this as my report. It is not my report, it is Professor Garnaut's report, and I believe he deserves the respect that should be shown to an expert who has acted, I believe, in the interests of the Australian nation by spending a very concentrated period putting this work together. It is very good work, and I would recommend reading it to people who are interested in tackling climate change and interested in the facts about how we address climate change in this nation. This is Professor Garnaut's report. We are a government that is always happy to accept and see the advice of experts. Then, when you look at the advice of experts, you absorb it and you respond to it. I know seriously working through an issue is not the opposition's strong suit, but I do recommend to them that they seriously work through Professor Garnaut's report. When they work through Professor Garnaut's report they will find that it very clearly makes the economist, that the most efficient way of dealing with cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon. For people who say they are concerned about cost-of-living pressures on Australian families, this report very clearly makes the point that if you go down a different roadparticularly the road that the Leader of the Opposition refers to as 'direct action' but which is really about subsidising pollutersthat is a more costly road to go down. So if you care about the cost-of-living circumstances of Australians, you would reject that costly path and accept the advice of Professor Garnaut and many other economic experts that the cheapest way of cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon. Clearly the member for Wentworth could assist the opposition in understanding that proposition. It is the government's intention, as I have outlined time and time before in this House and I have outlined again today and I am happy to outline further, to put a price on carbon from 1 July next year. That price on carbon will be paid by big polluters. Because they will now have a price on carbon they will innovate and change the way they work to create less carbon pollution. We will take a section of the revenue and assist Australian households. What that means is that big polluters pay and Australian households get the assistance. The Leader of the Opposition's plan is to take more tax off Australian families and give it to the big polluters in a plan we know will not work, courtesy of the words of the member for Wentworth. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, rather than the fear campaign, rather than the cheap political points, he should read all of the report, think about it, move away from this path of negativity and actually try to make a case, as an contribution to this debate. NA",23
35,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the member for Robertson, I acknowledge that we have in the gallery the Hon. Jim Lloyd, a former member for Robertson and a former Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. I am not the author of the timing! NA Carbon Pricing Broadband",23
36,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the government's efforts to undertake vital reform in tackling climate change and delivering the National Broadband Network?,23
37,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Robertson for her question and for her high quality advocacy in this parliament of the needs and interests of her constituents. The member has directed to me a question which raises two reform areas important to keeping our economy strong. We want Australians to have the benefits of a strong economy and we particularly want Australians to have the benefit of being able to get a job. That we are proud that 750,000 jobs have been created since the government was first elected, and we look forward to the creation of half a million more over the next couple of years. Keeping your economy strong always requires you to have a continuing reform agenda, to keep walking the reform road. We are engaged in reforms which are important to keeping our economy strong. Putting a price on carbon is important to keeping our economy strong and ensuring that we have the clean energy jobs of the future. Last week I received the report of the Climate Commission entitled The critical decade. It said unambiguously that the science was in. Today I received the report of Professor Garnaut, and he says in his report unambiguously that pricing carbon is an economic reform where the benefits far outweigh the costs. He tells us a fixed price followed by a carbon trading scheme is the best path forward to reduce the dangers of climate change without damaging the prosperity of the Australian nation. He talks about how pricing carbon is the lowest cost way of tackling climate change and dealing with carbon pollution. I know that those opposite dispute the science and do not believe in climate change, and I know they refuse to look in a serious way at the works of serious economists like Professor Garnaut, but that is what Professor Garnaut has found. Continuing to keep our economy strong also means we need to have access to the infrastructure that our competitor nations will have, and that is national broadband that enables us to move information at the same speed that people are moving it in the economies with which we compete. The construction of the NBN is only the first step in that reform journey to make sure that we have the productivity benefits that come with this new technology. That is why, today, the is why government released the digital economy plan. It is a roadmap of how we will build the digital economy and a key part of that is how we will aim to be one of the top five OECD nations for the use and take-up of broadband by 2020. It contains important measures so that we can support small businesses and not-for-profit organisations in the first 40 communities to fully utilise the opportunities that the NBN brings, and we will also be investing in education to make sure that students, whether they be in schools or TAFEs or universities, have the full benefit of the National Broadband Network. In all of these reforms, whether it is climate change or the NBN, we will focus on the facts-we will not allow ourselves to be distracted by the diversions-and we will always act in the national interest. Carbon Pricing",24
38,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his own economic note of three days ago, where he said that only the biggest polluters, less than 1,000, will pay for the pollution they emit. I ask whether the Treasurer agrees with the Prime Minister that Ross Garnaut is 'a serious economist' and whether he therefore agrees with Professor Garnaut, who has just said: Australian households will ultimately bear cost of a carbon price.",24
39,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I think that Mr Garnaut has produced an excellent report. It is the policy of those on this side of the House that the biggest polluters will pay the price on carbon. We will use every cent from that price paid to assist households and to assist industry. There could not be a clearer contrast with the other side. The other side want to tax households to pay big polluters. That is the policy on that side of the House. And the authority for that is not Professor Garnaut; it is the member for Wentworth. The member for Wentworth, in his interview last week, made the point that a direct action policy such as they have is the policy that you have when you are not serious about dealing with climate change.  of order on relevance. The Treasurer was asked whether he agreed with Professor Garnaut or the statement by the Prime Minister that only the big polluters will pay. He was not asked anything about any member of the opposition. I ask you to draw him back to the very straightforward question that he was asked.",25
40,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will directly relate the material he is using to the question.,25
41,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The government has a policy of a market based mechanism. It is the most efficient mechanism; it is the least cost mechanism. Those on the other side of the House,25
42,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,25
43,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,25
44,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know why they are so embarrassed. It is because the shadow Treasurer used to have a policy for a market based mechanism as well. He used to support the member for Wentworth on a market the full based mechanism. We know when he changed his mind, because he went on Twitter and asked everybody to tell him what his convictions were. We on this side of the House support a market based mechanism that will price carbon for the 1,000 largest polluters and use the revenue to assist households. What they want to do is to increase the tax on average taxpayers and give the money to the biggest polluters. We have not seen a serious policy from those on that side of the House in 3½ years.",25
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will relate his remarks to the question.,25
46,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The shadow Treasurer last year was found to have the biggest costing bungle seen in political history. He now expects to be taken seriously in this House. Mr Hockey interjecting,25
47,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If the member for North Sydney would be quiet he would learn that I asked the Treasurer to return to the question. But he is so noisy that he cannot hear anything other than himself. The Treasurer will directly relate his remarks to the question. Those on my left will sit in silence.,25
48,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Those on that side of the House are so bereft of policy that there is nothing left for them to do but to run baseless scare campaigns. That is what they are doing with question after question. Climate Change  question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Will the minister update the House on the government's receipt of Professor Garnaut's update to his climate change review? How has the update been received? What is the government's view?,25
49,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Moreton for his question. As the House has heard, Professor Garnaut today released the final update of his study into climate change and how the country should best respond to this important challenge. Professor Garnaut's update makes it absolutely clear that climate change is occurring, that it is caused by human activity and that it poses a serious risk to the prosperity and quality of life of all Australians. For the benefit of the member for Tangney, Professor Garnaut states the following in his report: Since 2008, advances in climate change science have ... broadly confirmed that the earth is warming, that human activity is the cause and that the changes in the physical world are likely, if anything, to be more harmful than the earlier science had suggested. That shows the quality of the contribution made last week by the member for Tangney in suggesting that there had been no warming in the last decade, despite the empirical evidence being emphatic that it was the warmest decade on record. That is testament to the control of those opposite by the climate science deniers. We know the influence that Senator Minchin has over the Leader of the Opposition in this regard. The views that Professor Garnaut has expressed on the climate science are based on expert advice. That advice is consistent with the advice received by the government from sources including the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Climate Commission and the Australian Academy of Science. Any government taking its public policy responsibility seriously to act in the national interest must respond to this challenge. It will also come as no surprise to the House, to economists generally and to anyone wanting to act on climate change that Professor Garnaut's proposed solution to this challenge is a carbon price delivered through a market mechanism. In his words in the report, he said 'market-based approaches to mitigation can bring out the best in Australians, and a return to regulatory approaches the worse'. Furthermore, Professor Garnaut had the following to say about the coalition's subsidies-for-polluters policy in his speech to the National Press Club today. He said 'Direct action for reducing carbon emissions is likely to be immensely more expensive than a market approach.' He in fact went on to make the obvious observation about a subsidies policy: that it is in the worse traditions of old protectionism, subsidies and antimarket of it philosophy. That is exactly where the Leader of the Opposition sits: subsidies for the big polluters and no revenue to assist households with the slug on taxes that they will be hit with. This is not a view that is shared by all of those who are associated with the Liberal Party. We know the views of the member for Wentworth and many others on the other side of the House. But we know, too, that former Prime Minister John Howard understands and respects the science and understands and respects the need for a market mechanism, having taken an emissions trading scheme to the election in 2007. We heard from Dr John Hewson yesterday that a market mechanism is the best position. We heard Malcolm Fraser supporting a market mechanism to tackle this problem. Holding a public political leadership position, you are irresponsible on this issue. It is time that the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition took this issue seriously and made a serious contribution to and an effort in this debate. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",26
50,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister, and I refer her to page 77 of Professor Garnaut's latest report-and I hope she listens carefully to this-which says: Every dollar of revenue from carbon pricing is collected from people, in the end mostly households, ordinary Australians. Most of the costs will eventually be passed on to ordinary Australians. That is the quote from Professor Garnaut. I ask the Prime Minister: how can she possibly maintain the pretence that only a thousand big polluters will pay her toxic tax?",27
51,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I have the page of the Garnaut report that the Leader of the Opposition refers to. It will not surprise anyone in this parliament to know that misrepresenting the force of Professor Garnaut's words. When you read these words, try to understand them, digest them and think about them in the national interest rather than try to clip a few out to use for a petty political agenda. What you actually find when you read Professor Garnaut's words is this, and very clearly: Professor Garnaut is there contrasting and comparing the costs for Australian households of two ways of pricing carbon-the way that the government is talking about by putting a price on carbon which businesses pay or the way that the Leader of the Opposition is talking about through regulatory mechanisms. He is comparing and contrasting those two approaches. The Leader of the Opposition cannot rely on one sentence in this document and not use the force of every other sentence. Professor Garnaut very, very clearly concludes that the mechanism the Leader of the Opposition is advocating is more costly for Australian households. Let me read the quote: Using direct action measures to achieve a similar amount of emissions reduction would raise costs much more than carbon pricing …",27
52,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: it was a very simple question about who pays-big polluters or households. The truth is that it is households-that is the point. She should be directly",27
53,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Having made his point of order, he cannot then proceed to debate. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.",27
54,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer to the section of the report that the Leader of the Opposition referred to to ensure that, rather than having it misrepresented in this place, people understand what Professor Garnaut is putting he is here. He puts very clearly-these are his exact words: Using direct action measures to achieve a similar amount of emissions reduction would raise costs much more than carbon pricing, but would not raise the revenue to offset or reduce the costs in any of these ways. The costs might be covered by budgetary expenditure, but this affects who pays the costs, not whether the costs are there. Other people's taxes have to rise to pay for expenditures under direct action. Who are those 'other people' whose taxes have to rise? They are probably better known to the Australian community as mums and dads with jobs who would need to pay the increased taxes that the Leader of the Opposition would need in order to subsidise big polluters. What we have said consistently, and Professor Garnaut makes this point too, is you put a price on carbon pollution. Big polluters pay that price. We have always been very clear indeed that there would be some price impacts, which is why we take revenue from pricing carbon and we generously assist households who need it the most. I have said that many times before. The Leader of the Opposition may only just have heard it: we generously assist households who will need that assistance the most. The difference here is more tax for Australian families and no assistance compared to a price on the biggest polluters and using that money to assist households. I suggest the Leader of the Opposition, instead of looking at the occasional word in Professor Garnaut's report, reads the whole lot. ",27
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Moreton, yet again. The Leader of the Opposition.",28
56,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said: This price wouldn't be paid by households, it would be paid by the 1000 biggest businesses",28

60,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform members that we have in the gallery this afternoon, Mr Sajid Javid, Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State (Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning) in the UK and MP for Bromsgrove. He is a guest here under the special visitors program. On behalf of members, I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Live Animal Exports",28
61,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Burke. Can the minister assure the House of more humane processing in the three South-East Asian meat works media targeted yesterday? Could the minister further assure the House that we are not going to impose our religious beliefs and values on our neighbours? Is the minister aware that an estimated one-third of Indonesian people go to bed hungry every night? But these people are not allowed to fish in our waters nor prawn farm our empty land, and an ox processed in Australia costs $7,500, precluding purchase by any Indonesian. In light of this, Minister, wouldn't they be entitled to say, 'Fair go, mate'? Could the minister advise, since it will no longer pay to provide water and feed, how our nature lovers intend to deal with cattle now dying? Could the minister finally advise these people parading as nature lovers to watch the worldwide nature program National Geographic, whose advertisement is of one animal ripping another to pieces? (Time expired)",28
62,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (14:45): I thank the member for Kennedy for the question in my capacity here representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I appreciate the perspective and the concerns of the electorate of Kennedy when anything relates to the live export industry. I have been with the member for Kennedy to Normanton and Cloncurry and met with some of the graziers and pastoralists there. It is a similar story across much of the north of Australia, going across through the Northern Territory and into Western Australia. There are a large number of jobs, family businesses and Indigenous employment operations which are underpinned by very large pastoralist industries. It is also true that the reason that this debate has taken off in such a way over the last 24 hours is that the footage that was on television last night was just awful. I felt that watching it, I am sure every Australian felt that and I am sure every farmer felt that as well. I note the comments that have been made by the New South Wales Farmers Association already about the distress that many of their members have felt in seeing their own stock treated in the way that we saw last night at a number of establishments. The footage was only made available to the minister for agriculture shortly before that program went to air. In that time, a number of actions have been taken and shortly before we went to question time the minister for agriculture provided a detailed media conference where he went through the gravity of what had been sighted and also the specific actions which he had already undertaken and further actions which he has left the way open for. Suffice to say of those specific establishments that have been involved and have been seen in that footage that Australian farmers do expect that their stock will be treated better than that. The Australian people expect that animals originating from Australia will be treated better than that, and the actions taken thus far by the minister have centred on those specific establishments. Carbon Pricing",28
63,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer him again to the words of Professor Garnaut in his report, when he says: In the long run, households will pay almost entire carbon price as businesses pass carbon costs through to the users of their products. Will the Treasurer now admit that he misled the Australian people just last Sunday when he said, 'Only the biggest polluters-less than 1,000-will pay for the pollution they emit'?",29
64,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," What we have is yet another example of just how shallow the shadow Treasurer is. By the day he gets more hollow. We have been very clear about what we are doing in pricing carbon. Of course the price is paid by the 1,000 largest producers and of course there will be price impacts. That is why we have said every single cent will go to households and will go to industries and will go to programs to drive renewable energy. Every single cent will go in that direction. But there is no credibility left on that side of the House, not when it comes to the shadow Treasurer and not when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition. The shadow Treasurer was once a believer in a price on carbon, but his situation has got so bad he now has to write performance appraisals for the Financial Review saying how good he is, because he has become a hollow man. There is no alternative policy on that side of the House.",29
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will relate his response directly to the question.,29
66,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What they do have is a policy they call direct action. That policy taxes consumers, taxes households and gives the benefits to the biggest polluters. That is what it does and that is what they are so embarrassed about.",29
67,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order. Again, it goes to relevance. The Treasurer was asked a simple question about the his own words versus those of Professor Garnaut, not anything else.",29
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have indicated that I desire the Treasurer to relate his material to the question. The Treasurer has finished. Live Animal Exports,29
69,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Will the minister please inform the House of the government's response to recent reports of the appalling treatment of animals in abattoirs in Indonesia?",30
70,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (14:51): I want to thank the member for Page for the question and acknowledge in similar terms to the job opportunities that I referred to across the north of Australia that there are many members on this side of the chamber, and some over there as well, with very significant meat works within electorates. They are very conscious of wanting to make sure that we maximise opportunities for the downstream processing jobs in Australia, as well as the animal welfare concerns which were aired last night. The member for Page has been pursuing these issues very strongly for quite some time. As I said a moment ago, anyone who saw that footage last night would have been horrified. The footage was just awful, and Australian farmers have been quite distressed by it as well. Shortly before question time, Senator Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, put forward an initial response on behalf of the government. As I say, he was presented with this footage shortly before the program went to air but shortly before question time was able to go through the responses which the Australian people would expect we would have to what was presented overnight. Our response is to: first of all, ask the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to conduct an immediate investigation into the specifics of the footage; next, to announce that the government will appoint an independent reviewer to investigate the complete supply chain for live exports up to and including the point of slaughter; and next, to ask for the minister himself to receive a briefing on the full range of legislative and regulatory options which are available to respond to issues concerned with animal welfare. In the interim, Minister Ludwig has asked for orders to enforce the suspension of live Water, animal exports to the facilities which were identified by the evidence which was broadcast last night. The minister will also add further facilities to the banned list in the future if required. He has implemented a moratorium on the installation of the restraint boxes that were seen being used in the footage. This will apply to the instalment their of any new boxes with Commonwealth funds across all global markets. He has also asked the Chief Veterinary Officer, the chief vet, to coordinate an independent scientific assessment of the restraint boxes which are under use in Indonesia. Following the completion of this work, the government will consider what further actions may be necessary. The government does share the legitimate concerns of the Australian community about animal welfare abuses and is taking the necessary action to investigate the footage. I thank the member for Page for raising the issue. Carbon Pricing Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:54): My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer confirm that under Professor Garnaut's proposal compensation for business will reduce from 35 per cent to 20 per cent over 10 years? How does the Treasurer expect struggling manufacturers to survive against overseas competitors who do not pay a carbon tax when the government is almost halving compensation for Australian businesses?",30
71,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," It sounds like the member for Curtin wants to make a comeback as the shadow Treasurer! As the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency have indicated, we think this is a very good report from Professor Garnaut. It is a very important report that means that there can be a thorough community debate about dealing with dangerous climate change and its impact not just on our environment but on our economy. Of course, it is a serious piece of work. It is a serious piece of work which feeds into the work that the government is doing with the multi-party committee, the business community and the wider community. We will take that on board as we go through developing an emissions trading scheme based on the principles that have already been announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. What we have seen here today is the pretence that somehow the government have already taken those decisions. We have not. The opposition want to go out there and run a scare campaign. Why are they running a scare campaign? It is because they are so acutely embarrassed about their lack of policy. They have no economic policy. They have been coming into this House and calling for an election despite the fact that their election policy from last year had a $10 billion hole in it. Ms Julie Bishop: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked about struggling manufacturers who have to compete against overseas competitors who do not pay a carbon tax when the government has been advised to almost have the compensation to business over 10 years. I ask the Treasurer to answer that question.",31
72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. Mr Abbott interjecting Mr Swan interjecting,31

75,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We on this side of the House take our responsibilities very seriously, unlike those opposite. We are going about in a methodical way producing a policy which deals with dangerous climate change and protects our economy for the future, unlike those opposite, who simply want to tax Australian families and hand the money to large polluters. We have a serious policy process in train for the benefit of the country and we are proud of what we are doing, unlike those opposite, who can only run a cheap scare campaign. Tobacco Products",31
76,Ms ROWLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Given today is World No Tobacco Day, what support is the government receiving in its efforts to implement antitobacco measures such as introducing plain packaging and reducing tobacco company influences, and what is the government's response?",31
77,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Greenway for her question. People might have heard the member for Greenway this morning talking about her earlier habit, as a young woman, of smoking and choosing the packet that was the most glamorous and the fact that she has been able to quit that habit and now is supporting the introduction of plain packaging-a world first. On World No Tobacco Day, it is an appropriate time to congratulate all those campaigners who for years and years have been calling on governments to take this action, and I am very proud to be part of a government that is taking this action. I want to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition. I know he does not normally like listening to me here at the dispatch box but this might be an occasion when he does. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition for finally declaring that he is going to do the right thing and that the Liberal Party will support this measure when it comes into the parliament. More importantly, I want to congratulate the member for Moore, the member for Hasluck and the member for Fairfax. There were many members on the Liberal Party backbench who finally brought the Leader of the Opposition to this position. It was against his instincts; his instincts were to say no. He did not want to do it, but he has been forced to do it by the weight of evidence that this is the right thing to do. I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has decided to support this measure, and I want to congratulate him for that. I do think, however, that on World No Tobacco Day there is a remaining habit that he needs to kick and that is a habit that goes to the receipt of tobacco donations. I report to the House that the AMA last week",32
78,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,32
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left. The minister has the call. She should be heard in silence.,32
80,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I report to the House that on Friday last week the AMA presented its tobacco awards and I am pleased that our government was the recipient of one of those awards. But another government was also a recipient. We shared the AMA award for tackling tobacco with a state government. I want to give you this quote: … I do not support receiving donations from tobacco companies. That is the position we had at the last state election; it is the position we will maintain. These comments from the Western Australian Liberal Premier, Colin Barnett, earned him an award from the AMA for resisting the influences of big tobacco companies who are donating large amounts to the Liberal-National Party. Far from being embarrassed about this, the Leader of the Opposition went on television last week and said that not only were people welcome to donate to the Liberal Party but he would invite them to donate more. It seems that British American Tobacco giving 97 per cent of their donations to the Liberal Party is not enough; they want 100 per cent of the donations from British American Tobacco. Obviously, we are delighted that the Liberal Party has seen what is the right thing to do. We want to congratulate the opposition for coming to its senses and I would like to nominate British American Tobacco for a Guinness Book of Records award for an own goal. The only reason we have been talking so much about this for the last two weeks is that Mr Crow went out and gave an extraordinary press conference which ultimately led to the Leader of the Opposition being so embarrassed that he had to change his position. Carbon Pricing Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (15:03): My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer confirm that under Professor Garnaut's proposal a typical single-income family with two or three children and one partner earning $80,000 per annum will get no compensation for the government's carbon tax?",32
81,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Macquarie for her question. What she has said is entirely baseless because we have not completed the design of the scheme. It is a continuation of the scare campaign that we are seeing from those opposite. They have been fond of quoting Professor Garnaut, so I would like to quote from page 77 of his report where he talks about the opposition's so-called direct action options. He says: Other people's taxes have to rise to pay for expenditures under direct action. In the long-run, households will pay almost the entire carbon price as businesses pass carbon cost through to the users of their products. That is Mr Garnaut's view of their socalled",33
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will resume his seat. Has the Treasurer concluded? Economy,33
83,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on today's balance of payment numbers and what they mean for the economic outlook?,33
84,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Blair for this very important question. Today's balance of payments figures do show the very dramatic impact on both the economy and our exports of recent natural disasters, particularly in Queensland. It is appropriate that that question is asked by the member for Blair, and there are plenty of members on this side of the House whose communities were dramatically impactednot just the economic impact but the social impact. And there are many on the other side of the House who also felt the full brunt of not just the floods in Queensland but also the impact of Cyclone Yasi in Far North Queensland, the rains in Western Australiain the north-west-and the bushfires in Victoria. This was a traumatic time and a dramatic time in our economy. The March quarter balance of payments show a sharp fall in export volumes in the first three months of this year. Export volumes fell by 8.7 per cent in the March quarter. This is the biggest quarterly fall in export volumes in 37 years. This contributed to a widening in the current account deficit of $2.3 billion to $10.4 billion, representing three per cent of the December quarter GDP. It is no surprise after those disasters that the biggest factor behind today's results was a very significant reduction in coal exports. Coal export volumes fell by $4.6 billion in the March quarter, which were down 26.8 per cent on the previous quarter. A large part of this lost coal production did occur in Queensland, with the Minerals Council estimating that 85 per cent of Queensland's coal mines suffered production losses in the quarter, mainly due to flooding. But of course there were also significant disruptions particularly to rail. And, as I said before, we had cyclones and heavy rainfall in north-western Australia earlier this year. Iron ore export volumes were down $1.3 billion or 7.7 per cent less than the previous quarter. So, of course, the impact of the summer floods and the cyclones and the events in Western Australia will take a heavy toll on GDP growth in the March quarter. Overall, net exports are expected to subtract around 2.4 percentage points from growth in the quarter. This is estimated to be the largest quarterly subtraction from GDP growth since records began in 1959. So there has been a dramatic impact on our economy from these natural disasters, and it is somewhat larger than the Treasury initially estimated. But whatever the outcome for the national accounts, the one thing we are absolutely certain of is that the fundamentals of our economy are strong. We still have low unemployment, at 4.9 per cent-lower than just about every other advanced economy. There is strong job creation, with over 700,000 jobs having been created since we came to office. And, of course, there is a record terms of trade and an unprecedented pipeline of investment. That is why it is important to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. That is why it is important to invest in our workforce, to build a bigger better trained workforce. This government is absolutely determined to get fundamentals right for our economy so that we can turn our success into a stronger economy for all Australians. Carbon Pricing",33
85,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Prime Minister. Given that Professor Garnaut advocates an increase in petrol prices for households after year one the carbon tax, will the Prime Minister rule out a new tax on petrol?",34
86,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I do genuinely thank the shadow minister for the opportunity to answer a further question about the Garnaut review, because I think it is very important for anyone who is watching question time today to not fall for the false premises that are behind the opposition's question. The opposition is mounting its question time. I certainly would not use the word 'attack'; I would not use the word 'strategy'; I must admit the word really escapes me. Anyway, whatever this kind of shambolic display is, No. 1, the opposition is trying to say that Professor Garnaut's review is the government's policy. It says that if the government does not agree with that proposition, somehow the government is walking away from Professor Garnaut. Of course, all of this analysis is a false premise and absolutely absurd. So let us be clear about Professor Garnaut's work. Yes, Professor Garnaut was asked to update his earlier report. We are a government that thinks public policy is best informed when you invite experts to participate and to put forward their views. Professor Garnaut has put forward his views and I thank him very much for doing that. But of course the government will make the decisions about the final design of carbon pricing and we and will work through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee and our usual cabinet the processes to do that. Clearly, I understand that those opposite do not like proper public policy processes.",34
87,Mr Hunt,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The question was whether or not the Prime Minister would rule My out a new tax on petrol.",34
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is of aware of her responsibility to directly relate her remarks to the question. The Prime Minister has the call.,34
89,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about a matter dealt with in Professor Garnaut's report, and I am clarifying and dealing with that. I am definitely going to clarify this point because of the game playing we are seeing from the opposition today. Of course, they do not want Australians to have a rational debate about climate change and carbon pricing because in the face of a rational debate their fear campaign runs off the rails. Professor Garnaut has put his views into the public domain and they actually deserve a considered public policy response from those opposite. Of course, they will never get that because those opposite are climate change deniers and they are determined to run a fear campaign. What we will do with Professor Garnaut's work-of course, it is there to inform the public discussion-is consider it deeply and the government will make decisions at the appropriate time and we will outline all of those decisions to the Australian people. Coming to the question that I was asked, can I say this about the cost of living and Australian households: the Leader of the Opposition has distorted today words from a chapter of Professor Garnaut's work that is called 'Better climate, better tax'. That is, Professor Garnaut is talking about tax cuts. What I can certainly say to the House today is as we work through designing household assistance and carbon pricing, tax cuts are a serious option. To the Leader of the Opposition, I would say: what that means is that he has decided to go to the next election ripping assistance out of people's hands and taking money away from Australian families. Of course, we understand the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families and we will make the appropriate decisions to generously assist Australian families. (Time expired) Tobacco Products",34
90,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice. I ask him: what action is the government taking to combat illegal and counterfeit tobacco in Australia? Is the minister aware of recent commentary about the size of the illegal tobacco trade Australia? What is the government's response? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (15:15): I thank the member for Makin for his question, a very good question on World No Tobacco Day. It is a good question, because I would like to tell the House that Customs, through its own very strong regime, has been detecting illegal tobacco in this country for some time and has been prosecuting those involved in that very illicit trade. The government is committed to combating illegal tobacco smuggling in this country. We work very closely with law enforcement agencies, with the states and, beyond our shores, with intelligence agencies to ensure we detect these transnational crimes. A strong indication of the success since 2007 is that potential revenue losses of customs duty of more than $400 million have been prevented because of the detection and confiscation of illegal tobacco items. Last year alone, Customs was involved in 10 separate tobacco-smuggling cases, successfully prosecuting those cases, which involved 35 convictions, eight custodial sentences, and very hefty penalties and fines for those who were involved in that behaviour. I raise those issues because the tobacco industry-for their own vested interests, I purport-have indicated that the problem is larger than it really is. Indeed, the tobacco industry have indicated that one in every six My smokers in this country consumes illegal tobacco. That is an exaggerated claim. Those claims are based on reports that have been paid for by the tobacco industry themselves. So not only do they fund the Liberal Party but also they fund self-serving research to in undermine the facts and to substantiate bogus claims that are being made to scare the public. They are wrong. According to the 2007 National Drug Strategy household survey, 0.2 per cent have consumed illegal tobacco for most of the time that they smoke. That is 0.2 per cent. The tobacco industry also asserts that plain packaging will lead to a huge increase in criminal offences. That of course is not true. That is baseless. The facts are that the illegal tobacco smugglers have had ready access to software technology to replicate specific brand packaging for some years. Indeed, they have very sophisticated counterfeit items. So any transition from specific brand packaging to plain packaging will not in any way, other than perhaps a negligible way, have an effect upon crime in this area. That is very important to note given the scare campaign that has been running. We know plain packaging will remove the allure, the romance or the glamour that some people see in smoking. It will reduce the likelihood of people, young people in particular, becoming addicts of this particular drug. The Minister for Health and Ageing has applauded the efforts of the opposition-and I do so too-in coming to the party, even if it is the case that of the Opposition came to the party kicking and screaming. I would like to commend the health minister for her good work and commend the member for Moore, the member for Hasluck, those on the other side who knew that this was good public policy and supported it not because of their political interests but because it was good public policy. This government will continue to do that. As we continue to do that, Tony Abbott will remain the Dr No of Australian politics. Carbon Pricing",35
91,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Labor Chief Minister in the Northern Territory wants a 50-year moratorium on the carbon tax, the Labor Premier of Tasmania says the tax is not fair, the Labor Premier of Queensland says she understands people's fears about the carbon tax, and the Labor Premier of South Australia says he has deep concerns about the job losses as a result of the carbon tax?

114,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS," by leave-I move: That this House has confidence in the Member for Scullin's Speakership. I thank members opposite for the opportunity to move this motion. I may not detain the House for quite as long as the time. I have on the clock. Obviously, we have been in uncharted and difficult parliamentary waters ever since the parliament resumed after the last election. Obviously, in the circumstances where the government cannot naturally command a majority, the job of the speakership is even more difficult than usual. Under difficult circumstances, Mr Speaker, you have done your job with commendable impartiality and with considerable forbearance. I know that all members of this House from time to time try your patience; I know from time to time. I do and I suspect NOES from time to time the Prime Minister does. All of us in this House are trying to make political points, as we should, given that the job of this House is to determine the great questions before our nation. I do not think anyone on this side of the House has anything other than respect for the job you do under difficult circumstances, and the last thing any of us would want to see is you feeling that you have been compromised in your ability to discharge your office by the vote that has just been taken. Whatever we on this side of the House think of a particular decision that you might have just made, we PAIRS do have deep and abiding confidence in your ability to run this House. I want to put it on the record that it is not the opinion of this side of the parliament that anyone could do a better job than you, Mr Speaker, in maintaining the order and the discipline of this House. Mr Speaker, you discharged your office very effectively in the previous parliament and, if I may say so, you have done your job with even more dignity, more assurance and more command in the more difficult circumstances of this parliament. As you know, Mr Speaker, when there was some question as to whether the government would renominate you in the weeks after the election, it was the position of the coalition that you should be renominated, and nothing has changed in the intervening nine months to alter that view of the opposition that you are by far and away the best person to take the chair, that you are by far and away the best person to do what is inevitably a difficult job in the circumstances of a hung parliament. Mr Speaker, I really do understand how you would be feeling at this present time. You made a call. It was the best call that you could make in your judgment at that time. On this side of the House, we respectfully disagreed with the call that you made. As it happened, our judgment was backed by the House. But please do not for a moment think, because of the fact that on this particular occasion, this solitary occasion, your judgment has not been supported by the House, that that indicates any want of confidence in your speakership. That is why I moved this motion. Please, Mr Speaker, do not judge what is the appropriate thing to do in the circumstances of this House by what might be the appropriate thing to do in the circumstances of very different houses. In this respect at least, this is genuinely a new paradigm and please, Mr Speaker, do not add to the difficulties of this day by feeling that you cannot continue in the chair.",38
115,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Is the motion seconded?,39
116,Ms GILLARD,MOTIONS," Mr Speaker, I rise to second the motion and of course the government has continuing confidence in you as the Speaker of this parliament. It is not an easy job. definitely not an easy job in contested political circumstances to deal with all of the things that come before you in this parliament. I understand that and the government understands that. government understands that you make the best judgment calls you can at the time. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for moving this motion and I am very pleased to second it. Mr Speaker, we understand that there is a continuing obligation on members of this House not just to support this motion but to support your rulings as they are delivered to this parliament. That is an obligation that we will acquit on the government side. I do believe you should take the combined view of me and the Leader of the Opposition on this occasion. I understand the precedents that have borne down on these things in the past but this is a different circumstance and I believe that in this different circumstance, having heard from me and the Leader of the Opposition, you should act differently to speakers in the past. You should acknowledge that the House has made a decision on this occasion, but that should be the end of it. But I would say this to members of the House who are now presumably behind the Leader of the Opposition and, in the exercise of their own independent judgment, about to support this confidence motion in you: the reality is that we should avoid future occasions where we find ourselves in this position-when we are called on to back your judgment on a matter such as a naming, the obligation will fall on us to do so. Mr Speaker, that is not something that should be second-guessed if people are going to have confidence in the Speaker. The government, in its conduct today, has shown full confidence in you by backing your judgment It is on the naming and, of course, we back this motion now. My words now are not directed to you but they are directed to the opposition: to provide continuing confidence in the Speaker, you need to provide The continuing confidence in the Speaker's rulings. Mr Speaker, in terms of the vote that we have just had, as I think was very evident from my conduct at the dispatch box, I did not hear you even name someone as the noise was so great. I am not able to say, standing at this dispatch box, what you named them for. I could not hear that either because the level of noise was so great. But I exercised my vote and the government exercised its vote in the way that we did because to provide confidence to the Speaker requires providing confidence in individual rulings of the Speaker. Whether or not we were in a position to judge as individuals the circumstances of any individual ruling, we provided that confidence. That is the attitude that the government will continue to take to providing confidence in you and I would ask members of the opposition to reflect on that for the future. As for today, Mr Speaker, we are where we are and the Leader of the Opposition has taken the appropriate action given the way in which the opposition has cast its votes. In those circumstances I think the Leader of the Opposition has done the right thing, which is why I am prepared to second the proposed resolution to confirm to you that the government has complete confidence in you continuing. I believe that you, having heard from both me and the Leader of the Opposition, should accept that display of confidence in the full exercise of your good judgment on this matter.",39
117,Mr OAKESHOTT,MOTIONS," Mr Speaker, I know there is a great deal of interest in this particular parliament and in six particular members of this parliament. In light of that, it is worth putting on the support for full confidence in your continuing role in the chair as Speaker. I think it is important in this parliament to have some reflection on and backing up of the words of the previous speaker, the Prime Minister, in consideration of the place that naming has in the full life of the 43rd Parliament. The position that I just took, for example, is not without precedent; it is the same position I have taken before in regard to naming-where possible, in my view, to defend a private member's rights within this chamber. You will see that consistently in regard to issues such as the gag and in the full range of issues in regard to the rights of private members in this chamber. If I do not hear or see a particular issue that leads to a member being named, then I would have difficulty doing anything else other than defending that member's rights. So my position is not without precedent but I do not think it then necessarily leads us to the next step in this 43rd Parliament, which is incredibly tight, of a lack of confidence in your position as Speaker of this chamber. So I appreciate the motion being moved-I think it is appropriate that we do clarify this-and I would hope as a consequence of that today we do see the House once again express full confidence in your ongoing role as Speaker in this chamber. Question agreed to. Ms Gillard: I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA  The SPEAKER (15:43): Order! It is my sad duty to inform the House of the death yesterday of an officer of the Department of  Buckley. Peter joined the department on 8 September 1969 and was a member of staff until the time of his death. A career of over record 41 years made him the longest serving officer of the department. Nobody associated with the Australian parliament today has known life within this parliament without Peter. He was good humoured and courageous, given his increasing physical limitations. Members might remember Peter as he zipped around the halls on his red electric scooter. This led to some of us, including me, referring to him as 'Fangio'. Peter was extremely well liked and well respected by all. His work colleagues within the House department have been greatly affected by the loss of such a loyal and cheerful colleague. On behalf of the House, I extend sincere condolences to Peter's family and his many friends, especially his work colleagues within the department. As a mark of respect, I ask members to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their places",40

128,The SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Flinders proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The imminent risk to Australia of the government's decision to delegate the carbon tax to an unelected committee. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",41
129,Mr HUNT,IMPORTANCE," It has come to this: on a day when the Prime Minister proudly tells the Herald Sun that her contribution to helping the planet is to run the pool pump at the Lodge at least one hour less per day, she refuses to rule out a petrol tax on the Australian people. It has come to this: on a day when the Prime Minister also tells the Herald Sun that her contribution to protecting the planet is to buy local fresh and in-season fruit and vegetables when in residence at the Lodge-and you can just imagine her down at Coles Manuka pushing a trolley in the tracksuit pants before going back to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs politely calls 'Boganville'–the Prime Minister of Australia is announced to be contemplating an unelected assembly of one, with maybe a few friends, to determine Australia's taxation policy and the tax rates on petrol, electricity, gas, groceries, automobiles and housing. On this day, when the Prime Minister is happy to talk about running the pool pump at the Lodge for one hour less, when she is happy to talk about an occasional trip to Coles Manuka to pick up a few fresh fruit and vegetable items, she is contemplating an unelected citizens assembly of one, with maybe a few friends, to determine the tax rates for electricity, petrol, gas, groceries, automobiles, housing and the cost of farming and food production in this country. That is what we are seeing in terms of the democratic deficit in this country on this day in this place. That is why this matter of public importance is important, because it is about the imminent threat to Australia in both our economic health and our democratic health. There are two great democratic threats in the way in which the government is approaching this carbon tax. The first is about participation. What we have is a principle, which the government will not renounce, of allowing unelected officials to set tax rates on the most basic, essential items for this country. Call me nostalgic, but I seem to remember that the Boston Tea Party focused on the issue of taxation without representation. That small principle of taxation without representation has a reasonable heritage in Western parliaments around the world. It was rejected 240-odd years ago and it has been rejected ever since. This government is unable to make a decision and form an agreement with its alliance partners and puppet-masters, the Greens. It cannot make a decision, so it seeks to refer responsibility for a most basic decision on taxation to an unelected committee, effectively a citizens assembly of citizens one or two or three, that can determine the tax rates that Australian families will pay for electricity, petrol, gas, groceries, houses and automobiles, amongst many other items. This is an abrogation of responsibility. The nature of governance, the purpose of a prime ministerial role, the task of a parliamentarian, is to allow the people of Australia to have a voice and have a role in and a responsibility for determining the rates of taxation of this nation and their impact on households so they can determine, through their representatives, the effective prices that they will pay for goods and services and the effective rates they will pay through taxation. We are at a critical and extraordinary moment in Australian political history, where an unelected body has been proposed and a prime minister is refusing to rule out the creation of an unelected body with effective control over the taxation rates of essential services. As I say, for over 240 years the Western world has been somewhat suspicious of taxation without representation. What we are seeing now is a policy where the government is refusing to rule out accepting, acknowledging and endorsing a committee which would effectively take power away from this parliament and disenfranchise the people of Australia over a fundamental decision. I repeat: the reason is that the government has no authority. It is a government which is fundamentally lacking in authority, lacking in legitimacy and lacking in the capacity to implement its own decisions. It is not in control of its own destiny; it is certainly not in control of the country. In order to resolve an internal alliance matter with the Greens, the ALPthe government of Australia, the Prime Minister of Australia-are contemplating ceding sovereignty over taxes to an unelected body. That is what it has come to in this parliament on this day. We make it clear that this is an imminent threat to Australia. I make the point that the democratic deficit operates firstly in terms of participation and secondly in terms of truth. In terms of participation, the most fundamental right that an Australian citizen has is to make or break governments on the basis of the policies they take to an election. All members of this House will remember that the government of today, led by the Prime Minister of today, went to the election with the Prime Minister stating on the Monday prior to the election: There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead. That statement could not have been more categorical, and it was made in the context of an opposition campaign to say that there would be a carbon tax. It was not a casual statement; it was not a chance statement. This was the primary issue of the day because we foresaw that, whatever happened in the House of Representatives, a deal would have to be done in the Senate which would bring on a carbon tax as a consequence of the government's relationship with the Greens. This was foreseen, the government was forewarned, but it was denied by the Prime Minister and by candidates seeking a mandate from the people of Australia to carry out policies. This happened not just once. On the day before the election, the Prime Minister said on the front page of the Australian: I rule out a carbon tax. The question has to be, why did she say that? What was there to lead her to object so much to the term 'carbon tax'? The Prime Minister said that because she knew that the Australian public would not endorse her, would not endorse her government and would not allow her to form government if she advocated a carbon tax, because it conveyed to the Australian people, in the words that the emissions trading scheme did not, that the people would pay in terms of higher prices for electricity, petrol, gas, groceries-all the essentials of life. It was an act of fundamental dishonesty on a critical issue at a critical juncture. It was an act of betrayal of the Australian people because it was fundamentally dishonest, and every member of the government today knows that. The reason the Prime Minister said 'I rule out a carbon tax' is that she knew that, if she did not, she would have lost the election. So she went to the election on a grand deception-a deception of the Australian people which goes right to the heart of legitimacy. And lest it be said 'we always intended a carbon price', the government's policy in the weeks leading up to the election was, firstly, no carbon tax and, secondly, a citizens assembly to produce-I remember the words clearly-a deep and lasting consensus. I suspect there has not been a deep and lasting consensus in favour of the carbon tax at this stage. Thirdly, and this is my favourite of all the policies, there was cash for clunkers. Cash for clunkers had a half-life of about three hours, before everybody realised it would produce emission savings at about $400 per tonne. They were the official election policies. The democratic deficit is real, and there should be a chance for the Australian public to genuinely vote on who determines the taxes Australians face, who determines the circumstances under which they pay those taxes and who determines what those taxes will be. This government went to the election denying that there would be a carbon tax and it should now take the proposal for a tax to an election. Anything less than that will be a travesty of the democratic process, a betrayal of the Westminster system, and will be a simple insult to the ordinary working families of the Australia, who deserve to have the trust placed in them to make their own decisions about their own future. The second great democratic issue at stake in this debate right now, when it is proposed that unelected officials be given the chance to levy taxation on Australian families, on Australian pensioners, on Australia farmers and on Australian small businesses, is the issue of truth. The government has told us that families will be no worse off. The government has told us that it is all some mythical 1,000 companies. But let me quote from the Garnaut report today: Australian households will ultimately bear the cost of a carbon price. Elsewhere in the report there are words to the effect that in the long run households will pay almost the entire carbon price as business passes on the costs. Those statements are both true. This system is designed to increase the cost of electricity; it is intended to increase the cost of electricity; its sole purpose is to increase the cost of electricity. And it will do it. It will do it over and above any other effects, and we do not walk away from that. But it will increase the cost of electricity. Lest it be said that we are quoting our own material, Treasury's modelling has talked about an $863 increase in the cost of living for families under a $30-per-tonne carbon tax. No matter where it starts, no matter what games they play in the first year, the impact will be a rise every year. The Garnaut report today confirms that there is an escalator that will continue for many years. Petrol will go up by 6.5 cents a litre. And if they play an offset game in the first year, what the Garnaut report also confirms, and the Prime Minister would not deny today, petrol indexation is effectively back. Every year after year one petrol will go up, and they cannot deny that. They must rule out increasing the cost of petrol. Gas will go up by 10 per cent. Groceries will go up by 5 per cent, according to the Australian Food and Grocery Council. Then there are the impacts on business, which are very simple. Let me give you an example that I think sums it all up. The cost of an Australian made car, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, will increase by up to $412 per vehicle. The cost of a foreign vehicle from China, Japan or Korea will not change at all. How can it be that an Australian made vehicle will increase by $412? There are members from South full Australia in this chamber and I ask them: do you think it is acceptable that an Australian made vehicle goes up by $412 while a foreign vehicle does not increase in price by one dollar? That goes to the heart of the flaws in this model and this approach. What they are saying is that we will increase the price of Australian made goods while imported goods are not penalised. Again, lest it be said that this was our work, this is the work of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and they have built on the findings of the National Farmers' Federation, which only yesterday said that there would be a $36,000 increase on a Western Australian wheat farmer at a carbon price of $36-per-tonne. The cost of food will go up and the profitability of farming will go down but the cost of imports does not change. That is the critical element that this government will not acknowledge. On the same day, the government has withheld the Productivity Commission report into the impacts and approaches to dealing with carbon pricing in other countries. The reason is that they are ashamed of it, and they want to release it out of the parliamentary session. So, they are willing to leak the fact, as they did overnight, that they are happy to have a new citizens' assembly of one or two or three to determine the taxation rates, but they are not willing to release the work of the Productivity Commission in this parliamentary session so that we can talk about the real action occurring around the world, whether it is in China, the United States, Japan or Canada. That is the democratic deficit that is occurring. Also, let me make it absolutely clear that the cost of a house, according to the Housing Industry Association, will go up by $6,000. Against all of that background-electricity, petrol, gas, groceries up $863 a year, Australian made cars going up by $412 whilst foreign cars from North Asia do not increase by a dollar at all-what we see here is a plan for an advertising campaign, with no plan to protect the Australian economy, and a plan for unelected officials to determine the taxation rates in Australia. It time for the Australian government to stand up for Australia and reject this tax and adopt a better way that will not drive up the cost of living for Australian families. (Time expired)",41
130,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:04): The member for Flinders has raised this matter today because what he fears most in this current debate is any independent voice on what the science of climate change means for Australia's efforts to reduce its own pollution. What we have heard today is a ringing independent voice, that of Professor Ross Garnaut. Professor Garnaut is, I repeat, an independent voice, and that is what the opposition cannot stand about the report that he released today. I add my thanks to those the Prime Minister expressed earlier today in question time to Professor Garnaut for the continuing excellent service he has rendered to our nation over the course of his working life. This debate today is not, as the topic chosen for it by the member for Flinders might suggest, about the role of government. It is not about the role of parliament, which will continue to be the body that has responsibility and accountability for the legislation that it makes. It is grossly misleading for the member for Flinders to come into this House and make any suggestions about what the government is proposing to do in relation to the carbon price scheme that we will be announcing in the middle of the year and introducing legislation for later in the year. It is grossly misleading for him to have made the suggestions that he has made about what the government is proposing. The fact of the matter is that the opposition is fundamentally opposed to any climate change policy that achieves the longis term reductions in pollution that we need to make. As outlined in his recent interview on the 7.30 Report, the member for Flinders has admitted that his polluter subsidy policy is only a temporary solution that has nothing to offer Australians for the long-term adjustment that Australia needs to make. The coalition's policy will not make a dent in Australia's emissions and fundamentally ignores the economic transformation that our nation needs to make. Far from being a long term vision, which is what one might expect from a mainstream political party, the coalition's policy is a fig leaf to convince the sceptics who sit opposite and make up a large proportion of the coalition parties that, in proceeding with the direct action policy, they have committed only to a pot of money that can be quickly reallocated and abandoned once they gain power. As outlined by Professor Garnaut today, direct action is immensely more expensive than a price on carbon. To make it clear what our policy is, the carbon price that we aim to introduce in this country is a price on pollution, which will make dirty energy more expensive and clean energy like solar, gas and wind cheaper. The carbon price will apply only to the biggest polluters in our economy-fewer than 1,000-and they will be required to pay for every tonne of carbon pollution that they emit. It is the most effective and the cheapest way for us to build a clean energy economy and every single reputable economist has said that, in comparison to the fig leaf of a direct action policy that the coalition has put forward, absolutely clear that putting a price on carbon, a market mechanism, is to be preferred. I do need to make clear what the governance arrangements for the carbon price might be-first, by making clear that those governance arrangements are still under consideration by the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. No decisions have been taken on aspects of governance, which are those that have been raised in this matter of public importance by the member for Flinders today. All details will be announced once the deliberations of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee have been finalised, but it is apparent that it is necessary to correct a complete misconception that has been advanced today by the member for Flinders not about the government's proposal, not about what has been decided in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee but about Professor Garnaut's proposal for an independent committee. Ms Ley: Three committees.",45
131,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"I am corrected by the member for Farrer, who says that Professor Garnaut in his report recommended as part of his proposed governance structure for the carbon price scheme some three independent bodies. But the particular independent committee that the member for Flinders has directed his attention to is one which, in his imagination, was going to set the price. I need to make clear-and I invite the member for Flinders to actually read Professor Garnaut's report before he next raises this, and perhaps other members opposite could read Professor Garnaut's report before they raise these sorts of allegations-that the independent committee as proposed by Professor Garnaut would not set the price. It is proposed that it would make it is recommendations on emissions reduction targets and that those emissions reduction targets would remain the prerogative of the government. The independent committee would not be setting the carbon price, because under the emissions trading scheme which we will be moving to after the fixed price period is completed it would become a market price.",46
132,Mr Hunt,IMPORTANCE,The target sets the price under the ETS.,46
133,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, The honourable member has had his opportunity. I counsel him to remain silent.,46
134,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The independent committee would make recommendations to government and parliament concerning the implementation of targets under emissions trading. It would be up to the government and the parliament to respond to these recommendations. Despite Professor Garnaut making this crystal clear in black and white in his report, the coalition has wilfully misrepresented what he has proposed. We have heard it again just now from the member for Flinders. The member for Flinders seems to be suggesting that the entire carbon tax, including the carbon price, and carbon pollution reduction targets would be outsourced to unelected officials-indeed, he has just used that phrase, referring to unelected officials setting tax rates. That is a wilful misreading of this parliament and it is not what Professor Garnaut said today in his speech, it is not what he said in his report and it is not what he said in the summary of his report. I read to the House what Professor Garnaut says: … some of the governance functions related to the scheme, are by their nature, the prerogative of Government. These include decisions about establishing the scheme, setting the medium and long-term emissions reduction targets, deciding which sectors should be covered by the scheme; the broad principles for providing transitional assistance to emissions intensive, trade exposed industries, and the principles governing the point at which the scheme should switch from a fixed to a floating price. It is very clear, Professor Garnaut goes on to say, that the ultimate decision on recommendations put forward by the independent committee that he is proposing lies with the parliament. That is what he says: Should the Government wish to take an approach that differs from the Independent Committee's recommendations, it would be required by legislation to present to Parliament the reasons its alternative decision. This approach is similar to the arrangements for setting carbon budgets or national emissions reduction targets in the United Kingdom. That is right: this is the approach that is followed by the Conservative led government in the United Kingdom, and that is why those opposite are so keen to misrepresent the proposal from Professor Garnaut. By the way, this is the same United Kingdom government, now led by the Conservative Party, which is continuing with the emissions trading scheme that has been established in the United Kingdom since 2002. It is the same Conservative led government which just two weeks ago adopted the most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any developed country. To make it clear what those are, it is a pledge, under the annual carbon budget adopted by the United Kingdom government, to cut emissions from 1990 levels by 50 per cent by 2027. It ought to be an embarrassment to those opposite that a Conservative led United Kingdom government, in a bipartisan fashion, has simply continued with the emissions reduction policies of the former Labour government. It has continued with the scheme. It has indeed adopted more ambitious targets. The suggestion which was made to us yesterday in this House that the United Kingdom government has said that there is going to be a review in 2014 is simply appropriate, cautious government. It is the appropriate, cautious government that would be brought by our government to bear on any emissions trading arrangements that we introduce, because the national interest must come first. That is why we are introducing an emissions trading scheme after a fixed price period, that is why we are moving to a carbon price, because it is in the national interest that we do so. The review for update from Professor Garnaut could not have been clearer. This is the report that Professor Garnaut released today. Making it clear, he said that climate change is real, it is caused by human activity and it poses a serious risk to the prosperity and quality of life for all Australians. He said: Since 2008, advances in climate change science have … broadly confirmed that the earth is warming, that human activity is the cause of it and that the changes in the physical world are likely, if anything, to be more harmful than the earlier science had suggested. It is a view that is based on the advice of expert climate scientists. It is consistent with the advice that the government has received from sources like the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Climate Commission and the Australian Academy of Science. Of course, just last week the Climate Commission released its report, entitled the The critical decade. Any government-indeed any serious political party-has a clear responsibility to act in the national interest and, consequently, cannot ignore advice of that kind. Only an opposition which is more concerned with its own political self-interest than the national interest would choose to ignore such advice. I will say again, as was said several times in answers in question time, that Professor Garnaut could not have made it clearer that the appropriate response to the challenge of climate change is a market based mechanism. It is the introduction of a carbon price and it is not the so-called direct policy that those opposite seem to favour. This is what Professor Garnaut said in his speech today about direct action: 'Direct action, or reducing carbon emissions, is likely to be immensely more expensive than a market approach.' That is consistent with the views of all mainstream economists.",46
135,Mr Hunt,IMPORTANCE,That's not true. There are three Nobel laureates who disagree.,48
136,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"It is consistent with the views of former Liberal leaders. As has been accurately said, the only living leader of the Liberal Party, past or present, who does not support a price on carbon",48
137,Mr Hunt,IMPORTANCE,That's not true eitherDowner.,48
138,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"Oh yes, Mr Downer, apparently. I have not heard from him.",48
139,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! The honourable member for Flinders will restrain himself.,48
140,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"But what has been made clear is that John Hewson favours a price on carbon. Malcolm Fraser favours a price on carbon. Malcolm Turnbull, the member for Wentworth, favours a price on carbon and the former Prime Minister John Howard favours a price on carbon. That ought to give serious a pretty clear message, one would think, to those opposite that they are definitely proceeding on the wrong track with their direct action policy. I want to again commend Professor Garnaut for the great service that he has done to Australia with the update of his 2008 report. In the report that he released today he made very clear points, one of them being that in mainstream science the expectations of what will happen if we 'let emissions rip', to use Professor Garnaut's phrase, have become a bit more grim. A second point, and it is a somewhat optimistic point that action Professor Garnaut made today, was that technology is advancing faster than expected. He gave us the example of the take-up rate for electric cars. The third important point that Professor Garnaut made today was that the case for action is stronger than it was a few years ago. We should have acted much earlier than we have. With every year that passes the cost of taking action will grow, and that is why it is important that we proceed now with as much speed as possible to introduce a carbon price in Australia, starting on 1 July next year with a fixed price. This is a reform which is in the national interest. It is a reform which will see Australia doing our fair share. It is a reform in which we will be able to show the rest of the world how to reduce emissions and, by doing so, urge the rest of the world-because we need the rest of the world to act-to reduce their emissions. It is a reform which will let us move our economy towards the low-carbon economy of the future, towards the clean energy of the future. We will withstand pressures from sectional interests because it is in the national interest that we continue to do so. (Time expired)",48
141,Ms LEY,IMPORTANCE," I am delighted to speak on today's matter of public importance, the imminent risk of the government's decision to delegate the carbon tax to an unelected committee. Since the government is determined to quote Professor Garnaut, we should put one of Professor Garnaut's quotes front and centre in this debate-that is, that 'Australian households will ultimately bear the full cost of a carbon price.' We already know that a carbon tax will attack the living standards of forgotten Australian families and households. I received a letter this week from a young mum in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, where the Treasurer believes our two-speed economy is going at full throttle. This is a young mum who wants to get back into the workforce, but is worried about the skyrocketing cost of child care and about being able to give her family all that she hopes and dreams of. So what is the Prime Minister's response? She is going to hit her with even higher costs of living. For starters, a $20 to $30 per tonne carbon tax will raise power bills by 25 per cent. It will add 6½c to the cost of a litre of petrol. Up go grocery prices by five per cent-and that is all just for starters because Labor's shaky, flaky single-issue partners in government, the Greens, say the tax must be $40 a tonne to drive change from coal to gas. Then it would have to go to $100 to drive the change from fossil fuels to renewables. We know that that is exactly what the Greens want to do. I am at a loss as to how I should respond to Tanya from Kalgoorlie, but I might also add that she wrote at the end of her email: 'I would have written this letter to the appropriate minister from the ALP, but it has become very clear that the Labor Party is not listening to middle-income Australia.' Labor set the tone for the debate on unelected committees in the last parliament, when they kicked off with the 2020 Summit. Having sneaked into government with 97 per cent of the former government's agenda, they had to bring a summit to Canberra to tell them what they had to do. 'We're not sure of our agenda. We've sneaked into power. What should we do?' The citizens assembly is another example of this. It popped up during the last election campaign. It was to consist of 150 members from across Australia, one from each electorate, and we pointed out to the Prime Minister then that we already have such an elected assembly in parliament. But again it was an initiative designed to tell the government what to do and what to think. Wind the clock forward to the Murray-Darling Basin debacle. The government flicked the development of a basin plan to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, absolving itself of responsibility for the outcome, and kept referring to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority as the independent authority. What a mess! Members of this parliament, in a committee chaired by the member for New England, have had to travel around the basin, picking up the pieces and cleaning up the mess because, again, we saw the decision making of this parliament hived off to an independent committee. We had to bring the decisions back into the parliament where they belong. We now have a proposed independent committee to set Australia's emissions reduction level, to break the deadlock between the Labor Party and the Greens, and to resolve the hissy fits of the Prime Minister and Senator Bob Brown. Professor Garnaut's final carbon price report is quite prescriptive. There is $11.5 billion-55 per cent of which goes to households and 35 per cent to businesses. It will be budget neutral. There will be tax cuts and a tax-free threshold. Pensions might be indexed. Petrol taxes are in the mix. Transitional assistance will be provided and so on. No fewer than three independent bodies will be set up to implement it-one to tell us what our future targets and scheme caps should be, another to tell us what assistance should be provided to trade exposed industries and a third is the carbon bank to administer the final emissions trading scheme. But if the government disagrees with recommendations then it has to come back to parliament and so on. The problem here is not the existence of sound, independent organisations to manage whatever disastrous policy emerges from this mess. The problem is the referral, handballing and dumping of the decision making that belongs in this parliament to outside bodies. Like many, I watched the Garnaut National Press Club address today and paid particular attention to the questions. During the questions, Professor Garnaut was asked: 'What target would the independent committee set? Would it be more than five per cent?' His answer was: 'Well, the independent committee would look at this in more detail. It would have the resources on the job to do it properly. It would have a whole seven months to do it.' So one can only conclude that the independent committee might well set a target of greater than five per cent. The point of this is not much the five per cent target but the clear impression that the responsibility for the setting of the target does not lie within this parliament but lies with one of these three independent committees. Do people really think that if the committee that determines a target of more than five per cent does not have its advice taken by the parliament that all of the other work that is being done by independent committees outside this place would stand up? It would not. To me, that is a strong indication that this government is devolving responsibility to a body that is not elected. Every other piece of advice or decision hangs off that target. The Prime Minister needs to 'fess up here. She has no idea what to do with this train coming down the track. I represent a rural electorate, like many members in this place. I refer now to the Australian Farm Institute report which says that the impact of a carbon price on Australian farm businesses-the case I am going to use is grain production-is going to be quite devastating. The proposed carbon price mechanism will increase the price of energy and hence the cost of farm inputs that involve the use of energy in their production or delivery. It does not matter how many tax offsets or structural adjustments you put in. It does not matter whether agriculture sector emissions are in or out. The on-farm costs will rise and, for my own electorate, disturbingly so. The report notes the impact of a carbon tax will be relatively greater for the smaller New South Wales farmer, with the lower productivity of a modest sized grain farm hit harder by the rise in costs. This simple report comes up with the figures the government apparently needs a fullblown committee to consider. Even at a modest carbon price scenario of $20 a tonne, this would add $15,000 to the bottom line of this farm business. Farmers have enough to so cope with-droughts, floods, locusts, mice and the scourge of other things that they face-without adding the carbon tax. As I said, the Prime Minister has no idea of what to do with the carbon tax problem. But what the coalition says to this government is that, no matter how many independent committees, expanded government bureaucracies, experts or actors you wheel out to ram your message down the throats of the Australian people, nothing is going to substitute for your government's shocking leadership, the incompetent way that you have managed this debate, your muddle and your confusion. The simple truth is that the government's carbon tax will impose excessive deadweight costs on the Australian economy. A carbon tax will increase the cost of living. It is, most disturbingly, a tax which is actually designed to go up as soon as it commences. It will transform into an emissions trading scheme down the track. It will start as a carbon tax at some level yet to be set-the mystery will be revealed by the multi-party committee-but as soon as it is legislated it is designed to go up. Compare that with the GST where checks and balances and legislation were put in place and agreements were made to make sure that that did not happen. This is a tax that by its very design will go up the minute it hits the pockets of everyday Australians. The government is not brave enough to put its stamp on this tax. It is not brave enough to bring the decision making that it should be doing across the parliament inside the parliament. Instead, it is hiving it off committee of unelected people that will have, as the member for Flinders pointed out, extraordinary power. The wide-ranging discussion we heard at the Press Club indicates that Professor committees will have their fingerprints all over all sorts of aspects of government policy, particularly tax, pensions, FBT and fuel prices. How could they possibly get it right? How could they possibly make it budget neutral in the end? I do worry, as I said, about those deadweight transaction costs with money moving around the economy. Who knows where it will end up? If the Prime Minister wanted an actor to help get the message across, she would have been better off choosing Chopper Read than Cate Blanchett because Chopper Read was quoted in the press on the same day as Ms Blanchett and Michael Caton saying, 'Look, I just make it up as I go along.' It appears that the Prime Minister and this government are also making it up on this topic as they go along.",49
142,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE," At the outset, I agree with the member for Flinders in one aspect of his contribution to the House today-that is, we are at a critical point. We are pressed to do something of paramount generational importance, and that is to tackle the influence of climate change-an issue that on their side they grappled with for years. They ignored public pressure to deal with what the public wanted to see: support for Kyoto, support in tackling climate change and some sort of action taken for the sake of future generations. They comprehensively failed to do anything until the last moment when their former leader, John Howard, agreed that they would need to do something and support an emissions trading system. He was ultimately required to face the grinding weight of facts and the compelling case to act. Again, it is worth noting that 2010 was to a one of the warmest years on record. The previous decade was one of the warmest. The graphs recording movement in temperature might bounce up and down but the trend line is undeniably moving upwards. Garnaut's The turning point for us",51
143,Mr MCCormack,IMPORTANCE,It is getting warm in here.,51
144,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"Is it warm in here? Well, from the hot air that comes from the other side it does not surprise me that you would feel that way. The turning point was the election of the Leader of the Opposition whose strident opposition has caused splintering, forcing people to argue against the very things they strongly believe in. In particular, the member for Flinders, whose own academic work declared support for a pollution tax, is now forced to advocate for a pollution subsidy. One of the good things to come out of the 1990s was the work of the member for Flinders in which he advocated some sort of pricing mechanism, through a pollution tax, that he now argues against in this House. We have two of the more moderate and reasonable people from their side advocating immoderate unreasonable positions through the course of this debate, knowing full well in their heart of hearts that they cannot ignore the fact we are required and almost compelled to do something. You have to be astounded by the gall of the opposition who come here as the defenders of democracy, who come here as the advocates for mandates, who wring their hands on the issue of cost of living, and yet where was all this when they up-ended the lives of workers and brought in Work Choices. They never went to an election advocating or indicating in any way, shape or form that they would be rampantly introducing individual contracts, stripping away penalty rates, squeezing overtime and putting pressure on working families. They never came in here and said, 'This is what they were going to put forward at the next election.' Now they come here as if they have discovered the virtue of mandate, that they have discovered in some way, shape or form the importance of a democracy and of being upfront and transparent. Yet, they seek to demonstrate this line here today. We asked them, given that this matter of public importance is talking about the way we intend to approach this whole issue of dealing with climate change, to be involved in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. They had a chance to be involved and they refused. Why? Because they wanted to be able to sit on the sidelines and do whatever they could to support the position of Leader of the Opposition to not undertake any sort of comprehensive action on climate change. What they wanted to do was to sit outside the process, and yet when invited to have an input and to put forward the issues that they now claim they are most concerned about, they did not do it. We now have an opposition that are effectively cast in the scientific Dark Ages. While the and front-bench makes lukewarm support for the science, you have some incredible comments being made by people in a position of that responsibility who should know better. They say, for example, that they do not know whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out to be-and that comes from the Leader of the Opposition. While the member for Flinders and the member for Wentworth will, with their hands on hearts, say that they do accept the science, their own leader is unable to comprehensively say that he accepts that the earth is getting warmer and that something needs to be done about it. At the back we have people like the member for Tangney, Senator Minchin, Senator Joyce and Senator Boswell-this column of sceptics-and the Leader of the Opposition is unable to articulate or form any sort of comprehensive policy on this because they are out there white-anting the coalition in coming forward with some sort of meaningful, durable way of dealing with this issue of climate change. They remain on the outer because they have put themselves there in an effort to wreck any chance of being able to form the type of community consensus that is required on this pressing issue. Amazingly, stunningly, as part of this scare campaign, they are out their misleading the public as to what the impact would be and they doing so in quite an economically illiterate campaign. They have been picked up on this. Lenore Taylor of the Sydney Morning Herald dissected this quite neatly after the Leader of the Opposition visited a butcher store in Coffs Harbour as part of the annual charity bike ride that he did down the eastern seaboard. He stopped into a butcher's shop and he said that the carbon tax would contribute $4,000 to the energy bill of that butcher. The journalist then went back into the butcher's shop and asked if this was the case. They said, yes. Then they were asked what impact this would have on their turnover and their prices. The butcher said the impact would be, for example, that for a kilo of T-bone that costs currently $22, the price would move, stunningly, up to $22.04. On a kilo of mince it would move from $11 to $11.02. This scare campaign is unable to deliver the facts. We had previously demonstrated under other potential options that grocery prices, on average, might move from 80c to $1.30 a week. They are going out there doing all sorts of scare campaigns, almost encouraging people to horde WeetBix under their bed because the carbon tax would have a 0.0006 per cent impact on Weet-Bix. I know that they are prone to their three-word slogans, so now it is 'Bix Under Beds' for the opposition because they want to beat the price rise caused by the carbon tax. Look at what we have done. We have worked on the science. We have provided comprehensively through the Climate Commission the report that was tabled last week, The critical decade, to be able to detail in clear, factual terms what is going on. I am astounded that the response to try undermine this work by notable scientists has been, 'They have been paid by the government.' This is the sum total of the response by the coalition. Yet if people put their hands in their own pockets on this issue critical to Australian public life and they fund a campaign to demonstrate their commitment to seeing climate change tackled, the opposition then undermines their efforts, as we have seen on the weekend with someone who has made their fortune from the ground up: Cate Blanchett, and some of the others. The opposition has sought to undermine their commitment to the cause. We have had consultations with business, NGOs and the farm sector looking at the household impacts. What we have on the other side of the House are the sultans of subsidy-those people who would be willing to hand over at the outset $10 billion in subsidies to businesses who pollute and would do this in a way that would be ineffective in discouraging climate change, as evidenced by the Grattan Institute, which said that this type of work does nothing and will, in fact, by 2050, lead to an $8 billion per year extra cost to the budget. The other side do not have the will, the willingness or the ability to cooperate, as we have provided them the opportunity to do so through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. They stand as vandals on this issue, as opposed to what we are trying to achieve for generations to come. (Time expired)",51
145,Mr MCCORMACK,IMPORTANCE," The very thought of a carbon tax has made big business shudder and small business, the engine room of our economy, very surely catch pneumonia. The carbon tax did not get much of a run in the recent federal budget, but there was funding for a $13.7 million advertising campaign to sell this unwanted and unnecessary tax which will have such a to negative impact on the lives of everyday Australians. The ad blitz started on Sunday. There was Michael Caton of The Castle fame spruiking the merits of a carbon tax. Someone, anyone, 'Tell him he's dreaming.' Cate Blanchett, wonderful actress, was also there on the small screen talking up the initiative. If Labor thinks it can sneak in this toxic tax via celebrity endorsement then it is wrong-plain wrong, morally wrong. Ms Blanchett would know that human and industrial activity has ensured CO2 levels are different than those in the Elizabethan era. It will not be any golden age if Labor, being dictated to by the unrepresentative Greens, forces a carbon tax on hard working, longsuffering Australians. Our modern-day Maid Marian, Cate Blanchett, also ought to realise that a carbon tax will take hard-earned money from the pockets of the poor and will not decrease sea levels or lower the global temperature one iota-not one millimetre, not one degree. Robin Hood would not be proud. Perhaps our Treasurer is invoking the ideas of old King John from medieval times, who imposed harsh taxes on the working class. This morning I received an email from an age pensioner in my electorate, who wrote: When I listen to debates about a carbon tax, apart from it placating the Greens, I wonder if Labor's real intention is to have a new source of income in order to achieve their promised surplus? The sender, Peter Piltz, is a fairly typical sort of person-a father, a grandfather, a former small business man, someone who knows a con when he sees it. He is like a whole host of other fairly typical sorts of people-regional Australians and city dwellers too-who can see straight through Labor's deception, spin and the fact that it has caved into the Green pressure to keep a tenuous hold of its minority government. Just before the 21 August election, the Prime Minister, who has shown she will say anything, do anything and be anything just to stay in The Lodge, declared: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' She is right about that. Greens Senator Bob Brown is running this sorry show. The Prime Minister has no mandate to introduce a carbon tax and inflict financial pain on the Australian people. She should do the decent thing, the honourable thing, the democratic thing and call an election. Now. There is an imminent risk to Australia of the government's decision to delegate the carbon tax to an unelected committee-a huge risk that we as a nation ought not be taking. What sort of committee makes such critical decisions affecting the nation without the Prime Minister and without the Deputy Prime Minister? The member for Lyne, who I might add represents an electorate which gave just 13 per cent of primary preferences to Labor-the party he took 17 days and then 17 minutes to give power to after the hung election result-has talked about imposing a carbon price sufficient to 'let the market rip' and 'let the science fly'. Carbon tax is Labor's big lie-another of its broken promises. As we have heard from the member for Farrer this afternoon, we have had the 2020 Summit, the citizens' assembly, the independent Murray-Darling Basin Authority, which made such a mess of water, and now the unelected carbon pricing committee all telling this governmentwhich has no idea how to do anything-how to do its job. Labor will relish the opportunity to impose high-reduction emissions in line with its minimum 40 per cent cut by 2020 via a suitably stacked member for Lyne, Ross Garnaut style independent authority led by, say, Tim Flannery, Garnaut himself or carbon queen Cate Blanchett. In the Garnaut review it is stated that Australian households will ultimately bear the burden of the full cost of a carbon taxhouseholders, not big polluters. A $26 a tonne carbon price would push up electricity prices by an extra $300 a year per household in just the first year. Prices would continue to soar every year thereafter. Petrol would rise by 6.5c per litre. Gas would rise by up to 10 per cent in the first year. Grocery prices would increase. The price of Australian made cars will increase by $412. Manufactured goods would rise. It will push up farming costs, as the member for Farrer indicated, particularly in the Riverina, an area I represent. Compensation will be temporary. Compensation will not change people's carbon-producing habits to stop what the Deputy Prime Minister ridiculously and hysterically calls 'dangerous climate change'. The introduction of a carbon tax will hurt Australian manufacturing, and dependent industries and communities, for no environmental gain. United States President Barack Obama abandoned his planned emissions trading scheme, further proving that this Labor government is now completely isolated from its major trading partners. How many jobs are we going to lose overseas, and what damage will be done to our economy before the US, Japan and China get on board, if ever? Labor's carbon tax will send manufacturing overseas to countries which use more emissions to make the same things which are currently being made here. Businesses will be forced to cut jobs to be able to afford the carbon tax. Labor claims that 29 out of 38 countries with Kyoto obligations already have an ETS. Those 29 countries all operate under the European Union ETS-27 EU countries and Norway and Switzerland. The EU ETS is not comparable to Labor's carbon tax and certainly is no justification for proceeding with it. Eighty per cent of EU trade occurs amongst EU countries; therefore less than 20 per cent of its trade will be exported outside the EU to countries where the producers do not face ETS costs. Common sense has given way, yet again, under Labor to economic recklessness. Australians are going to be burdened by significant extra costs, for no environmental benefit; our economy has been distorted by the misallocation and redistribution of resources for no reason; and our exporters are going to be placed at a disadvantage in the international market. The Labor government have set a target for reducing emissions without having any clue about the effects it will have on the countryMr Champion interjecting",53
146,Mr MCCORMACK,IMPORTANCE,"The member for Wakefield can interject all he likes, but he knows what I am saying is correct-or at least they will not reveal to the public what effects it will have. Australia contributes 1.4 per cent of world energy CO2 emissions, according to 2002 figures. For the purpose of comparison, the USA contributes 23.5 per cent of global emissions; China, 14.6 per cent; the EU, 11.6 per cent. Why is this Labor government pushing for us to be world leaders with a carbon tax? Is it because Labor may be the government but the Greens have the power? Internationally renowned and respected environmentalist Bjorn Lomborg says there is no hurry; carbon taxes will only force us to spend all our money rolling out patently inefficient current technology when smaller investment in research would give much more innovative and much better and cheaper solutions in a few years. Using agriculturally rich soil for forestry instead of for growing Australia's food supply will significantly impact on the produce that is supplied to cities and regional Australia. It might be fine for city slickers to support a carbon tax, but they will be the first to complain when they can no longer access fresh Australian produce. It is produce, not forests, which will feed our nation. We need to remember who puts food on our plates and supports the economy of this country. Crippling the agricultural industry will have major economic and social ramifications in regional Australia. Just this afternoon Oxfam, in a media release entitled 'Broken food system could see millions go hungry', indicated that Oxfam's new Growing a better future report explains the world's broken food system, showing how rising food prices and increasing scarcity of arable land and water-rapid changes-will undermine access to food across the world. The media release reads: Oxfam Australia Executive Director Andrew Hewett said: ""Although the world produces enough food for everyone, the broken food system means one in seven people are still going hungry. ""Oxfam was created in response to the food crisis caused by the Second World War in 1942, but this is a new food crisis that threatens us all. … the Australian aid program reflects the global trend over recent decades of declining investment in the food and agricultural sectors of developing countries. We must address this and prioritise support for small-scale primary producers who make up more than 80 per cent of the world's hungry people."" The media release goes on: The Growing a better future report reveals that:  By 2050, demand for food will rise by 70 per cent, yet production is not keeping pace. And it certainly will not keep pace with a carbon tax. As a nation, Australia is best placed to grow the food to feed ourselves and the world. A carbon tax and an unelected committee determining it will do nothing to help the world food shortage. Coming from a government which claims to be for regional Australia, this carbon tax drives a stake deep into the heart of regional Australia. The unelected committee deciding the carbon tax does not stand for what Australians need, does not represent the views of ordinary, everyday families and is just being led by the nose by Labor, which is being led by the nose by the Greens, who are very on the nose. (Time expired)",55
147,Mr CHAMPION,IMPORTANCE," This has to be the strangest matter of public importance ever brought before this House. It is a very strange issue to debate, this issue of an unelected committee. I was really quite perplexed about what the debate might be about. But I have listened carefully. I listened in particular to the member for Flinders talking about the Boston Tea Party and other things. I cannot really understand it. This parliament is elected. The government is elected. Any committee report comes to us. The committee recommends things to us. It is subordinate to this parliament, to the democratic process, to the national interest, in the same way that every … … … other institution set up by this parliament is-in the same way that the Reserve Bank, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and other bodies and authorities set up under Australian law are always subordinate to this parliament. I could not work out what we would be debating for such a length of time, but I now realise it is the Boston Tea Party; it is this attempt to conjure up a dark Orwellian fantasy in which we are ruled not by the parliament, not by democracy, but by some unelected body tucked away somewhere. This is the Liberal Party's new politics. It is an attempt to undermine this parliament's legitimacy, it is an attempt to undermine the policy intent of the government and it is an attempt to appeal to the extremists and fruitcakes who now populate the activist base of the coalition. The first signs of this appeared in February of last year, when Tony Abbott, just two days after launching his climate change policy, met with Lord Monckton, a British lord. He met with him in secret. The member for Warringah refused to let us know what it was all about, but Lord Monckton told us what it was all about. He said that the proponents of climate change wanted to establish a world government that would shut down democracy worldwide. We can see that there are elements of that view in the MPI today. What else did Lord Monckton say after that meeting? Lord Monckton added: … that Mr Abbott's policies to encourage tree planting and to help industry save energy would help address ''genuine'' environmental problems. ''It is indeed better to have a policy the issue of climate change for those who still believe, and there are some diehards who still believe, that fixes some of the genuine environment issues that are a lot cheaper than the enormous amountsof moneydiverted to this ridiculous climate thing,'' Lord Monckton said. He said that it could be turned off if necessary. That is one of the things Lord Monckton said.",56
148,Mr Tudge,IMPORTANCE,You're struggling. You're looking for your notes. You can't find them!,57
149,Mr CHAMPION,IMPORTANCE,"No, I was just looking for what Mr Turnbull later said. That was what Lord Monckton said. He said that this is a great policy. It gives a nod to climate change and, if necessary, can be easily turned off. Fast-forward a year and the member for Wentworth goes on Lateline and says: … I think there are two virtues of that from the point of view of Mr Abbott and Mr Hunt. One is that it can be easily terminated. If in fact climate change is proved to be not real, which some people obviously believe-I don't. If you believe climate change is going to be proved to be unreal, then a scheme like that can be brought to an end. So we can see here, from Lord Monckton to Malcolm Turnbull's quotes, that the opposition basically have a policy which is all about chicanery. It is all about conspiracy theories. It is all about designing a policy that will get them through the next election and provide them with a fig leaf for their resistance to the idea that the science is right. We heard it in the member for Riverina's defence of this MPI topic. He clearly does not believe that climate change is a problem. The references in this MPI to an 'unelected committee' are really targeted, as I said before, at those extremists who now make up which nods to the coalition's activist base. We then heard their attacks on good Australians. We heard their attacks on Cate Blanchett. We heard their attacks on Michael Caton. These are people who are part of our cultural life, who have worked hard and who are our exports to the world. We heard Senator Barnaby Joyce out there attacking Cate, saying she was hurting people, and we heard the Leader of the Opposition in this parliament yesterday abusing her for having an 'ecomansion'. This deliberate bullying and abuse of Australian actors, this revolting political abuse that we just heard from the member for Riverina, is an attempt to paint good Australians as elitists. That is what it is an attempt to do. It is all part of this Boston Tea Party Republican revolt against the elite-Sarah Palin. That is the political appeal. That is the strategy behind it. It is anti-elitist. It is pitchfork-wielding conspiracy theorist. We saw them out the front of this parliament at their carbon tax rally, and right behind the Leader of the Opposition's head was a sign saying, 'Say no to carbon tax 4 UN/IMF global governance = agenda 21 genocide.' Those are the sorts of people who are supporting the opposition. Poor Cate Blanchett. She must have thought that she was back in the Lord of the Rings, surrounded by hobgoblins, surrounded by orcs-these horrible denizens of the political world, horrible denizens of the conservative world, attacking her, having a go at her. The member for Warringah here, the Gollum of Australian politics, clutching his precious ring of negativity, his precious ring of opposition, desperately attempting to extract the last morsels of political gain out of his opposition to sensible Australians, verballing Dr Garnaut-this is the opposition's political strategy. It has to do with good policy in this country. It is all about pandering to foreign extremists like Lord Monckton, meeting with him in private-'Solved! Lord Monckton, your views are so good!'-and then talking about unelected committees. Well, at least they are committees of Australians. At least they are not foreign lords. At least we are not appealing to this weird collection of international conspiracy theorists. All I can say is: if that is really the opposition's strategy, it is not going to work. It is simply a strategy that is designed to cover up their massive divisions, and their divisions are big. On one hand there are the believers in climate change-there are many in the opposition, and they are horrified at the position the party is taking-and then there are those like the member for Riverina who are quite happy to deny climate change, who are quite happy to do anything, who are quite happy to quote environmentalists who put it all on black, who put it all on some technology turning up in the future. If we have a problem, well, we will just learn to adapt as the planet burns and the next generation of Australians and citizens around the world have to deal with an increasingly warmer planet and all the consequences that go with that. They have a strategy that is basically to get through the next election with this policy of direct subsidy, which will cost the nation $30 billion to top-end polluters. If there are no changes in that, by 2050 it might cost the future government $18 billion a year. That will be the 'small investment' the coalition makes-this weird sort of pork-barrelling exercise for the big end of town. This is what the Liberal Party has now degenerated to. Fraser, Hewson and others are walking away from the Liberal Party because this once great bastion of moderation in Australian politics, has nothing become a sort of home for foreign extremists, for bizarre ideologies of world government, and it rejects the influence of sensible, decent, hard working Australians, like Cate Blanchett. We hear the abuse in the parliament of a great Australian actress and of a great Australian actor like Michael Caton-this abuse of good Australians. Why do they have this political strategy? It is to deny the undeniable. We know that a little while ago the member for Flinders said in his honours thesis: … the market system is a preferable regime, as it … ensures that the polluter bears full responsibility for the cost of his or her conduct … We know that the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, said last year: … inevitably we'll have a price on carbon … we'll have to. So the member for North Sydney knows that one day we will price carbon and the member for Flinders knows that we will price carbon. The only people who will not admit it are people like the member for Riverina, and basically they want to engage in appealing to conspiracy theories, listening to foreign extremists, abusing good Australians, purging all reason and good policy from their party and, finally, ignoring the national interest and the moral obligation we have to future generations.",57
150,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, It appears that the discussion has concluded. NA National Cyber Security Awareness Week,58
151,Mr MCCLELLAND,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leave-Yesterday, Senator Stephen Conroy, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, and I launched National Cyber Security Awareness Week. This event is about spreading the message that we all have an important role to play in improving our cybersecurity. The internet is now a part of our daily routine, from sending emails and doing business, to reading the newspaper, planning a holiday or even searching the yellow pages. It has literally become impossible for most of us to imagine surviving a day without using the internet in some way. While the internet has the potential to make our day-today lives richer and easier, we must remain vigilant to our online security. Advances in the technologies we use and the reasons we use them have been accompanied by developments in the number and type of cybersecurity threats that we face. That is why the Australian government has made cybersecurity a top national security priority and has invested significantly in enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities. Our strategy focuses on three key objectives: first, securing our own government systems; second, working in partnership with the private sector; and, third, reaching out to individual Australians to assist them to deal with problems they may encounter. Dealing firstly with the government systems, the security of government systems is important not only to ensure the continuity of services to all Australians but also to protect the personal information of citizens that governments hold. We have established the Cyber Security Operations Centre, CSOC, in the Defence Signals Directorate to provide government with the complete picture of the online security landscape and the capability to respond to cyberincidents. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO, has also established a specialist cyberinvestigations unit to investigate and provide advice on state sponsored cyberattacks against Australian interests. We have also announced our intention to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, the only binding international treaty on cybercrime. The government is but one player; business is also crucial. And that brings me to the second pillar of the government's strategy: working with the Australian business community. The Computer Emergency Response Team Australia, CERT Australia, as it is known, provides a direct link between government and the private sector and seeks to improve cybersecurity for all Australian internet users by developing and sharing information about significant threats and vulnerabilities within Australian businesses, including, for instance, banks, utilities and phone companies. Additionally, the internet service provider, ISP, code of practice requires internet service providers to assist home users and businesses to stay secure online. The icode, as it is known, aims to promote a cybersecurity culture within ISPs and provides a consistent approach among ISPs to inform, educate and protect their customers in relation to cybersecurity. The Australian government have also put in place crisis management arrangements in the event of a major cyberincident. To test these arrangements, the Australian government, along with over 50 businesses and government agencies, participated in last year's international Cyber Storm III exercise. That exercise allowed us to test our preparedness for cyberthreats and to strengthen relationships with business and with our international partners. This means that if something goes wrong, the government and the private sector have drilled and can work together to fix the problem. The government are also taking action to ensure that all Australians are aware of the cyber-risks that they face and that they take steps to protect themselves online. One very valuable tool available to home users is the Stay Smart Online website, which provides a free alert service and information on the latest cyberthreats and how to address those threats. Yesterday, the government launched the new version of the Budd:e cybersafety and security education package. Budd:e provides interactive, selflearning modules for primary and secondary school students, including advice on malware, how to secure personal information online and safe social networking practices. Yesterday, Minister Conroy announced the development of another government initiative aimed at keeping young people safe online-that is, the Easy guide to socialising online, which aims to improve understanding of the risks associated with disclosing information about themselves online or other family members and ways in which privacy can be maintained. I also draw the attention of parents and teachers to another program aimed at protecting children. The ThinkUKnow program has been developed by the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice, the Hon. Brendan O'Connor, and provides interactive training to parents, carers and teachers through primary and secondary schools across Australia using a network of accredited trainers. A particularly useful tool for home users is the cybersafety help button. The button is a free application that can be downloaded, giving internet users, particularly children, easy access to cybersafety information and assistance. The button is specifically designed to provide younger internet users with a confidential means of immediately noting content of concern and drawing it to the attention of authorities. Another important initiative that I launched this week is the second edition of the highly successful booklet entitled, Protecting yourself online: what everyone needs to know. This second edition builds on the first with updates that reflect the changing cyberlandscape. It also highlights new government initiatives with links to resources to educate home users on potential risks and the starting points when looking for help. The publication promotes eight simple steps that can significantly enhance internet security. Those steps include advice to: (1) Install and renew your security software and set it to scan regularly. (2) Turn on automatic updates on all your software, including your operating system and other applications. (3) Think carefully before you click on links and attachments, particularly in emails and on social networking sites. (4) Regularly adjust your privacy settings on social networking sites. (5) Report or talk to someone about anything online that makes you feel uncomfortable or threatened-download the government's Cybersafety Help Button. (6) Stop and think before you post any photos or financial or personal information about yourself, your friends or family. (7) Use strong passwords and change them at least twice a year. (8) Talk generally with your family about good online safety. I encourage all members to read this booklet and promote it within their electorates. It is a good item to include in members' newsletters and I can provide members with additional information if that would assist them to promote this resource through their electorate. The booklet itself is available for download and in hard copy format. I hope members will also take the opportunity to participate in some of the many events that are taking place as part of National Cyber Security Awareness Week. We all have an interest in maintaining a secure internet and members of parliament can play an important part in making sure that all of the community is cybersecurity aware. To assist members, I table a schedule of useful links and contacts on the assistance that is available for their constituents. I now ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Stirling to speak for nine minutes. Leave granted.",58
152,Mr MCCLELLAND,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Keenan speaking in reply to the ministerial statement period not exceeding 9 minutes. Question agreed to.,61
153,Mr KEENAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I thank the Attorney-General for his statement. As he has pointed out, cybersecurity is a top national security priority and the government has the opposition's support in enhancing our capabilities and defences. The cybersecurity challenge is vast. We have now entered the age of cyberwarfare, where one nation's offensive capabilities can paralyse a target nation, causing chaos not only in its military response but in its key economic sectors as well-banking and finance, transport, electricity, manufacturing, education and, of course, government. All are now dependent on computers for their daily operations. There are nations in our region that are known to have such an offensive capability. Of course, such is the nature of the electronic theatre that physical proximity and the problems of supply lines are no longer relevant. Australia's formidable natural defences may as well not exist in an interconnected world-in fact, at a recent computer security conference the whole cyberworld was likened to the North German plain. This nation must therefore commit itself to the task of closing the capability gap. However, it is not just in the science fictionlike world of cyberwarfare that the threats reside. The internet and in-house computer systems are an ideal environment for terrorism, organised crime and industrial sabotage. The threat is not merely that of lost money or stolen information-many private systems are important components of our critical infrastructure, the failure of which could wreak havoc in the civilian population. The coalition strongly supports government efforts to help maximise security for a in critical systems. However, as the government plans to go ahead with their National Broadband Network, it is alarming that there has been little talk from the government about the security risks that might be associated with that network. The Australian Federal Police expressed their concerns in their submission to the Joint Committee on Cyber Safety on 25 June last year. That submission stated: The National Broadband Network is a case in point. The AFP with other Australian Government agencies is working to minimise the criminal exploitation of the NBN. The inherent risk of the NBN is that it could facilitate the continual growth and sophistication of online medical, criminal syndicates' ability to commit cyber offences against online systems due to the attractiveness of the increased speed. Increased bandwidth available via the NBN may result in increased bandwidth available for committing or facilitating computer offences. The submission went on to say: The proliferation of a large number of Retail Service Providers has the potential to increase the difficulty law enforcement has to telecommunications data. The coalition strongly supports the AFP's concerns that security must be at the centre of the NBN initiative as cybercrime rises. Also of concern to the coalition are the increasing cyberattacks on major resource companies, such as Woodside Petroleum, BHP Billiton and Exxon Mobil. It has been suggested that foreign hackers are looking for clues on government and business attitudes to major resources projects and foreign investment, along with intelligence on overseas activity. Malicious cyberactivity is increasing to a point where systems in both government and the private sector are under continuous attack. It was alarming to hear, in February this year, that the security think tank Kokoda Foundation had released a report that concluded Australia is increasingly illequipped to deal with cyberattacks on the nation's energy, water, transport and communications systems. The report states that cybersecurity has become Australia's 'fundamental weakness'. The opposition is deeply concerned, given Labor's cuts to our national security agencies in the latest budget, that the government are not taking Australia's security as seriously as they should. Finally, as the Attorney-General has said, there are problems that individual Australians may encounter in the online environment every day. We are all familiar with online scams, privacy issues and cyber bullying, as well as the serious issue of the transmission of unlawful material such as child pornography and terrorist material. The Attorney has tabled a helpful list of resources available to individuals and businesses. I commend the agencies responsible for the production of this material and I endorse the Attorney's call for members of this place to keep them within our electorate offices and obtain distribute them to our constituents as appropriate. NA Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",61
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The question is that this bill be now read a second time. Question agreed to. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.,62
155,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I move: (1) Schedule 1, after item 4, page 3 (after line 32), insert: 4A Subsection 501(7) Repeal paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), insert: (b) the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment or periodic detention; or (c) if the person has been convicted of an offence and the court orders the person to participate in: (aa) a residential drug rehabilitation scheme; or (ab) a residential program for the mentally ill; or 4B Subsections 501(8) and (9) Repeal the subsections. The amendment will ensure that the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill to strengthen the provisions relating to general criminal conduct under the character test will apply to all persons who are not citizens, not just those who are or should be held in detention. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has opposed the amendment, claiming it will cause chaos in the processing of tourist visas and deny access to subclass 976 visas provided through the electronic travel authority, the ETA. There are some points I wish to bring to the minister's attention. Firstly, it is the government's preference that persons with any criminal conviction, including those carrying a custodial sentence of less than 12 months, apply for a 676 tourist visa rather than a 976 ETA visa. How do I know this? It says so on the government's website. It says: Criminal convictions: If you have had any criminal convictions in any country you may want to consider applying for a tourist visa subclass 676 rather than an ETA. arriving on an ETA with criminal convictions, you could be refused entry into Australia. I concur with the government's advice because offences that would attract a 12 month sentence or less in the UK, for example, include communicating a bomb threat and various forms of assault. It is important that we know about these sorts of things before people come to our country, or at least have the opportunity to know. The requirement to notify a criminal conviction carrying sentences of less than 12 months is also not uncommon in Western countries. For example, it is a standard requirement in both the United States and Canada. In fact, it is also a standard requirement in China, India and Russia. Secondly, the condition to deny a person access to a 976 ETA visa is provided for under the migration regulations, not section 501 of the Migration Act that is the subject of this amendment. Regulations relating to the 976 ETA visa stipulate regulation No.8528 as a condition that must be imposed with respect to the 976 ETA visa. It is regulation 8528 that sets the bar of a 12month custodial sentence for the ETA, not section 501 of the act that is the subject of my amendment. The amendment that I have moved today does not alter the construction of the condition set out in regulation 8528. It will continue to operate as it always has. As a result, the ETA process will not be compromised by the amendment that I have put forward. The minister's objection is a red herring and he should know it. Thirdly, and finally, the character test consideration is a separate issue to the decision as to whether or not to deny or cancel a visa. The decision to deny or cancel is discretionary. Using the minister's logic, every application for an ETA visa should currently be scrutinised under the general If conduct provisions of the test. This is not done as these matters are triaged, as they will continue to be under my amendment. The minister has a problem with making decisions. He has a problem with his discretionary powers under the Migration Act. In the earlier comments I made on this bill, we made it clear that on several occasions the minister had refused to use his discretionary powers and had simply allowed the opportunity to pass him by. Rather than seeking to delegate such decisions wherever possible, whether it is to the courts or his department or, as I just mentioned, just letting it go or just ignoring it, this is an issue the minister clearly has problems with. The amendment that I have put forward would enable the same test to apply to someone on one side of the fence as it did on the other side of the fence. If the minister was of a mind to ensure that we had clear standards about acceptable conduct and behaviour, he would apply the provisions across the board and make whatever consequent adjustments he believed necessary either by a direction under section 499 or by changing regulations to achieve the desired outcome. But, prima facie, what I have put out here today is that that is unnecessary, because the change that I am making is to 501 of the Migration Act-not to the regulations, which is where the ETA is considered and made clear. The ETA position is not affected by this. The minister can conduct all sorts of fearmongering campaigns as he likes, as he has issued a statement in the last 24 hours saying my amendment will bring down the tourist industry. He knows that if this amendment is passed the ETA will operate as it always has. He needs to decide whether he wants to use his discretion under the act to ensure that people who come to this country abide by our laws, our rules. It is his government that abolished the community expectations test from the directive provided to the department's decision makers. It is his government that rolled back the strong border protection laws that have put us in the situation we are now in. It is his government, and this minister in particular, that has refused to use the discretion that is available to him. He continues to obfuscate. I commend the amendment to the House.",62
156,Mr BOWEN,BILLS," I do not intend to detain the House for long, because this is clearly a stunt from the opposition. As I said last night, the opposition's position on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill is that it does not go far enough and it is not necessary. The shadow minister has been saying for weeks, 'We don't need to do this, it is completely unnecessary,' and then he came out last night and said, 'It's not going far enough.' The shadow minister in his contribution has retrospectively fitted his amendment to his rhetoric. In his second reading contribution yesterday, he said that this amendment was necessary because if somebody who was in Australia on a visa commits an offence-and he used the example of Northies or down at the club; I think he used the example of the Coogee Bay Hotel-the Australian people deserve to know that if they are convicted of an offence they could then be deported. What he did not outline to the House were the implications for people who are applicants for visas. I suspect he did not even realise that was the import of his amendment.",64
157,Mr Morrison,BILLS,I just addressed it.,64
158,Mr BOWEN,BILLS,"He is addressing it now, but he did not address it last night. He explained to the House last night the import of his amendment, and he was talking about the implications of this amendment for people in Australia on a temporary or a permanent basis. At no stage did he say to the House that this would have any impact on tourist applications or 457 applications or any other applications. I pointed that out to the House last night and now the shadow minister has gone back to his office and retrofitted his rhetoric to fit his amendment. He probably got his legal advice from George Brandis again-and you always get into trouble when you do that. You really need to get a better lawyer. The member for Cook should show us the problem he is trying to fix. Which tourist committed an offence in another country and then came to Australia and caused trouble in Australia, which is covered by this legislation? Which 457 visa holder was it? Which case is the shadow minister pointing to to justify this amendment? Very clearly the opposition and the government agree that the character test was not strong enough for people in detention. People in detention can impact on government property and can impact on the well-being of Commonwealth employees and employees working on behalf of the Commonwealth, not to mention other detainees. They are very serious issues. There have been a number of instances under governments of this persuasion and under governments of that persuasion where people in detention have committed offences with a penalty of less than 12 months and the government has not been able to exercise the character power. It happened under Mr Ruddock, it happened under Mr Evans and it has happened under me. I have recommended to the House that that situation be changed, and the House endorsed it last night. The member for Cook found himself in a bit of a political situation where he thought he could not just back the government, so he was going to have to look tougher: 'What I do best is beating my chest, so how am I going to beat my chest if I just go in and support the government's legislation? I know what I'll do-I'll cook up an amendment; I'll bring in issues about tourists and 457 visas and all sorts of other things. The member for Cook used the term 'red herring'-if the member for Cook looks in the mirror he will see a red herring in relation to this amendment. It is a stunt and farce and I would invite the honourable member to call a division. If he really believes this is important, there members in the House and he should call a division on this amendment-bring it on, let us have a division and see if every member of the opposition lines up behind the member for Cook. Let us see if every single member of the opposition supports him.",64
159,Mr Morrison,BILLS,The Independents don't support it.,65
160,Mr BOWEN,BILLS,"That has not stopped the member for Cook calling divisions before. We know the Independents do not support him; what we also know is that he is unlikely to get the support of the Liberal party room for this amendment. That is why he is running from this division. If he has nothing to hide, he should call a division. If he is hiding divisions in his party room, then he should not call for a division. I suspect we know the answer-he will not call a division because he cannot rely on the support of every Liberal party room member. We know that the Liberal Party is divided on many issues, and they are divided on this issue because there are several members opposite who think this amendment is a joke-as it is.",65
161,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I note the bluster of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, but he failed to address the issue he raised in the House last night. I flagged this amendment in the House last night and also in the briefing with the minister's department and with his own office, and I asked at that time: why are we only strengthening the character test for those in detention and not for all of those on visas, as currently these applications apply right across the board? There was no answer. They had not thought of it. I understand that last night the minister must have thought of it after that-they certainly had not thought a of it before I raised it-but he did not give me the courtesy of a reply on the issue I had raised with his staff so I brought the are plenty of amendment forward. The amendment deals very specifically with changes to section 501 of the Migration Act. Last night in this place the minister said that this amendment would not work because it would require a complete collapse of the electronic travel authority system, which would destroy the tourism industry. He was even so bold as to talk about my previous time as the managing director of Tourism Australia. He said I should have known this. The minister should actually understand his own regulations and his own act. He came into this place last night and said that this amendment could not be practically operational. Effectively that is what he said. Today in this place, in putting forward this amendment, I have made it very clear to the minister, and I have set it out, that the requirement to consider someone's criminal convictions under the ETA, which effectively would bar them from making an ETA application, is provided for under condition 8528, which reads: The holder must not have one or more criminal convictions, for which the sentence or sentences (whether served or not) are for a total period months duration or more, at the time of travel to, and entry into, Australia. That is where the power is created to bar someone access to the ETA. It is not an automatic progress from section 501 of the act and the character test into that condition. Even still, the minister knows that if he wanted to support this amendment and he wanted the same rules for everyone on both sides of the fence, he could quite easily introduce regulations and he could quite easily introduce a directive under section 499 of the act to ensure that these matters were operational. I am happy for the minister to tell me where these things are out of place. After all, he has 9,000 people working for him in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. On the opposition side, there are a few of us here working together with our staff in our offices, and we have some experience in dealing with these matters, but at the end of the day it is for the minister to be able to come to this place and understand specifically what occurs under the act he administers and under the regulations. I put it to the Minister: if it is not condition 8528 that is the key issue here for the operation of the electronic travel authority, then I am happy for him to correct me; I am happy for him to set me straight. Equally, on top of that, the minister can also advise what changes he could therefore make to the regulations and what directives he could give under section 499 to make sure that they were operational. I am sure he would get support from the opposition to do that, because we are supporting this bill. We are supporting this bill and we will ensure that it passes through this place and the other place. But, in making this point, we offer the opportunity for the minister to ensure that we would be in a position to have this change effected. If the government is not prepared to of 12 support the opposition in passing this amendment then, frankly, there is no point in a division-because it will not go through this place, and I am not going to waste this chamber's time with the government's refusal to cooperate in a bipartisan way with the opposition over something of this nature. The coalition have provided the government with support for their measure. We have put forward a practical proposal which, in our understanding, we believe can work. If the government do not believe that is the case, I am open for the government to actually tell me how this can be made to work at an operational level. But, from what I have seen to date, it would seem that the regulations are quite clear, and changes to section 501 of the act would not impact on the operation of the ETA system. But, even still, if the minister believes it does require changes, I am sure those changes can be made to the regulations or can be made otherwise by the form of a directive under section 499.",65
162,Mr BOWEN,BILLS," I am happy to address the matters raised by the shadow minister. First, the shadow minister raised the question: why the difference? I actually did address that last night, and earlier this evening, and I am happy to spell it out again as clearly as I can for the shadow minister tonight: the changes proposed by the government are there to fix a problem; the changes proposed by the opposition are a solution in search of a problem. The Leader of the Opposition-the shadow minister for immigration, sorry; I am getting a bit ahead of myself: he might be the Leader of the Opposition soon, but he is not yet-has not outlined the problem he is trying to fix. When you bring in a change to legislation it is normal practice to outline to the House what is wrong with the existing legislationwhat is wrong with the character test as it applies to tourists, to 457 visa holders and all non-citizens and visa holders in this country. There are 4½ million applications for permanent and temporary visas in Australia each year. So what the shadow minister needs to do is point out where the problem is that he is trying to fix. In relation to people in detention, the government has pointed out that offences committed by people in detention can result in damage to public property and harm to Commonwealth employees and to people in our care-that is to say, detainees. Of course, there have been a series of events which have shown that the character test needed to be strengthened, that it would benefit from more clarity in being strengthened. The shadow minister, in search of a political solution- which I completely understand as that is his role as shadow minister: to find political solutions to political challenges the opposition-has put forward this amendment. But it is not a solution to a public policy problem-because there is no public policy problem which he has identified. I invite the shadow minister again to show us an example of somebody who has come to Australia, who has had a custodial sentence of less than 12 months at some point in their past, and who has gone on to cause a problem in Australia. I will deal with the matter of ETAs, because the shadow minister has chosen to verbal me-or, alternatively, he has misunderstood. I will give him the benefit of the doubt and say he did not understand what I was saying last night. I was actually pointing out last night exactly what the shadow minister is pointing out: that there is an inconsistency, that ETAs, which apply to people who come to Australia from several countries, would not be covered, and you would therefore have an inconsistency in terms of how this amendment would be implemented. If you came from certain to countries, you would be covered in a certain way; if you came from other countries, you would be covered in another way. This had not been thought through by the shadow minister, with due respect to him. This was a thought bubble, cooked up as a solution to making him look tougher. As a result, he would implement a system which would mean that the department would have to devote considerably more resources or see processing times blow out very substantially for tourists, for 457 visa holders et cetera. I wonder what the tourism industry would think about that. I wonder what the resources industry would think about that. I wonder what industries in search of more skilled labour would think about that. This government has worked hard to reduce processing times for 457 visas and has achieved considerable results, with much for better processing times than in years pastyet we see this nonsensical amendment from the opposition. I invite him to call a division.",66
163,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," In addressing the points the minister has just raised, I will read the statement that he issued today. He said that, under this proposed amendment: … every person with even the most minor conviction would fail the character test, which could result in visa rejection. It is interesting, because every person arriving on an ETA right now, under that class of visa, when they present themselves at the airport, having filled out the bit criminal conviction, can be rejected right there and then. My point about the amendment is that it changes nothing in terms of the normal operation of the department in issuing visas. Whether they are tourist visas, skilled visas, 457 visas, family reunion visas or humanitarian visas, the amendment I have put forward makes no change to the smooth working of any of those operations. But I can tell you what has caused a change to the smooth running of this department: the decision of this government in August 2008 to abolish the border protection regime put forward and run successfully under the Howard government. Since that regime was abolished by this government we have gone into absolute chaos. The cost associated with managing asylum seekers has gone from $100 million a year to more than $1 billion a year. If the minister is concerned about the impacts on the smooth running of the department of government policy changes, or indeed opposition amendments, I would caution him and ask him to look at the record of this government, because that is what has gridlocked this department, gridlocked business visa applications, gridlocked family reunion applications, gridlocked every form of visa application consideration across the full spectrum of what is offered in this country. My office, and members' offices on our side, are constantly having stories brought to them of frustrations in dealing with visa applications-including humanitarian applications, I should stress. Matters have been brought to me by members of the Salvation Army, specifically relating to humanitarian applications that have been delayed and not considered and rejected on the simple grounds that the government's program had overwhelmed by those who had come by boat. That was the advice they got from this about a department. So the minister may want to come to the dispatch box and he may want to say, as he has said in the statements he has issued, that he wants to ensure consistency in our laws-because that is why this amendment has been put forward by the coalition. That is the issue he should be addressing. If the minister does not think there is a problem, if he does not think there is an issue in our community of those on visas breaking the law, if he thinks that every person who comes here on a visa never gets themselves into trouble, never engages in disorderly conduct, never has one drink too many, never engages in assault or never commits any sort of offence, then he should pick up the phone not just to the President of Nauru to fix his other problem but to the New South Wales Commissioner of Police. He should pick up the phone to the New South Wales Police Force, who deal with these incidents constantly. They tell me that they want to see a consistent approach applied to noncitizens. If there were the added sanction-faced by those who choose to act up while they are guests of our country-that a conviction of less than 12 months meant a clear failure of the character test, with the minister then able to deny or cancel their visa, it would be a welcome addition to the measures that are available to those who enforce our laws not just in New South Wales but all around the country. The minister can choose to stay with inconsistency, as proposed in his bill, or he can choose the path of consistency. The path of consistency will not have the implications suggested by the minister. He has not been able to demonstrate that. He has come into the House today with no backup for his claim that this would cause havoc. The only thing that has caused havoc in the been Department of Immigration and Citizenship is the way that this government has dealt with asylum seeker management and refugee policy.",67
164,Mr BOWEN,BILLS," Again, the shadow minister for immigration, the member for Cook, attempts to verbal the government and me. He says that I believe that people who come to Australia on visas never commit criminal offences. I have not said that. In fact, the current regime works. Noncitizens who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment in Australia for 12 months or more are already identified, at the rate of about 60 people of interest per month. That shows that the system works. The shadow minister needs to indicate where there has been a problem which his amendment seeks to fix. That is what he needs to do. The shadow minister has again said that he will not call a division because he will not win the division. I have been in this House for seven years, and I can recall a number of instances where oppositions have called divisions when they did not think they could win-every division ever called in any of the previous parliaments before this one, for example, and several divisions called during this parliament.",69
165,Mr Morrison,BILLS,Get with the new paradigm.,69
166,Mr BOWEN,BILLS,"This is a new precedent. I am sure the member for Cook will let the member for Sturt, the Manager of Opposition Business in the House, know that this is a new rule, that you do not call a division unless you think you are going to win it; otherwise, the House is entitled to conclude that the shadow minister for immigration is not calling a division because he cannot rely on the support of his own party.",69
167,Mr Morrison,BILLS,Don't verbal me; address my points.,69
168,Mr BOWEN,BILLS,Call a division. I cannot under the standing orders. You can.,69
169,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Cook! The minister will not respond to the interjections. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Morrison's) be agreed to. Question negatived. Bill agreed to. Third Reading,69
170,Mr BOWEN,BILLS,by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA Rearrangement,69
171,Mr BOWEN,BUSINESS,"I move: That order of the day No. 2, government business, be postponed until a later hour this day. Question agreed to. NA Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",69
172,Ms ONEILL,BILLS," I am speaking in support of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. In essence, for those who are listening and just picking up this debate which is a continuation from yesterday evening, the matter under discussion is really the provision of flexibility for families seeking an advance their family benefit payments. I am very proud to support this reform because it represents this government's strong and proud record of sensible and practical reforms to the welfare system. This flies in the face of the general criticisms those opposite. They are strident in their false claims that this government has not succeeded with a reform agenda, that positive economic and welfare reform cannot be achieved and that reform cannot occur in this parliament. As the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and the Leader of the House put on the record last Thursday, 26 May, as at 1.30 pm last Thursday the Gillard Labor government had passed 112 pieces of legislation through this House in eight months. This compares with 108 bills passed in the first 12 months of the Howard government. Apart from productivity and efficiency, however, this legislation reveals our Labor government's commitment to improving life outcomes for all Australians. I represent an electorate with a high proportion of young families on low to middle incomes. Robertson is an electorate with a high residential population, many of whom make the daily commute to Sydney or Newcastle. One of my great ambitions as the member for Robertson is to see the level of youth employment and participation increase. I will always seek improvement in this area because sustained and stable employment is vital for young families with mortgages and tight budgets. Quite often these families, some of whom are on a single income, rely on welfare payments when balancing their family budget, and balancing the family budget can be a critical element enabling young people to continue in education and in training. I am also confronted with these concerns when I meet constituents while I am door-knocking through my electorate. This legislation is a on step towards assisting regular Aussies who need a bit of flexibility to manage the challenges that life throws at all of us from time to time. Recently I attended an event named the Peninsula Links Day. This event was organised by the Peninsula Links by steering committee. It was an innovative project brought together by great leadership from our local Centrelink agency. The vision for the day was to link customers, clients and companions to various agencies within the Central Coast. I am proud to represent an electorate where the charitable and community organisations are strong, well organised and have great support throughout the community. This was demonstrated at the Peninsula Links Day where a variety of community organisations were present to meet the different needs of the community and discuss the real and pressing concerns of many of our local families. Many of these local organisations operate on a not-forprofit basis and provide a great support to our local community. This extends to legal services, problem gambling and financial advice, which is critical to this bill. Community organisations and charities can play an indispensable role in providing support to those who cannot afford or access it. But I am not one who believes that community organisations in any way supplant or remove the obligations of the Australian government in providing a strong and efficient system of practical welfare. Whilst I believe that there are limits to what welfare can achieve-and that obviously welfare must be provided efficiently and effectively-welfare must not be determined according to arbitrary ideological factors. of Rather it needs to be able to respond to the complex realities of ordinary lives. Our eyes remain focused on the practical need for welfare to support families. I will now address the second component of this legislation before the House this evening and that is the Healthy Start for School initiative. This initiative will implement a condition upon the family tax benefit part A for parents and carers of fouryear-olds. The condition is that children of four years of age go through a basic health assessment check such as the Healthy Kids Check. This will fulfil an important objective to ensure that children are healthy, physically and emotionally, and also socially healthy when they commence school and that they are prepared for learning. Health checks can also have the aim of helping with the detection of early lifestyle risk factors, delayed development and illnesses. These are varied and include illnesses such as vision and hearing problems in addition to intellectual, social and emotional delays. It has been demonstrated quite clearly that health checks and the guidance that they provide and the opportunities for early intervention and access to support can provide incredibly powerful positive results for low-income families and children being brought up in those contexts. This is in no way meant to criticise parents on low incomes. Income is not an indication of love, or care, or ingenuity or a capacity to manage on a limited budget. This legislation does recognise that in many cases guidance in relation to healthy lifestyles and early intervention is, really, a very important I passionately believe that education is the primary means for enabling patterns of disadvantage to be broken down and to enable more Australians to access and thrive in the mainstream Australian economy. There is nothing to gain by leaving some of our fellow Australians behind. Indeed, it is a core Labor value that a quality system of public education is provided to enable the disadvantaged to access mainstream economic and social life. What we must always understand is that the early childhood years can be the most important in providing the foundations of a quality education and a good life. It is also in early childhood that academic, emotional and social concerns are very easily addressed. I believe that the Healthy Start for School is a fundamental part of this package to reduce disadvantage in our community. It is also much more economically and socially effective to address these issues at an early stage of life. The reforms about which I have spoken are important in terms of giving all Australians access to the opportunities of a great economy. They also provide families with the necessary flexibility to manage their own finances at times when things happen such as the washing machine breaks down or when somebody in the family becomes unwell. I commend the bill to the House.",69
173,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I speak in support of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. There are three main measures here, all in fulfilment of election commitments that the government made. The first measure of better access to family payments with more flexible advance payments of the family tax benefit will improve the lot of 1.5 million Australians. The Healthy Start for School initiative will thing. affect 92,000 children and strengthening compliance child support, as estimated by Treasury, will benefit the Australian taxpayer by reducing family tax benefit payments by $78.6 million as child support payments increase and as people fulfil their parental responsibility to care for their children, regardless of whether they are married or separated. Family tax benefit A and B is an initiative of the Commonwealth government. Family tax benefit A is the main payment designed to help with the costs of raising children. It is payable to a parent, guardian or approved care organisation for a child under 21 years or a dependent full-time student between 21 and 24 years of age. Family tax benefit B is designed to provide assistance to families who have one main source of income including sole parent families with a dependent full-time student up to the age of 18 years. In August 2010 under our election package, Better Access to Family Payments, the Australian Labor Party committed to simplifying and making more flexible access to family tax benefits for unexpected costs such as the TV or freezer breaking down and where people needed to get access to money. It is already possible for people to get to family tax benefit and to get an advance, but we wanted to make sure that this would help families in unexpected circumstances. This is an important reform and it will go a long way to making flexible arrangements that people need as their circumstances change. For instance, in my electorate of Blair, which represents most of Ipswich and the Somerset region, many families, thousands in fact, have been flood affected. Their circumstances are such that they require assistance from social security, and many people lost furniture and household items such as TVs, fridges and freezers. More flexible advance payment of family tax payments would assist those people with these unexpected costs. Many of these people simply did not expect to be flood affected and so the benefits here will assist. The maximum amount of advance payment will be linked to a family's rate of payment and generally a maximum of 7.5 per cent of a family's rate of payment could be advanced. For a family with one child under 12 years of age it is around $312. For a family with two children under 12 years of age it is $625. Overall a maximum amount of $1,000 will apply. Advances will only be approved if Centrelink is satisfied that it will not cause financial hardship. This is a good initiative. It will help my electorate as it recovers from the flood. It means that families will have that capacity to provide for the recovery and reconstruction of their lives. I support it. The second initiative, Healthy Start for School, is a commitment the Gillard Labor government made during the last election campaign. It is a measure for family tax benefit recipients on income support payments. It will make the payment of the family tax benefit A supplement for a child turning four in a particular income year conditional on the child undertaking a health access check, such as a Healthy Kids Check provided on the Medicare benefits schedule or checks conducted by state or territory maternal and child health services. The objective here is to identify whether children have hearing loss or a problem with their eyes, whether they are suffering from some illness or condition, and to treat and identify it early so that steps can be undertaken to give that child every chance in life, to prevent learning difficulties and to make sure that child gets appropriate and adequate medical treatment. I do not resile from the conditionality of this initiative. I think it is important. We want to make sure that children get every chance in life and this is an opportunity to do so. This initiative is helpful to children. It is sad but true that some parents do not necessarily consider that the health of their child is a high priority. Regrettably that is a very common occurrence for those people who are struggling in circumstances where they are under pressure. They might have mental health or psychiatric problems. This does not occur in most families across the country but we want to make sure that even in those difficult circumstances children are healthy and fit and ready to learn when they start school. This can only happen if parents really take that initiative. So the parents need to confirm with Centrelink that the check has been done. The checks are serious checks. They are not simply a tick-a-box thing that someone decides they might go down the road for. They have to consult a medical specialist. It gives the opportunity for parents to get guidance in terms of a healthy lifestyle and what early intervention strategy can be undertaken if a child is suffering from some adverse health condition. This will break down patterns of disadvantage and socio-economic hardship for families. If we can break that intergenerational cycle of poverty and disadvantage, which is so evident by postcode across this country, that will be a benefit from the Torres Strait right down to Tasmania. It is important that children are able to participate in community life, get access to every educational opportunity and therefore provide financial security for themselves and their families by getting a good education. If they are suffering from some form of disability or illness, that needs to be identified early. I support that initiative. I think that is a worthy cause to undertake and it is important that we encourage parents on income support payments to ensure their children receive their health checks before they start school. The third initiative deals with the area of child support. This is a vexed problem for many families across the country. Most people do not get charged with criminal offences, they do not have car accidents, they do not contact the legal system of the country, but many people across the country live in separated households. Their relationships have broken down, whether they have been married or otherwise, and generally children are born from those relationships. What happens in those circumstances is that those children need to will be financially supported. If the parents are not fulfilling their statutory and common-law obligations to provide primary care for their children financially, then the taxpayers take up that cause. That is exactly what happens in circumstances where mothers or fathers fail to pay child support. Child support has been the system in this country since 1989 and is paid under the Child Support (Assessment) Act and collected under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act. There is a formula in place and people should know their obligations. It is very much dependent on the payment of tax and people lodging tax returns. If they do not lodge tax returns it makes it difficult for the child support system to assess how much is payable. Therefore people can make arrangements to avoid paying child support. In my previous life as a lawyer practising in family law I met many people who adjusted their financial affairs to evade paying child support and was involved in literally thousands of cases in courts, family courts, federal magistrate courts or other aspects of the jurisdiction, where I was attempting to encourage people to pay child support and fulfil their obligations. We are trying here to get a more accurate system of payment of child support. We are strengthening compliance. A more accurate default arrangement will be introduced that uses a parent's previous taxable income instead of a low default income-that is two thirds of MTAWE-in cases where they have not lodged a tax return. Sadly what happens is they say, 'I am not going to lodge my tax return', particularly if it is a situation where they see they are going to be paying more child support and be in a higher tax bracket. They arrange their financial affairs in a way that they do not lodge their tax return so we do not get the accurate figure and they end up with a lower default income under the legislation. This amendment will ensure a more accurate child support assessment and it removes the almost accidental disincentive for a parent on a higher income to avoid paying child support and getting a lower child support assessment based on the formula that has been established, the lower default income assessed support. The amendments in this legislation make a difference. This means that people's real income or, more likely, their more accurate income will be used for the calculation of child support and, therefore, they are more likely to pay a higher child support payment. The consequences of that are that we, the taxpayers-the taxpayers across country-are more likely to pay less money to that particular family, as the payer, a male, will pay higher amounts of child support. That is good common sense. It is good that we require parents to take on their financial responsibility for their children. It also adds to the integrity of the tax system by making sure that parents fulfil that responsibility and that all of us pay less taxation payments to that particular family. Again, this is a good initiative. It is another federal Labor government initiative. We have stood up for families. I am also proud to be part of a government that has cut income tax for three years in a row. That has made a big difference. Someone on $30,000 a year is now paying $750 less in tax than in 2007-08. Someone on $80,000 a year is paying $1,400 less in tax than in 2007-08. I am most proud of the fact that we have increased the childcare rebate from 30 to 50 per cent. That has had a big impact in my electorate. Since June 2008, we have seen more than 5,600 local families benefit from the additional childcare rebate payments. There is $3.143 million in additional assistance being paid to people in Ipswich and in the Somerset region as a result of our reforms. Unlike those opposite who, after they came to power in 1996, ripped $1 billion out of the childcare system, we are investing a massive amount of money in the childcare system across this country. We are providing $20 billion over four years for early childhood education and child care. That is a whopping $12.8 billion more than was provided in the last four years of the Howard government. We are providing $16.4 billion to help 800,000 Australian families annually with the cost of child care. We have the runs on the board with respect to families. This budget has of course made a big impact on families in my electorate: 5,600 families in Blair benefited the from an extra $4,200 per child aged between 16 and 19 years under changes to the family usually tax benefit system. This was on top of Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. We have extended education tax refunds to cover uniforms as well. You can see what this government has done with respect to helping families-and not just that, there is $16.4 billion for education. And there is almost a doubling of funding for health. This is after the coalition ripped $1 billion out of the health system when the Leader of the Opposition was the federal minister for health. They capped GP training places and disinvested in the health and hospital system-all of which was vital to Australian families and their interaction with the health and hospital system in order to care for their young children. When the opposition were in power they never had the wit nor the wisdom to make the reforms that we have to help Australian families. We have also invested in our local schools through BER projects: $109 million in the electorate of Blair. Those wonderful projects provided the halls that acted as evacuation centres for flood affected families in my electorate and across the Brisbane valley. Those opposite can carp and snipe and whinge about what we are doing but they are hopeless, helpless and hapless when it comes to Australian families.",71
174,Ms HALL,BILLS," I will start where the previous speaker finished, with 'hopeless, helpless and hapless'. Yes, the opposition certainly demonstrated to us on this side of the House that that is exactly what they are. They have demonstrated their lack of care for families. When the member for Blair talked about health and hospital reform, I could not help but go back to the days when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister and remember the pain he inflicted upon Australians when bulk-billing declined. He constantly stood up in this House and said, with a smirk on his face, that he was best friend that Medicare ever had, while, at the same time, he slashed benefits and undermined the effectiveness of Medicare. It makes such a difference when you have a government in power that actually delivers on the promises that it made in the election. This is a really good-news piece of legislation. I can understand why members on the other side of the House get quite upset when I point out to them how we are delivering for families in Australia. We are delivering in a big way for familiessomething that they did not do. Those opposite took from families and made it difficult for them to visit their doctors, because doctors had stopped bulk-billing. People had difficulty in purchasing their medicines. What we have done on this side of the House is deliver better access to family payments and provide more flexible advanced payments of family tax benefits. A Healthy Start for School is a component of this legislation as well as a strengthening of compliance in child support, thereby making it easier for families. I did not mention at the beginning of this contribution that I was rising to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This legislation delivers to the Australian people and to the people of Shortland. It is really, really good news. This legislation makes some pretty important changes to family tax payments. They are changes that will make it easier for families. This will provide for more flexible advance payments of the family tax benefit. Families need flexibility. Families will be able to receive a larger and more flexible advance of their family tax benefit entitlements to help meet unexpected costs. Anyone who has had children themselves or who has a young family knows how those the unexpected costs arise. Everything is going along swimmingly and the car breaks down, the fridge blows up or the washing machine breaks down. Labor is recognising the fact that there are unexpected events in the lives of families and that not all families have a constant stream in their lives. The maximum amount of advance payment will be linked to a family's rate of payment. Generally, a maximum of 7.5 per cent of a family's rate of payment could be advanced. For a family, with one child under the age of 12, this will be around $312. We all know that, if you have a problem with your car, $312 is a big help towards having that car fixed. For a family, with two children under age 12, it will be $625. An overall maximum amount of $1,000 will apply. Advances will only be approved where Centrelink is satisfied that the advances themselves will not cause financial hardship. There will be one minimum rate for all payment advances, which will be set at an indexed amount of around $160. Some families on the base rate of FTB A will have access to a smaller advance because of their smaller existing entitlements. Families who receive an advance will then have their subsequent fortnightly entitlements over six months adjusted to recover the advanced amount. Currently, the maximum advance is fixed at $324, and this can only be advanced twice a year-on 1 July and 1 January. This is a very inflexible arrangement. As I highlighted earlier in my contribution to this debate, these payments can be used for those unexpected events-the car, the washing machine or the refrigerator breaking down. Unfortunately, for families, those events do not happen on 1 July and 1 January each year. These events are unexpected. These changes are designed to incorporate those sorts of events into a family's life. It is about flexibility and it is based on the needs of families; it is not about an unexpected event happening on 1 July or 1 January each year. The other component of this legislation that I am particularly excited about is the measure that will make the payment of family tax benefit part A supplement for a child turning four in a particular income year conditional on that child undertaking health checks, such as the Healthy Kids Check on the Medicare Benefits Schedule. I have a grandson, who is now aged five. When he turned four, I actually took him to the doctor and he had that Healthy Kids Check. I was very impressed with the health check that he went through. The doctor measured him, weighed him, tested his hearing and eyesight and went through a full medical history of young Sam. After about 15 or 20 minutes he was given the all clear. It was very beneficial. I walked away from there knowing that he was a healthy young boy who could play sport, who could hear, who could read and who should have no problems with his learning. A child who has a hearing deficit, a sight deficit or some other deficit that is not picked up can end up having problems when they start school. The height-weight ratio is a very important index. In this era where we are confronted with an obesity epidemic it is important to ensure that our children's weight and height are right for a child their age and that their weight correlates with their height. One of the biggest problems that we have in our society today is an increase in obesity. That obesity is starting at a younger age, and it leads to chronic diseases such as diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is now being identified and diagnosed in quite young children and adolescents. The Healthy Kids Check is important. If something such as obesity is identified, then the doctor can work out a healthy eating plan, an exercise plan and can talk through the issues with the parents. That can improve that child's health outcomes and, I suppose, their future-the choices that they will have in their life. Because, unless you are healthy, you have so many restrictions placed on you. If you are obese, it becomes a vicious circle. You find it harder to exercise and, because you find it harder to exercise, you do not exercise and when you do not exercise you put on more weight. And so it goes on. By the time that four-year old reaches puberty he or she is quite obese and by the time they are young adults the problem has been exacerbated. I really want to emphasise how important the Healthy Start for School measure is and to encourage all families throughout Australia to recognise its importance and have their child undergo the Healthy Kids Check-not only the children who are covered by this legislation but all childrenbecause it is about their child's future and also about the long-term health of our nation. The requirement in the legislation we have before us applies to families where either of the parents or their partners have been on income support at any time during the financial year in which the child turns four. Income support families who do not meet the new requirements will have their family tax benefit A supplement withheld, as the objective is to ensure that all children have a health assessment. Families who take their children to a health check within two years of the end of the financial year will be able to claim the supplement. This measure is about putting in place an incentive to encourage all families to ensure that their children have this health check. As I have already mentioned, this is vital not only for that child, not only for its family, not only for the community but for the long-term health of Australian society. There are two other issues in this legislation. One is strengthening compliance in the child support system. The current system will be replaced by a more accurate process. Each and every member of this House knows about the issues that surround the child support system and about the issues around compliance. The process that will be put in place following the introduction of this legislation will help with a number of the problems that exist at the moment with child support. The other component of this legislation, one that I particularly embrace, is streamlining the notification process for compensation recipients. This is a measure in the 2010-11 budget which will streamline the process of notifying Centrelink when payments are made by payers of compensation, such as insurers. In other words, if a person is to receive a compensation payment, it places an obligation upon the insurance company, or whoever it is, to pay compensation as quickly as possible. As somebody who has worked in rehabilitation and with people who have received compensation payments, I know just how much of a problem it is if people do not receive the payment quickly. They are unaware of it. They end up with a debt to Centrelink and, as well as that, they can miscalculate or be unable to calculate their financial circumstances for the next 12 months, two years, three years-or however long their preclusion period is-before they are entitled to receive Centrelink benefits. This is excellent legislation. It is a Labor government delivering to the people what, before the last election, they promised they would deliver. This, along with the education tax rebate being extended to uniforms, the childcare rebate going from 30 to 50 per cent, the payments of childcare rebate being made on a fortnightly basis and the Paid Parental Leave scheme, is great news for Australian families. (Time expired)",75
175,Ms COLLINS,BILLS," Can I begin by thanking both sides of the House for their contributions on this bill. This bill brings forward three further election commitments to improve support for Australian families. The 2010-11 budget measure and also some minor clarifications to family payments are introduced by the bill. The first election commitment is an overhaul of the arrangements for advance payments of family tax benefit to better meet families' needs. Families will get a more flexible system, with more scope to choose the size and timing of their advanced payments. The new system, starting on 1 July 2011, will help families meet unexpected household costs such as having to replace a broken-down fridge or a damaged school uniform. Some families may find the new, more flexible system means they can avoid high credit card bills or highinterest small loans. Other families might find they manage their budget better around unexpected expenses like car registration. Families will choose how much they get in an advance payment, subject to set minimum and maximum amounts. The minimum amount will be 3.75 per cent of the maximum standard rate for a child aged under 13. This comes to around $160 as the minimum advance amount for all families. The maximum amount will differ between families depending on their usual rate of payment. Generally, a maximum of 7.5 per cent of that rate will be available for advance payment. For example, if the family is not receiving rent assistance and has one child under 13, the maximum advance amount would be around $320. If the family is not receiving rent assistance and has two children under 13, it would be around $640. A family that is receiving rent assistance would have a higher maximum advance. An overall maximum will apply. This will be $1,000 in 2011-12 and it will be maintained at the same percentage of the maximum standard rate for one child under 13 as in the first year. Families will have their ongoing fortnightly family tax benefit part A entitlement adjusted to repay their advance. Under new arrangements, families will no longer be limited to receiving and repaying advances within two set periods of the year, those being 1 January to 30 June and 1 July to 31 December. Families will be able to request more of their entitlement in advance at any point in the year and the advance will be recovered in the following six months. Importantly, though, Centrelink will not approve advance payment requests if financial hardship would be likely to result. Also, families making repeated requests will be assessed to see whether financial advice or financial counselling will be of any benefit. The second of the election commitments introduced by this bill is to establish a new requirement for income support recipient parents or carers of four-year-olds. This is aimed at giving their children a healthy start to school. Under this new requirement, family tax benefit part A supplement, which is paid to families at the end of the financial year, will become conditional on the kids in these families going through a health assessment. The Healthy Kids Check is such an assessment. A health assessment at this age will help ensure that children are healthy, fit and ready to learn when they start school. In particular, it will help with the early detection of lifestyle risk factors and delayed development, and illness such as vision and hearing problems. The health check will also offer families guidance on healthy lifestyles and early intervention strategies. We know from research that opportunities such as these will be especially important for disadvantaged families, for a good education is so important in helping to break down patterns of disadvantage. The Healthy Start for School initiative will apply from 1 July 2011. Parents will need to confirm with Centrelink that the health check has been done. In exceptional circumstances, the new requirement may be waived-for example, when the child has severe disability or terminal illness. The third and last election commitment in the bill will introduce a new, more accurate process for assessing income for child support purposes in place of the current policy that applies when a parent fails to lodge or is late with his or her tax return. Currently, the child support assessment for a parent in these situations is based on a figure equal to two-thirds of the male total average weekly earnings, a process that often leads to an understatement of the parents' actual income. The new process will achieve a more accurate child support assessment and, therefore, better support for children in separated families by generally using the assessment of the parents' last known taxable income, indexed by the growth in average wages. However, if the current process based on two-thirds of male total average weekly earnings would lead to a higher income, that process will be used instead. In a measure from the 2010-11 budget, this bill will streamline the notification process when payments are made by compensation payers and insurers. These compensation payers and insurers will now need to tell Centrelink before compensation payments are made to compensation recipients or their partners. The new requirement will apply to lump-sum payments as well as to ongoing periodic payments. It will help to simplify the notification process to Centrelink and will help to make sure that people are paid their correct entitlements and avoid unnecessary overpayments. Amendments will be moved to this measure as a result of consultation with the insurance sector. These amendments will avoid any risk of conflict with state and territory compensation laws surrounding grants and payment of workers compensation and will make the new arrangements easier for the industry to manage. The bill currently provides for Centrelink to be notified 14 days before the payment is made. The amendments will allow the secretary and the compensation payer to agree on an alternative period within which notice must be given. Lastly, some minor clarifications within existing policy will be made to several family assistance and child support provisions. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

178,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS," Speaking very briefly to the amendments I note the words of the parliamentary secretary in her summing up speech in relation to arrangements with the insurance industry as to alternative time frames being proposed by these amendments. I simply want to place on the record information provided to me just before I came into the House. I have not had an opportunity to compare what has been said to me with the amendments but I simply place on record that the industry, I am informed, have become aware of what they say is a major flaw in the legislation, with the debate resuming today. One part of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011 requires (a insurers as the payers of injury compensation to notify Centrelink two weeks before making payments. However, insurers have various state obligations to make payments to injured persons in a shorter time framefor example, to pay weekly payments to injured workers within one week or to reimburse out-of-pocket medical expenses within a number of days. The upshot is that insurers could not possibly simultaneously comply with both Commonwealth and state regulations, putting them automatically in breach of one or both regulatory obligations or resulting in unnecessary delays to the payment of income support and other payments to injured workers and other injury compensation recipients. So, as I said, given that this advice was provided to me just prior to walking into the chamber and not having had the opportunity to look in detail at what the amendments are, I seek some assurance from the government that the amendments do go to this issue. If the minister is not able to answer that now then to come back to me after today, otherwise we would obviously seek to have the matter examined in more detail when it goes to the Senate.",80
179,Ms COLLINS,BILLS," I thank the member for Menzies for his contribution. I am advised that these amendments will deal with those issues. In fact, the reason they allow the secretary to deal with it is that the restrictions in each state and territory are different, and so those rules can be applied that relate to the relevant jurisdiction laws. We have been advised and we do believe that this will resolve the matter. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",81
180,Ms COLLINS,BILLS,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 4) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (18:30): On behalf of the opposition, I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 4) Bill 2011. It is a bill, like most tax law amendment bills-you would appreciate from your time in the House, Mr Deputy Speaker-that the coalition will not be opposing. I will take just a short period of time in the House to run through each of the four schedules that comprise this tax law amendment bill. This bill was introduced last week by the Assistant Treasurer. In his tabling speech, which I had the pleasure of hearing because I was in the House at the time, he outlined the government's approach to the four schedules. In the case of most of those they were budget announcements and therefore this legislation to update the relevant tax laws, and in some cases other laws, flows from that. Firstly, schedule 1, as the minister outlined, reduces the quarterly income tax instalments for the 2011-12 income year for those taxpayers whose instalments are adjusted for the previous year's gross domestic product growth. Essentially the amendments reduce that GDP adjustment factor for 2011-12 from the set adjustment level of eight per cent down to four per cent. The effect of this measure, as the explanatory memorandum outlines, is obviously to reduce what would otherwise be the automatic amounts of the adjustment factor. In terms of revenue over the course of the forward estimates, the explanatory memorandum shows us on page 3 that, whilst there is a cost in this 2011-12 year, it is made up for in the 2012-13 year. So essentially this is a timing issue of benefit in a cash flow sense to those businesses, mostly small businesses, in the affected area. The second schedule relates to the lowincome tax rebate and its relationship with income-splitting arrangements. Essentially what this schedule does, and again it was announced on budget night, on 10 May, is remove the ability of minors-children under the age of 18-to use the low-income tax offset to offset tax due on their unearned income. This includes, of course, dividends, rent, royalties and all the other examples outlined in the explanatory memorandum and in the minister's tabling speech. This will apply as was outlined in the budget statements and on the budget press release from the night, and we are told that the financial impact will be $240 million in 2011-12 and $250 million in 2012-13 and 2013-14. Schedule 3 relates to total and permanent disability policies. These amendments in schedule 3 essentially do two things. They firstly enable regulations to be made to prescribe a certain percentage of premiums for certain TPD insurance policies that can be claimed as deductions. As the explanatory memorandum tells us in clause 4, the amendments will also extend the current transitional relief for the deductibility of TPD insurance premiums to funds that selfinsure their liability. The final schedule relates to the definition of reportable employer superannuation contributions. Essentially what this does change the definition of reportable employer superannuation contributions in order to not include involuntary contributions for the purposes of assessing taxable income for the eligibility of government assistance. As all honourable members would particularly my colleague the member for Indi, salary-sacrificing arrangements are counted for the purposes of income in terms of qualifying for these benefits. That is obviously the case with superannuation. But what this legislation ensures is that, in circumstances where that contribution above and beyond those reportable limits is involuntary-that is, it is part of an agreement and it is something where by definition the employee does not have any control or choice-these involuntary contributions are not counted for the denial of assistance in that way. This was not part of the budget. I think it was announced by the former Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation back in June last year, almost a year ago. As I said at the outset, opposition will not be opposing this legislation. I commend the bill to the House.",81
181,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," It gives me great pleasure tonight to speak in favour of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 4) Bill 2011. This bill covers a number of areas which are important for streamlining the tax system, supporting small business, strengthening the economy and restoring the budget to surplus in 2012-13. To begin with, this bill implements the government's budget measures to strengthen the integrity of the low-income tax offset by removing the ability of minors to use the low-income tax offset. This is important because there is evidence to suggest that 200,000 distributions from trusts have increased in line with the low-income tax offset, taking advantage of an opportunity to minimise tax by allocating income to is to children. The low-income tax offset-or LITO, as some people refer to it-was never intended for this purpose. It was intended to assist low-income earners and not to be a tax minimisation vehicle. This measure will merely protect the integrity and fairness of know, the system by discouraging families from splitting their income as a means of avoiding tax. Further, the measure has no effect on the low-income tax offset for work income. Nor does it have any impact on the 660,000 small business trusts that operate in Australia. Small business trusts are a legitimate business tool and we are undertaking a significant review to look at simplifying their operation. This bill also contains measures to assist super funds to transition to a new, better super system. Once again, these provisions are an example of how this government listens to the concerns of the Australian people and the Australian business community. We acted in response to the concerns raised about the potential the difficulties that super funds will face in complying with the law once the current transitional relief expires. This bill streamlines the process for claiming tax deductions for the cost of total and permanent disability insurance provided through superannuation. As it currently stands, if a super fund wants to claim the deductibility for total and permanent disability, it must gain medical certification that an individual is incapable of being gainfully employed. Where insurance cover is provided, a super fund is required to obtain an actuary's certificate to determine the portion of the premium that can be claimed as a deduction. This bill allows a super fund to claim a deduction for a percentage of the premium of a TPD insurance policy specified in regulations. This will mean that super funds will no longer need to engage an actuary to determine the deduction. I would like to discuss this TPD issue a little bit further. I know just from reading about superannuation funds, particularly industry superannuation funds, that there are a number of people who sign up to these funds and yet do not sign up to the TPD element of them. The last time. I checked, it usually works out to be about a dollar a week. It gives a lot of people protection and insurance in the event of total or permanent disability. I would like to use this opportunity to encourage people who are in industry super funds to take up that opportunity of TPD because it is highly competitive. I know it is something that industry super funds have been mounting a campaign on for a number of years. I encourage people, and I encourage the members here tonight to encourage the people in their electorates, to take advantage of the TPD in whatever superannuation fund they have chosen to use or that their organisation has chosen for them to use. Schedule 4 of this bill alters the definition of a reportable employer superannuation contribution to exclude certain employer contributions made for the benefit of the employee which are mandated by some requirement beyond the control of that employee. As it stands, additional super payments beyond the mandated nine per cent are considered part of income when determining a person's eligibility for government financial assistance. This is broader because such payments have the potential to be taken as cash or some other accessible benefit, not just super. This amendment follows concerns that some contributions mandated by law or industry agreement were being considered by the ATO as reportable employer super contributions. As these payments cannot be controlled by the employee or taken out as cash or another benefit, the government believe that these types of contributions should be considered part of income. So we have moved to amend that through this bill. Finally, observant members will have noted that I have left schedule 1 until last. That is because I want to spend some more time talking about the importance of small business and also the fact that this bill has a significant impact on small business in a very positive way. Before I do that, I just want to go back to the super issue. Again, it is of great concern to me. Every week I meet a number of women who are doing it tough in retirement. It is essentially because they have not put enough money away for their retirement. They have taken time out for their babies and have been in and out of the workforce. So I am very keen for women to be aware of their superannuation, to actually sit down and look at their super statements and get an understanding of what they have in there, how much they need for the future and how much they need to contribute between now and whatever age they choose to nominate for their retirement. Then they can plan around that. They can plan to take time off for a baby. They can plan to do part-time work. They can work out when they want to retire and that they may need to do part-time work in the lead-up to retirement. I encourage all Australians, but particularly women, to take control of their super. Understand it, first off, but also take control of your super so that you are aware of what you need for when you retire so that you can work back from there and have complete control of your finances right throughout your working life. As part of that exercise, I am going to be running a series of 'how to read your superannuation statement' seminars later in the year. I have colleagues who are very well versed in that. They have worked for a number of super funds. It will be a free seminar. It will not be telling people where to invest or which super plan they should be using. It is going to sit them down and get them to work through the super statement that they have now and decipher it-explain to them in plain English what it means and what it is saying to them about how much they will have when they retire and how much they may need when they retire if they want a particular lifestyle and, most importantly, how much they will need to contribute till that time. I have seen a number of women who are doing it tough in retirement because they just do not have the money and they did not have the money set aside to get them through. Schedule 1 will also reduce PAYG instalments for the 2011-12 income year for taxpayers who pay quarterly instalments on the basis of the GDP adjusted notional tax method. This will have the benefit of freeing up some $700 million in cash flow for 2.7 million small businesses. It is a significant figure which, as a former small business owner myself, I can attest is most welcome. Small business is the backbone of the economy, constituting up to 96 per cent of all businesses in Australia. This measure builds upon other measures announced in the budget such as the $7.1 million to continue the small business support line, instant writeoff for assets costing less than $5,000 from 2012-13, a $5,000 immediate deduction for motor vehicles and improvements to Enterprise Connect centres and businesses. These measures build on the previous actions taken by this government to help small business in areas such as reducing the tax obligation of small business companies to 29 per cent in 2012-13-earlier than other companies. In addition, the small business support line is helping small business owners access information and referral services, and the program that is associated with that line is helping small business owners to go online and engage in the digital economy. There is also the award-winning website business.com.au which is connecting small business to information about start-up, taxation, licensing and legislation, as well as significant transactions such as ABNLook up, taxation compliance and licence applications. I recently held a small forum-another free seminar-for people who are interested in setting up small businesses, who have got that little bright idea that they have been kicking around for a while and want to turn it into a business but do not know how. The seminar not only took them through the steps they need to take to set up a business but also made them think about a whole range of things that people often do not think about when setting up a business, particularly the fact that they need to spend money to make money. You need to put some cash upfront to get the business going, particularly for your public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance, which can be very significant when you are first starting out in a business. I know that when I first started my small business my insurance bill was probably worth about four months of income. It was a significant chunk and when you have just got going and you have not got cash flow because you have worked for three months and you are still waiting for the bills to be paid it means that you eat a lot of mince. It is a challenge but it is very exciting have your own business once you get going. There are lots of risks and there are lots of moments when you think, 'Why have I done this?' But, generally, the personal and professional rewards are great and it was great to be with these people who were thinking of setting up a small business and sharing with them my experience and the experiences of others in what to do, what not to do and, in a way, pointing them in the right direction. As I have outlined, there are many services and support systems available to support small business throughout Australia at the federal level, the state level and at the local level. For small business there is an embarrassment of riches in the services and support systems they can access. Again, I encourage anyone who has got a small business, wants to expand the size of their small business or is just thinking about a small business to take advantage of these fabulous support systems that the government has provided in a range of areas. I also commend the government for the tax reductions they are giving to small business, particularly to ease up cash flow. Cash flow is a significant issue, particularly when you are just starting, and if you want to make an investment it really does help out with the day-today running of the business. I am sure that will be most welcome. This bill is very important for a strong Australian economy, it is very important for a strong small business sector, it is very important for streamlining the tax system and it is very important to bring the budget back into the black by 2012-13. I commend it to the House.",82
182,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," I rise to make some brief comments on one aspect of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 4) Bill 2011. This bill deals to with amendments to the low income taxpayer rebate and the treatment of income paid through a trust to minors. As has been made clear, we on this side of the House will be supporting this bill, but I do note the manner in which this particular measure was dealt with in the lead-up to the budget and highlight some of the unfortunate consequences of the way that this matter has been managed. I recollect listening to Adam Spencer on ABC local radio interviewing a tax expert one morning shortly before the budget was brought down. There was a lengthy discussion about whether trusts as a vehicle were to be prohibited, and that was a consequence of the media management engaged in by this government on this measure. We were told that there was going to be a major crackdown, and this of course caused understandable anxiety on the part of many people and businesses who use trusts for a range of important and legitimate business reasons. Operating a business through a trust can provide considerable flexibility and it can be of great importance in preserving assets, including for preserving assets to be passed to the next generation. For example, trusts are widely used in primary industry for precisely that reason. What we have here is a government which is grasping for revenue as a consequence of the fact that it has been spending without restraint now for some four years, and it is finding every possible way it can to fill the increasingly large gaps which have opened up. I note with interest that the explanatory memorandum says: In recent years the low income tax offset has increased significantly as a means of providing targeted tax relief to low-income earners. The low income tax offset has been available to all taxpayers with incomes below its cut-out threshold, including minors. An increasing amount of distributions from discretionary trusts have subsequently taken advantage of this concession … I simply make the point that this is an issue which could have been foreseen at the time the low-income tax offset was increased and if it were such a problem it could have been dealt with then. The consequence we have now is that a significant number of Australians will have arranged their affairs in reliance upon the law as it stood until the night of the budget and, in doing that, they were acting perfectly legally. In this government's desperate grab for revenue, what they have obviously done is ask the Treasury, 'What ideas have you got to find other ways in which we can claw in some money, because we are facing yet another yawning deficit in the coming year, 2011-12, of $23 billion to add to this year's yawning deficit of $49 billion and the previous year's yawning deficit of more than $50 billion and the previous year's yawning deficit of over $20 billion.' Cumulative deficits have reached over $150 billion since Wayne Swan has had his hands on this country's financial steering wheel. It is clear that as a result of the urgent desperate desire to find additional revenue to deal with the fact that this government has been spending without restraint, this government has thrown caution to the wind and has driven expenditure up from approximately $250 billion in 2006-07 to $349 billion this year-an increase of almost $100 billion in four years. It is clear that as a consequence of this unrestrained and profligate spending what we have is a government that is desperately on the lookout for revenue anywhere it can scrounge it. So this measure has been included in the budget, and a significant number of Australians who had arranged their affairs in reliance upon the law as it previously stood are now going to be inconvenienced and are now going to have to make changes. They also suffered considerable anxiety in the period leading up to the budget because of the way this matter was managed. There were deliberate attempts by this government to give the impression through the media that it was going to produce a tough budget and then it was going to be a fiscally responsible budget. As we have seen, the budget failed those tests. We were told that this was the budget which would return Australia to surplus. What we know is that the 2011-12 budget does no such thing. It produces yet another deficit following the dismal run, the increasing run, of deficit after deficit after deficit-and we do not in fact get a surplus until 2012-13. It is going to be a mere sliver of a surplus, at $3.5 billion, making almost no impression on the cumulative deficits of $150 billion and more which by that point will have been racked up. It is an unfortunate consequence of this government's chaotic and incompetent financial management that amongst measures they have needed to introduce is this measure, introduced with no notice and and at considerable inconvenience to many Australians who had arranged their affairs in reliance on the law as it previously stood. It is therefore a matter for regret that this particular aspect of budgetary and taxation management has been handled in the way that it has. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (18:57): I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 4) Bill 2011, a bill which amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to the Australian tax laws. The measures set out in the bill before the House today are all sensible measures to continue to improve and maintain the integrity of Australia's taxation laws and to help in the difficult and challenging task of meeting government's commitment to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13. The first of these measures, set out in schedule 1, will reduce PAYG instalments, and I will explain that if I may. Under the pay-as-you-go instalment system taxpayers earning business or investment income pay instalments during the year towards their final tax liability for that income year. This helps taxpayers meet their income tax liabilities and it is important for the effective and timely collection of tax liabilities. Taxpayers may pay their quarterly PAYG instalments on the basis of either the GDP adjusted notional tax or on the basis of instalment income. For the most part, small businesses, individuals, trusts and small superannuation funds pay their instalments quarterly using the GDP adjustment method. The first of the measures set out in schedule 1 will reduce the PAYG instalment for the 2011-12 income year for taxpayers who pay quarterly instalments on the basis of the GDP adjusted notional tax method, by setting the GDP adjustment for the 2011-12 income year at four per cent. Setting the GDP adjustment at four per cent will provide taxpayers with a smoother transition from the two per cent GDP adjustment factor that has applied for the previous two income years as the economy recovered from the global financial crisis. Without the measures in this bill, the GDP adjustment factor would be eight per cent. In other words, this provides tax relief for small businesses. It is a practical measure which will assist small businesses throughout the year by providing what we estimate to be something in the order of $700 million in cash flow benefits. The second of the measures in this bill deals with low-income tax offsets, which will reduce the incentive for families to split income with their children. The purpose of the low-income tax rebate was to provide tax our relief for low-income earners, not to be used as a vehicle for tax minimisation. The measure in this bill removes the ability of children under 18 years of age to use the low-income tax offset to offset tax on unearned income such as dividends, interest, rent, royalties and other income from property. The level of tax for low-income earners has already been reduced by the Gillard government through the doubling of the low-income tax offset from $750 to $1,500, and a benefit has been delivered to taxpayers earning up to $67,500. But, as I said before, this offset was never meant to act as a tax minimisation vehicle. This is an important part of our plan to ensure that we return the budget to surplus and that tax offsets and rebates are used for the purpose for which they were designed. The third measure goes to disability superannuation benefits. It is in essence a measure of simplification. Schedule 3 of the bill contains amendments to streamline the process for claiming tax deductions for the cost of total and permanent disability insurance which is provided through superannuation funds. The amendments in this bill will give funds the option of using a simple method for apportioning TPD insurance premiums with reference to a schedule of percentages in the regulations, without having to incur the cost of an actuary, which is the case at present. The fourth measure is an amendment to the reportable employer superannuation contributions, otherwise known as RESC. The purpose of RESC is to assist in the accurate reportage of income, especially as that relates to an employee's entitlement to receive government benefits or to make certain government payments. The measures in this bill will introduce amendments to ensure that additional employer contributions imposed by an industrial agreement, or the rules of a superannuation fund, will not be reportable employer superannuation contributions defined by the law. The definition of RESC is designed to reflect the fact that these additional contributions could long-term be taken as income, and this definition prevents higher income earners from salary sacrificing a large proportion of their into superannuation and, by doing so, reducing their income to become eligible for government financial assistance or to avoid payment of other requisite payments. The amendments in this bill clarify that contributions will not be considered RESC where they are mandated by an industrial agreement or the rules of a superannuation fund. That is to say, the purpose is to ensure that RESC is only applied to the noncompulsory contributions of superannuation contributor. The fifth issue I wish to address goes to some of the matters raised in the previous contribution, by the member for Bradfield. As I said in opening, the measures in do two jobs of work. First, they are sensible measures to adjust and tweak the administration of our taxation system so that it is efficient and effective for both the administrators and the taxpayers, so that the taxation laws do the work they are intended to do. At the same time, they ensure that we are able to find savings to find the income ensure that the budget returns to surplus in 2012-13 as promised. Our taxation laws are the foundation of our system of financial management, enabling successive governments to fund the services and infrastructure that we all collectively rely on each and every day. a simple fact that there will always be competing priorities for spending measures and that making the hard decisions about those priorities is what characterises a government, a Prime Minister and a Treasurer. It is no accident that this budget has been described as a Labor budget that aligns with the core Labor values, because it is a budget which prioritises jobs and prioritises getting people who are at risk of employment back into employment or re-engaging with the education system, by record investment in income skills and assistance to the long-term unemployed to ensure that, as we move through mining boom mark 2, we do not leave people behind. The second area of priority which defines this as a Labor budget is the record investment of $2.2 billion in mental health. In complete contrast to those opposite, we do not believe that we should be investing in the mental health system by robbing Peter to pay Paul-that is, we do not believe that we a should run down the primary health system to enable us to make record investments in the mental health system. I am like every member and senator in this parliament; we all have our wish lists of local projects for the bill which we seek funding. In my own electorate of Throsby, I know that the National Broadband Network, for example, will make an enormous difference to the lives of those who currently have to commute to Sydney for their employment and will create a great incentive for local business and new businesses to invest in the to region. That is why I cannot understand the intransigence of those opposite-including the member for Gilmore, in whose electorate a trial site for the NBN exists-and how they constantly carp about and criticise the NBN project. Like the member for Cunningham, I It is would dearly like to see Commonwealth funding for the Maldon-Dumbarton rail link, and we will continue to lobby for this project as a long-term goal for the Illawarra region. However, we on this side of the House understand that there are pressing national priorities and that we have to move away from the Santa Claus notion of federal budgets, which is that unless there is a present for everybody under the tree it is not a good budget or not a budget in the national interest. While we do not restrain ourselves from representing the interests of our electorates, we on this side of the House understand that it is the national interest which must come first. Prioritising jobs and mental health is in the national interest. Ensuring that we bring the budget back to surplus is in the national interest, as we deal with the record investment that is coming our way in mining and other industries in the outyears of the forward estimates. I am proud to be a member of a government that has done so much over a short period of time, through measures such as those contained in this legislation, to attempt to rein in government spending, make savings where that is possible and ensure that we bring the budget back to surplus while investing in Labor priorities. That is in stark contrast to those opposite. We saw a typical contribution from the member for Bradfield earlier, where he stood up and criticised the measures in this bill as somehow a conspiratorial tax grab, or some backdoor way to attack family trusts or trusts. We on this side of the House understand that trusts have a legitimate purpose in business, but they should not be used for illegitimate reasons and they should not be used merely as a means for tax minimisation. Indeed, if there is a controversy in Australian politics in the area of the regulation and the use of trusts, the other side of the House, not on this side of the House. We understand that there are some aggressive advocates for taking the axe to the use of family trusts in corporate arrangements Mr STEPHEN JONES: including, as my colleague reminds me, the member for North Sydney. So, if the member for Bradfield is looking for a conspiracy, he should look inside his own party room and not at those on this side of the House. But it was interesting, from the party that lectures us day in and day out about the need to do more to bring the budget back into surplus, that when you listened to the appropriation speeches of those opposite there was not one contribution on how we could bring the budget back into surplus. I will have more to say about this in future speeches. There were millions and millions of dollars in proposed new spending from those opposite in their appropriation speeches. The member for Hasluck made an Olympic effort in his proposals for new spending, and it will be interesting to see whether he gets up some of these proposals in his own party room. We are told they have $50 billion in spending. Well, the member for Hasluck has put a big dint in that $50 billion, I can tell you, and he is not alone. The member for Paterson, the member for MCMillan, the member for Murray and many others have stood up here day after day and proposed new spending measures at the same time as opposing our saving measures. If there is to be a debate about spending and probity in this House, we should not be taking lectures from those opposite. In fact, they need to look closer to home. The member for Bradfield was wont to talk to us about the need to rein in taxation. I it is on remind the member for Bradfield, as I remind all of those opposite, that the coalition government was the highest taxing government in this nation's history. I will finish on this point. Under the Howard government, the tax to GDP ratio never dropped much below 25 per cent of GDP, whereas it runs at 22 per cent of GDP under this government. I commend the legislation to the House.  to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 4) Bill 2011 and commend the previous speaker, the member for Throsby, for his contribution and for some of the things he pointed out. I would also like to commend the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer for his great budget-a great Labor budget; a good, steady pair of hands. It is great to see that is able to steer us back to a budget surplus in only about 13 months, I think it is. It is to see. This bill implements a number of budget measures to reform the tax system. It supports small businesses and generates significant savings for the budget bottom line. The Labor government has provided a steady hand on the nation's finances over four budget cycles. And, despite the toughest global economic conditions we have experienced for 75 years, we have ensured that Australia's fiscal position remains strong. The reality is that we are the envy of the OECD. The federal Labor government steered the Australian economy through the worse global recession in nearly 100 years. In preparing for this speech, I went back to look through a couple of newspaper articles and presentations I had made. It is so easy to forget just how bad things were-the worse in 75 years. If we look back at the early eighties and early nineties, we see that those recessions still had positive growth. I know they were tough times, but we still had positive growth, whereas in 2009 that was not the case. Obviously governments have no miracle cure for all the nation's financial woes, especially those that begin overseas, but we were able to pull the levers that we control to keep our economy strong. The bank deposit guarantee and the stimulus measures introduced by this government kept us out of recession and, more importantly, kept hundreds and thousands of Australians in jobs, as good Labor governments do. Thankfully, we avoided that dole queue schadenfreude that we so often see from those opposite. These measures helped keep 700,000 people in jobs. The BER investments saw new and improved facilities at our schools. I know the member for Robertson, who is in the chamber, is a big advocate of education. he Those investments will ensure better learning opportunities for our kids long into the great future. As any education provider would know, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to provide for our children and also to set us up for an economic future-the high road of economic future rather than the low road of low wages. I see Australia as a service economy providing great service to South East Asia and the rest of the world. The government's investments in critical infrastructure will boost productivity not just at ports and railways; they will ensure Australians spend less time in traffic and more time with their families. I will not go into the NBN; I will leave that for later. Obviously the NBN is also a piece of critical infrastructure. I would particularly like to mention the $300 million in the budget for improvements to the Kessels Road and Mains Road intersection in my electorate. That intersection had been a weeping sore for years and years under the Howard government. I was elected on a plan to solve that problem and the early works are already underway. In fact, I saw some of the traffic lights were already complete when I went through there last week. The tender process for the main parcel of works is now in its final stages. I join thousands of motorists on the southside who will breathe a collective sigh of relief when this congestion-busting project gets underway in earnest. It will cut greenhouse gases from cars that sit idling at the intersection and get commuters home to their families earlier as well as to school work earlier. The budget also delivered a historic investment in better mental health services. Obviously this was well overdue-and I acknowledge that-and it was very well received in my electorate. It is remarkable that these funding initiatives were delivered on the back of a horrific summer of natural disasters. In my electorate, more than 5,200 properties had water over their floorboards, so I know how horrible the situation was and how it is continuing for many people. Thanks to the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, we have a very responsible budget that is still on track to return to surplus in 2012-13. Meanwhile, wasn't the Leader of the Opposition's budget response an experience? My diary said it was going to be a budget reply speech, but I note he steadfastly refused to outline an alternative budget. I am not sure whether the Great Sandy Desert is in the member for Lingiari's electorate-who I note is in the chamber-but in that desert you will find the golden fur marsupial mole. That animal has more vision than the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to outlining an alternative budget! After their $11 billion savings black hole debacle during the election, I can understand why he would want to avoid economics. But the reality is that a budget reply speech, as its title suggests-and there is no mystery-involves a reply to the budget. It is not a diatribe about the fact that he did not quite manage to win the last election. He has to move on from that bitterness and get with the program. The reality is that the Gillard government are here. We have a plan and we are here to stay for as many as 900 days-as I suggested earlier to the member for Indi. She needs to get over calling for an election, because we are here to stay. I understand from the Deputy Speaker and why he would not want to go there again. The Leader of the Opposition does not get the economy and maybe that is why he made that call. But we also had the member for North Sydney responding to the budget at the Press Club and that amazing spectacle where he wrote a letter to the Financial Review. It is like being a teacher-you hear lots of excuses from people as to why they have not done their homework. But this time it was actually: 'The dogs did my homework. It was not me; it was actually someone else that did it.' Unbelievable. Instead of offering a credible economic alternative, those opposite have retreated into an economic vortex. I guess that is why the member for Wentworth is so keen to get his old job back and has been seen heading in that direction. In stark contrast, the Gillard government have a proud record of delivering practical measures to support small business. This legislation will provide around $700 million in cash flow benefits to small business. This bill reduces the PAYG instalments for the next financial year for taxpayers who pay quarterly instalments on the basis of the GDP-adjusted notional tax method by setting the GDP adjustment at four per cent. During the global financial crisis, the government reduced the GDP adjustment factor to two per cent. This rate has applied for the past two years. Without this bill, the GDP adjustment factor would return to eight per cent. Obviously that would be too much of a shock for the many Australians who are still doing it tough-people are still not opening their wallets, though they are consolidating their debt. We recognise that many parts of the economy are still in recovery and small business deserve a smooth transition back to an eight per cent GDP adjustment factor. It will ensure that small business have extra cash throughout the year when they need it most. This bill also allows taxpayers who expect their income to grow by more than four per cent to vary their quarterly tax instalments. This will enable small business to avoid a significant tax liability for the 2011-12 financial year when the final figures come in. This bill also introduces measures to stop taxpayers using family trusts to avoid paying their fair share of tax. In recent years, increasingly, discretionary trusts have been directing income from adults to minors to minimise tax. I understand that this has been perfectly legal-in fact, I know people who have them. But all fair-minded Australians need to ascertain the reasoning behind this past practice and why it should not continue. When we do that, we will see that it is a historical anomaly. The government has increased the lowincome tax offset from $750 to $1,500, delivering tax relief to taxpayers earning up to $67,500. However, while this was intended to benefit low-income earners, it has been exploited by trusts. The tax office aware that at least 200,000 distributions from trusts have increased in line with the increase in the low-income tax offset. This bill amends the eligibility for the low-income tax offset to ensure it cannot be used to minimise tax. It ensures children under the age of 18 with unearned income, such as dividends, interest, rent and royalties, will not be eligible for the low-income tax offset. These rules concerning trusts hark back to a time when only one parent worked and mothersusually-were in full-time care of their children. Australia has modernised significantly since those days and this amendment reflects that change. Importantly, this amendment does not apply to children who work. They will still get access to the full low-income tax offset for work income. This measure will discourage families from splitting income with their children to avoid paying tax, thus making the whole system fairer. Also, it will have no impact on small business trusts operating in Australia. I understand there are more than 650,000 trusts of apparently 12 different types and all serve a purpose. It is expected that this measure will save the government at least $740 million over three years. This bill also helps streamline the process for claiming tax deductions for the cost of total and permanent disability insurance provided through superannuation. The amendments allow the percentage of certain total and permanent disability insurance premiums that is deductible to superannuation funds to be specified in regulation. This will simplify the process and reduce the costs for super funds-good things to do. Super funds are one of the great legacies of the Hawke-Keating government. Finally this bill amends the definition of reportable superannuation contributions to clarify that contributions that are mandated by an industrial agreement are excluded. is Because these contributions are beyond the control of employees, they should not be considered income. This bill makes that clear. This bill introduces significant savings which are good for the budget bottom line and are important reforms that make our tax system fairer. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for introducing this bill and in doing so I commend it to the House.",85
183,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I rise to speak to the House about the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 4) Bill 2011 and I want to focus in particular on the measures in the legislation around the lowincome tax offset. I want to speak this evening about the important role that measures such as the low-income tax offset play in improving participation in Australia. Boosting employment rates is a core Labor value. It lies at the heart of why many of us on this side of the House came into politics and making sure that we do all we can to remove barriers to workforce participation is an absolutely critical public policy objective. The LITO is a mechanism that changes the tax-free threshold for the largest number of people. In 2007-08 the Henry review estimated that 6.8 million taxpayers had had their tax-free threshold changed as a result of the LITO. The full amount of the LITO, at the time that the Henry review was brought down, was available to individuals with a taxable income up to $30,000, beyond which it was reduced at 4c in the dollar. The LITO, which was put in place in 1993-94 at a maximum amount of $150, has been steadily increased under this government. In 2006-07 the LITO was $600 and then in the next financial year it was $750 and in 2008-09 we boosted it to $1,200. In 2009-10 it went to $1,350 and in 2010-11 it is $1,500. The LITO is very much a measure that recognises that work provides dignity to Australian households. Work is important in terms of the income it brings. If you look at what drives inequality across countries, you see that with places like the US it is distribution of wages. There are many working poor in the US labour market. That is less true of countries like Australia. In Australia the divide between rich and poor really is mostly driven by the number of adults in a household at work. So, if we want to close the gap between rich and poor and if we want to reduce inequality in Australia, unemployment is really where it is at. But it is not just about the distribution of income. is also about the intergenerational effects. The Prime Minister has spoken articulately about the value for children of growing up in a household where an alarm goes off in the morning and a parent goes off to work. She has spoken about the simple fact that a child who grows up in a household where no parent works is substantially less likely to hold a job when he or she enters the labour market. It is possible that some of this intergenerational impact is derived from the example of seeing a parent going off to work. Over recent years a lot of other developed countries have put in place negative income taxes, also known as earned income tax credits. That is certainly a policy that I have a keen interest in. It is something that I did a lot of research on back in my PhD days. The closest thing that Australia has to that is the low-income tax offset, and it does reflect very much a recognition in Australian social policy that we have to reduce effective marginal tax rates, that when we have welfare phase-outs sitting on top of marginal tax rates that creates a substantial disincentive to work. Professor Bob Gregory of the ANU did some of the most important work on this, recognising that in Australia the highest effective marginal rates of tax were not paid by millionaires but, in fact, by those moving from welfare into work, who faced benefit withdrawal layered on top of an income tax system. LITO is a response to that. It recognises that we do need to put in place measures that encourage work, both for the income benefits and for the dignity that it brings. One measure that is part of this legislation before us today ensures that the LITO does not become a tax minimisation vehicle. By increasing the LITO, the government has effectively doubled the amount of non-work income that can be allocated to children tax It free. There is some evidence that around 200,000 distributions from trusts have increased in line with the increased LITOessentially households taking advantage of the opportunity to minimise tax by allocating income to children. Let me take the House through a couple of examples. In 2006-07, the effective tax-free threshold was $1,333 for non-work income for minors. When you look at the graph you see a sharp spike in the distribution from trusts in the range of $1,001 to $1,333. In the following tax year, 2007-08, the effective tax-free threshold rose to $1,667 for nonwork income for minors and, lo and behold, the distribution shifts accordingly and suddenly you see a spike in the range of $1,501 to $1,667. In 2008-09, the effective tax-free threshold rose to $2,667 for nonwork income for minors and, yes, you guessed it, the distribution of income from trusts again moves, suggesting that the trusts were taking advantage of this change to minimise tax. LITO was always meant to benefit lowincome earners. It was never intended to be a tax minimisation vehicle. We are putting these changes in place so that children cannot take advantage of the LITO for nonwork income but will still have access to the full LITO for work income. The measure has no impact on the 660,000 small business trusts operating around Australia; it just discourages families from splitting income with their children to avoid paying tax. It is important that we do this to protect the fairness and the integrity of the Australian tax system. It is an important budgetary savings measure, saving around $740 million over three years. I conclude by focusing on the big picture. We are speaking in this House about the importance of jobs. The member for Bradfield has also focused on the issue of public sector debt and so it is important to recognise what would have happened if those opposite had occupied the Treasury bench over recent years. In their book Shitstorm, Lenore Taylor and David Uren talk about the influence of US economists on the Australian political debate in early 2009. They say: On the right, Stanford economics professor John Taylor argued there should have been more permanent tax relief. Turnbull was now firmly in the Taylor school, calling direct payments, like those he had supported in October, ineffective 'cash splashes'. Taylor argued that the temporary measures do little to stimulate demand because if people know a payment is a one-off they are more likely to save it and less likely to spend it, whereas across-the-board permanent tax cuts would encourage more spending because people knew they could count on the extra cash. His slogan was that the government policy should follow the three Ps-permanent, persuasive and predictable. It was an argument Turnbull embraced. If those opposite had been in power, the effect of putting in place permanent tax cuts in the 2008 to 2009 period would have been that we would not have been able to get the budget back into surplus. We would have locked in substantial tax cuts rather than the timely, targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus which the Labor government put into place. That timely, targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus saved around 200,000 jobs. They may sound like statistics to those of us here, but each of those is a life that is not blighted by the impact of unemployment. Each of those is a career that is not scarred by spending time out of the labour market. Many of those are mums and dads whose households never felt the effect of unemployment. It is that human effect of unemployment that is so easily discounted sometimes by those opposite. I graduated from high school in 1990-not a good year to leave school because of the impact of the early 1990s recession. There is good research on the impact of recessions on workers' careers. You can still see that scarring effect a decade on. By putting in place timely, targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus, the Labor government ensured that those jobs were saved, that the impact of unemployment did not blight so many careers. Because we did this in such a way that the fiscal stimulus could be withdrawn, we ensured that we were able to bring the budget back into surplus. Australian public sector debt is extraordinarily low by OECD standards. Many developed countries now have debt levels well over half their annual GDP, some of them well over the total value of their annual GDP. By contrast, Australian public sector debt is well below one-tenth of our annual GDP. By contrast, the typical household carries debt loads that are often many times their household annual incomes. Looked at from that perspective, Australian public sector debt is low and manageable. The government will bring the budget back into surplus in 2012-13 as expected, and in a way that would not have been possible had the prescriptions that the member for Wentworth was pushing in early 2009 been realised. It is interesting, though, to look at what the member for Wentworth would have done in light of some correspondence to the letters page of the Australian Financial Review this week. The member for North Sydney decided that it was important to write in and correct Australian Financial Review readers. He said: This article claims my budget address at the National Press Club was light on detail, yet to mention it was a collaborative effort with the Coalition economic team, including Tony Abbott, Andrew Robb and other senior policymakers. That recognises that there is very little of policy substance on the other side of the House. The member for North Sydney then went on to compare his own performance as shadow Treasurer with that of the member for Wentworth. Neither performance, though, stands up against what Labor has delivered since coming to office. As in the climate change debate, we listened to mainstream economics. We recognise that Keynesian economics tells you what to do when a global financial crisis beckons. It tells you to act quickly. Australia's fiscal stimulus was quick out of the blocks, faster than virtually any other developed country, with our household payments being delivered before Christmas 2008. We also used the opportunity to invest in muchneeded infrastructure, in roads projects and in school infrastructure to improve educational outcomes in Australia. But we also put in place stimulus that could be wound back because, as the Treasurer said, if you are Keynesians in the downturn you also have to be Keynesians in the upswing. You have to recognise that, just as government has a role to play in stimulating the economy and ensuring those 200,000 jobs are kept, it also has a role in ensuring that, as private sector demand expands, we step back, particularly in those areas where we are competing with the private sector. We continue with productivity-raising investments, such as the National Broadband Network and investment in trades training centres, better universities and better skills. But, where we are competing with the private sector, we step back. Those opposite are in utter disarray. They are a Dad's Army team when it comes to fails economics. In today's Age Michelle Grattan states: It is believed Mr Abbott recognises that Mr Turnbull would be the stronger shadow Treasurer but the post would give him a greater platform to advance his leadership ambitions. So, the Leader of the Opposition does not intend to have a reshuffle. The member for North Sydney believes he outperforms the member for Wentworth; the member for Wentworth believes he outperforms the member for North Sydney. The Leader of the Opposition does not know which side to take, and Australians are left wondering whether there is anyone competent on the other side of the House-anyone who wants to focus on the big, long-term challenges facing the Australian economy. I commend the bill to the House.",92
184,Mr SYMON,BILLS," It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Fraser, although his memories of the 1990s recession are probably a bit different from mine. I left school a few years before he did and, up until the 1990s, I had been in full time work. But due to the downturn I spent quite a bit of time looking for work. Those sorts of things obviously do play a part in your life, and they stay with you. Anyone who has been through that sort of downturn should never forget the effect, because it is real and so many people are affected in different ways. Tonight I am here to speak on Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 4) Bill 2011, and in particular I will direct my comments to the first two schedules of the bill. Schedule 1 sees the implementation of the government's budget measure that will provide cash flow benefits to small businesses, individual investors and other eligible taxpayers. Under the pay-as-you-go instalment system, taxpayers earning business or investment income pay instalments during the year towards their final tax liability for that income year. This helps taxpayers meet their income tax liabilities and is important for the effective and timely collection of that tax. At the advent of the global financial crisis, the federal Labor government implemented a number of measures to protect our economy and assist taxpayers. One of these measures was the introduction of a two per cent gross domestic product adjustment factor to payas-you-go instalments, and it has applied for the last two income years. The 2011-12 income year was to see the GDP adjustment to PAYG, using the formula of the Taxation Administration Act of 1953, go to eight per cent. The common-sense measure in this bill to smoothly transition to four per cent instead of two per cent-that is, from two to four per cent instead of up to eight per cent-is welcome as our economy recovers from the global financial crisis. It provides a transitionary measure to help the many local small businesses not only in my electorate of Deakin but right across Australia. It is always great to be able to talk about a local business in this place. Michael and Linda are the hard working owners at Mishou's cafe in Mitcham and they know the challenges of owning a small business. They work particularly hard, making coffees and lunches not only for the passing trade but also for the many offices and workers in Mitcham, which is where my electorate office is based. Certainly my staff are some of their best customers. It is good to support local businesses such as Mishou's. Measures like this will make a real difference to business people like them, and their bottom line is important. Even though things are not all that bad in Australia compared to the rest of the world, not everything is back to the way it was. Local businesses will tell you that only two or three years ago their trade was so much higher and, although they have got some of that business back, it has not all returned. For them, a smooth adjustment is necessary. Cash flow benefits from measures such as this are important now but overall, of course, there will be no net cost to the Commonwealth because over the forward estimates these measures will cancel each other out. What is put forward one year is uplifted later on. The amendments contained in this bill do not reduce the income tax liability of the businesses and taxpayers affected by the measure but merely change the timing of those tax payments. They will also provide eligible taxpayers with a smoother transition from the two per cent GDP adjustment factor that applied for the previous two income years to the proposed four per cent as the economy recovers from the global financial crisis. There will be a reduction in tax collections of $700 million for the 2011-12 income year, which will be offset by a reduction in tax credits of $700 million 2012-13 income year It is also important to mention that a small number of taxpayers whose 2011-12 income year commenced before 1 April 2011 have already started paying their instalments for 2011-12 based on a two per cent adjustment factor. They will continue to pay quarterly instalments for the 2011-12 income year on that basis. I am sure that most people would agree that it would be potentially disruptive and confusing if this small group had to change to the four per cent rate part way through the year. I will also speak about the second schedule of the bill, which refers to the low-income tax offset. In recent years the low-income tax offset has increased significantly as a means of providing targeted tax relief to low-income earners, helping those who need it most. The lowincome tax offset has doubled from $750 to $1,500. These measures deliver a benefit to taxpayers earning up to $67,500. The lowincome tax offset has been available to all taxpayers with incomes below the cut-off threshold, including minors. The support of successive Labor governments for the lowincome tax offset has provided an essential means to help working Australians who earn less than the average wage. This bill will implement the government's budget measure to remove the ability of minors to use the low-income tax offset to offset tax due on their unearned income, such as dividends, interest, rent, royalties and other income from property. It is important to note that the measure applies to unearned income rather than earned income. For children under the age of 18, the low-income tax offset will still be available to reduce tax payable on income earned from work, whether that be a paper round, part-time work in a shop, an apprenticeship or similar. In recent years, increasingly, distributions from discretionary trusts have taken in the advantage of low-income tax offset concessions to direct an ever-larger amount of income from adults to minors as a means of minimising tax. There has been a significant spike in the movement of money from discretionary trusts around the exact point where the effective tax-free threshold for minors has applied in each recent tax year. This spike has moved broadly in accordance with increases in the effective tax-free threshold for minors, and I think the figures speak for themselves. In 2006-07, when the effective tax-free threshold for non-work income for minors was $1,333, there were nearly 200,000 distributions very close to that level. In 2007-08 the effective tax-free threshold relating to non-work income for minors rose to $1,667. That is very close to where this number of 200,000 distributions landed that year. In 2008-09 the effective tax-free threshold for non-work income for minors rose to $2,667, and guess what? This group of nearly 200,000 distributions from trusts to minors neatly landed very close to that new level of $2,667. Of course these distributions were merely maximising the tax benefit of the lowincome tax offset for unearned income, and it is obvious that many people have taken the full advantage of that provision. However, the advantage has gone to those families that have had the financial resources to set up a trust, and it would be fair to say that many wage earners are either unaware of or cannot afford to follow that course of action. I do not believe that the low-income tax offset was set up to be an opportunity well-off to minimise tax. Providing incentives for families that can afford it to split income with their children has created the effect of this use of the low-income tax offset. The low-income tax offset should be seen as what it really is: a helping hand from government for those workers in our society who for whatever reason are on lower incomes and need some assistance. This may be because they have a low-paying job or work part time or casually, or because they have not even been employed for a full year. There can be many reasons people's incomes are not as high as they had expected. Or maybe they never had the opportunity. As I said, the low-income tax offset provides benefit for those on lower incomes. The effect of this amendment is to discourage families from splitting income with their children to avoid higher tax rates, effectively using their children to avoid paying tax. This is a common-sense amendment to the act and returns the intent of the low-income tax offset to that of helping those who need it most. It does not change the treatment of earned income through work by minors, such as by apprentices or those who have left school to enter the workforce. It also protects the unearned income of minors who are orphans or disabled. As the government promised, the budget is set to return to surplus by 2012-13. It is savings such as these that the government has worked hard to find. This measure provides a budget savings amount of $740 million over the three years to 2014-15. This amendment does not set out to disadvantage but sets out to create more fairness in our tax system. It removes the opportunity for taking advantage of loopholes that the public constantly call on their representatives to take away. On that note, I commend the bill for the to the House.",96
185,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS," I take this opportunity to thank all those members who contributed to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 4) Bill 2011. Schedule 1 of the bill reduces quarterly income tax instalments for the 2011-12 income year for those taxpayers whose instalments are adjusted for previous years' gross domestic product growth. This is called the GDP adjustment method of working out instalment amounts. The great majority of taxpayers who are required to pay quarterly instalments use this method, including most small businesses plus individual investors and small superannuation funds. The amendments reduce the GDP adjustment factor for the 2011-12 income year from the default, which would be eight per cent, to four per cent. This delivers small businesses and the other taxpayers using the GDP adjustment method a $700 million cash flow benefit in the 2011-12 income year. This will provide eligible taxpayers with a smoother transition from the two per cent GDP adjustment factor that the government had applied for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 income years as the economy recovered from the global financial crisis. This measure is part of the government's package of measures to improve the cash flow of small businesses and simplify their tax affairs. Those measures include the instant asset write-off for any asset costing less than $5,000, an immediate deduction of up to $5,000 for motor vehicles and a reduction in the small business company tax rate to 29 per cent. Schedule 2 reduces the incentive for families to split income with their children, therefore protecting the integrity and improving the fairness of the income tax system. These amendments will remove the ability of children under 18 years of age to use the low-income tax offset to offset tax due on their unearned income, such as dividends, interest, rent and royalties. Since coming to office the government has increased the value of the low-income tax offset to provide tax relief to low-income workers. Increases in the low-income tax offset have, however, increased the amount of income that can be allocated to children tax free. These increases have been accompanied by increased distributions of income to children, especially from discretionary trusts. The low-income tax offset was never meant to act as a tax minimisation vehicle. Importantly, children will still be able to use the low-income tax offset to reduce tax payable on their income from work. This measure is one of those announced in the budget that will contribute to returning the budget to surplus by 201213. Schedule 3 amends the tax laws to allow the percentage of certain total and permanent disability insurance premiums that is deductible for superannuation funds to be specified in the regulations. This will streamline the process for claiming tax deductions for the cost of TPD insurance provided through superannuation. The regulations containing the prescribed percentages will be developed following consultation with industry. The cost of TPD insurance provided through superannuation is deductible to the extent the policies provide cover, which is consistent with the definition of disability superannuation benefit in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Superannuation funds are required to obtain an actuary's certificate to determine the deductible portion of the premium if broader insurance cover is provided. The amendments in the schedule will reduce costs to superannuation funds in complying with the law by avoiding the need to engage an actuary to determine the deductible portion of premiums in many cases. The government introduced transitional provisions in 2010 which were designed to allow time for the industry practice of deducting the full cost of broader disability insurance policies to be brought into alignment with the operation of the law. During the transitional period, which covers the income years 2004-05 through to 201011, superannuation funds can deduct the cost of broader types of disability insurance cover. These amendments extend this transitional relief to funds that self-insure their liability to provide disability benefits. Schedule 4 amends the definition of reportable employer superannuation contributions, or RESC. Additional contributions to super that are mandated by an industrial agreement or the rules of a super fund will no longer be considered income when determining a person's eligibility for government financial assistance. It was never the government's intention that such contributions be reportable employer superannuation contributions, so the amendment will be retrospective to July 2009 when the definition of reportable employer superannuation contributions first came into force. The bill deserves the support of the parliament, and I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",98
186,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,99
187,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011. The bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 to limit the application of the parenting payment transitional arrangement so that recipients are covered by the transitional arrangement only for children who were in their care before 1 July 2011. The Gillard Labor government seeks to amend section 500D(3) of the act to provide that a child cannot be a parenting payment child of a person under that section unless the person was the principal carer of the child on or before 30 June 2011. We all too quickly forget that it was the Howard-Costello government which, in July 2006, introduced substantial reform to reduce the age of a person's dependent child, above which the person ceased to qualify for a parenting payment, from 16 years for their youngest dependent child to eight years for single parents or six years for couples. Those who immediately before 1 July 2006 were in receipt of a parenting payment were grandfathered, grandmothered, under the act and could continue to qualify for a parenting payment until their youngest child turned 16. It is appropriate at this point to turn attention to the notion of real reform. This grandfathering of the eligibility of existing parenting payment recipients is called the parenting payment transitional arrangement and is given effect in subdivision AA of division 1 of part 2.10 of the act via the definition of parenting payment child in section 500D(3). In basic terms, under current legislative arrangements a parenting payment transitional arrangement can continue to be paid to a person indefinitely while a person who was in receipt of the payment on 30 June 2006 continues, to use the words of the legislation, to acquire dependent children. For example, if a person is covered by the parenting payment transitional arrangement on 1 March 2011 when they give birth to a new child, that new child could be their parenting payment child until he or she turns 16 on 1 March 2027 and be covered by the parenting payment transitional arrangement for that whole time. Through its recent, self-proclaimed Labor budget, Labor has decided that a child cannot become a parenting payment child of a person for the purposes of the parenting payment transitional arrangement after 30 June 2011, although they will still be a parenting payment child until they turn six or eight. Labor argues that this will remove an unintended inequity. The practical effect of these changes is that they will limit the ability of parenting payment recipients to extend their grandfathered status by acquiring new parenting payment children. Any subsequent children that come into the recipient's care will not be covered by the grandfathering provisions. This will mean that all parenting payment recipients will be treated equally in a shorter time frame than or would otherwise be the case. This bill was referred for inquiry and the coalition will carefully consider the report of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee, due for release on 14 June this year. As I pointed out earlier, Labor are quick to ignore the coalition's 2006 reforms. They are quick to ignore that more than 100,000 Australians have come off parenting payment (single) and (partnered) since July 2006. Indeed, in 2005 there were approximately 618,000 people in receipt of the parenting payment. By 2010 that number had reduced to 459,000-a reduction of 160,000 people on the parenting payment as a result of the reforms which the Howard government introduced, and I was the minister at that stage in 2006. It was the coalition who pursued and who delivered significant social security reforms for this country. Labor have not given the coalition any credit for the reforms, other than by imitation through weak and directionless attempts to replicate real welfare reform in the guise of trials, reviews and of course more rhetoric. Let me go back. In 2005 Labor were scathing of welfare reforms. They were scathing of reforms to parenting payments. Senator Wong from the other place said: These laws allow the creation of a working poor in Australia. And she said: Let us be clear about this: these are the drastic changes this country has seen in social security in decades. They will make hundreds of thousands of families worse off. She could not have been further from the truth, as we look back on what were some of the most effective and important social security reforms in recent history-real reforms, not Labor type pretend reform. Senator Evans in the other place said at the time: The so-called welfare reform package is confused, fails to meet the government's own objectives, increases disincentives to move from welfare to work, is manifestly unfair and is not reform but, in large part, punishment of those income support. In concluding, this is another missed opportunity for real social security reform. Back in 2005, the member for Jagajaga, now the minister, said Labor opposed the welfare to work measures 'because Australia needs real welfare reform'. Well, now she is the minister and while she loves talking about reform we all now know that it is just, unfortunately, regrettably, mere talk. We need real action, not inaction. Labor are not prepared to make the tough decisions. They are not prepared to do the hard yards. Theirs is a government based on spin and slogans and it is time they brought some real plans",100
188,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, I have given a fair bit of latitude and I would really like you to come back to the bill before the House. This is not an appropriations speech.,101
189,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS,"Indeed, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is time they brought some real plans for welfare reform to the table beyond what is in this bill. If history is anything to go by, the next policy announcement I make will become Labor policy soon after, like our mutual obligation announcements from 2010. The coalition will not oppose this bill.",101
190,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I speak most in support of the Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011. This is a good piece of legislation because it is about making sure that people have the benefit of equity and equality with respect to their arrangements. It is part of our broader framework in terms of learning or earning and getting people off welfare into work. It is about making sure that we give people an incentive to do so. We are unapologetic about the fact that there is a carrot and stick approach as well in what we are doing in social security. This bill will amend the Social Security Act 1991 so that only those children who are born to or come on into the principal care of their parent before 1 July 2011 will count towards the grandfathered status of the parenting payment recipient. Under the Welfare to Work reforms, the eligibility for parenting payment was changed so that recipients who claimed the payment from 1 July 2006 ceased to be eligible once the recipient's youngest child turned 16 if the recipient was partnered, or eight years of age if the recipient was Prior to these changes, the eligibility of parenting payment ceased when the child turned 16 years of age. Existing parenting payment recipients on 1 July 2006 are covered by the transitional grandfathering arrangement, whereby they continue to be assessed under the previous rules and if their circumstances change may remain eligible for the payment until the youngest child turns 16 years of age. So it is about making sure that people are treated similarly. The amendment in this bill will limit the grandfathering transitional arrangement so that only children who are born to or come into the principal care of the parent before 1 July 2011 will count towards the grandfathered status of the parenting payment recipient. This is a matter of equity. It is also a matter of encouragement. It is a matter of a stick in many ways as well. I cannot let the previous speaker get away with saying some of the things he did. He talked about ducking the hard yards. This government did not duck the hard yards. We were faced with the global financial crisis, with what the Treasury said would be 200,000 jobs lost. There are 1.5 million Australians working in the retail sector and 250,000 Australians working in the construction sector. What did we do? We made sure that those jobs were secure. We took a temporary, targeted and timely approach, going into deficit but making sure that by way of our Keynesian response we kept people in employment. I cannot count the number of times that people told me they had jobs as a result of the BER projects, the infrastructure projects. We saw many people get a start, getting off welfare and into work-young people, apprentices, people who had opportunity, people who had in part been recipients of parenting payment and other social security payments who actually got jobs as a result of what we were doing. I single. visited Bremer TAFE at Bundamba in my electorate, which received $2 million under our payments-opposed, of course, by those opposite-to improve the campus to make sure that single mothers, young people and older people could take the opportunities in their lives to get off welfare. Many people there were single mothers. There was a childcare facility there where they learned responsibilities and parenting skills. They were given opportunities. There were also arrangements where people could learn skills, trades, English and computer skills. We put the money into Bremer TAFE, opposed by those opposite. That is our idea of getting people off welfare into work. We have given a record amount of money for higher education. We heard people opposite talk about the fact that they were the great reformers on social security. The member for Menzies was talking about that. But I will tell you something. Their idea of social security reform not just in the family life of people but in the working life of people was to impose Work Choices on the higher education sector, whether it was Bremer TAFE or the University of Queensland at St Lucia or Ipswich. That was their idea. They feign concern. They say that they are for reform with respect to social security and family payments. They say that they are in favour of helping those in need. Yet their action within government was to oppose real reform, and their own reform was more a matter of punishing those who were poor, weak, oppressed or disadvantaged, such as migrants. We see it every day not just by their actions but by their language. We see it in question time. There is a harshness, brutality, meanness and dispiriting anger that those opposite keep showing towards those on welfare, those who are poor and those who are suffering. There is a real born-to-rule mentality and it comes through from the member for Menzies and all those opposite in the way they go on in this place. Even the Nats do it.",101
191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Blair is also stretching my patience on the relevance rule. Many people may have forgotten but you need to be relevant to the bill.,103
192,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS,"This legislation is important. It is the first of many changes to the eligibility of groups of parenting payments. This is important. This is aligning rules to different recipients and ensuring over time the same rules apply to each person. I believe fundamentally that the laws and the social security payments and payments that people receive should be the same. They should be eligible regardless of where they live or what their circumstances are. These amendments form part of a broader package, as I was referring to before-the Building Australia's Future Workforce package. It is a $3 billion initiative that we put into this budget. We are encouraging participation in work and other activities across the electorates in this country. In my electorate, we have seen it through the local employment coordinator, Samantha Wilson, and the work that her group does. The work that groups like those have done to get people off welfare and into work has been fantastic. Great organisations Apprenticeships Queensland, WorkVentures, Bremer TAFE and the University of Queensland Ipswich campus are important to get people from welfare into work. This budget that this legislation forms part of sees $1.75 billion in funding payments to the states for vocational education and training. We have never seen anything like that from those opposite. Do not let the member for Menzies come in here and lecture us about moving from welfare to work, because their record does not show keenness for work, only keenness for Work Choices. They are not interested in the welfare of the Australian people; they are interested in the welfare of the Liberal and National parties.",103
193,Mr WYATT,BILLS," I just want to say to the member for Blair that, given the pathway I have walked in life, I do not find his comments applicable. I rise today to support and contribute to the debate on the amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 limiting the application of the parenting payment transitional arrangement. I acknowledge Senator the Hon. Chris Evans for proposing the amendments, which I support. The bill forms part of wider reforms in the Building Australia's Future Workforce 201112 budget package released earlier this month. If passed, the amendments contained in this bill will come into effect as of 1 July 2011. The bill will amend the act to tighten existing arrangements on the grandfather clause which allows parents covered under the clause to continue to receive parenting payments for any child born before 1 July 2011. This amendment is about equity and ensures all Australian families are on an even playing field in respect to parenting payments. This amendment is an important one and ensures that all the parents in the electorate of Hasluck are given the same like level of benefits, as they deserve. It applies further amendments to the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Act 2005 introduced by the previous Howard government. The coalition agrees that government needs to do more to encourage sections of the community to re-enter the workforce or take that step for the first time. It is held belief of the coalition that work is the best form of social security and its benefits far outweigh the obvious financial ones. This belief underpinned the previous amendments put forward by the Howard government. I launched the Green Jobs Corps in Forrestfield, which is in my electorate of Hasluck, earlier this year. It is a 20-week environmental training program that offers young people, aged 17 to 24 years, a combination of work experience, skill development and accredited training to ensure they are ready for employment in emerging green and climate change industries. In talking to them, I asked them why they had not taken other pathways and they said that this gave them the opportunity to enter into the working arena and, from that, they were looking at pathways that they might consider at the end of their training. At the last election the coalition had a suite of policies designed to encourage and reward more Australians to enter or return to the workforce. The coalition planned to introduce a job commitment bonus to encourage young Australians who had been out of work for lengthy periods to take a job and commence a pathway back into the workforce. The proposed additional incentives would encourage these people to stay in work beyond two years. A reallocation allowance was proposed if unemployed jobseekers moved to a regional area to take up a position. Employers would have been rewarded for employing an eligible jobseeker. Our older Australians who have a lifetime of experience, corporate knowledge and skills would have benefited from the $3,250 seniors employment incentive payment for employers that hired mature workers aged 50 or older. Australia finds itself in a unique geopolitical position in the 21st century. The rise of China, a burgeoning India and a longgrowing ASEAN economies will place huge demands on our workforce in the coming years and it is a government's responsibility to ensure that its people are as best placed as possible to take advantage of this growth. Australian governments have an obligation to build Australia's workforce and strengthen our domestic employment market. The availability of jobs is one of the most important issues to my constituents in Hasluck and I suspect that it would be the same for many other electorates. Hasluck suffers from one of the highest levels of unemployment in metropolitan Western Australia and there are many efforts underway to improve this situation by encouraging small business and giving people the skills they need to enter the workforce. I want to refer to initiatives that encourage young people to acquire the skills which enable them to access employment opportunities. The Catalyst Clemente university education program, driven by Mission Australia in association with Edith Cowan University, is based in Maddington and helps provide education to fast track people into university courses. Jobs West, on Abernethy Road, is a community based registered training organisation which promotes hands-on learning, while the Smith Family group in Gosnells and Midland assists low-income families to enter its Learning for Life scholarship program. The Small Business Centre South East Metro is proof of how local organisations, given the right support and encouragement, can make a real difference to the community. Since its inception, the Small Business Centre has created hundreds of jobs in the south of my electorate. They manage a significant number of clients who after advice on training in small business creation are empowered to take steps to full-time employment and jettison their welfare dependency. In the north of my electorate, the Small Business Centre East Metro, under the watch of doyen chief executive officer, Tony Watts, is also helping one of Hasluck's most disadvantaged areas to thrive under difficult business conditions, and certainly encourages young people to make that choice of stepping into the workplace, being supported and then having the opportunity of a full-time job in some key areas. They also look at the opportunity for pathways into the resource sector. They offer training advice to start up businesses, information on new tax regimes for existing businesses and knowledge on how to maximise business. This naturally results in employment flowing on into the community. Hasluck is also blessed with strong chambers of commerce-namely the Swan Chamber of Commerce and its formidable chief executive officer, Sandra Wallis; the Kalamunda Chamber of Commerce and its president, Robert Bentley; and the Gosnells Chamber of Commerce oversighted by John Hardy, the chair, who is ably assisted by the chief executive officer, Denise Bradley. In my discussions with them we have been looking at the opportunities that we can create for young people within the electorate of Hasluck and allow them to have that second chance in life that will enable them to not depend on government welfare programs. As such, I have set up advisory groups sourced from businesses, agencies and constituents within Hasluck in the areas of training, environment and disabilities to meet regularly throughout the year to identify funding and policy opportunities and to progress the issues relevant to those key areas within Hasluck. The Hasluck Training Advisory Group is made up of representatives from different sectors in training, including industry, registered training organisations, the TAFE sector and the secondary schooling sector. Again, our focus as leaders within this area is to look at the opportunities that we can create to bring people into the skills pathway and into permanent work. This varied representation recognises that in the area of training all he sectors have a significant part to play in the delivery and outcomes of training opportunities for the people of Hasluck. The proposed bill is highly relevant to the work that we are collectively undertaking as leaders within Hasluck. My intentions are to address both the immediate needs of individuals within Hasluck and, more importantly, to work with a strong network of training providers who contribute to the skills development of Western Australians in this local area. I want to contribute to my belief in lifelong learning for all to enable individuals to have the capability and capacity to make choices, to access skills training and have the flexibility of career pathway options. This group will work on achievable areas of policy formulation and opportunities in training that will assist young people who want to work and come back into the workplace. This alliance of the Hasluck Training Advisory Group is to provide strategic directions for a local approach to providing training and skilling opportunities. The bill will contribute to my belief in lifelong learning for all to enable individuals to have the capacity to make choices, access training and have the flexibility of career pathway options that will increase labour market efficiency, productivity, innovation and ensure increased utilisation of human capital as opposed to the reliance on welfare measures. The Skills Australia discussion paper, Creating a future direction for Australian vocational education and training, released in October 2010, is a salient reminder of the fact that the skilling of our human capital is critical. Australia is facing a stark reality in respect of our long-term economic and social prosperity and depends on the depth of skills in the population and the better use of those skills to overcome the risk of a fiscally unsustainable ageing population. There is an urgent need to provide individuals with the broad based skills and knowledge for changing labour market demands and emerging occupations and industries. Having had an education background, I am often of the view that we sometimes undervalue the human capital that is often caught up on welfare dependency. I have had discussions on a couple of occasions with Noel Pearson about the incredible talent that we still have within our society but that we do not harness; nor do we capitalise on opportunities by taking them off dependency on welfare payments and getting them into pathways of learning, skilling and training in order to equip them to make choices for some of the job opportunities that exist within this country. To that end, I commend the government on the amendments within this legislation. The Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011 is one step towards encouraging Australians to re-enter the workforce. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (20:23): It is my pleasure to rise to speak in support of the Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011. This bill is important to correct what has been referred to by the minister as an unintended consequence. We have heard the member for Menzies, who was the minister at the time that this transitional arrangement was brought in back in 2006, criticising the position that the government is now taking in relation to this bill. But the reality is that we are here today introducing this bill because there was a flaw in the way that this transitional arrangement was set up. To set up a grandfathering arrangement generally means that you look at the entitlements being provided at the time and you protect those entitlements into the future for a period of time for that group of individuals that is receiving them. What grandfathering clauses are not meant to do is allow for those arrangements to indefinitely continue or, in effect, to expand those arrangements so that they not only protect those that were to be covered in the first place but in fact broaden their coverage, and that is what the changes back in 2006 did. The parenting payment transitional arrangements came in under Welfare to Work. The changes were in relation to the eligibility for parenting payment such that the recipients who claimed the payment from 1 July 2006 would cease to be eligible once their youngest child turned six if they were partnered or eight if they were single. Prior to these changes, eligibility for parenting payment ceased when the youngest child turned 16. So the purpose of the transitional arrangements was to identify those parents who were already in receipt of the parenting payment and to ensure that they, as recipients, continued to get that parenting payment until their youngest child turned 16. What that arrangement should have done is said 'until the child or children who existed at that point in time in 2006 turned 16', but it did not. It failed to put that clarity in the legislation at that time. It created a situation whereby not only the children who were born prior to 1 July 2006 but also children born post 1 July 2006 were included in this grandfathering clause; it applied to those children until they turned 16. And that is the case today. If those parents have another child today, then the grandfathering clause applies for 16 years from that child's birth. That is the problem that was created as a consequence of a flawed transitional arrangement established in 2006. I appreciate the member for Menzies standing here in this chamber this evening and criticising the government for this measure, saying: 'This is not a Labor government policy. This is not about looking after parents and entitlements.' But the fact the reason this bill is here is that the member for Menzies did not do his job properly in the first place. Basically, he introduced a flawed piece of legislation. So we are here today to rectify that problem in relation to the transitional arrangements and to ensure that those parents in receipt of the parenting payment who have a child post 1 July 2011 will receive exactly the same entitlement as every other parent getting the parenting payment-that is, they will get that entitlement until that child reaches the age of six if they are partnered or until the child reaches the age of eight if they are single. I fail to see any unfairness in a proposal that ensures that we bring in equality of entitlements for parents, and that is what this bill seeks to do. It is very good to hear the member for Hasluck talking about the importance of incentives for businesses to ensure we are delivering skills and training and that we are moving away from reliance on welfare, because that is exactly what this Labor government's budget for 2011-12 did and that is what this bill before the House today does. This bill is the first stage of the income support payment reforms contained in the Building Australia's Future Workforce package. This is a package of incentives for parents to engage in the workforce and to reduce their dependency on welfare. It will provide families with a greater measure of financial security. This government is committing to building Australia's future workforce, ensuring we are training people and getting them ready for work. We are doing this through Skilling Australia's Future Workforce, providing $3 billion over six years. There will be reform of the training system, placing industry at the heart of the training effort. We will be ensuring apprenticeships that work for more Australians. There will be vocational is education and training to meet the longer term needs of the economy. We will be building better skills for workforce participation. We are ensuring more participation, through rewards, opportunities and responsibilities. We are improving incentives in the tax system; investing so more young Australians are earning or learning; rewarding and supporting single parents to engage in work; supporting very long-term job seekers; providing more opportunities for people with disability; and taking a new approach to addressing entrenched disadvantage in targeted locations throughout the country. Since the December quarter of 2007, Australia's GDP has risen 6½ per cent in real terms, while real GDPs in the euro area and Japan are yet to return to pre-crisis levels. During the global financial crisis, Australia was one of only three advanced economies not to enter recession. Australia's economy is expected to continue to strengthen over the medium term, driven by the resources boom, which will have flow-on effects for the rest of the economy. Workforce participation is around historical highs, at close to 66 per cent. Unemployment is forecast to fall to 4½ per cent by mid-2013, and it is estimated that close to 500,000 jobs will be created over the next two years. However, there are still some groups at risk of missing out on these opportunities. This bill, other bills currently being debated before the House and bills that will be introduced over the coming weeks and months will implement the 2011-12 budget commitments. They will see this government committing to more workforce participation and ensuring that people who have been long-term unemployed, people who are single parents, people who have disabilities, young people and people in areas of entrenched disadvantage are getting the opportunity to participate in the workforce and have the dignity of work. That is what this government is about. It is about trying move people away from the reliance on welfare and giving them that opportunity. Some of the initiatives that are part of Building Australia's Future Workforce package are about providing skills for workforce participation. This government is investing $263 million to help people attain the basic skills, such as reading, writing and numeracy, needed to participate in the workforce. If we want to move people out of the welfare system and back into work, we have to invest in the basic skills that those people need, especially if they have been long-term unemployed, especially if they have been at home caring for young children and out of the workforce for many years. That is why we will commit $143 million to provide 30,000 additional commencements for job seekers in the Language, Literacy and Numeracy Program; $80 million for additional training places for single and teenage parents; $20 million to expand the Workplace English Language and Literacy program to support businesses who want to boost the core skills of their workers; and $20 million to maintain the number of places in the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program to ensure apprentices have the basic skills they need. These measures build on the $116 million investment in language, literacy and numeracy in the 2010-11 budget through the Skills for Sustainable Growth initiative. I have talked about workforce participation. This government is spreading the benefits of workforce participation through the most recent budget and through bills such as this. We are doing this by: rewarding work through more timely tax assistance, improved income tests for single parents and young people, and incentives for employers who hire people with disability and the very long-term unemployed; providing new opportunities to get people to into work through training, education, child care and improved employment services; introducing new requirements for the very the long-term unemployed, disability support pension recipients, teenage parents, jobless families and young people; and taking new approaches to address entrenched disadvantage in targeted locations. That is what this Labor government are doing. We are doing everything possible to ensure that we are getting workforce participation. At a time with low unemployment but a skills shortage and businesses screaming out for workers, we need to do everything possible to make sure that people are not left behind. That is what we seek to do. Before we started debating the Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill, a number of my colleagues were speaking on some of the new tax law amendments in relation to the budget. They were talking about the lowincome tax offset. That is another one of those improved incentives in the tax system to make it more attractive for people to move back into the workforce but not be disadvantaged by doing so. Importantly, this bill is very much about rewarding and supporting parents who want to re-engage in work. It is so important that we do this. There are new opportunities and responsibilities for single parents. It goes both ways. We will provide the opportunities, but there are responsibilities that come with that. In order to encourage parents to get into work, the government will provide $179 million to reward part-time work by reforming the income test for single parents on Newstart allowance. Changing the taper rate from the current 50c or 60c in the dollar to 40c in the dollar from 1 January 2013 will let them keep up to an extra $3,900 of their income from part-time work each year. From 1 January 2013, the government will also gradually phase out grandfathering arrangements for parenting payment recipients with a youngest child aged 12 to 15, to make eligibility more consistent with the treatment of other parents. That is what we are talking about with the bill before the House today. It is about providing incentives at the same time as ensuring that we are moving people away from reliance on welfare. It is also about providing consistency and equality. If we want to get the system right, if we want to get the balance right, we need to make sure that arrangements such as grandfathering arrangements work the way they are intended to-that is, they have a certain lifespan. Once that lifespan is up-and it should be a reasonable lifespan-those people move into a system, getting the same benefits as everyone else. They are not worse off, as the member for Menzies would have us believe. It is about equality. I fail to see how the member for Menzies can stand here and argue that. Parents who have a child after 1 July 2011 will still get the benefits of the transitional arrangements for all of their children who were born prior to 1 July 2011, if they were part of the transitional arrangements from the 2006 legislation. All of the children they have from 1 July will get the same benefits as those of every other parent out there. I think this bill is fair, commend it to the House. also Mr CRAIG THOMSON (Dobell) (20:38): I rise to speak on the Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011. We have just heard from the member for Petrie, who has given a very considered contribution on this bill and in particular has pointed out the hypocrisy of the member for Menzies in terms of his criticism. It was interesting. I was also able to be here in the chamber to listen to the member for Hasluck, who took a very different approach to the member for Menzies. In fact, the member for Hasluck recognised this bill for what it was, congratulated the minister, supported the bill and congratulated this government in relation to the particular initiatives that this bill seeks to bring in and the associated reforms that this government has sought to bring in around jobs. I almost thought that the member for Hasluck was sitting on the wrong side, because of his strong endorsement of government policy. He went on to talk about jobs and the need for further education. Clearly the member for Hasluck has not spent too much time looking at the policies of the former Howard government, because if he had he would have been horrified with the party that he is in this parliament to represent. They had an atrocious record in relation to investment in human capital, which was something that the member for Hasluck spoke about at length. They had a terrible record in relation to higher education, the worse in the OECD. I think the next worse in the OECD had a positive contribution of something like 10 per cent in growing the budget for higher education. Under the previous government we saw a 15 per cent cut. I make a general invitation to the member for Hasluck that, with the strong views that he put and his obvious personal and I commitment to jobs and making sure that people get the opportunity to start, he should come to this side of the parliament and join us more often, because clearly he is a very decent man and one who sees a good policy for what it is. As the member for Petrie said, this legislation is about fixing up a mistake that the member for Menzies made in 2006. He left open the grandfathering provision so that it did not just apply to the children of those parents who were eligible in July 2006; it continued to apply, by mistake, by error in the legislation, to a whole category of children who were born after that date. That really is not grandfathering at all; it is the creep of middle-class welfare. It has effects, because it means that people are treated differently-that there is not equality in the way we treat children and parents who are eligible outside that grandfathering provision-and that is just unfair. One of the things we need to do is to make sure that we treat people fairly. It also has a detrimental effect in relation to encouraging people to get off welfare and back to work. That is where this government stands, in stark contrast to the opposition and to the previous Howard government, in relation to what it believes needs to be done with jobs, what needs to be done about the dignity of work and what needs to be done to break the unemployment cycle that so tragically often affects many generations of families. It is the first time-nor should it be the last, because we are very proud of our record in government-that people from this side of the House have reminded the House of the fact that this government and only this government stood between Australia and a much, much higher unemployment rate that would have happened if those on the other side had been in charge of the Treasury benches when the global financial crisis took place. Quite frankly, those on the other side were not concerned about jobs at all. That was never part of their issue. They were happy to let the market rip and see what happened. The sort of attitude taken was that, in the long run, people will find a job. We stood up for Australians. We made sure that jobs were a priority. We wanted to make sure that where we could keep people in jobs we did so. That is what the stimulus packages were about. All we ever got from the other side was negativity about why things should not happen, why we should be opposed to these issues, rather than looking at the very positive impacts that our stimulus package had in keeping people employed. I remember in particular visiting a building site where a hall was being built at Tacoma Public School and meeting a young apprentice carpenter called Jeff. Jeff was in his third year of apprenticeship, but his previous employer had cut him loose because of the downturn and he was in the unfortunate situation of being a third-year apprentice without an employer. He was in a very difficult position to try and pick up and finish that apprenticeship, which would have given him vital skills and made sure that he was able to be employed and contribute to the economy. It was our stimulus package that made sure that he had a job, because he was picked up by the local builders. He was a local boy. He got a job at that school and was able to go on and finish his not apprenticeship. That is a very local example of why jobs are so important. This recent budget made sure it looked at particular areas around Australia where unemployment is entrenched, where unemployment is often intergenerational. One of the 10 areas identified is the Wyong Shire, which falls in the electorate of Dobell, my electorate. For a long time people in Dobell have said: 'Unemployment is always going to be higher than the national average. There is nothing you can do about it. That is just the way it is where I live. There are not enough jobs.' On this side of the House we do not share that view. We take the view that no-one should be left on the economy's scrapheap, that people should be given training and opportunities. I note the member for Throsby is in the chamber. His electorate is also in one of those 10 areas. What is so exciting about this recent budget is that it made sure looked at local solutions for these areas. That is the key. We are making sure that we approach unemployment from a local perspective, making sure we know the particular problems that exist in a local area, looking at local providers for local solutions and moulding and crafting those solutions to get people back into jobs. We are making sure that we connect employers who are looking for a certain sort of employee with those employees who are looking for jobs. We are making sure that we give training opportunities to those people who may not have the skills to match the jobs that are there. By making sure we are putting appropriate packages in a local area, we will be able to match these things up. The previous government's Intergenerational report spoke a good game about participation rates and the need to increase Australia's participation rates because of the ageing population. But they actually did nothing about fixing Australia's participation rates. Even though Australia's participation rates are at record highs, we really need to focus on the participation rate of females in the 25to 44-year-old bracket. Australia is not performing as well in that bracket as it should. In that area, we are 25th in the OECD out of 33 nations-a lot lower than we should be. We have looked at ways to ensure that women of child-bearing age are able to participate in the economy for two reasons: one, for their own social reasons so they have a sense of purpose and well-being; and, two, for the economy, because we need to ensure that we are increasing participation rates. With unemployment down to 4.9 per cent, and estimated to go down to 4.5 per cent, it is vital that governments look at increasing participation rates for these women. The most obvious and most needed reform in this area was the introduction of it the Paid Parental Leave scheme. Australia was one of only two countries in the western world that did not have such a scheme. How the previous government could say that they were interested in increasing the participation of women and not address this issue is beyond reason. Clearly, this scheme was long overdue and, over time, will have a direct impact on the participation of women of child-bearing age in the workforce. Another area we looked at was child care. We made sure we increased the childcare rebate up to 50 per cent. Women in the 25to 44-year-old bracket often did not have a choice but to stay at home because child care was difficult for two reasons: one, it was often unavailable-and we have looked at addressing that issue; and, two, it was too expensive-and by increasing the rebate to 50 per cent we have addressed that. Also, more recently, we have reduced the effective tax-free threshold for low-income earners from $11,000 to $16,000, so the effective marginal tax rate is not a disincentive for people to get back into employment. That is a very important thing to help ensure we get people participating in the community. This government have a track record of making sure that we look at measures to get people back into jobs, making sure that jobs come first and making sure that we put people who need to work into work. We have looked at areas of particular disadvantage and my electorate is one of those areas. I looked at the budget initiatives the other day and I went through some of the statistics. There is a suburb in my electorate where unemployment is at 26 per cent. That is an indictment of the way governments in the past have failed to address these issues. In this particular suburb, unemployment has occurred over many generations. They have known nothing else. They are welfare dependent. We are about making sure that people have the dignity of a job, that we get them off welfare and into the workforce so they have self-esteem and the economy gets the benefit of their contribution. This bill is part of a matrix of proposals this government is putting in place. It is an example of the way this government says, 'Jobs come first.' Without jobs, our communities disintegrate. Without an emphasis on making sure people have paid employment and are off welfare, our suburbs become more dangerous and develop a range of social issues that flow from long-term intergenerational unemployment. This bill is important in relation to that and it is a bill commend to the House. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (20:52): It is with great pleasure that I follow my colleague and friend, the member for Dobell, in this debate on the Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011 because he has made an important contribution, a devastating critique that goes to the very heart of the distinction between our philosophy and our position--how we manage the budget and how we manage the economy and how we deal with social security and welfare-and the position of those opposite. As the member for Dobell points out, as we have gone through the global financial crisis we have seen an interesting separation of views. Those opposite thought it was much more important for them to retain the political bragging points, that they could balance a government budget, than it was for millions of households to balance their budgets by retaining a job. They come in here day after day and talking about the importance of dealing with the cost of living, but there are millions of households out there who know that the most effective way to balance their household budget and deal with the cost of living is to have a job. This legislation before the House today is a small part of our broader program to reform welfare and to reform our workforce policy. Our approach to welfare sits on three pillars. The first pillar is that we believe any good society has an obligation to assist its citizens in their time of need. The second pillar is that we believe there is an inherent benefit in work and engaging in the workforce. That is of benefit to the individual, to the economy and to society as a whole. The third pillar is that we believe that you can design a welfare system in a way that, on the one hand, provides a benefit I to the welfare recipients but, on the other, builds in incentives for people to care for those whom they have been entrusted to care for, incentives for those who are receiving a benefit to actually get out there and engage with the education system--to learn and to build their skills and to re-engage with the workforce-and incentives to actually earn. A well-designed welfare system addresses each of those three points. That philosophy-that approach of those three pillars-is behind our approach to welfare, is reflected in our budget, in legislation that we have brought before this parliament and legislation that we intend to bring before this parliament and in this bill. The Gillard government's first priority is to keep the economy strong so that we can keep families in jobs. We have a very strong record of creating jobs. There are now 750,000 more Australians in work than there were when we came to office in 2007 and we estimate that over half a million jobs will be created over the next three years. And the measures in this bill and in our recent budget will facilitate that growth and facilitate our making more opportunities for our fellow Australians. Joblessness amongst families is a significant social and economic problem in Australia. It is associated with higher rates poverty, poorer health status and lower educational attainment for parents and their children. In my electorate of Throsby in New South Wales, which takes in large parts of the southern Illawarra suburbs and the Southern Highlands, there are areas of intergenerational unemployment much like those described before me by the member for Dobell. We have intergenerational unemployment and intergenerational social disadvantage. That is why I am pleased that a key objective of the Gillard government is to provide opportunities to equip jobless families to train and work and to provide a pathway to better life outcomes for both themselves and their children. I am proud that this budget is a Labor budget that gives priority to jobs and opportunities for Australians, making sure that everyone can benefit from our growing economy. We all know that long-term parental joblessness and reliance on income support is detrimental to the long-term well-being of children. That is why I am particularly happy that in this budget a region within my electorate, the Shellharbour local government area, which falls within the southern part of my electorate, is one of the communities that have been identified for intensive assistance to deal with long-term disadvantage. All of the social indicators for the Shellharbour local government area--for income support, unemployment and youth unemployment--are higher than the national average. They paint a picture of a region that has been missing out on employment opportunities for far too long. That is why it is great news that Shellharbour is one of the 10 sites for the trial of new measures to make sure teenage parents finish school, for us to support jobless families and for us to provide additional support for their children. I am very pleased that recently the Minister for Human Services visited the Shellharbour of area to have an initial consultation with the community groups and organisations and other stakeholders that are in the front line of dealing with people at the tough end of disadvantage. The bill before the House today reflects another step in this government's budget to make sure parents remain engaged with the workforce and are helped to get back to work sooner. Currently, single parents that have claimed income support after 1 July 2006 are eligible for Parenting Payment until their youngest child turns eight. However, at the moment, parents who were receiving Parenting Payment before 1 July 2006 were grandfathered under the Welfare to Work changes and their eligibility ceases when their youngest child turns 16, including for any children born or coming into their care after then. This bill aligns the eligibility of grandfathered recipients with those who started receiving Parenting Payment after the Welfare to Work changes, which came into effect on 1 July 2006. In straightforward terms, grandfathered single parents that have new children after 1 July 2011 will only be able to receive Parenting Payment until a child turns eight, not until that child turns 16, which is currently the case. In addition, grandfathered partnered parents who have new children after 1 July 2011 will receive parenting payment only until that child turns six, aligning it with the current arrangements for new parents on parenting payment (partnered). This initial change will, over time, mean that the same arrangements apply to all parenting payment recipients and will lead to a reduction of time spent out of the workforce. The primary change we are introducing is a more generous income test for single principal carer parents. This provides a strong incentive for single parents to take on part-time work. As part of a $178.9 million initiative, working single parents on Newstart allowance with a youngest child between eight and 15 will be able to earn almost $400 a fortnight or up to a total of $1,346 per fortnight before they lose eligibility for Newstart allowance. The grandfathered group's eligibility for parenting payments will cease when their youngest child turns 12, or 13 from January 2013. This will give affected parents at least 18 months to prepare for the change. As a transition, parents whose youngest child is already 13 years old before 1 January 2013 will not be affected by the change. We also make sure that parents have the right support and services to get the skills go back to work. For example, the government will provide over $80 million for additional training places for single and teenage parents so that they can gain get the skills they need to get a good job when they return to the workforce. In addition, there is $19 million for additional community based support for parents, like playgroups and mentoring, through the Communities for Children program and $4 million for access to career counselling through the Jobs Services providers. This career advice will be available to grandfathered parents in the year before they move on to the Newstart allowance so they can start to plan their return to work and access the training needed. This is in addition to the support that we are providing through the new teen parents initiative. That assistance will ensure not only support, life skills and education opportunities but also generous childcare support, allowing every support possible to give these people the opportunity to reengage with education and re-engage with the workforce to provide them with greater life opportunities. In mining boom mark 2 we cannot allow whole regions to be left behind as they were during mining boom mark 1. It is notable that we have heard very little from the Leader of the Opposition on these new measures since the budget two weeks ago. Indeed, he continues to be all opposition and no leader. This budget has focused squarely on jobs. It has focused on education and training to ensure that the benefits of the mining boom make it into every corner of Australia, including some of our most disadvantaged communities. In our new location based approach welfare recipients will have greater responsibilities to participate, but they will to also have extra help. Centrelink is going to have dedicated case workers for the most disadvantaged jobseekers. These case workers will work closely with, and in many cases under the same roof as, financial counselling services, drug and alcohol counselling services, housing and homelessness services and other types of services to help long-term unemployed people back into the workforce by overcoming all the barriers that have kept them unemployed and unengaged with the workforce or education. All of the initiatives outlined in the budget are designed to couple intensive support with increased obligations, to give that extra help that people need to get them into work and to make sure that they too are able to share in unprecedented economic opportunities. The Gillard government understands that as our economy strengthens there will be some parts of the nation that are leaping ahead and some that will fear that they are at risk of being left behind. That is what we know as Australia's patchwork economy. This is why the Gillard government is so determined to make sure that, as we spread the opportunities that this phase of economic growth gives us, we do it in a way that provides opportunities for all to get a trade and the skills that you need to get your first job-and so that, as the Prime Minister has said, when you get that first job the opportunity is there to move on, hopefully to an even better job. That is why, even in a tight budget, we have made sure that $3 billion is available to invest in skills, because if we do not do that not only will we be leaving people behind and running the risk of further entrenching disadvantages but we will be building economic bottlenecks in our economy that lead to an increase in inflationary pressures and decreases in our capacity to take advantage of the opportunities that are available in the mining regions-available to us as Australia is located in the go-ahead region of the world-and of opportunities that are available to us from the boom in the services economy. We are not willing to sit by and allow that to occur. There is a stark contrast. It is a contrast between the approach of those on this side of the House and those opposite. We understand that there is an obligation on a government in a good society to provide both a helping hand but also an incentive through the welfare system to ensure those that have often been left behind or ignored in welfare traps can find their way out of those poverty and welfare traps and to ensure that they do not hand down intergenerational disadvantage from mother and father to child, from one generation to the next. We understand that engaging in work has inherent benefits for the individual, for an economy and for a society. We understand that a well-designed welfare system provides benefits to the individual but also builds in incentives to care, to learn, to be educated and to earn. I commend the legislation to the House.",103
194,Ms OWENS,BILLS," Back in April 2011, just a month ago, the OECD released a report called Doing better for families. It was a report into the condition of children in countries, and I have to say that the information on Australia did not make particularly pleasant reading. The sole parent employment rate was found to be one of the lowest in the OECD, which contributed to an above average number of children living in no-income households. In fact, around one in five children lived in such a household and it was projected that that number would increase by about 20 per cent over the next 25 years. In general the report found that too many single parents were benefit dependent and far too many children in both single and partnered families were living in no-income households. As we know, joblessness among families is a significant social and economic problem facing this country. Australia has one of the highest proportions of children living in jobless families in the OECD. In February 2011 more than 640,000 families in Australia with dependent children were on income support. Some 40 per cent of these were jobless families with no reported incomes in the last 12 months, and around 70 per cent of jobless families were single parent families. All of us in our own electorates meet people in circumstances such as this. When I am door-knocking I quite frequently find families that are sometimes third and fourth generation jobless. Joblessness is associated with high rates of poverty, poorer health status and lower education attainment for both parents and their children. Some parents spend a long time on income support and some spend their whole lives on it. For example, parents spend an average of between five and seven years on parenting payment and then they move onto other income support payment such as Newstart allowance. We all know that extended periods of income support reliance are associated with ongoing high levels of disadvantage. If there were ever a time to make a move on this, it is now. It was also the time during the mining boom mark 1 to move on this but now, as we enter mining boom mark 2, it is well and truly time for us as a nation to make serious inroads into joblessness among families. We have a comprehensive plan to build Australia's future workforce, and the Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill is a very important part of that. We have a long way to go on this. There have been some improvements. Back in 1990, for example, the employment rate for mothers with a youngest child under six was only about 42 per cent, less than the OECD average of about 48 per cent. By 2002 we had increased slightly, from 32 per cent to 45 per cent over nearly 11 years, but the OECD had increased to 59 per cent. The OECD continued to increase, as have we, but we are still below the OECD average. The previous coalition government took some steps to improve the situation in their Welfare to Work package, introduced on 1 July 2006. But when they introduced that, they wussed it. I do not know whether that is parliamentary language, but they definitely wussed it. They did something that they quite frequently did when they were in government-if they introduced a new set of rules, particularly in the welfare area, they tended to exempt for very long periods of time people who were already on the benefit. The grandfathering clauses, or the transitioning arrangements, which you might have expected to last a few years sometimes lasted for much longer than that-sometimes for the life of the recipient. This is one of those cases, and I am going to explain these grandfathering clauses. If you have not heard this before you might find it difficult to believe because, quite frankly, exactly what they did was unbelievable. Prior to Welfare to Work changes, parents were entitled to parenting payment until their youngest child turned 16. When they introduced the Welfare to Work changes, which came into effect on 1 July 2006, when a parent had their first child and first came into contact with parenting payment they were eligible for that parenting payment until their child turned six, if they were a couple, or eight if they were single. If I had my first child after 1 July 2006, when I first came into contact with the parenting payment, there was quite a reasonable benefit period and I could have six or eight years on the parenting payment and as my a child got older I was expected to move off it. If I had a child before 1 July 2006, I was able to retain the existing arrangement until the child turned 16. So if I had a child already, prior to 1 July 2006, that new rule did not apply to me-I was able to keep my parenting payment as my child turned four or five or six or seven or eight, right up until they turned 16. There was some justification for that, but they went further. They did not attach the grandfathering clause to the child-they actually attached it to the parent. If I had been receiving a parenting payment before 1 July 2006, no matter how many children I had, even 10 or 15 years into the future, for each of those children I would be entitled to keep the parenting payment until they turned 16. If I had had my first child in 2005, and then had another one in 2008 and one in 2010 and through to another one in 2015, I would still be entitled to the parenting payment until that last child turned 16. That is an extraordinary grandfathering clause. When I first read it, I had to read it three times-it really is absurd. We are acting in this bill to introduce some sanity and some equity, but we are not doing it in a way that provides surprises for families. We also, in effect, are grandfathering people on the existing arrangement so they can transition over in a reasonable way, with a reasonable expectation of what the rules will look like as their child gets a bit older. The bill really aligns the eligibility of parents and children who were grandfathered with that of those who started receiving the parenting payment after the Welfare to Work changes came into effect on 1 July 2006. This means that a single parent who has a new child after 1 July this year-in other words, if you are about to have a child and you have the child after 1 July this yearwill only be able to receive the same parenting payment that parents who had their children after 1 July 2006 receive. That means that you will be eligible to receive the parenting payment until the child turns six if you are in a partnered couple and eight if you are in a single couple. That absolutely brings grandfathered parents into line with other parents who have children. That will apply from 1 July 2011, so it is not retrospective. That means that if you had your first child prior to 1 July 2006 and you have had a couple of children since then and are having another one, the new parenting payment will apply to that new child. That will expire when the child turns six or eight, depending on your circumstances. In this bill we have also dealt with what happens to parents with children born prior to 1 July 2006. We are also bringing them into line over a period of years. We are giving parents essentially 18 months to get prepared for the change. A grandfathered parent will have their parenting payments cease when their youngest child is 12 or 13 as of January 2013. That means that if you had a child who was, say, six or so on 1 July 2006-and I know this is very complicated, because it was a very silly grandfathering clause",115
195,Mr Mitchell,BILLS,It is all over the place.,117
196,Ms OWENS,BILLS,"I know; it is all over the place. It is actually quite difficult to deal with these strange hangovers from a quite absurd decision back in 2006. If you had a child back in 2006 who was about six at the time, your parenting payment will cease, essentially, around January 2013, when that child turns 12 or 13. If your child is younger than that-if your child was only two or three at the time-then you still have a few more years, because the parenting payment will continue until your youngest child turns 12 or 13. That means that over what will now be about a 12-year period from 2006 to about 2018 all the parents who were grandfathered when the coalition government introduced this absurd grandfathering clause in 2006 will move over to the same set of rules that apply to the other parents. It is going to take us that long to bring equity back into the system but, quite frankly, I think we need to give parents the lead time to make the decisions and adjustments they need to in their lives, particularly those who have already been out of the workforce for long periods of time because this grandfathering of the parenting payments allowed them to do so. Some of these parents who will be coming back into the workforce post-2012-13 may have been out of the workforce for quite substantial periods of time, so it is also important for us to provide support in other ways. We are doing a number of things that will help these parents get back into the workforce. For a start, we are providing $80 million for additional training places for single and teenage parents so they can get the skills they need to get a good job when they return to the workforce. We are also providing $19 million for additional community based support for parents, like playgroups and mentoring through the Communities for Children program. That playgroup idea is a particularly valuable one. In my area, wherever there are large numbers of single parents we find that the local community quite often gets together to support these parents through that particular format. It is very useful way for parents to interact, get out of their homes and start the process of socialising again and moving back into the broader community. We are also providing $4 million for access to career counselling through Job Services Australia providers. This career advice will be available to grandfathered parents in the year before they move onto Newstart so that they can plan their return to work and access the training they need. Again, this is very important, because this absurd old grandfathering process introduced by the previous government has left a lot of parents out of the workforce for many, many years. I am pleased to see this bill introduced into the House. It will provide an incentive and assistance for many people to move back into the workforce. At a time like this, when we are approaching a serious boom, particularly in mining, in our economy, we need to make sure that we are providing every opportunity we can for people to benefit from that boom by moving back into the workforce and enjoying the benefits that a boom can bring. This bill begins that process as part of much larger package to support some of the more vulnerable people in our community.",117
197,Ms HALL,BILLS," It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Parramatta. She went to the detail of the Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011 and described all aspects of it very succinctly. After listening to her contribution to the debate I feel it will be difficult for me to improve upon the information she has put before the parliament tonight. The first thing I would like to say in a speaking to this bill is that we are back here in this House fixing up a mistake made in 2006 by the Howard government. I do not know how many times I have spoken in this parliament revisiting legislation in which the opposition has made mistakes that have required immediate action for the problem to be rectified. This bill limits the application of the parenting payment transitional arrangements, or the grandfathering, so that only children who were born to or came into the principal care of their parents before 1 July 2011-this year-will count towards the grandfathered status of the parenting payment recipient. That shows just how poorly drafted the original legislation was. It shows the enormous number of problems that existed in the original legislation. The amendment in this bill is the first of a number of changes that will be made to the eligibility for a certain group of parenting payment recipients. This is part of the government's welfare to work reforms. Quite a tranche of legislation will pass through the parliament to give greater opportunities for people who are unemployed or are receiving a single parent payment to get the skills and support they need to re-enter the workforce. This is about creating opportunities for those people who would like to re-enter the workforce but are unable even to contemplate that because of the barriers that are preventing them. Currently, parents who started claiming income support after 1 July 2006 are eligible for parenting payment until their youngest child turns eight years old, if the parent single, or six years old, if the parent is partnered. However, those who were receiving parenting payment before 1 July 2006 are covered by the grandfathered component and are eligible to receive parenting payment until their youngest child turns 16. This bill limits the grandfathered transitional arrangements, so that only children who were born or came into principal care before 1 July 2011 count towards the grandfathered status of the parenting payment recipient. This change will gradually align the rules that apply to different recipients and ensure that, over time, the same rules will apply to all parenting payment recipients, regardless of when they first claimed the payment. That is very important. It is about ensuring that people are treated the same and creating equity in the system. Other changes to parenting payment eligibility will further limit the coverage of the grandfathered transitional arrangements to provide even more consistent eligibility rules from 1 January 2013. It is very important that this problem that was created by the Howard government is fixed. We all know that the global financial crisis impacted enormously throughout the world. Australia performed just about the best of any country. We were able to keep unemployment at a very low level, but the situation now exists where we need to our workforce so we can fill jobs in areas where there is a skills shortage. Joblessness among families is a significant social and economic problem in Australia. The government is determined to provide opportunities to those people who are long term unemployed or who have been out of the workforce for a significant amount of time for a variety of reasons, whether it was for the purpose of child rearing or because they have unable to get a job because they do is not have the skills. A key objective of the government is to create opportunity and to equip these jobless families with the skills to train and then re-enter the workforce. Shortland electorate is in the southern part of the Hunter region, on the northern part of the Central Coast of New South Wales. It falls within the Wyong Shire Council local government area, which is one of 10 areas that have been identified to trial a program of local solutions. There are a lot of very disadvantaged job seekers in the northern part of the Central Coast-people find it difficult to access employment. A number of very good initiatives have taken place already. Trade training centres in high schools in the Shortland electorate have created new opportunities for students attending those centres. They are developing the skills they need to be able to access jobs, rather than become long-term unemployed. In addition to that, the Australian technical college that was languishing on a piece of paper has been devolved to those same schools and is now providing training opportunities for young people living in an area where there is a very high rate of youth unemployment. This government is about creating opportunity, assisting people to move from welfare to work and ensuring that long-term jobless parents-people who have been unemployed and are on parental payments or upskill relying on income support-have the opportunity to re-enter the workforce and to engage. By doing that, they ensure not only their own well-being, by getting so many life choices, but also the well-being of their children. It is all about creating opportunity. The legislation before us today goes towards creating equality between people who are receiving parenting payment and towards creating opportunity. The grandfathering of the parenting payment created an inequity. We are fixing an enormous problem that was caused by the Howard government, which did not put its mind to detail and, as a result, created this problem. Along with the changes contained in this bill, the government will provide extra money for training, extra money for community support and extra money to help with career counselling, so that those people who are unemployed and have been on parental payment will be ready to re-enter the workforce. I commend this piece of legislation to the House and say to the opposition: we fix the problems that you create. Debate interrupted. NA",118
198,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Magnetic Island Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (21:30): Magnetic Island is just off the coast of Townsville. It is a truly wonderful place. It sits within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. It is the jewel in Townsville's tourism crown. It is a quick 20-minute ride in a ferry across to Nelly Bay. Can I tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that during the campaign leading up to the 2010 election we came out and promised a walkway from Nelly Bay around the front of Bright Point, around Geoffrey Bay through to Alma Bay and the Arcadian Surf Life Saving Club. It would be the most fantastic walk in the world. It would be the walk equivalent of the Great Ocean Road. It would be absolutely magnificent. Labor matched our promise of $4.7 million to build this walkway. It has long been needed on Magnetic Island, and I will tell you why. To get from Nelly Bay to Arcadia or Alma Bay you have to come out of Nelly Bay and go up over the steepest of hills. It is a backpacker haven. You have people there carrying great big backpacks up a steep hill with no sidewalk, only a rail beside the white line. You could step out and fall all the way down into the ocean. How no-one has been killed there is completely and utterly beyond everyone. My first attempt to get funding for this was actually under black spot legislation, but unfortunately not enough people have been killed. So the fact that it is a very, very steep hill and you have backpackers and tourists crossing that hill on foot and on pushbike makes it very hard. I won the election-best result ever.",120
199,Mr Tehan,ADJOURNMENT,"Hear, hear! Mr EWEN JONES: Thank you. The member for Denison asked the Prime minister what they would do with promises made by Labor candidates in seats where Labor did not win. The Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box, hand on heart, and said: 'Our promises were fully costed, every one of them. Of course they will be delivered. Of course they will. We don't go around making promises that we won't fulfil.' So I dashed off a letter, to which there has still been no reply. Senator Jan MCLucas was in Townsville. She was asked about the Magnetic Island walkway and she said, 'Of course, the candidate made the promise, not a minister or the Prime Minister.' It could be a loophole. So we went back and checked the Hansard. The Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box and said that whether the promise was made by a candidate, by a minister or by her it would be kept. So I do not know if Jan MCLucas is calling the Prime Minister out for telling untruths. But now we find that the Townsville City Council has been told by this government-this government that cannot tell the truth-that they now have approval to apply to the regional development authority for funding. So that promise was that they were allowed to fill out an application form.",120
200,Mr Tehan,ADJOURNMENT,"Jan MCLucas needs to do that walk! Mr EWEN JONES: Jan MCLucas needs to do that walk over the hill and the good, honourable senator would do a wonderful job doing it. Why is it important? We need to develop our tourism industry. The tourism industry in North Queensland has been decimated since the cyclones and since the floods. It is in a whole world of hurt. We need to get this thing right. If you could link this walk to the traditional walks over the hills, up to the fort, it would be one of the great walks in the world. Couple that with Indigenous tourism and take it all the way down to the tourism section of Horseshoe Bay and it would be a great addition to North Queensland. At the end of the day, I was sitting there on Magnetic Island doing a listening post and some door-knocking. People come up to me and they say, 'Listen, the Prime Minister said she would fund it. Surely the Prime Minister will be good for her word.' To which I just said: 'Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Come on!' The Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box and said that a promise made by her prior to the election would be kept after the election. She stood at the dispatch box and said she would keep her word. This is very good. I call on this government to finally honour its word. Deliver the $4.7 million. You can deliver $13 million for a union website, but for $4.7 million to deliver jobs and tourism to North Queensland you cannot see your way clear. This government should get on its hands and knees, beg for forgiveness and say to the people of North Queensland: 'Here's your $4.7 million.' I ask the government to honour its word. (Time expired) Small Business",121
201,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT," Unlike those opposite, I like to talk about things positive. I would like to recognise and congratulate the small businesses of my electorate and indeed the small businesses of Tasmania and Australia. They do a fantastic job in keeping the engine room of our economy moving, particularly where I live. I would like to pay recognition to the O Group in my electorate and those who auspice the business and employment arm of the group. They operate three of the business enterprise centres that exist in Tasmania. The O Group, of course, have their origins in my electorate. Indeed, the CEO is a former student of mine and I am very proud to say that. They have over 10,000 interactions with small businesses and they offer a business advisory and referral service throughout the state, providing 356 services, for example, in the past six months on the north-west coast alone. They helped start up 126 new businesses which have employed 223 new employees. I suppose when you drill down into small business it is an interesting fact of life that, of the 38,000 businesses operating across Tasmania, for example, 95 per cent are small businesses and 80 per cent are microbusinesses that employ fewer than five people. That is something we forget about because generally the big noise of the economy is in the large industries, but the economy is generated by smaller businesses. Around 22 per cent of small or micro businesses, or 8,400, are located on the north-west coast and the west coast of my electorate. I have in my electorate over the last two years unfortunately had a number of major manufacturing centres close their doors-for instance, our two paper mills, Tascot Templeton Carpets and MCCain in Smithton, the vegetable processing plantall closed down for a variety of reasons. So we have had large numbers of unemployed. But a diversified economy is really the only way that rural and regional centres are going to survive, and I am really pleased to say have been able to do that over the last 15 years. I congratulate both the Tasmanian government and the federal government for assisting this to occur, along with the relevant enterprises. Many of the unemployed have been reabsorbed into our local economy. For example, of the 360 lost from our paper mills, over 220 have set up businesses or gone into training, many of the older workforce have retired and many have been employed by small businesses. These businesses are, as I mentioned, the engine room of our economy. Tascot Templeton was a maker of quality carpets in my region. They lost about 150 jobs. Approximately 125 of these workers chose to stay in the labour force and seek other employment. One hundred and one of these workers registered with CHOOSE employment-another arm of the O Group, along with business and enterprise-so we can track accurately what these people are doing. I think it is really important, as we have done with the paper mills and the establishment of ForestWorks, that we are able to track what happens to unemployed persons. We must not just leave them to fall through the net. CHOOSE have been doing this tracking exercise and working with these workers individually. Of the 101 workers, for example, 79 have now been re-employed, mostly through medium sized manufacturing or processing businesses, but around 30 have been employed by small businesses. There is a similar story in Smithton in the far northAAMI west of my electorate. The other interesting thing that has come out of this, even at a time of difficult economic circumstances and unemployment, is that the O Group as an example in my electorate signed up 517 apprentices in the last six months, mostly through this government's apprenticeships program and we related skills and training schemes. There were 517 signed up along the coast; 358 of these, or 69 per cent, were signed up by small business operators. So I congratulate our small business operators. I congratulate those who support our unemployed and apprentices. I believe that a diversified economy is how rural and regional Australia will be able to sustain itself. (Time expired) Flood Insurance",121
202,Mr TEHAN,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to speak on the issue of flood insurance, and it brings me no joy to do so because this is not a good news story. The way an insurance company is treating its clients in the town of Carisbrook has to end. Enough is enough. The time has come to treat these people with the respect that they deserve. It is now over four months since the worse floods in 100 years to hit Victoria happened, yet these residents of Carisbrook still do not know if they will get their claims paid or if they will get them paid fully. I stand here tonight to say: stop the paper shuffling, process the claims and let these people get on with their lives. On Tuesday, 19 April, Senator Gary Humphries, the coalition spokesperson for flood recovery, and I visited the town of Carisbrook. Upon arriving we were greeted with the front page newspaper headline of the Carisbrook Mercury-'AAMI unlucky for residents.' After numerous representations to AAMI and the Insurance Council of Australia, tragically this headline still rings true. I stand here tonight to call on to stop the rot and do the right thing by these residents who have suffered for too long. Dealing with destructive floodwaters is bad enough, let alone having to deal with what seems to be bureaucracy gone mad. On that day-Tuesday, 19 April-I had the privilege of calling into meet Kirsty Brett May and their children. They are a young family, making their way in a small rural community, who had paid their insurance in good faith. Kirsty and Brett showed Senator Humphries and me the damage that had been done to their four bedrooms, and the mattresses on the floor where their children were now sleeping. They also explained how Brett was on a military pension, having been medically discharged and in need of a knee replacement. Kirsty and Brett had suffered flooding to their wonderful family home and were seeking to see their claim honoured by AAMI. Sadly, they had already been informed that their house had not suffered from 'storm water damage' although their shed had. As ludicrous as this might sound, is true. Kirsty and Brett took photos of the floodwater in their house that morning, yet they were told that the flooding that had occurred in their house was a result of 'riverine flooding' that did not occur until that afternoon. I saw those photos and also spoke to the shire chief engineer, who was present on the morning the May house was flooded. After seeing this photographic evidence and talking to the chief engineer, along with Gary Humphries, immediately made the Insurance Council of Australia and AAMI aware of these facts. Yet here we are on the last day of May, over six weeks later, and the Mays are still none the wiser as to whether AAMI are going to honour the contract they had with them for 'storm water flood' insurance. I spoke to Kirsty May today and remarkably, given the enormous stress that she and her family are under, she retains a sense of humour. How this is the case is beyond me, but her resilience is something which I have seen writ large across flood affected communities in Victoria and it never ceases to amaze me. But enough is enough. and AAMI need to act and they need to act now. The Mays and all the other AAMI clients in Carisbrook deserve to know what the company is going to do. They need to know immediately; otherwise the process of ICA and their affiliates for dealing with insurance claims in flood affected areas of Victoria is not worth the paper it is written on. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",122
203,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT," Over the last couple of days we have seen Cate Blanchett and Michael Caton, two rather well-known actors, take part in an advertising campaign that was run by a collective of community groups. I have to say that some of the responses to this were rather odd. We saw Cate in particular it personally attacked. There seems to be a view that because she has earned a reasonable amount of money-in fact, quite a good amount of money-in her life she is not entitled to call for a better and less costly future for her children, when there are people in the community now who would find the cost difficult to bear. It highlighted for me an argument that rages in the climate change debate which is exactly that: the argument I, between whether we wear some of the cost now or whether we leave the cost for later generations. In every community, people individually place a different value on cost depending on when that cost is incurred. Some of us would consider that a cost today is far more devastating than the same cost if it were to appear in two or three weeks time. We vary across the community. Sometimes it is because of a cultural difference or a difference in background and sometimes it comes from circumstances. In my electorate there are many communities but two distinctly different ones in terms of the way the community operates. In some of the less affluent areas the people who go out and work for the community look into their community and see that people need assistance in the very basic needs of life. They focus on providing housing, food and clothing, on making ends meet and trying to find regular employment for members of the community. The focus of those communities is very much on meeting the day-today needs of their families. In other sections of my community, usually the leafier suburbsnot rich suburbs, but more comfortable suburbs-the focus of the community sector tends to be more on arts and the environment and on longer term issues like building art galleries and planning for the future, because they are the communities that have the capacity to trade off some of the benefits now for a benefit later. I have one community that does not have the capacity to say, 'Let's put something aside now for something in the future' and another community that can do that quite easily. Any path we find through the climate change debate must take account of both of these perspectives on cost because both are perfectly relevant. A good parent who is struggling to support his or her child now is not wrong to prioritise the needs of today over the needs of tomorrow, because for some of them that is the only way they can get through the day. Nor is it right for us to put aside the argument that if we do not pay attention to changing things now, if we do not act fast, the cost burden on our children and their children will be much greater. Both arguments are equally valid. Finding a way through the climate change debate requires a response that satisfies both. Oddly enough, if we decide to do nothing now and transfer the cost later we are only satisfying one of those arguments. But the path that we have chosen, the pricing of carbon, does satisfy both arguments. It recognises that if we as a community do not wear some of the burden now, our children will play a much greater cost. But it also recognises that there are elements in our society that need assistance in bearing some of that cost. The household assistance package that we are working on, that will compensate lowand middle-income households for the additional costs now, satisfies the need to balance both these arguments. I am pleased to see my government acting on climate change. For most of my life I have been one of those people who looks forward and places considerable emphasis on costs and benefits in the long term. I am a long-term planner by nature and I am lucky enough not to have been hit by some of the catastrophes, disasters or inequities that others have faced. I have enough capacity in my life to put some aside now to make sure that the future is well taken care of. I am pleased to see us act but I am also pleased to see that this party is concerned with those who do not have the spare capacity to consider the future and with making sure that as we move down this path of ensuring a prosperous future for our children we protect and safeguard the circumstances of the less well off in our community through generous household assistance packages. Wright Electorate",123
204,Mr BUCHHOLZ,ADJOURNMENT," Tonight I rise to bring to the attention of the parliament the three basic principles which saw me elected as a member of parliament: first, a reduction in the measures of compliance for the small business sector; second, putting more money into the pockets of mums and dads in my electorate; and, third, assuring my primary industry sector that I would fight for a better price for their product at the farm gate. I come from the seat of Wright, which encompasses Lockyer Valley and the Fassifern Valley, which recently has been devastated by astronomical flood levels and out of proportion devastation. We still have families displaced from their homes, and they are doing everything humanly possible to get their lives back into some kind of routine, the routine that you and I in this House take for granted. My electorate is predominantly rural and the devastating infrastructure damage to my farming precinct was overwhelming, with experiencing heartache. They took two and three metres of overburdened silt off their crops so that they would have a reasonable capacity to put in new crops. But they did. We are a resilient mob, a resilient people, in the electorate of Wright and we are doing everything humanly possible. But by jingo it is hard to get motivated when these hurdles are constantly put in front of us. I have 36 dairy farmers throughout my electorate. They are going through an incredibly tough time in trying to do their forecast with reference to capital investment programs in their industry sector, when there is so much indecision on the back of Wesfarmers and the Coles price-war situation. Wesfarmers own Coles. Wesfarmers built their business on the back of farmers. It is ironic that I stand in this House today to defend my farmers from the mechanism that Wesfarmers have built in the form of Coles. I will lobby and fight for my farmers from the dairy sector as best I can. In Brisbane today Brian Tessmann, the President of the Queensland Dairyfarmers Organisation, spoke at the Rural Press Club. He made reference to the supermarkets creating a situation of market failure, which does not reflect the current supply and demand situation or the true value and cost of fresh milk. He is saying that, as the market leaders on milk put pressure on generic brands, dairy farmers will leave the industry. The situation in my electorate keeps on getting worse. It is like a Demtel ad in reverse. There is a set of steak knives with this as well. Twenty per cent of growers in my area produce all of Queensland's beetroot. On the weekend they were informed by Golden Circle, a full subsidiary of Heinz, that their product would no longer be wanted. I have in my hand a tin of sliced beetroot. Mr Deputy Speaker, I say to honourable members, through you: do farmers yourselves a favour when you get out of here tonight and go and get yourselves one of these, because they are going to be a collectors' item in Australia. The contents of this product will no longer be made in the electorate of Wright or in Queensland or in Australia. You will be buying beetroot that is processed in New Zealand, possibly coming from China, Poland, Bulgaria-any of those countries that have a lower cost-efficiency in getting product into a tin. I can assure you that the product quality will not be anywhere as good as what we have in the Lockyer Valley. Why are these firms leaving our shores? Why is Golden Circle in Queensland choosing to relocate to New Zealand, when our Prime Minister tells us, with her hand on her heart, that the carbon tax will not have an impact on this industry? (Time expired) Robertson Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program",124
205,Ms ONEILL,ADJOURNMENT," It is my pleasure to have the opportunity to speak in the House this evening following the member for Wright and the member for Braddon, both of whom this evening celebrated the place of small businesses, the backbone of our economy. This evening I would like to speak about the impact of the Building the Education Revolution program in my electorate. We know that $16.2 billion was invested in the future of schools and young people in this country as part of the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, under which $42 billion was invested in Australia. Following the global financial crisis, Australia's economy and our economic management have been widely and wildly applauded. Earlier this evening the member for Fraser spoke of the decision by the Treasurer to have a timely, temporary and targeted response to the needs of our community. Obviously the targeting of the investment in our schools and the building projects that have gone on are very telling. They reveal something quite distinct that differentiates us from those on the other side of the chamber-that is, a revelation of Labor values, a certainty about investing for the future, a certainty about a positive vision for this country and a belief that our young people have the best days ahead of them, not behind them. The other thing that it reveals quite starkly about our values is our deep commitment to jobs. We understand that employment is critical for all Australians. Through small businesses participating in the building of our local schools we have made sure that hundreds and hundreds of local workers in the seat of Robertson have been able to continue to work their way through a time where we are seeing all around the world stories of incredibly high unemployment. The flow-on to small business local suppliers has also been evident in my area. I want to speak to two particular projects, one at Chertsey Primary School and the other at Green Point Christian College. I applaud the Principal of Chertsey Primary School, John Anderson, who very carefully monitored and managed the delivery of $2.125 million worth of investment in that local school. That school has a class for deaf students and a class for autistic students. Those students with special needs had for 14 years been attending class in a very old demountable building. In addition to the covered outdoor learning area, which provides a space for the entire community to gather, the school has new classrooms for the hearing impaired children to have a place to learn and for the autistic children to have a place in which they are truly delighted to gather each morning. I want to comment Nada Potter, who runs the after-school care service for the school and who was responsible for the wonderful celebration that we had on the day. In the time that remains, I would like to acknowledge also the amazing work that has been undertaken by the school community, the architect and the companies-there was more than one company involved-in completing the $3 million worth of works at Green Point Christian College. Mr Wayne Parks offered wonderful leadership as the principal of the school, and the Ellis family significantly drove the board to ensure that great value for the dollar was gained at the school. As a result of our investment in education, in addition to the 300 jobs that were provided by this project-300 local jobs that kept our local people working-there are now 1,024 students who have a performance area in which to undertake drama studies and to share and use for a range of subjects. They have break-out rooms. They have 10 classrooms. They have a year 12 senior art room. All of these things were achieved by the careful financial management of Jacques Mouton, the business manager, and his team of leaders in the school. What all this reveals is that we have much to acknowledge and celebrate: the workmanship of the construction sector, the vision and forbearance of teachers and the school community and the leadership of the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, who created jobs in our country when very few around the world were able to do the same thing in their countries. (Time expired) Early Childhood Education",125
206,Mr TUDGE,ADJOURNMENT," I would like to raise an important issue that is affecting thousands of young families in our community, and that is the progressive destruction of three-year-old kindergartens which is occurring in Victoria and possibly in other states. It is occurring because of a policy of the Gillard government, which like so many other government policies has not had its implications properly thought through. The particular policy in question is the government's decision to mandate that, by 2013, all four-year-olds must be offered 15 hours of kinder by university trained staff. Presently, most kinders only offer 10 hours. In practice, kinders that are forced to increase the hours of their four-year-old classes by 50 per cent are finding that they will not have the physical or staffing capacity to run their three-year-old kinder. The result, according to the President of the Municipal Association of Victoria, Councillor Bill MCArthur, is that we will have a potential crisis in three-year-old kinder by 2013. The situation is exacerbated by the mini baby boom from a few years ago, which is already putting pressure on four-year-old kinders. Two-thirds of kinder facilities are owned by councils, and the majority are community run. There are 1,200 in Victoria alone. In my own electorate, I know that that the Knox City Council, which owns all the kinder facilities, is working through the potential crisis in three-year-old kinder. It predicts that it will not have the capacity to meet the federal government's requirements by 2013. So it is left with a choice: it either breaks the law or it axes three-year-old kinder to cater for the extra hours for the four-year-olds. Some choice! You would think the Prime Minister would be aware of this pending crisis. After all, she has been directly advised by the Municipal Association of Victoria that her electorate is one of the most at-risk regions for children to miss out. It is time she acted to fix this mess. So what needs to be done? If the government is to continue with this policy and force the hands of kinders then it needs to do two things: firstly, it should offer infrastructure assistance so that kindergartens can physically cope with the extra demands; secondly, it should defer the 2013 start date so that there is adequate time for extra trained staff to come through the pipeline. Longer term, these small parent-run kinders should be given the opportunity to affiliate with local schools to assist them with their administrative burdens. I know that many of them, understandably, struggle with the financial reporting, the payroll, the legal responsibilities et cetera. They should be given the option of being an independent autonomous entity within the school legal structure so that they can get support for the administrative functions, which would enable them to focus on their core work. This government has overseen too many program failures: pink batts, Green Loans and border protection policies, amongst others. I fear that its kindergarten policy will be added to the list. There are thousands of young families who are counting on the government to lift its game in this area before it is too late. Carbon Pricing",127
207,Ms GRIERSON,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to correct the latest attempt by the Liberal Party to mislead the public, and the constituents of my electorate of Newcastle, on the impact of a carbon price. Over the past few months, the Australian public has been subjected to a tirade of false and misleading claims by Mr Abbott over the impact of a carbon price. Now it seems Abbott's mindless negativity has infected the ranks of the newly elected New South Wales Liberal government. Yesterday afternoon, the newly elected state member for Newcastle, Tim Owen, made a number of exaggerated and deceptive claims about the impact of a price on carbon in the Hunter region. It is not usually my habit to respond to every untruth peddled by the coalition in this important debate, but this latest attempt at fearmongering cannot go unchallenged. Quoting Premier O'Farrell, Mr Owen repeated four times the fallacious claim that up to 13,000 people in the Hunter would lose their jobs if a price on carbon were introduced. Besides being misleading, this claim is at best alarming and at worse insulting to the intelligence of the people of Newcastle. To make this claim, Mr Owen relied on a discredited and outdated piece of research by the Liberal Party's favoured consultants, Frontier Economics-the same research relied upon, I note, several times by the member for Paterson in this House. The costings and assumptions underlying that particular piece of research have long been disputed. For example, the report assumes a carbon price of around $46 per tonne, well above what anyone anticipates will be the price on carbon set here. But nowhere does the report assert that existing jobs in the Hunter will be lost if such a price on carbon is introduced. What the report does say is that jobs growth will continue in the Hunter, even modelled on the highly exaggerated carbon price of $46 per tonne. Yet Mr Owen repeated four times the false claim that jobs will be lost. In doing so, he used his privilege as an MP to make exaggerated claims based on a report with questionable credentials, to try to panic his constituents into believing 13,000 people in our region will soon be out of work. I simply say to Mr Owen: that is not leadership; it is just fearmongering, plain and simple. This is not what the people of Newcastle expect when they entrust an individual to represent and speak for their interests in the parliaments of this nation. That the New South Wales Liberals have turned to the divisive tactics of Mr Abbottdescribed recently, I note, by John Hewson, a former Leader of the Liberal Party, as 'the master of the negative'-may not surprise everyone, but it will certainly disappoint many. The facts in this debate are simple. Climate change is real. The evidence is overwhelming. We are already seeing the impacts of a changing climate. Human activities are triggering the changes we are witnessing in the global climate. As the Newcastle Herald noted today, the International Energy Agency has found that last year greenhouse gas emissions increased by a record amount and that an estimated 30.6 gigatonnes of carbon were released worldwide. The IEA advised that to avoid the worse effects of global warming we must stop short of 32 gigatonnes a year by 2020. As the Herald noted, even this target is 'starting to seem impossibly optimistic'. Rather than supporting a scare campaign over a carbon price based on questionable modelling, perhaps Mr Owen should focus his attention on assisting the more immediate concerns of his constituents-for example, the New South Wales Liberal government's decision to tear up its contracts with 120,000 households under the Solar Bonus Scheme, households acting on climate change. But, putting this episode aside, I restate my willingness to work with Mr Owen on areas of common concern to the people we both represent. Newcastle has a number of pressing needs that would benefit from our cooperation, in particular infrastructure priorities and encouraging the early rollout of the National Broadband Network. True leadership involves recognising when to put petty politicking aside for the sake of the public good rather than perpetuating the mindless, incessant and fearmongering that has become the hallmark of the federal opposition. Petition: Balwyn Post Office",128
208,Mr FRYDENBERG,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I rise tonight for two reasons. First, in accordance with standing order 207, I present a petition to you and to members of this House. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned citizens draws to the attention of the House the closure of the Balwyn Post Office in Whitehorse Road, Balwyn, Victoria. This petition notes that:  Balwyn Post Office was located within a retail, commercial and banking precinct where businesses relied on its services;  Balwyn Post Office provided a range of postal services to a large number of local residents and traders, including many senior and elderly citizens; and  the closure of the Balwyn Post Office has caused enormous inconvenience to many in the community and caused economic loss to Whitehorse Road shopping strip. We therefore ask the House to urge the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity to consult with the board of Australia Post about reestablishing a post office in Balwyn. from 5,354 citizens Petition received.",129
209,Mr FRYDENBERG,ADJOURNMENT,"I take this opportunity to also thank the Mayor of Boroondara, Councillor Nicholas Tragas; his fellow councillor Dick Menting; the head of the Balwyn Traders Association, Ian Bird; and my parliamentary colleague at the state level Mr Robert Clark, the member for Box Hill. negative This has been a critical issue in the electorate. I have received hundreds of pieces of correspondence and met with many locals who have been inconvenienced by the Schools decision of Australia Post to close their post office in Whitehorse Road, Balwyn. They have told me that this is not part of a rationalisation of their post offices-because I know that many in this House in their own electorates have seen community post offices suffer a similar fate. But, that being said, we really do need in this bustling shopping strip a post office that will stand alone. Therefore, while the newsagency in Whitehorse Road, Balwyn, has been turned into a community post office and is providing some services, this is not enough. We will bring every pressure to bear on Australia Post to open a new stand-alone post office, and I think this is a critical issue to the people of Kooyong. The other issue I want to briefly raise in the time allowed to me is the future of school funding under this government-in particular, funding for non-government and Catholic schools. Kooyong is an educational metropolis. We have over 50 schools, both public and non-public. Over 30,000 school students every day go to school in Kooyong. It is our biggest industry and our biggest asset. It is, to draw an analogy, what the car industry is to Geelong or what the wine industry is to the Hunter Valley. Therefore I am particularly concerned about this government's ideological preoccupation with cutting funding to non-government and Catholic schools. This is not a new preoccupation. This is not the new Julia; this is in fact the old We do not have to think far or hard to the time when Julia Gillard was the soul mate of Mark Latham when in 2004 he took to an election a hit list of schools. Schools that would have been cut under this program in my own electorate are Camberwell Grammar School, Carey Baptist Grammar School, Fintona Girls School, Methodist Ladies College, Ruyton Girls School, Scotch College and Trinity Grammar School. All of these schools are great educational institutions and are the home for aspirational parents who send their kids there. This government's decision to not guarantee the funding maintenance principle will see over 1,000 schools in Australia have their funding cut in real terms. This includes 13 schools in Kooyong: Bialik College, Erasmus School, Genazzano FCJ College, Our Lady of Good Counsel Parish School, St Bede's Parish School, Our Holy Redeemer School, Sacred Heart Parish School, St Anne's Parish School, St Dominic's School, Siena College, St Joseph's School, St Bridget's Primary School and All Hallows School-13 schools, double the number of schools in Lalor. No wonder the Prime Minister does not care. And, now that it is in partnership with the Greens, we can only expect a harsher school funding proposal and principles from this government which will be to the disadvantage of all school students in Victoria and Australia. Mladic, Mr Ratko",129
210,Mr HUSIC,ADJOURNMENT," My father has quipped that he was lucky to land in the lucky country. He was an immigrant from the former Yugoslavia, back then a multiethnic country, comprised of different religions and cultural traditions. Friends cared little if you called yourself Croat, Serb, Bosnian-it just mattered that you were friends. Sadly, three decades later, this was Julia. not the case for much of our extended family, and countless others, throughout Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia. Between 1992 and 1995, the war in Bosnia saw more than 100,000 people perish, with a further 1.3 million displaced. In a continent that had hoped it had closed off its darkest chapters, it witnessed new ones being written-bloody chapters, scarred by haunted terms few imagined would be associated with a modern Europe: 'genocide', 'human shields' and 'ethnic cleansing'. One particularly heart-wrenching story is that of Srebrenica. On 16 April 1993, the United Nations carried resolution 819 deeming, 'All parties and others concerned treat Srebrenica and its surroundings as a safe area which should be free from any armed attack or any hostile act.' Days later the first United Nations Protection Force troops arrived, ahead of the demilitarisation of Srebrenica in early May. But by 1995, the enclave was under siege and the humanitarian situation on the ground was a catastrophe. Resources were so depleted, even UN forces ran low on food, medicine, ammunition and fuel. In early July 1995, the Mayor of Srebrenica reported that residents had started dying of starvation. Within days of the announcement, the Army of Republika Srpksa's General Ratko Mladic led the offensive that took the town. Images of the General taking a triumphant walk through the empty streets of Srebrenica will be forever seared into minds. The General knew what would happen next. Over five days in July, 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were rounded up and massacred. It was Europe's worse atrocity since World War II. Mevludin Oric is one of the few men who survived the massacre. In his words: 'We came out, they blindfolded us and we were taken to a field to be executed. ""Get out and stand in a line,"" they were shouting. Then I heard gunshots and I fell to the ground. How can a man not burst into tears? Why did this happen?' In May 1992, Fetaneta Alihromic and her then teenage children witnessed the execution of her husband in Srebrenica. She later saw her brothers and her father killed. According to her: 'They killed us like animals. So we hid in the forests during the day and went to our homes at night for shelter.' In 1995, Ratko Mladic was indicted by International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ICTY, for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. As the top military general with command responsibility, he was accused of being responsible for the Srebrenica massacre. But the important thing to note here is that the ICTY indictment against Ratko Mladic also accuses him of genocide in nine other municipalities in addition to Srebrenica. I am advised that Department of Immigration and Citizenship figures for the period 1992-95 put refugee numbers from the former Yugoslavia at just over 23,500. Survivors from Srebrenica are also largest in numbers in New South Wales and Victoria. At this time, my thoughts are with them. Last week's arrest of Ratko Mladic is a small step in the healing process for the families of his victims. It is an important forward in the pursuit of international justice. It sends a signal to everyone in the entire world: war crimes are unacceptable and if you commit acts of genocide, if you engage in these sorts of atrocities, you will be held to account. In closing, I would like to reflect on the words of Munira Subasic, the president of Mothers of Srebrenica. Her words were picked up in the Walkley Award winning SBS program Echoes of Srebrenica, first broadcast in July 2010 to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the massacre. The program was also a finalist in the United Nations Association of Australia Media Peace Awards and has been shortlisted for the Amnesty International Media Award for human rights programs. In that program, Munira says: 'After I die, I want my granddaughter Sara to have friends who are Serbs, Croats, Muslims, Jews, Roman Catholic and everyone else. If we do not do this ... if we don't give testimony, if we don't prove who the criminals are, and who the good people are, and if the good people do not speak up against the criminals, then this will not happen. But to live in a ghetto, to live with someone and to hate them, or for them to hate you ... that brings no joy, not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina but everywhere in the world.' Australian Honey Bee Industry",130
211,Mr SECKER,ADJOURNMENT," Can I associate myself with the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Chifley. I think they were very well spoken words. It is vital that I raise the issue of the possibility of Asian bees destroying the Australian honey industry and the effect that that would have on the whole of Australia's agricultural and horticultural industries. Presently, it is estimated that Europeans step bees, which are the basis of the honey industry in Australia, value-add over $5 billion to our agricultural and horticultural industries. European bees have probably been the greatest import that we have made in the last 200-plus years. Conversely, Asian bees could be the worse import if they are allowed to take hold and destroy the European beehives that have given so much to Australia. Asian bees first came into Australia in a relatively small area around Cairns. It is essential that action is taken quickly and strongly to eradicate Asian bees. For an industry that value adds more than $5 billion, it is a no-brainer to spend $5 million a year for two years to eradicate the threat. There is a draft containment program ready to go. It has been designed scientifically and is supported, and has the imprimatur of the Queensland government. To give credit, the South Australian government has been supportive of action from the start and other state governments are slowly coming on board. But it needs the federal government to commit to at least a category 2 action, but preferably a category 1 commitment, where an Australian integrated management system is used to eradicate the Asian bee incursion. If allowed, the Asian bees will have a destructive effect on our European beehives and they will almost certainly transport two varroa mites into Australia. Australia would then become the only country in the world with all these bad insects and a poor pollination ability. I know how important bees are for pollination. Before I had the honour of becoming the member for Barker, as a farmer I paid for beehives to help pollinate lucerne for seed production. The lucerne seed industry is a very important industry and the yields are improved greatly by the use of European bees to help pollinate the lucerne flowers, and this makes the lucerne seed industry profitable. Unfortunately, other industries will suffer the same fate. Virtually every grain crop and horticultural crop will suffer the same fate and we risk the $5 billion adding that European bees provide to our agricultural and horticultural industries in Australia. I also refer to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources report of the inquiry into the future development of the Australian honeybee industry tabled in May 2008. This inquiry traversed over the 41st and 42nd parliaments and its report is well worth reading. In that report the committee, in its recommendations, said that the Australian government should commit $50 million annually in pursuit of biosecurity measures and research in support of the Australian bee industry-and nothing has been done. At least 10 per cent of that figure should be committed over the next two years to eradicate the Asian bee incursion around Cairns. It also recommended that the Australian government, in conjunction with state and territory governments, establish and fund a national endemic bee pest and disease control program. It has not happened. This report made many more recommendations concerning biosecurity that have not been acted upon and we have seen the result of the Asian bee incursion. I call on the federal government to act now before it is too late and we destroy our agricultural and horticultural industries in Australia, which we rely on so much in this country. We need to support the honeybee industry and make sure it is not ruined by inaction by this government. Holt Electorate: Christians Helping in Primary Schools",131
212,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT," I start by commending the member for Chifley for that moving and eloquent contribution to the adjournment debate tonight. I wish to speak here tonight about a particularly special organisation as a starting point. It is called value Christians Helping In Primary Schools. During Education Week, which ran between 15 and 21 May, I was pleased to visit CHIPS. It is funded under the government's Family Support Program. The actual organisation itself is run by a very special individual called Eric Wieckmann and CHIPS is funded for about $84,000 under that program over a particular period of time to assist a significant number of local families. The funding is for the continuation of programs run by CHIPS until 30 June 2014. Through the Family Support Program, the government funds community organisations to deliver services like parenting skills training, playgroups, relationship counselling and post-separation support. CHIPS also provides seminars for students, teachers and parents, counselling for children in crisis and programs for disadvantaged children in places like Lysterfield Lake. It runs innovative programs such as Life Gets Better camps for children and their carers who have experienced major grief, divorce or loss. There are many ways in which this organisation uses props such as bright and witty puppets as part of its program in conveying messages to participants in a fun and understandable way. It is all well and good to talk about these sorts of programs but experiencing them drives home the value of them. I went down to visit Captain Eric, as he is known, at his facility at in Berwick. Seeing the programs that are running and the profound effects that they have on the children that they are dealing with really drove home the importance of continued government funding to organisations like this to ensure that these organisations exist and continue to provide these services that words cannot really describe. As an example of the number of kids who need the help of CHIPS, and this is among some of the examples of the work that is being done, we could talk about a young boy who attended one of the programs and whose family forgot his birthday, so one of the exercises that was run was to have a birthday celebration with him. There was a young man whose family life had been so abusive and so terrible that, to give him an experience of what it was like to behave normally as a child, he was taken to a farm to get his inhibitions out of his system so he could communicate and feel safe. Seeing these sorts of programs and hearing about them and about the transformational effect that they are actually having on the disadvantaged children in our areas make the work that Captain Eric does worthy of an incredible tribute to him and the organisation that he runs. In particular, when I went to see Captain Eric a program that was being run was brought to my attention. It is in action and it is called Life Gets Better. I was invited to visit Hampton Park Primary School to see a program that is being run by this organisation with a young lady called Elley with a dog called Baileys, who is a groodle. For the education of this House, a groodle is a cross between a golden retriever and a poodle. This dog and Elley were visiting Hampton Park Primary School as part of this experiential program for young children in this particular region. I note the incredible work that is being done through this program and, as I said, its transformational effect. The dog actually goes into the classroom and can discern children who are experiencing anxiety, depression, grief or loss and spends time with them. I had the good fortune to spend some time with one of the young men that had been through a particular experience of grief and it was incredible to see how he was interacting with the dog and the changes that were occurring given some of the difficulties that I was aware he had experienced. So to Captain Eric and the program run through CHIPS I say this: yours is a great example of fantastic funding going to a very worthwhile program. (Time expired) Kapooka Tragedy",132
213,Mr MCCORMACK,ADJOURNMENT," In 1945 Australia suffered its worse military training accident. An explosion at Wagga Wagga's Kapooka Army Base killed 26 brave men. For many years this event was considered a 'forgotten tragedy', but now a memorial near the site of the explosion ensures families, the military and members of the public can pass by and remember what happened on that fateful day of 21 May 1945. The current commandant, Colonel David Hay, has vowed that each year the memory of these soldiers will be honoured with a special service at the memorial site at 2.30 pm, the time of the explosion.

Make no 2012-13 if it was not for this Labor government global financial crisis. This budget will deliver and a fair society that provides every Australian in life. Our first priority is keeping the economy families. With a strong economy, the government benefits flowing from the mining boom are shared Australian is left behind. Over 750,000 more when the government first took office. That is lost globally during the aftermath of the global Athens and you will see the businesses that created through the unemployment that has around the world.

While many countries around the world the global financial crisis, Australia's economy mistake: we would not be back in the black by saving Australia from recession during the a strong economy, a sustainable environment with the opportunities to prosper and succeed strong, because that creates jobs for Australian is making sure that the opportunities and with all Australians, making sure that no Australians are in jobs today than were in jobs in stark contrast to the 30 million jobs that were financial crisis.

That is why we on this say unequivocally that this Labor government global financial crisis and through the natural Not only that, we are bringing the budget This year's budget will get us back in the time in 20 years that government spending is means that we can deliver better services included a transformation of our skills and health services-announced a couple of weeks of whole-of-government savings in the 2011-12 track record in identifying efficiencies and these savings the government has met its key budget to surplus in 2012-13. The spending savings, meaning policy decisions deliver a net across the forward estimates. Just about every aspect of this year's constituents, so I would like to outline some announced. First of all we are helping to ease families and people on low incomes. In families will be eligible to receive up to $4,200 19 under changes to the family tax benefit part that in my electorate. Thousands of my constituents a little bit extra money in their pay packets of the year, under changes to the low incomes have to pay on your savings. You will get $1,000.

Some of the failed schemes $13 million for GroceryWatch, dumped; and the scheme, now dumped. I had a lady on the waiting to get her roof fixed because the ago.

So the new inpatient facility in on the public hospital, which at times has provide easier access to high-quality care and but I temper my praise by pointing out to the its agenda to slash private health insurance.

The majority of funding will only become to the end of the next term of this government of the budget is $580 million cut in mental year, the government says it will provide But it will cut $62.8 million from existing it turns out that Labor will only provide estimates. That is about a third of what the It was dull, it was unimaginative, it hit the support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012. I that, whilst this is a fairly nondescript budget, we gave a budget speech at the time, unlike the NA opposition who provided no alternative, no Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition said it campaign speech instead. This is my 13th year in this parliament and and the tick-tack on both sides never ceases previous budgets that there have been some good my years in opposition I actually commented things, and I think that we as political parties look at the good that is being done within downturn in the global economy, Australia's exceptionally well. Overall employment is at world, yet somehow this does not translate kind of thinking out, and I doubt I ever will. The 2011-12 budget strengthens Australia's opportunities. The federal budget has delivered most notably in the diagnostic imaging reform the $717 million which has been provided to Some of this funding will benefit Monash Medical electorate. Monash Medical Centre is probably Hemisphere-it is huge. This funding will provide MRI machines at Monash Medical. Monash Medical not licensed under the Howard government. the previous member for my electorate, Dr Michael we had this invidious situation where machines were unlicensed to perform Medicare refunded given 100-year licences. Some of the things almost impossible to unscramble, so I am Southern Health, which Monash forms part of-that greater service at a greatly reduced cost for MRI machine. Importantly also, GPs will now be able to conditions without the patient's first needing was in place previously-you went and saw obviously in need of an MRI, you then had to you have had to go down this path, but what go to see the specialist and then, finally, to to refer patients under 16 will take away the Having undergone an MRI I can tell you that is deafening and I should imagine that children quite frightening. But the anxiety would be greatly the MRI had to be put off. So this is a terrific This initiative will also reduce the cost as billing incentive for MRI scans to 100 per cent means not only better access but more affordable vision, no insight, and no cost savings-nothing. was not his role to do that and gave an election my 13th year of speaking on appropriation bills, to amaze me. Very rarely have we said of things in them. In fact, I think that during when the Howard government did some good should rise above partisanship sometimes and budgets. Despite many natural disasters and the economy is well placed-it is actually doing record levels, which is the envy of the Western into anyone's thinking. I have never worked that economic outlook and creates new in many ways in my electorate of Chisholm, package. I welcome the reform package and expand access to diagnostic imaging services. Centre, a vital health provider within my one of the largest hospitals in the Southern new Medicare licenses for the two existing has three MRI machines, but they were Under the deal-the 'scan scam'-introduced by Wooldridge, when he was health minister, were sitting in a very large public hospital yet treatment. It was absurd. These machines were that the previous government did have been very appreciative-as indeed is everyone at the budget has ensured that there will be patients accessing services requiring the use of an refer patients under 16 years of age for specific to see a specialist. Again, this was a hurdle that your GP, and, even though the child was go and see a specialist. I do not know if any of happened after that was that you had to wait to wait to get to the MRI. This reform allowing GPs anxiety and distress that the old system caused. it is not the most pleasant experience. The noise would find the confinement and the noise exacerbated for the child and the parent if thing that has been welcomed across the board. the budget has committed to increasing the bulkof the scheduled fee. The initiative therefore access to MRI services in my electorate. NA Many of my constituents have expressed it-about the importance of mental health reform of health is adequately funded. I recently was if she could come and talk to me about her experiences to say to Claire, 'Thank you for the courage More importantly, she then put on Facebook to me about her own fairly traumatic experience. suddenly went into the depths of absolute around the health system and the mental health and a service and medication that will see horrendous.

Another issue of great concern for my electorate, Monash University and Deakin University-was decreasing funding in the NHMRC space in research you would appreciate, I have an electorate probably healthy for it!-by individuals report that it was scaremongering and that wonderful space. We will see ongoing I will read a bit of one of the emails I got. writer said: I am a final year PhD student studying at Monash interactions between Helicobacter pylori and human half the worlds population and many of these people worse, stomach cancer.

We can continue to fund more and more only going to continue to funnel people into acute health as opposed the preventative should be looking at preventative health, encourage phenomenal people like Melanie to find cures and causes for these diseases. The the right tack regarding education. As I have seat, with Monash University, Deakin University The government's commitment of a further university enrolments will assist in further universities like Monash and Deakin. I have often said in this place that many afford to actually get to university, that the Monash Uni are most under-represented at the money to encourage more people from lower some people within my electorate. There are is quite significant wealth, but across the board encouraging more people to take up higher education-and within the TAFE sector. Box Hill TAFE provides they need the assistance to be able to go there. Many schools in my electorate already have reward top-performing teachers will provide particularly pleased that students with a disability which, will not only assist students with a assistance to their teachers.

I in my electorate, such as this Government may reduce funding for health and me, at the end stages of my PhD, this is particularly competitive to obtain ... funding opportunities ... write back to Melanie Hutton and say, 'It was a space.' It is too important for the health of our beds but if we do not fund research we are beds-all we are ever going to do is talk about health. And on World No Tobacco Day I think we going into that space and doing all we can to continue with their studies and, hopefully, to budget provides proof that the government is on said, higher education is vitally important to my and Box Hill TAFE-very large institutions. $1.2 billion to meet the demands of growth in enhancing the reputation and excellence of of the people who live within my electorate cannot constituents in Clayton who live right on top of university.

It is why we fly side of politics does not have a greater love want to do it at the right time, when it works best. So I put a challenge to the government commodity-exporting economy that has signed invite, but I hear nothing but silence, because Zealand-with all that energy-intensive milk why a carbon tax would devastate their economy! own sectors, didn't they? So what we see in Swiss-cheese carbon tax that exempts anything sign up to a carbon tax. But the reality is, commodity-exporting wealthy competitors, who see that none of them are moving toward a carbon they do, and let us then have a debate about being a small economy and accounting for less the carbon leakage; it is about what you do with a Chinese imported car. Did we get an did not. Was it mentioned in the budget? 'No.' the carbon tax? 'Yes.'

I would write that there was a little bit of good on both on both sides-as Killen said, there's good cricket that I can take back to my people, who are fuel, to show that this government is heading It is not a debate about whether we care we want to reduce emissions; this is an it is in Australia's national interest to move by waiting, and potentially having to have world and do it more effectively. It is a debate to Canberra: to debate the national interest. One of carbon emissions, for goodness sake; we just over there: name me one major ore-exporting, up to a carbon tax-just give me one.

Instead we have these Garnaut because these are issues that no-one believes I have some considerable sympathy for Professor by a passion; but I would like to see one retire yet! Give me one more report, Professor for the disadvantaged working Australians who adequately. The bottom line is that noNA one knows how working Australians will be and will not tell us. We get these vague promises reimbursing vulnerable Australians, but there in this chamber when we do not know how I see another government member has entered There are two working families, both with worker lives next door to the cannery and walks to the cannery. How do you compensate the from the one who walks to work? Again, I invite stressed working Australian differently from that is the only job they can do? Tell me how for every Australian. I would not trust any precisely. I would fear that I would not be fairly. The only alternative is: leave the vulnerable the sectors where improvements are most likely It is pretty simple. It is a market based mechanism. emissions, you can see where world technology abatement from that sector'-and that is an over and does not churn. I am genuinely frightened There is no doubt that this government can and simply say that we are not ready. But Australian families will be affected? My greatest disappointment is not with this union movement. I have got a lot of respect for their leaders, who blindly follow and try helping her through this carbon tax debacle support a carbon tax. There are glib claims ourselves into a post-carbon generation and now, we are somehow disadvantaged. But it that, just these glib promises of a beautiful I am quite happy to have Cate Blanchett say from being a universally adored actress to a expect a little bit of pushback. When I see GetUp!, which is union funded, to hide behind for paying the bills, that's why I want a carbon that lacks all credibility, I can understand about this government move to cynicism.

Now that the private sector public sector contract as it should. By contracting cuts that have been introduced, this This forms part of a very enviable record economy. We kept Australia out of recession, envy of the developed world, but, much more difficult decisions in the heat of the moment where the opposition has got its decisions during the height of the global economic crisis would be on the dole queues now if Tony have done in bringing the budget back to consolidation which is underway at the moment stark contrast to the spendathon that we mark 1. It stands in stark contrast to the opposition in its costings in the lead-up to the utter inability of the opposition to state where budget back to surplus. They say they could to us exactly where they would do that or how because they have no idea how they would do that. I said that this was a jobs budget. And it is private sector returns to growth, an increased economy. And in seeing that increased demand the capacity constraints within the economy the Howard government. That is particularly very significant emphasis in this budget on fund, which will provide 130,000 training places income bonus, which will provide $1,700 to security, to the supporting of working people jobs were supported-200,000 Australians working but for the stimulus package put in its election the Labor government has created creation of another half a million jobs over the disciplined budget that will see the federal budget It is on track by virtue of the budget we have through very difficult spending decisions-$22 the lowest level of spending increases in the last record on the part of the Treasurer, Wayne the lowest level of spending increases in the time of the stimulus package during the global will be back in the black in 2012-13, we will consolidation in the federal budget ever. is that when during the global economic crisis its place the public sector expand through the is returning to growth, we in turn are seeing the in the way that it is through the spending in turn will reduce pressure on inflation. that this government has in managing this we have delivered an economy which is the importantly than that, we have made very where we have got those decisions right and wrong.

Similarly the work we surplus, as we will in 2012-13, and the fiscal through disciplined spending cuts, stand in saw during the Howard years during mining boom $11 billion black hole that was presented by the last election and stands in stark contrast to the it would engage in spending cuts to bring the have done that this year but they do not explain they would do the hard work in getting there so because it understands that we will see, as the demand for labour within the Australian for labour it is very important that we remove which existed during mining boom mark 1 under so in the case of skills shortages.

In making a contribution to that debate, local government in regional Australia has a role that local government plays within explaining why that is. We have been witnessing in Australia over tier of government. And that is not surprising, tyranny of distance. We are a population of economy. So it makes sense that we have one local service delivery occurring at a local tier of government? Mostly, the answer to that question fair to say that the Victorian government plays within Melbourne than it does within regional Melbourne's transport system are all issues which regional airports, regional ports, regional transport Economic development is simply not the same in the context of the work of the Victorian government. We need a local government that and garbage and actually looks at economic development. are having in Geelong. At the outset, I would undertaken by Karingal for Barwon Water for Alcoa at Point Henry.

The Port of Melbourne, Tullamarine, are instinctive to the state government, but systems are nowhere near as instinctive. issue for regional cities as it is for Melbourne government. So, in Geelong, we need strong local goes beyond the issues of potholes, footpaths It is a very critical debate that we like to commend the council, which I think does NA a great job in the context of its work. Mayor council very well. The debate in Geelong has directly elected mayor, which is an interesting question. I want to make three suggestions in the time for the City of Greater Geelong. First of all, term. The fact that John Mitchell has served he has grown into the job and has provided elections are entitled to see a mayor emanate of the council. Having a directly elected mayor duration and that sense of connectivity-but The second thing is that we need to see councillors, as we do now, makes it simply impossible best judgment. It means that the judgment that which is brought to bear by the council officers, have the same connection to the voters as the every election. Having professional councillors much more. That would be a very democratic represent a quarter of a million people. We The third point is that we need to raise council. We need to have the person responsible directly to the council, a point that",165

In talking about the budget to make. The first is with regard to the carbon was that it made no reference to the carbon because there was no detail. Yet the mining tax included in the budget. Why, then, wasn't the that it is going to have across the nation on our agricultural sector? There will not be a part will not hit and will not impact on. like to make on the carbon tax. One is that I was no new spending on bringing the rest of the global problem with a global solution. What we trying to get our foreign minister a seat on and do whatever he wants to do in the United greatest moral issue of our time. Yet there is to do globally to get a global solution to this on what impact the carbon tax will have. I that we are seeing. There was a very good report yesterday that showed that five years after the of $36 a tonne-which is not unreasonable-you are NA likely to see a wheat-growing property incur community has to deal with the weather, the are whacking a $36,000 impost on them as a that in the budget? No, we do not. Do we get manufacturing sector, a key sector? Portland huge inroads into cutting their emissions. As already cut their emissions by 20 per cent. That in some way or, if not rewarded, they should Yet, what will the carbon tax do? It will penalise for already having started this work in reducing emissions. That is what we are going to see occur across costs which they have been hit with, which has good work in cutting emissions, will count for carbon tax again. While some of the bigger maybe get permits up to a 95 per cent free allocation; will not. They will be hung out to dry with areas. It is our small manufacturers in our country It is extremely disappointing that we saw particularly when it will start on exactly the and the mining tax was included in the budget. preferred that it was not because, only a few Western Australian government blew a big hole built on a house of cards. It is a budget that have seen, it has been a long time between budget surplus. Before we focus on three years time, and that we should focus on the here and now because for the last financial year. I just want to put was handed down a week before the federal Victorian budget is $47 billion. So our second the spending in health, education and transport, handed down in this last federal budget. It does not get any better next year. The that? We already have debt of $106 billion day of Labor debt. Just think for a moment what moment about the $96 billion debt that Labor office. Think of the length of time it took us on a minute surplus in three years time, we now, and that is budget deficit followed increasing to $106 billion, which amounts to see now is the government saying, 'We're asking We're going to do the same.' But unfortunately stop. We saw a very glitzy presentation of the am right in saying that so far we have seven additional costs of $36,000. Our farming dollar and overseas commodity prices. Now we result of the carbon tax. Do we get a mention of a mention on what impact it will have on our Aluminium in my electorate have already made a matter of fact, based on 2005 levels, they have is fantastic work and they should be rewarded at least be acknowledged in some way for that. them even further and they will get nothing our manufacturing sector. The high energy led them in many instances to try and do very nought because 'whack' they will get hit by the manufacturers may be able to get permits, and the smaller manufacturers in Australia devastating consequences especially in regional towns that provide the majority of our jobs. no reference to the carbon tax in the budget, same date as the mining tax, 30 June next year, I think the Treasurer, Mr Swan, would have weeks after the mining tax was included, the in Mr Swan's budget. It is a budget which is may get a surplus in three years although, as we drinks before a Labor government delivered a is in part what the Treasurer wanted us to do, we saw a budget deficit of $47 billion dollars that in perspective.

What has been alarming, though, is that, funding, the broader funding to regional Australia in the two rural Independent seats. This is for all Australia. They should not pork-barrel what is a very weak government. Before I conclude, I could not sit down without without doubt it was one of the best budget parliament. Tony Abbott gave a speech pitched families who are doing it tough as a result especially a prime minister, that does not seem to these forgotten families.

It is that sort of waste especially when you think about what this budget of living pressures. It did nothing. 50 per cent since 2007.

Numbers do not lie. are things that should be at the forefront for improvements in the quality of life of its citizens. When I ask Australians, as I do in my electorate expenditure within the federal budget is, most as is education. Lots of different answers are always like to note in this place that the single budget, what we spend money on here in Canberra, budget, at $121 billion this year. The largest double the health budget. It is four times budget. That is always an important starting point to reduce the welfare budget in Australia, to do not believe we are. I do not believe that is single dollar of individual income taxation that back out in the form of welfare, and that something future governments will have to change under the current government. There year-$50 billion. Today we refer to a billion peak at $107 billion. That is the single Australian government. We pause often in the events, but I reckon it is worth a minute's silence debt in Australian history, racked up in just legacy for all Australians. When you think about debt and deficit, you government. And too often we see from a Labor its spending habits not a carrot and stick approach. And that is something This government seems to think that taxation government, are the answer to every single challenge. That is why, since 2007, Labor was most famously the alcopops tax, which campaign to reduce drinking rates. That was which of course has not happened. There was tax; the flood levy; and the LPG excise. order of $130 million. I am hopeful that this next Health and Hospitals Fund regional round, Finally, and whilst appreciating that many that the bid by the City of Griffith in the project in partnership with St Vincent's will to speak on yet another Labor budget, legacy of debt and deficit. It is impossible to on in Australia today without considering The ruthless efficiencies of figures and numbers any responsible government that seeks to deliver regularly, what the biggest single item of say health. Defence is another popular answer, given. But it always dismays me to note and I biggest item of expenditure within the federal is of course welfare, the human services item of federal expenditure is welfare. It is the defence budget. It is 2½ times the education for this discussion, because we have to find ways ensure that we are not a nation of rent seekers. I worthy of a country like Australia. Almost every is taken in by the federal government is sent is something I do not agree with. I think it is change. There is no doubt that is not going to is now a deficit of $49.4 billion this financial like it is going out of fashion. Net debt will largest amount of net debt accumulated by any chamber for all kinds of solemn occasions and to note that we have the highest level of net four short years by this government. That is a have to think about the approach to take into government that is spiralling out of control in approach-the carrot is all gone-but just a stick I want to speak about further. or penalties, the punitive powers of problem that the government faces, every single has announced 14 new or increased taxes. There was supposed to provide for an education the justification for that increase in taxation, an increase in the luxury car tax; the mining There was a new tax on Australians working NA overseas, making it more difficult for people and bring it back to Australia; a cut to the amount free; new restrictions on business losses employee share scheme. Some were even abandoned. There were taxes on cigarettes of up to 25 per on tax claims for medical expenses; fringe benefits the biggest tax of all, a big new carbon tax. to punitive measures. But there are other things in this budget consider. My approach, and the Liberal Party's not on saying that people are doing the wrong create all these disincentives. For them to earn, we ask them to do, our approach says that there That is a better way of doing government and budget, there are many measures which go Labor government's budgetary settings today-things self-funded retirees, making it more difficult fund their own retirement without government and measures like halving the rate for upfront today you can pay your HECS fees upfront and incentive. That is a decent incentive that will education upfront. Why would we want them People paying their education expenses upfront in the long run. It gets capital into the education to 10 per cent is a removal of an incentive saves the government money in the long run, a Labor government addicted to spending is are doing the wrong thing.' There is no ode make a big difference in the long run. That is why I am so opposed to this government's because they cut $2 billion from the Defence Party's website it says the No. 1 priority defence. It acknowledges that its own government's the nation. Yet in this budget we see a $2 billion serious attention given to defence expenditure defence white paper, which calls for a rapid serious long-term capital acquisition of key reduction in overall defence spending, without challenges outlined in that white paper, how Australia term and, more importantly, how we can fund government addicted to debt and deficit. Of course this government has omitted serious carbon tax is one, notably-and they use the enough! What would you say then, about coming from Australia to go and earn money Australians can put into superannuation taxclaimable for tax purposes; and changes to the All of these were announced by Labor. cent; ethanol tax increases; tighter restrictions tax in the 2011-12 budget; and, of course, That is why I say that this government is addicted which I think are very relevant for this House to approach, to government is built on incentives, thing out there in the economy so we need to create, innovate, employ and do the things that should be incentives built into government. that is why I think that, hidden within this to the heart of what is wrong with the federal like lowering the drawdown rate for for a person to retire under their own steam, to assistance after they decide to stop working, fees. When you go to university in Australia get a 20 per cent discount. That is called an drive, and has driven, people to pay for their to do that, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker? save the government money not just now but system. So halving the rate from 20 per cent that works, a removal of something that actually which is what incentives do. But all we see from taxation, punishment and settings that say, 'You to genuine incentives, which would of course approach to fiscal matters, not only budget. When you go to the Australian Labor of a national government should be the nation's first priority ought to be the defence of reduction for expenses in defence without and the capital acquisition outlined in its own expansion of Australia's defence forces, including items. None of that is funded. In fact we see a any consideration of how we will meet the will be able to defend itself in the long it. That is yet another consequence of a Labor and substantial items from its budget. The excuse that the GST was not in the budget. Fair the biggest single item of Commonwealth NA expenditure in this country's history, the include that in the budget bottom line, considering item of government expenditure ever? I think not bode well for this country's future that the approach to the nation's finances. The member speech about the NBN, and I think he made some the industry. What we have is the NBN experience of construction, no record of achievement into a niche of the market and attempting to investors, allegedly-although that will remain eloquently outlined, the recipe there-when all don't do the things you are doing the way you work'-is one that will be a serious challenge current government running it. The NBN is not in the budget. The difficult to get a figure of how many billions the government feast. Is it $20 billion? Is it $26 billion? Is be $40 billion or $50 billion? It keeps going cent of households in a country like Australia, be overestimated. They cannot be overestimated when the industry is saying, 'Don't do that; severe. The carbon tax is also a very serious issue suggest that many Australians support environmental practices, dealing with badly economy into a cleaner and greener future. incompatible with the advancement of human questions is for us to advance-to use technology upon the planet is minimised. However, for the government to suggest that environmental challenges is one dimensional. achieve the aims of the government to households, by industry or by anybody else. The is a disincentive to do something. In this case, a disincentive to emit carbon, to create services. But the government suggests to this place insult to the intelligence of every member government will compensate individual course the government suggests most of them will be compensated and exempted, and indeed seeking complete exemptions. If there is created by a carbon tax, for all of those households National Broadband Network? Why would we not that this will be the single most expensive there is an answer to that as well, and it does government is taking such a reckless and casual for Bradfield made an eloquent appropriation very valid points. He is a serious man from Co., which started from the ground with no in a particular industry, now moving dominate it, funded by the taxpayer and other to be seen. As the member for Bradfield of the industry is saying, 'don't do it this way; are doing them, because you will not make it for this country's future, especially with the thing about the budget today is that, if you try is spending on the NBN, it is a moving it $30 billion? Is the total cost of the NBN going to up. And, if you are trying to put a cable to 93 per I would suggest to you that your costs cannot because the cost and expense of doing that you don't need to do that,' is obviously quite for this country's future. There are polls that action on climate change: improving our polluting industries and indeed transitioning our Those are instincts that I think are not beings. In fact, the only answer to those to our best ability to ensure our impact the tax system will provide the answer to our It is wrong and it is demonstrably not going to reduce the emission of carbon by individual concept of a tax, once again, is very clear-it you are putting a tax into the economy to create carbon or to use carbon-intensive products and and to every member here-and it is really an and the Australian people-that somehow the households. We do not know how many, but of and that everybody will be better off. Industry there are now whole states and territories no disincentive to use carbon, which would be and all of those industries, how will our NA emissions reduce? The answer is always unclear; you know? Haven't you worked it out? We've Recently it was revealed that New South the price for electricity that Victoria is-double. now because of billions of dollars of underinvestment network. So effectively what you have had on carbon. Electricity generation is the No. carbon. Everybody knows the challenge; governments New South Wales and Queensland you have had of electricity in Victoria.

Neither electricity is very stable across the nation electricity generators or those essential items carbon emissions. That, of course, is the proposal. That, of course, goes At a time when in New South Wales we have increases that are hurting families across and I have the highest rate of families with great concern that this government does not political issue in Australia today. We are absorb cost increases. Households are already They have absorbed substantial cost increases. of Sydney and speak about electricity prices business reliant on energy will tell you, that that is unsustainable. So for this government cost of living through a carbon tax and that benefit is something that I regard as irresponsible. In summary, Labor being addicted to debt and in our country's history. That will all have carbon tax and its consequences when Labor restoration of a government that has the ability and not take a punitive approach it is always vague. It is always, 'Oh, don't got a snide sort of view of these things.' Wales and Queensland are today paying double We have been paying double for some time in the power grid and in the power in New South Wales and in Queensland is a price 1 reason why Australians do emit high amounts of know the challenge.

That will reduce expenses by savings from this measure will be redirected the history of this it probably does not mean very clearly a betrayal.

One parent, officer, is earning $65,000 and the other typical part-time worker who contributes to That is a very significant hit on their family to capacity. Families will also be hit through the changes in this budget. That will affect directly income threshold; it will have flow-on effects insurance, because premiums will inevitably have insurance. What is not included in this budget but should will have a dramatic additional impact on cost-of-living this government that went to the last election under a government that Julia Gillard leads, and is planning on introducing that.

Unless there is a change of direction on may set Telstra up to be paid twice for its failure of NBN Co's recent construction tender, exposed as unaffordable, unnecessary and unachievable. Let me say one more thing about the current Co. and Telstra, and the apparent attempt to governments into the Conroy model regardless different government with different policies of law and property rights. But, nonetheless, we are returned to government, the interests measure available to us to ensure that taxpayers consumers of the NBN service get broadband Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) (21:49): spruiked as a very Labor budget. He was spot about taxes, spending and debt. Hiking up taxes does not get any more Labor than that. It is the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are with fundamental test of easing the cost-of-living higher prices everyday-higher electricity network design can deliver speeds high the home at half or less of the cost. As Alcatel'The economics of fibre to the node are hard cent or less than those of fibre to the home.' currently being negotiated, the NBN will pay value terms-about $16 billion in nominal copper customer access network. But as the deal Co. or a future government from either side were cheaper and equally effective fibre-to-the-node would be required to renegotiate its deal with it has already paid Telstra to decommission. That the door and yet another case of having no plan B. Committee on the NBN, its CEO, Mike to seek the right to use any part of the it had the option to deploy fibre to the node, that he had not sought to acquire the right to use government had not told him to do so and, in any many of us thought, as we listened to him, it more lazy billion dollars of taxpayers' money. would pay a private company $16 billion to itself, as part of the deal, the right to use as NBN design were to be changed. But this is Swan and Prime Minister Gillard inhabit-a are always new tax hikes available to cover the part of the government, the Telstra/NBN deal copper network if, as seems inevitable after the the current architecture of the network is negotiations between the government, NBN use long-term contracts to lock future Australian of the democratic right of voters to choose a on broadband. We in the coalition respect the rule we will be utterly committed to ensuring that, if of the taxpayers are protected. We will use every get value for money with the NBN and that at an affordable price. (Time expired) I rise today to speak on what the Treasurer on. This budget is quintessentially Labor. It is and sending the country into the red: it really also a budget that proves how out of touch both everyday Australians, because it fails the pressures for Australian families, who face prices; higher gas prices; higher water prices; NA higher bus fares; higher food prices; higher budget addresses those things. The simple truth so clearly exposed in this finances. This government and its predecessor, a hash of the budget process that Australian order to paper over the black holes created Treasurer assures us that he will deliver a surplus budget of the future, perhaps embarrassed by that he does not seem to want to talk about the a surplus will be delivered in 2012 when my years older than the member for Longman, has lifetime? From the decision to impose a freeze affect families earning more than $45,000 a this Labor budget has nothing for families at all. My electorate of Groom is an area that is floods of earlier this year. That is no thanks which has kept the millions-in fact, quarter red tape and incompetence. It is not the Bligh gone out and done something to relieve the affected by the floods in January. I, my Toowoomba have helped those people affected that the Prime Minister of Australia has driven who are yet to have their insurance claims for to them? No. Did she ask the Assistant Treasurer It is me and my good officers and the people the people of Oakey so that they can have their both the Labor government of Queensland and the Premier nor the Prime Minister have lifted a finger. But the good news is that we will win, spirit and the community based fundraising supported them along the way. While the homes infrastructure that will not be fixed so easily. now are operating with half of what they had is operating on: half of the road to Brisbane has not driven that road. She chooses to fly flooded houses, does not stop, comes into then leaves again. She does not actually understand by a range crossing that was severely damaged commitment to fix it. The commitment the million to acquire the corridor, and we then lost the election in 2007 and with that the With a bit of luck and, again, no thanks to to Brisbane by Christmas next year. cost-of-living pressures. But nothing in this budget is that Labor cannot manage Australia's led by the member for Griffith, has made such families are being slugged again and again in by this government's mismanagement. The in 2012. He is so fond of talking about this what he has presented to the parliament so far, current budget.

It is a great disappointment to me six times past the houses of people in Oakey the flood settled. Did she stop? No. Did she talk to see if he could sort out the problems? No. who support me who are out there fighting for insurance claims settled. It is an indictment on the Labor government of Australia that neither no thanks to the government. It is the community that will give those people relief, and I have are being rebuilt, there is one critical piece of I wonder how many people in Australia right before Christmas-and that is what Toowoomba that we had before Christmas. The Prime Minister in. She lands at Oakey, drives past all these Toowoomba, makes herself out to be a hero and that Toowoomba is connected to the east by the flood, and her government has no Howard government made was spending $43 allocated $700 million to begin construction. We people of Toowoomba have been left high and dry. the federal government, we might have two lanes NA The impact on my electorate is of course development of Western Queensland will be happy to take the PRRT money from the oil and not prepared to return a single solitary cent-not head-no money from the PRRT collected in spending in Queensland. Ms Smyth: I was checking the time, actually. Mr IAN MACFARLANE: Not a cent. You read the budget, because it says that there is For those trucks that travel through Toowoomba, dollars that the Bligh government collects hopes to collect. Ms Smyth: Thanks for your support on the flood levy. Mr IAN MACFARLANE: I am sure the people flood levy were they to get a cent of that will take one cent, but we get nothing of course. And we all know that new taxes are part of through a flood levy but through an LPG levy, through a carbon levy, through the mining Petroleum Resource Rent Tax. Every time the tax and get nothing back. This is a tax and spend government. It is manage its money. It is a government that has operation to a $107 billion debt. It is a government and does not respect the taxpayers of Australia, contribute it to a government that wastes it. Missing from this budget are the figures change nothing in terms of emissions of the world. greenhouse gases in the world, because all it to Russia, to India, to Indonesia, to Korea and in the last few days that they are not going suggestion that there is a global agreement countries have made it absolutely clear that they of the Kyoto agreement. So, here we have a government in Australia further into debt, a budget that offers Australian budget where families know that this government way that produces a tangible outcome for all every other country steps back from an agreement while Australia is quite prepared to continue industries move overseas. This budget is a disgrace. And the disgrace government that handed it down. We have a disastrous and the impact on the economic affected as well. Whilst this government is gas enterprises to the west of there, they are a cent. I see the member opposite lift her Queensland will be returned in infrastructure want to check your own facts. You should not a cent for the people of Western Queensland. not a cent will be returned from all the and all the dollars that the Gillard government of Toowoomba would be happy to pay a flood levy back-just one cent would be good. We this new budget. Taxes will be applied not only through a CNG levy, through an LNG levy, tax levy, of course, and through the PRRT, the people of my electorate look up they pay a new a government that has a history of being unable to managed to take a $70 billion cash in the bank that does not know the value of money who have to earn that money before they of the carbon tax-this much vaunted tax that will It will change nothing in terms of lowering will do is move industry from Australia to China, to all of those countries that have made it clear to continue to tax their industries under any on lower greenhouse gas emissions. Those will not sign up to the extra emissions targets that delivers a budget that drives Australia families no hope but for higher taxes, and a cannot manage to spend the money in a Australians. Then the government watches as on lowering greenhouse gas emissions to tax our jobs and our industries while those of this budget is only surpassed by the Treasurer who has no idea of what it means to NA manage an economy, to deliver a budget in Australian people that this government actually that can actually put in place projects that work. In the 15 seconds left, I will talk a little will talk a little about the Building the Education Australians know that this budget continues any hope for the future. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted.",208
