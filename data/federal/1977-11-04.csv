The humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth: That because television and radio (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are farnily media watched and heard by many children at all times, and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, they therefore need stronger control than other media and the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both national ABC, and commercial sectors. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Government will amend the Broadcasting and Television Act, in relation to both national and commercial broadcasters, to legislate (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in the best interests of the general public, (b) for a 'Dual System of Regulation' enforced by the Australian Broadcasting Tnbunal by internal regulation and external control, (c) for an independent consumer body to represent the best interests of the general public, and (d) for immediate and effective penalties to be imposed for breaches of program and advertising standards.

The humble petition of the undersigned citigravid zens (students, parents, teachers) showeth: That the decision by the Government forms of nnancial assistance to students of non-State tertiary institutions is in total conflict with stated Government cation policy. The decision will result in a shortage of places for training secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand upon the State Government education systems. At a time of severe economic disruption, this action must lead to a serious worsening of the current employment situation, particularly school leavers.

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the weakest members of our society, the unborn, should have the same protection as all other citizens of Australia.

That on 10 May 1973 the House of Representatives rejected the Medical Practices Clarification Bill which sought to legalise abortion on demand in the Territories controlled by the Federal Government. That women and girls with serious problems during pregnancy need special care and help to overcome their difficulties rather than encouragement to terminate their pregnancies. That termination of pregnancy can never be justified on sociological or personal grounds and can be a dangerous treatment when the mother realises that her child has been killed. That over 46,000 abortions were paid for in 1976 under the existing Medical Benefits Schedule which stipulates the benefit payable for medical services under both Medibank and the pnvate health insurance funds.

I do not have the exact details of the number of agents; do I know the specific details of their names. I will seek information from my colleague the Minister for Adrninistrative Services and make the information available to the honourable member. NA",16
17,Mr SAINSBURY,OECD ECONOMIC REVIEW,I ask the Prime Minister whether he can expand on the answer he gave yesterday to the question asked by the honourfor able member for Oxley in relation to the the Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development review of the Australian economy.,17
18,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OECD ECONOMIC REVIEW,"Since the question yesterday from the honourable member for Oxley concerning the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development review of Australia, which he suggested had been completed, I have made some inquiries. The fact is that the processes leading to the review not even been started. The honourable member asserted that the Government has been successhave ful in suppressing publication of the review from its normal period in December and having held over until the middle of next year. So from publication of the review in December being normal, not one of the four reviews so far issued has been published in that month. The facts are that the December 1972 review was published in February 1973, the April 1974 review was published in June 1974, the July 1975 review was published in August 1975, and the December 1976 review was published in February 1977. It ought to be noted that the only one of these reviews which was published during the honourable member's term as Treasurer appeared in August, not in December, 1975. gaps between these reviews have been 16, 14 and 18 months. The honourable member for Oxley seems to be suggesting that the OECD should now be prowould ducing another review only 10 months after last review. That would be out of all normal cedures. From very old days, conspiracy theories have been part of the mind stuff sition, but there is no of substance in this instance. The conspiracy which the honourable member for Oxley is seeking to trump up now seems far fetched even for him. As the Treasurer said, Australia has nothing fear from an examination of policies by interand national organisations. In fact, we have the usual team from the International Monetary Fund Australia at the moment. The usual discussions with the OECD secretariat have been proceeding in the normal way with a view tofindinga mutudisaster ally convenient time for an OECD mission to visit Canberra and for our officials to receive them. Australia must be fitted into the OECD program which has about 20 member countries. As it happens, there may be an OECD mission in Austraha next month, but that matter remains be officially determined. If it does occur it will probably mean a publication of the resulting review of Australia in about April 1978. So much that farrago of falsehoods which seems to be only meat the Opposition has had for the last and two or three weeks. Let us look at the figures that the honourable gentleman quoted in his question. The Government and its advisers are quite unaware of their origin. Certainly they do not appear in any OECD document yet available in Canberra or any document yet available to our official delhave egation to OECD in Paris. Perhaps the honourable member for Oxley or his friends in Paris been opening some mail there also. No doubt the OECD, Uke the Opposition, has not yet it caught up with the transformation of this far country's economic prospects which in the last six weeks have brought a dramatic improvement in the outlook for inflation, as a result of the September quarter consumer price index, the very strong figures issued recently by the Australian Statistician for business capital expenditure for the current half year, which are up 14 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms, and the sharp change in attitudes towards the balance of payments and the exchange rate since the end of September. If the OECD or anyone else is talking of a GDP deflator of 10V4 per cent for the calendar year The 1978, then like the honourable member for Oxley, it does not know what it is talking about. Currently the Government's advisers' own conservativefigureswould be around IVi per cent. As to growth next year, our advisers' figures be roughly double the rate quoted by the the honourable member. Even that well known procharacter whom the honourable member is so fond of quoting, Blind Freddie, would put him of the Opporight on that one. What does all this add up to? The honourable gentleman seeks, as a result of a short period into the Treasury, to give respectability to his claims to what he says, but they are a thorough garbling of the facts, a use of falsehoods, a search in for conspiracies where none exist and a desperate search for any basis at all on which to hang the Opposition's fond hope of economic for Australia. There is only one basis on which there could ever be economic disaster for this country. That is if the Leader of the Opposition were ever again to be in charge of this nation's affairs. Then it would be a true economic disaster, and that is why his soliciting even for a to mere two-year term will be rejected. NA",17
19,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN WOOL CORPORATION,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. Is it correct that over the past two weeks the Australian Wool Corporation sold 20,000 bales of wool ex Flushment? ing on the basis of f.o.b. prices in Australia? this mean that the purchasers have bought the wool without having to pay freight so, does this mean that the Corporation tively undermined its own reserve prices and this case has caused the drop in the wool over the last week? Does it mean a possible to wool growers of up to $600,000?",18
20,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN WOOL CORPORATION,"I know the honourable member is seeking to learn a little bit about agriculture. One of the elements of trying to ensure stability in a market for a commodity the recognition that whatever is said in this liament needs to be heard not just within these four walls but around the markets of the world. The Australian Wool Corporauon has been a most effective marketing body. I do not know anything of the instance which the honourable member has just suggested has happened but do know that Corporation stocks held abroad assisting have each been sold in the past-I would sume on this occasion also-o n the basis of all costs being included in the price charged for a particular line of wool. I will investigate the cumstance that the honourable member has strength alleged. I can assure this House and the wool buyers around the world that the Corporation operates a flexible reserve. It sets the level of that reserve on a daily basis. It maintains a strong stable ing force. When sales are negotiated outside Australia those sales are normally on the basis the cost of the wool at that particular point where it has been delivered. If there should be a varitions ation in any particular sale that might tiated, I have no doubt that the variation is on a very good premise, and indeed as far Australian wool growers are concerned, since return to office and the maintenance of a firm wool reserve and a sympathetic understanding of thefinancialpolicies of the Corporation, there has been no doubt that the Australian wool growers' interests have been well protected. I have little doubt that exactly the same has hap1inister pened in this circumstance. I will investigate circumstance and write to the honourable memPrime ber about it. NA",18
21,Mr HAMER,DUAL PORTFOLIOS,"My question is lo the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen a sugges Mr tion that one Minister could act as Minister for Defence and Foreign Affairs? Are the poltiical and adroinistrative responsibiUties of the Minister for Defence such that he could also act as Minister for another major departWhen the Foreign Affairs ministry was Does last combined with other major responsibilities, were those other responsibuities carried out in a to Europe? If satisfactory manner? has effec Mr MALCOLM FRASER-I believe that in anyone who is aware of public adniinistration in market Australia would well know that the Defence loss ministry carries very heavy administrative responsibiUties. After all, for a long while there were in that area Ministers for the separate Services and a Minister for Defence. How the Minister for Defence can preserve his calm and is undertake in full the responsibiUties formerly Parundertaken by four Ministers, I sometimes find difficulty in understanding. It is worth noting that in the United Kingdom where there is a unified structure, in many ways not dissimilar from our structure, there are a number of junior Ministers and Assistant Ministers- I think, from memory, I aboutfivein all in the United Kingdom contextthe Secretary of State for Defence. It is precertainly a very fulltimejob indeed. I also would have thought that being Foreign Minister is a fulltimejob if it is to be done well cirand properly, with a degree of sensitivity and such as we have seen over the last two years. I trunk my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, beUeves that he has been fuUy occupied in his functions as Minister for Foreign Affairs. How anyone, especiaUy someone who at buysome stage had been mvolved in government administration in Australia, could ever contemof plate combining these two offices, I just fail to comprehend. Of course, there have been suggesthat some people could do these jobs well be negoand combine them and that there was an based occasion when the ministry of Foreign Affairs as was combined with the ministry of the Prime our Minister and Cabinet under the previous Administration. I rather think that the administration of Australia's affairs failed very dismally during that period, but I am not sure whetherMr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, I raise a E oint of order. Is it in order for the present Prime to reflect on Mr Menzies in that way? It the will be remembered that Mr Menzies, while Minister, also took over the post of Minister for External Affairs.",18
22,Mr SPEAKER,DUAL PORTFOLIOS,Order! That is not a point of order. E. G. Whitlam-We are all embarrassed a combined by his record in that period,18
23,Mr SPEAKER,DUAL PORTFOLIOS,Order! The honourable investments gentleman will resume his seat. Mr E. G. Whitlam-It is not fair to treat man in this way.,19
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DUAL PORTFOLIOS,The monkey in gentleman the zoo? The honourable gendeman knows quite well that he was the person in the previous Administration who was being referred to. Mr E. G. Whitlam-No; you were stabbing Leader another Liberal leader in the back.,19
25,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DUAL PORTFOLIOS,"The honourable the Australian entleman continues interjecting in defiance tanding Orders and abusing the privilege that you, Mr Speaker, accord to him as Leader of the Opposition. He does this when he is and when he does not like what is being Speaker Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, he is treating Menzies as he treated you and Gorton.",19
26,Mr SPEAKER,DUAL PORTFOLIOS,Order! The Leader of the position will resume his seat. I call upon the Prime Minister to complete his answer. I to remain relevant to the question. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to cease interjecting.,19
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DUAL PORTFOLIOS,"Mr Speaker, the those completion of the answer will be relatively if the honourable gendeman accords with request from the Chair. During the previous Administration there were occasions when one might have suggested that the good government of Australia was forfeited because the then Prime Minister was also Foreign Minister and ter out of the country a very great deal. On the other hand, when he gave up the job of Foreign Ministhe ter the administration of the country did not improve because he was here more. I think one can judge from that that the administrauon Australia might well have been better been overseas entirely. Under those circumstances Australia would have benefited. TREASURER: PECUNIARY INTERESTS Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask a quesuon of the mary producer. Prime Minister. He will note that I have placed question for him on the Notice Paper in the light of his answer to me two days ago that the rect Treasurer had mentioned to him the matter  the Treasurer or anybody else notice a statement by a director of the company named in my question that that company merely acted as a nominee company and that was uncomfortable about his name appearing a share register he could use the company to register his holding? Does the Prime Minister think it appropriate for a Minister to make or to hold mterests in a company in such a guise that the public cannot discover that a sick Minister's investments or interests?",19
28,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DUAL PORTFOLIOS,"If the honourable wanted to put a question of that kind on the Notice Paper he would be entitled to do so. I think that really the public would be much more interested to know the full details of all those people who pay into the private fund of the of the Opposition and of the cheques that he draws on that fund allegedly in the interests of Labor Party. So far as I know, that of political party is the only one where the leader has specific control over a slush fund of that kind. getting hurt AUSTRALIA AND THE EUROPEAN said.

30,Mr HOWARD,OPPORTUNITIES,"I think it would be clear to all honourable gentlemen in this House, particularly who sit on the Government side, that the short balance of trading opportunities between your Australia and the European Economic Community is totally unsatisfactory and totally inequitable to the efficient and competitive primary producers in Australia. For that reason the Government took the step of appointing a Miniswith specific responsibility for this area. It was very interesting to note that while I was overseas estimates for the Department of Special Trade Negotiations were considered and the attitude taken by the Opposition was simply that the of whole exercise was a waste of time. if he had Mr YOUNG - That is right.",19
31,Mr HOWARD,OPPORTUNITIES,"The honourable member for Port Adelaide says: ""That is right'. I think that ought to be on record for the benefit of every pria Mr BRYANT - I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. What the Minister says is quite incorConsideration of the Estimates was continuof ously gagged and no opportunity was provided brought to his to consider them.",19

The honourable member for if someone Wills will resume his seat. in Mr HOWARD-I think it ought to be on record that the Opposition thinks it is a waste of time to try to secure greater access to the largest trading bloc in the world. What the Opposition is saying to the primary producers of Australia that if it were m government it would not try improve access for the efficient primary profor the world. ducers of Ausualia into the largest trading bloc in the world. Every honourable member in House knows that it will not be easy our access into the European markets, who have the interests of primary producers heart will know that it is beholden on any tralian government to try to improve that access, to try to reduce the level of export subsidies in respect of the large surpluses that have been created in Europe through the operation of the common agricultural policy. After this Governonly ment is returned to office on 10 December it will continue its efforts to improve that situation. I believe that as a result of my visit to the nine governments of the European Economic Comtion munity there is now a much better understandfacilities ing, both of the depth of feeling throughout Australia and the fact that this Government not be easily dissuaded in its efforts to improve our access to those markets. While this Governceptability ment remains in charge of the nation's affairs will continue to try to improve markets to which our primary producers are undoubtedly entitled. NA",19

34,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NUCLEAR ENERGY,"The honourable the gentleman is asking me to repeat an answer which I gave yesterday. I said that Mr Justice Fox had given me approval to quote one sendeliberately tence from a letter which he had written to me. had discussions with him about it yesterday. made the situation perfectly plain following discussions in the United States. His Honour was not claiming any particular relationship between his own discussions and what happened later. Whether or not there was any he nowfindshimself in almost complete agreement with the United States officials in relation to these matters. The Deputy Leader of the Opbe position is continually trying to put the view is Australia should not be actively involved in into ternational forums seeking a safer arrangement this Mr UREN - What about what your Foreign to improve Minister said yesterday? but those Mr MALCOLM FRASER-What the at Foreign Minister said yesterday was completely Ausright, as one would expect. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is seeking to do is compaidpletely wrong, as one also would expect, knowing his affinities and knowing his circumstances in relation to these matters. It is important not for Australia but also for the world that Australia, as a supplier country, be actively involved in trying to seek safer international regimes in these areas. If one accepts that the full thrust of the original United States policy in relato the internationalisation of re-processing is unlikely to be achieved in its entirety, the kinds of proposals which are being discussed will by His Honour in international forums, and which are being met with a degree of acin a number of areas, surely ought to it be examined very closely if we are to achieve a access to those safer world. The honourable gentleman would much prefer that Australia have nothing to do with these matters. He has a remarkable expectancy that of fraternal parties in other parts of the whose working people are dependent upon the use or uramum to supply energy for his should become unemployed particular predelictions. It is policy. I ask not surprising that this a view of the Australian deny energy to countries in which need it to keep their factories There is not much difference between that view and the report on possible ways of increasing unemployment which was refened by me in Parliament yesterday. I made it perfectly plain yesterday that the Labor Party on that occasion had taken an action which was designed to increase unemployment. I Not only that, the Leader of the Opposition, He when he was Prime Minister, suppressed the his document. It was not published until several weeks after the decisions had been taken. Then it was tabled amongst all the other Budget documents, in the hope that nobody would see what direct relationship, was in it.",20

A later paragraph states: After our experiences of recent years the ALP has no intention of sitting by compliantly while it is being in its opinion screwed by television station licensees. It further states: Therefore 1 deem it appropriate that you should provide hour of primetimeto the ALP as the omciai Opposition. While I would prefer that such an hour be given to a similar on a week with the Opposition Leader, I am that we could negotiate a program which would be in almutually acceptable. Mr Combe wants to negotiate a television program. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that Mr Combe was not quite sure whether he wanted a week with the Leader of the OppoIsition or whether he wanted to use the television of time in some other manner. I think the most interesting paragraph of the letter is the last television paragraph. It states: in the event of us failing to receive equality of to that which is being given to the Prime MinisI would undoubtedly find it necessary to recommend to Executive that we lodge a formal complaint to the Broadcasting Tribunal and that failure to receive satisfaction to us contesting your right to have your licence when next it is under consideration.

The letters read asfollowsSir Kenneth Humphries, Chairman of TEN, Channel 10, Epping and Pittwater Roads, Nonh Ryde, NSW 2113 Dear Sir Kenneth, I write to you rather than to your General Manager because of my belief that it is more appropriate consider the matter which I am doubt that Mr Kennon is a most competent General Manager for your station closely associated with the formulation the now infamous television commercials John Singleton at the 1974 elecuon, and must therefore be assumed to have close associadon with our political opponents. I read this morning with some concern that your station has prepared and is putting to air next Friday night at time an hour long documentary about the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. My concern is based on the fact that to the best my knowledge no opponunity has yet been given to the position to have an hour of prime time on your channel. Your are no doubt aware of and have probably read my evidence to the recent Broadcasting Tribunal Inquiry into self-regulation of television stations. Equally, I am sure are aware of the Tribunal's Repon tent is concerned. While it did not recommend amendments to the law to enforce equality politics it did give strong suppon to the principle that licencees were obligated to be fair and equal. You will be aware that I brought to the Tribunal evidence showing that some stations in Australia had been most unfair 'program and inequitable in their treatment election periods. In particular at which Addresses to the Nation from the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader have been put to air on some staing tions. In the case of your station I madereferenceto the that, using the April 6 and April 13 addresses as an example,emergency Mr Fraser had been put to air at the prime viewing time 7.30 p.m. and that Mr Whitlam had competed with the 1977. National Anthem one week later at 11.58 p.m. After our experiences of recent years the ALP has no intention of sitting by compliantly while it is being in opinion screwed by television station licencees. This brings me back to the program in question. The proposed one hour long documentary, as it was filmed at ume when the Prime Minister was clearly seen to be in an election campaign, can an hour of prime time to the Government pirties. I am sure that not even the most ignorant Australian would argue at the time the documentary was filmed there was not ter than reasonable prospect of a general election in 1977. (Need I remind you that as long ago as early March I was your able to forecast that such an elecuon would take place). Therefore I deem it appropriate that you should provide an hour of prime time to the ALP as the official Opposition. While I would prefer that such an hour be given to a similar documentary on a week with the Opposiuon Leader, I am certain that we could negotiate a program which would be mutually acceptable. However, in the event of us failing toreceiveequality of opponunity to that which is being given to the Prime Minister, I would undoubtedly find it necessary to recommend to our Executive that we lodge a formal Broadcasting Tribunal and that should lead to us contesting your renewed when next it is under consideration.

The Tribunal received a letter from Mr David Combe, National Secretary, Australian Labor Party, enclosing a copy of a letter he forwarded to Sir Kenneth Humphreys, Chairman of Directors, Channel 10, Sydney, requesting that the channel provide an hour of prime time to the Leader of the Opposition. I am enclosing copies of both letters together with Sir Kenneth's reply to Mr Combe, which I have just received. The program was shown on Channel 0 Melbourne on Wednesday, 26 October, Channel 0 Brisbane on Thursday 27 October, and Channel 10 Sydney on Friday 28 October 1977. Channel 0 Brisbane informed me per phone on 26 October that they had sought legal advice from Henderson and Lahey who advised that provided two statements were edited out of the program they would not regard it as pohtical from an election point of view. (As you are aware it is an election period in Queensland for the State elections.) The Tribunal viewed the program yesterday and decided that it did not have power to act on Mr Combe's demand for equal time for the Opposition as it is not yet the election period for the Federal election. The election period as denned in the Act commences on the day of the issue of the writs and ends at midnight on the Wednesday next preceding the day of the polL The relevant section of the Act is section 116(3) which reads as follows: (3) If, during an election televises elecuon matter, he shall afford reasonable opportunities for election matter to all political parties which were represented in either House of the Parliament for which the election is to be held at the time meeting before the election period.

The Tribunal also decided that if the program was shown during the election period it ter and it would expect reasonable opportunities to be afforded to the Opposition. As regards the mention in Mr Combe's letter to the Tribunal's Report on self-regulation, the Tribunal decided it would be improper to act on any recommendations in the Report until such time as the Government makes a decision on the Repon.

Where is the depreciation reserve of $2,584m? Wul the Minister direct Telecom to reduce its telephone call charges or rentals or connection fees so as to reduce these exorbitant profits? Do most of the interest charges of $278m go to Treasury, and are they in other words another form of taxation on Telecom users? To settle this question of whether the profit is exorbitant, will he refer Telecom charges to the Prices Justification Tribunal so that it can carry out a full and frank investigation into the Telecom charging system? Do the charges of today represent the greatestrip-offof any concern in Australia?",23

54,Mr FIFE,DISMISSALS IN WODONGA,"I suppose that at this time of the election year we have to excuse members of the for getting off the track. The fact of the matter is that the people sitting opposite are the guilty men as far as unemployment in this country is concerned. They created the worse unsince the Great Depression and they are not helping the present Administration honourable to overcome the problem. The matter raised by the honourable member for Indi is a very important and very serious one. He has asked a question in relation to the dismissal of some 70 employees of Sanyo Guthrie Pty Ltd in Wodonga. I have had this investigated because it is one that con70 cerns me greatly. I am advised that the dismissals have occuned for two reasons. One is largely the power dispute in Victoria. I am bound to say that many people who lost their positions a so-called temporary period as a result of that dispute will not be re-engaged. It is an unfortunate fact that when disputes of this nature occur many people who are stood down are never re-engaged. The second reason is that large number of colour television sets are being imported. I understand this matter is being refened to by the management of the company I mentioned. I inform the House that on imported colour television sets a duty of 35 per cent of cost of the set less the picture tube is imposed. At present there is no application before Temporary Assistance Authority or the Industries Assistance Commission for additional assistance, but if the company makes apphcation the Minister for Industry and Commerce I can assure the honourable member and the House that that application will receive very careful considerauon. If a recommendation is made for a reference to go to the TAA or the IAC it also be considered expeditiously by me. This is a most important matter. The Government is extremely concerned about the employment situation in Australia and I am grateful, as indeed is the Government, to the honourable member for Indi for giving such strong support to the policies that are being pursued by this Government to protect Australian jobs and not to aggravate the cally unemployment position further by deliberately exporting jobs overseas as our predecessors did.

55,Mr WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"My question, which is addresthat sed to the Prime Minister, concerns gave earlier this week in which he claimed that Australia's rates of inflation and unemployment in comparison with those of selected overseas countries were worse under Labor than under own Administration. Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to a recent report by a sponsible economic commentator which demonrestraints strated that, in comparison with the average formance of all member countries of the cepted Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Australia's performance in respect ofeconomic growth, unemployment and inflation has detenorated since the Fraser Government came to office? If he has seen the report does he now acknowledge that by his earlier statements alleging the opposite misled the House? If he has not read the repon will he do so soon and learn the real facts of important matter?",25
56,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"The statements I made in answer to a question, emphasising the gross distortions in an interview on This Day night and a Willesee interview, were and are rect I say only two things in relation to the honourable member's question. Over the last two years only two of the major countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and a Development have reduced unemployment. I refened to a number of countries in which unemployment has increased. The Leader of the Opposition, carried away by his rhetoric, said: 'You cannot point to a country in the world where the these things have happened.' I was demonstrating very plainly that the Leader of the Opposition, if he did not know what he was talking the about, knew that he was talking falsely. With regard to inflation, excluding the to Medibank distortion, the gap between Australia's inflation and the average inflation in the OECD countries has been closed from 6 per cent to 7 per cent in 1975, which was Labor's inflation, to a situation in which Australia's inflawill tion broadly matches that of our major trading partners. It is worth noting the comments from other informed commentators who give advice to business houses around Australia. They all point to a continued downward thrust in inflation and the consumer price index leading to reduced interest rates and leading, as the Treasurer said yesterday, to 1978 being a good year economias long as the present Government's policies continue. The honourable member can thresh around as much as he likes. I respect him for trying to support an insupportable leader and for not taking the view that Senator Button took what his leader says is, in any case, an answer he irrelevant. NA",25

That has been done. We also said that we would establish a nadonal sports council. That sports council has met twice, once in September and once in October. I am pleased to report that request by that council for assistance in the sports program has met with wide response. On 23 and 24 October the council met to conthat sider requests. I am hopeful that within the week or so we will be able to announce what those allocations of money will be under the gram.

I ask: Has the Government had an opportunity yet to assess the impact of this scheme? If so, can the Prime Minister say whether it has assisted in algold leviating the serious problems faced by Tasindustries because of high freight costs? a gold Mr MALCOLM FRASER-In a Uttle under two years this Government has done more in terms of special policies for Tasmania than, I tliink, any other government has done since federation of Australia. A number of concerted policies have been announced and are operating. There is also a special report on the disabilities Tasmanian industries. An announcement yet be made in the other place by Senator Cotton will very shortly be made in this House by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Comthe munity Development. So far as freight equalisit ation is concerned, a number of specific benefits have flowed to Tasmanian industries. The cattle, sheep and pig industries have benefited; and vegetable industries have benefited to the extent of about $3m; confectionery and chocolate products, baled wool, pulp and waste paper, tin, newsprint and paper have benefited by nearly $6m-a n area m which I think the honourable gentleman might well have an interest In addition, the aluminium and zinc metal industries, as well as a number of other industries, have been advanced significantly. great many Tasmanianfirmsand a number of question other industries have benefited specifically as result of our pohcy on freight equalisation. I hope all honourable gentlemen in this House will be particularly pleased at the announcement that has been made about the spending of some $30m at Burnie. That reflects the confidence of Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd in do Australia's future. This company's decision to spend $30m on expansion, I venture might well not have occurred had it not been for the policies of freight equahsation. This indicates what we are doing forjobs and opportunities Tasmania. I think it ought to be said that the honourable gentleman and his Tasmanian colleagues quite constantly, vigorously and certainly very propperson erly have brought to the notice of Government Ministers the particular and special requirements of Tasmania.

A to government might get $40m or $50m out of comthese companies, even with Labor's vicious for taxes, and I do not think that $40m or $50m would go very far towards paying the $3 bilUon for the promises that the honourable gendeman made. At another point the honour The discussions able gendeman said: . . . we didn't have to devalue, we didn't have to said that twice. Later in the interview he said it again.

That reaUy was a plain, blautter and knowing falsehood of which the honourable gendeman must have been well If he was not aware of it and it was a moment's mental aberration, really it is a stance claim for him to make while he is trying to lead a poltiical party into an election, which I suppose his supporters are hoping he wtil lose.

I am advised that the realisation was approximately $1.7m. That represents not just the total cost value. The sales included a in small premium which is always added to cover added costs of holding wool outside Australia to compensate for the wool being sold priI vately.

78,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Leader of the Opposition has indicated to me that he claims to have been misrepresented. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of Opposition)- I seek leave therefore to make Assisting the a personal explanation. the infor Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gendeman on 5 Mr E. G. Whitlam-Today and yesterday, and maybe on an earUer occasion, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has misrepto resented what I have had to say on unemployployment ment in Australia and in other Organisation Economic Co-operation and Development counIt tries. I want to conect the position. Australia has normally had a lower rate of unemployment than the average for OECD countries. This remained true during 1974 and 1975. In 1974, Australia experienced an unemployment rate of the 2.2 per cent compared with the OECD average Labor was of 3.3 per cent. In 1975 the ngures were 4.3 per Unemployment cent for Australia and 5.1 per cent for the OECD the 1962-72 average average. Unemployment went up everywhere in that year. By the third quarter of 1976 the rate of States unemployment in Australia had risen to 5.2 per Canada cent, almost the same as the average rate in 1.7 OECD countries which was, by then, 5.3 per 157 perthat cent. By the second quaner of this year the rates match were identical-5. 5 per cent in Australia and Board repon poUtely also, on average, 5.5 per cent in the other OECD imports' but more properly countries. The second quarter of this year is the increase unemployment', demonstrated last quarter for which OECD ngures have been published. The cunent seasonally adjusted of unemployment in Australia has risen to 5.8 unemployment. per cent. It is unlikely that the average figure for the OECD countries when published, will be found to have risen to 5.8 per cent. Might I also mention a misprint in Hansard. Since the House will be rising soon the correction which wiU be made in the weekly Hansard will not be readily avaUable. Yesterday the Prime Minister was giving an answer to the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) in which he .quoted a letter from Mr Justice Fox in these terms: Whether my arguments and the changes related I cannot tell but Ifindmyself harmony. I interrupted and said: 'I think he said related'. The daUy Hansard shows me as I think he said 'casually related'. Hansard, I would have thought in enor, has me would repeating what the Prime Minister tells me that the weekly edition will contain the This words 'causally related' which is what I said and tralian which, I am sure, is what the judge said.",29

81,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Impliedly the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has misrepresented me in indicating that an answer I gave yesterday is not completely correct. He made an imputation about the figures that I gave in answer to a question. It is necessary recaU that in regard to inflation and unemwhen the Labor Party was in office the for Leader of the Opposition said: did not hit Australia worse than other countries. When it went bad under us it went bad in every Western country without exception. Those remarks were made during interviews on show.

In those comments he intruded remarks about a document which was before the Cabinet considering the Budget in mid-1973 and which was tabled with the Budget Papers in August 1973.

82,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,The motion will need to be put in writing and seconded.,31
83,Mr SINCLAIR,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"I move this motion because in the last few weeks the Leader of the Oppohas sition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has been appearing on a number of occasions on the media and around Australia and making statements which we beheve to be dehberately contrary to the real position. In circumstances in which he is offering himself to the Austrahan people as an alternative Prime Minister, we beheve that the suspension Standing Orders to debate a motion of this sort the onlyfitand proper way by which the ParUanumbers ment of Austraha and the people of Australia can adequately and effectively deliberate matters which we believe are being distorted before the eyes and the ears of every Australian. The position of Prime Minister of this country is such that no man can lay down his case and instance, purport that case to be true when in fact it is true without the people being advised to that effect. The proposal to suspend Standmg Orders is to ensure that the people of Australia look back at the real record, the real facts and the cumstances of the whole economic program of the Whitlam Government. It is imperative that we suspend Standing Orders so that we can deicy hberate on these matters. We believe that the various statements which have been made by the Leader of the Opposition in pubUc to the media, on the electronic media in particular, deliberately misleading the Australian matters of substance and matters of real concern. For that reason I have moved that we Standing Orders so that the debate can ensue the substantive motion.",31
84,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,Is the motion seconded?,31
85,Mr HOWARD,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,I second the motion.,31
86,Mr SCHOLES,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"The Oppofor sition will not oppose this motion for the suspenclear sion of Standing Orders. We reaUse that it is parUamentary tactic which is being foUowed for the purpose of giving the Government some and semblance of respectability in its claims electorate. We believe that Parliament is entitled to a debate on the economic management of the Government, and we wiU seek to have that dethe bate. We believe that the Government ought to be exposed for the sort of fraud that it has trated on this Parliament. In the deep hours the other night the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) came into the House and admitted to the Parliament that Question Time he had used the seasonal figures of two years ago and compared them with cunentfigures.Thus he gave false information to the Parliament. It is important that the Parliament debates the real issues. It is sitting at a time when an election has been called. In recent days the Government sought on every possible occasion to prevent debate on matters of substance relating to the election. The Opposition will not oppose the motion, even though we reahse that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) feel the need for this type of smokescreen in order to cover up matters of of real substance which ought to be debated in is the electorate. The Government will be using its to carry the motion. I am fairly certain that the Leader of the House was hoping that we on would oppose his motion. We wtil not. I can assure the Leader of the House and other honourable members who sit behind him that those people who pay the Medibank levy, for know that they pay it. It is not a mirage, not as the Prime Minister seems to suggest, in the cost of Uving. The levy comes out of the pockets of the people. It may be a mirage to honourable gendemen opposite. It is certainly important that cirthe Parliament should expose the deception and the damage that has been done to this country by the selfrighteous,opinionated approach to polof the Government. It has portrayed itself to everyone as God and has said that everyone who opposes it or suggests that it is wrong is guilty of a mortal sin and should be excommunicated are from the community. We do not propose to people on oppose the motion. suspend Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable on gendeman ought to keep theology out of the debate, if he does not oppose the modon. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (11.24)-The Opposition does not object to the suspension of Standing Orders the purpose of debating this matter. It is quite that only by allowing a debate on this mata ter will the Opposition be given the opportunity to put the correct facts in relation to Australia the rest of the world. I gave notice yesterday in the of a motion of censure. It was not taken immediately, as would be the normal practice. It is quite obvious from the antics of the Leader of House (Mr Sinclair) that he will not today move for the suspension of the Standing Orders perpeto take the motion of censure of which I gave notice yesterday. A week ago also I gave notice of a motion of censure. Again, the Leader of the at House did not foUow the normal procedure of immediately moving suspension of Standing the Orders to enable the censure motion to be debated. On subsequent days no such motion was taken. I have therefore taken the censure motion off today's Notice Paper. Instead, was hkely that the Government would not call the motion of censure of which I gave notice be debated today, I put the substance of that sure in the form of a matter of public importance. I anticipate that you will call on that debate, Speaker, because it is on the informal unofficial Blue Paper which we all have before us but that the Leader of the House will abort it by moving that the business of the House be called on whatever the formula is. The Opposition welcomes the opportunity of putting these questions straight in the ParliaThe ment. The Government has adopted the techministry nique of providing its back benchers, particularly those who will be in this place for the next week, with questions which give the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or the Treasurer (Mr Lynch)-whe n he is here-a n opportunity to make prepared speeches and an opportunity to member distort the facts and to misrepresent them composed pletely. Out of this farrago of falsehoods which ports constantly spews forth from the Prime Minister have and the Treasurer at Question Time, they and those who sit so forlornly behind them, gain some pubhcity.",31
87,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition refers to the matter before Chair, namely, the suspension of Standing have Orders. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I am supporting the modon for the suspension of Standing Orders. is only when a substantive motion is before the House that members of Parhament, bench and back bench, have an equal opportunity to put their cases. Question Time has so distorted by having Dorothy Dix questions thrown up by oncers to the Prime Minister or the Treasurer that the Opposition welcomes the opportunity to have a substantial debate. We have the the been constantly prevented from having that dedebated bate. I cannot remember a case when so many that are contained notices of censure have been ignored in this man-refer ner. There is one motion of censure paper which should be corning on today. It will meagre fashion, the Beefdebated not be coming on, so we can now put the case the motion which the Government will move. Let me say immediately, in case anybody bereports Ueves there is any substance in that part of motion which is now to be brought on which for states that I claimed that the Labor Government never devalued the Australian doUar, that course the Labor Government did devalue on one occasion. When, however, the Government went out of office the Australian dollar stood higher than when the Labor since it Government came in. The Australian doUar on stands much lower now than it did when the to Fraser Government was instaUed because of the cenfrequent devaluations that this Government has made. Devaluations were always a prickly matMr ter in the Government which preceded rnine. The right honourable member for Lowe (Sir WuUam MCMahon) has disclosed the fact-and I hope he will be given the opportunity to repeat it, for it is or a most valuable comment-that during the last debate that took place on devaluation in December 1971 he admitted that he was preparing to have a solely Liberal ministry sworn in. Country Party was to be omitted from the in the circumstances that he outlined. I do not want to go further, Mr Speaker, because last time you were the Treasurer at the time.",32
88,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Furthermore, the honourable should not go further because he is supto be discussing the reason why he supthe suspension of the Standing Orders. I given him very great latitude. I ask him to return to the specific question of why Standing hope to Orders should be suspended. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I believe that the Standing Orders should be suspended in order the that honourable members on both sides will an opportunity of putting their cases. They would otherwise not have it. As I said by way of interjection which you permitted the other day, Mr Speaker, I look forward to the day when we It meet after the elections and you are once again the Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia and both front Leader of the Opposition.",32
89,Mr BRYANT,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS," I wish to raise the point that, whilst we agreed to this debate proceeding, it seems to me to be a total misuse of parUamentary forms. There are already on Notice Paper a number of items which, if adequately, would cover the matters in the substantive motion. I on the notice have no doubt will beRural to the Australian Bank Bill, which I in the most on Payments) Bill and the Industries (Incentive Industry Assistance Commission Amendment Bill. There are two on the Notice Paper which are unlikely to the be debated. They have been on the Notice Paper a long whUe. I refer to the report by the Department of Productivity and the White Paper of and ministerial statement on Manufacturing Industry. They could cover the whole question of Labor the economy of the country. I regard the motion for the suspension of impactits ofelection Standing Orders as a total misuse of parliamensince tary time and of the parUamentary power of the (1) majority. During the last few weeks when we were debating the Estimates, in each instance the debate was cut short. Matters that ought to have been debated fuUy were not debated. I want to know for how long the debate on the censure motion wtil proceed. WUl it be an open forum in which at least 10 or 12 members will take part, or wtil it be simply another foray, so that there is a record placed in Hansard, by two or three mem- (5) devalued bers from each side, and the rest of us being here to make up the numbers? On this matter I speak on behalf of everybody in this Parliament, I am sure. There has been a great deterioration in opportunity for most back bench members to participate in debate. Honourable members will say to me: 'Yes, but you make enough noise; you speak often enough . It is true that I do. I spent a long time studying the Standing Orders so that I can take advantage of opportunities such as this to say what I have said now. are other opportunities which I may take if not heard properly and in the way in which think the man representing the people of WUls ought to be heard. My firm conviction is that representative of the people of WUls ought to have as much right to speak in this House as the man who represents the people of Wannon. This is a consortium of equals. The way in which been handled is a disgrace to the parUamentary His system.",32
90,Mr SINCLAIR,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I suggest that the honourable gentleman study the Standing Orders of which he professes to be so knowledgeable and return to the subject matter before the House.",33
91,Mr BRYANT,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,I am speaking about the pacity necessity to suspend Standing Orders. I am sayprice ing that it is unnecessary. The point of order taken by the temporary honourable member for What New England is a typical example of him and his approach to everybody else in the tunately the lessons of history are clear to those who care to look. The people who exercise power performance in an arbitrary and a capricious for the axe themselves before long. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA,33
92,Mr SINCLAIR,MOTION OF CENSURE," I move: That this House censures the Leader of the Opposition his persistently misleading and untruthful statements Australian people regarding the effect of the economic policies of his Government between 1972 and 1975 and the econonuc policies of the present Government in 1975 as exemplified in recent weeks by his statements to the following effectHis assertion that Australia's rate of inflation has not fallen during 1976-77.

(3) His claim that under the Labor Government inflation and unemployment were no worse than in other countries. (4) His claim that the Hayden Medibank scheme would cost no more than the present Medibank scheme. His claim that the Labor Government never the Australian dollar. It is not Ughtly that the Government launches this motion, and contrary to the assertions made the during the debate on the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders the purpose of this motion is to ensure an adequate opportunity for people outside this place to know something of have the farago of falsenoods, if I might use the phrase that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has used, that has been spread There around Australia on the media and ih the I am newspapers by those people who are putting I themselves up as the alternative government of this country and who in a few weeks will seek to the offer themselves as the Government of this country. The list of items in the motion is brief but the number of false assertions by the Leader of the Opposition is many. The motion lists five. it has Thefirstparagraph in the motion is: assertion that Australia's rate of inflation has not fallen during 1976-77. What utter nonsense! Can the man not read? Can he not understand? Probably the answer is no. Surely, with all that economic advice, conflicting though it might be, by those several and successive Treasurers, would be Treasurers and possible Treasurers behind him, there is a cafor him to understand that the consumer index at this stage indicates that the rate of inflation in Australia is now below double digits. a contrast to the 19.4 per cent inflation rate of at the height of the Labor years. The second place. Forparagraph in the motion is: His false and misleading comparisons of the economic of Australia and other Western countries durfashion are due ing 1976 and 1977. Statistically, every comparison between Austraha and other countries shows that we are doing very well. A couple of other countries are doing better than we are, but over the whole of which parameter of the average of the countries are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development there for is no doubt. Our economy is picking up. I want to to the say a Utde in a moment about the state of play as the we inherited it in December 1975. Everybody should look at the alternative, look at the who was there for only two years and who already acknowledged that if he were to be ted he would be only a lame duck Prime Minis-day ter, not a man there for the full term, not a man who wants to stay but a man who wants to get out. Quite obviously those behind him also that. Whether he will stay after he is defeated the election, as he undoubtedly will be, another interesting matter of contention. In terms ofhis comparison of economic mance, there is no substance whatsoever in his suggestion that the Austrahan economy is not order now improving significantly. The various econremindinvolved. omic writers who have been looking performance during the last three months, in tion to the state of themember particular looking at the last CPIfigure,are acrum. Therefore, there is no need forcall knowledging that it now signifies that the trahan economy is rising out of the morass into quorum which the Labor Party led us more than three call uponisthe years ago. The third paragraph in the motion is: speech. His claim that under the Labor Government inflation and unemployment were no worse than in other countries. Again, that is an utterly false misleading. It is dehberately seeking to put the Australian voter into a position of beUeving in some way the improvement that is demonThat strable is not real.

Thefinalparagraph in the motion is: His claim that the Labor Government never devalued the I draw your Australian dollar. That statement, too, is of course a farago of falseI turn now to the detaU, because I want to speak at some length on it. Recently on This Day Tonight Mr Whitlam said, regarding mflation and unemployment: didn't hit Australia worse than other countries . . . for On Willesee at Seven he said: When it went bad under us it went bad in every Western honourable country without exception. On another edition of that program, deaUng with mflation during this Government's term, he said: . Japan, Western Europe, North America... in all those countries it has improved in 1976 and 1977 and in Australia it has not. On another This Day Tonight program he said: . in 1976 and 1977 inflation has gone down in other House. Itcountries. It hasn't in Australia. Liking the sound of his own rhetoric he said on been inanother Willesee at Seven program: . . inflation has gone down in all the other Western on countries, scarcely at all in Australia. Those statements are dehberately misleading and false. Speaking on unemployment during this Government's term, the Leader of the Opposidon said: . . . Canada and the United States and West Germany . . . they don't have as much unemployment He went on: . . . unemployment has certainly gone down in every other Western country . . . You can't quote another country in the world where it has gone up anywhere near that at all. Unquesdonably, the Leader of the Opposition was making two assertions. The first was that under Labor Austraha's economic performance was as good as that of other countries. The sectified ond was that under the present Government it is worse. It is for that reason that I beheve it imperative that we look at the real record and where we are. Firsdy, Labor's inflation was demonstrably worse than that of many other countries. There are so many statements, articles and commento taries about the record of those Labor there is little point in my going through them all today. I wish to mention only two. One is an article by Professor Michael Parkin, who has the of chair in Economics at the University of Western wages Ontario. He was a visiting research economist at able the Reserve Bank of Australia in 1973. In an down article in the Australian Financial Review on 14 managed January 1976 he commented about the Whidam import performance: This is a worse stagflation performance than that achieved by any comparable country. So much for the performance ofLabor. He said: There is no mystery as to why the Australian economy suffered a worse stagflation was not because of the behaviour of Australia's labour unions: it was not because Australia was in a particularly nerable position . . . The stagnation was made in Canberra by budgetary monetary poUcies which can only be described as insane. The problem with Whitlam's economic management be summed up in a phrase as ""too much, too often'. The Labor Government has left the Australian economy in a very dangerous situation. Just in case there is any mistake in the minds memories of people about those days of Labor mismanagement, I refer to an article in the Economist of 27 March 1976. This was an article in the British media describing something of the problems that Britain saw in Austraha. It made this comment about the Australian economy in those Labor days: This is now in a state of even greater confusion than other Western economies . . . The major economic mistake of the Whitlam government was that Mr Whidam himself was more interested in foreign pohcy and the quaUty-of-life issue at home than he was in economics, and at the decisive period of his prime ministership he left the economy in the charge of left-wingers whom he never reaUy tried to get under control until it was too late. It is that, above all else, that the people of Australia need to recognise as one of the AchUles' heels of the present Labor regime. In the problems and traumas of the Labor management one finds the Leader of the Opposition still subject to the same insidious influence by the communist trade union leaders and the radical left wing. There is no change. The problem idenin the article in the Economist of March 1976 is the problem that exists today. It talked is quite about the encouraging of 'a flood of wage see increases far beyond the rise in productivity'. There is a comment about the replacement of the successive Treasurers. There is a comment about the extent to which they were inclined 'to say yes virtuaUy every proposal for increased public days that spending'. The article goes on: No economy could stand the double inflationary pressure a budget deficit this size and a government-encouraged explosion. To be sure, Australia was bound to be hit by the general world inflation to some extent But a reasonguess is that its own inflation could have been held to about eight to ten per cent if the economy had been better, the country does not, after all, need to most of its raw materials, and it suppUes two thirds of its own oil. Instead, inflation went up to 17 per cent at its peak. The overpricing oflabour, and the squeeze this appUed to the cashflowof companies, sent unemployment up higher than it need have gone . . . They are only two of the commentaries on the state of play in those days. Thirdly, Labor certhan any other major country. It tainly generated a pace of escalating unemployvulment that was greater than that in any of the other member countries of the OECD. In the and United States of America it went up 1.8 times the 1962-72 average; in Australia threetimes;in Japan 1.6 times; in Canada 1.4 times; and in the can United Kingdom 1.75 times. Labor's record was three times the average. Under Labor unemployment rose 157 per cent in one year. So much for the claim of the Leader of the Opposition that unemployment was not bad. Under Labor inflaand tion rose above 17 per cent. The underlying rate of inflation today has geen reduced, if one takes the annual rate for thefirstnine months of this year, to 9.1 per cent. There is no doubt that each one of the assertions by the Leader of the Opposition is made deUberately to mislead the Australian electorate. There is no doubt that the statements are not accurate. They have no submost stance hi fact, and they are deUberately intended to persuade the Australian people hi some way that those disastrous three Labor years can be put aside. An interesting article was published in the Reader's Digest in the United States in January this year. It was published only in the United States, but it identifies one of the problems that we have had. So many of the overseas commentators accepted that under the successive Liberal Country Party governments prior to 1972 there was a continuity and responsibihty in government. They knew that government was understandable and trustworthy. But the article I am about to read illustrates just what those Labor years did to Austraha's reputation. It is headed 'The Sobering Story of Austraha's Big Spending'. The Labor Pnme Minister might well be called the last of the big spenders. The article begins: In April 1975, the Australian economy was in its worse shape since the Great Depression. The country's socialist Labor Government was running a $3 billion deficit, five per cent of the gross national product. Business confidence had all but vanished, unemployment had soared to the highest level in 30 years and inflauon rate of 13.4 per cent. In Canberra, Australia's federal a wry joke went the rounds: 'The only Australian factory working day and night is the government mint.'",34
99,Mr HAYDEN,MOTION OF CENSURE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Is it possible to obtain some silence from Government back benchers while the Government Minister is speaking? I cannot hear him.",36
100,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF CENSURE,Order! There is no substance in the point of order.,36
101,Mr SINCLAIR,MOTION OF CENSURE,"Mr Speaker, I can understand the honourable gentleman's distress. After all, he has now been laid aside finally as the alternative Labor Treasurer. Firstly, he was was offered a position in foreign affairs and defence. Quite obviously the Leader of the Opposition at that stage was not too sure whether the honourwas able member for Oxley was really going to be contender for the leadership or how soon, but they came to an arrangement. The arrangement is not that the Leader of the Opposition will make the honourable member for Oxley the next Treasurer. Far from it. He will have a hotchpotch offinancialand economic miscellany. We are not too sure what it will contain. We are quite that if he has advice it may or may not be taken.",36
102,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF CENSURE,Order! I remind the right honourable gentleman that he is moving a cenand sure of the Leader of the Opposition.,36
103,Mr SINCLAIR,MOTION OF CENSURE,"Mr Speaker, how right it is. The point of it all is that it is the Leader of Opposition who at the moment, according to latest record, is intending to appoint the honoureconomy able member for Oxley to one of those economic advisory roles. It is the Leader of the Opposition whose credibihty is suspect and against whom this motion is directed. It is the Leader of the Opposition who suggested on one day that the honourable member for Oxley would have two impossible portfolios so that the honourable member for Oxley presumably could not possibly be in Australia long enough to be avaUable sufficiently to be a plausible alternative to the Leader of the Opposition. FinaUy we know the truth. The Leader of the Opposition has said: ' I will have two years'. He will be lucky if he has two months. It is important that the Australian people remember that the commentary I am now giving from a Reader's Digest analysis of what happened in the Australian economy over those years is the sort of view that the average man or woman in other countries is getting of the Australian status under a Labor government. The first article I quoted was from the Economist. The second quotation I gave was from a university professor of economics. The one I am now quothad accelerated to an annual capital, ing is the sort of document that average men and women read, and I think it is very important. Mr E. G. Whitlam-What is the date of the Reader'sDigest!",36
104,Mr SINCLAIR,MOTION OF CENSURE,"I would be happy to table the document. The Leader of the Opposition may have it. It was pubUshed only in the United States edition in January 1977, but I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that it was talking about the performance of the economy under him. It states: When Labor came into office in late 1972, unemployment just 2.4 per cent and inflation 4.5 per cent-a n economic performance matched only by West Germany. Is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that it not so when he came into office? Of course a not. What happened? The whole of the development over those three years led to this commentary by my predecessor as Leader of the House: 'Few of us bothered to count the cost in those early days', said Fred Daly. 'We spent money as if it were going out of fashion', said Fred Daly. That is what one of his colleagues thought of sure him. Remember those commentaries he made in his first years in office that the Labor Government had some special relationship with the trade union movement. But strikes proliferated 2.634 miUion working days were lost- a 31 per cent increase over that for the 1972 period. Then of course we had the Khemlani affiair and the those Iraqi breakfasts and aU those disastrous the attempts to try to cover up and patch up the in ways that led to the Labor Governuncertain ment's defeat in December 1975. One of the things that does worry me in terms of the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition is that he is now saying he has learned his lesson; that perhaps the Labor Government was rash; that if he offers himself to the people on an economic program it will be properly costed. That demonstrably is not true. The demonstrable untruths in the statements he has made to the E ublic in the media in the last few weeks set the ackground. He has successively made a number of statements. They have been contradicted by the truth. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in answers in this House, has successively gone through each of those points. The point I first wish to make is that the credisigned bility of the Leader of the Opposition as an of a million dollars alternative Prime Minister is ml. The second point is that the people of Australia need to realise that the statements he is making about performance as Prime Minister, about the economy under Labor, are equally totally wrong. The third point is that as far as our performance concerned most of the traumas we have had in trying to establish again common sense and since rationality in developing sound economic grams, in again launching Austraha into a ition of full employment, have been because the heritage of those Whitlam years. In the mary industry sector alone, there are so many areas where, as a result of the implementation those Coombs report recommendations, Ausfactory trahan farmers were significandy disadvantaged. Of course Mr Whidam has never had any parthe ticular regard for the farming community. Setfallen ting that aside, his assertion of what his governcould ment might do needs to be seen in the hght of mis-statements he has been making in the media in recent weeks. This censure motion is presented to the Parhament and to the Austrahan pubhc because it is essential that people realise that in no way the economic pohcies of Labor changed from those of the Labor regime of 197S. They need to remember the product of the economic programs of the Whitlam Government in 1975 and, in It looking at the statements that Mr Whitlam has made in recent weeks, accept that not only not learned his lesson but also that he is pared to tell the truth about it. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (11.53)- I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view stituting the following words: 'this House censures the Fraser Government economic policies which have caused a serious deterioration of the economy during 1977.' I am not going back to the appearance of the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) on the Willesee program because the misrepresentations and falsehoods he committed there and the threats he carried out against Mr Willesee and the program mean that he is not likely to face interrogation in any searching media forum during this campaign.",36
105,Mr SINCLAIR,MOTION OF CENSURE,For an honest man it would be easy. I would hardly do that in front of you. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Willese e revealed and the Leader of the House has never disputed and has never even sought to justify the fact that he panies documents that in two of his family comthere were misappropriations of a quarter in the last four years.,37
106,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF CENSURE,"Order! The Leader of the Ophis position will remain relevant to the motion. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Yes, I shall, Mr is Speaker. I first state this fact: The Austrahan economy is now more depressed than at any time the middle of 1972. This is the finding of an proimpeccable source-the Australia and New posZealand Bank. I am refening not to a United of States edition of the Reader's Digest of last priJanuary but to the ANZ Bank's index ofeconomic activity released two days ago. This index is of based on the Bank's own measures of the level of production, of job vacancies, retail sales and motor vehicle registrations. The index shows appalling extent to which the economy has below the level ofeconomic activity which be expected on the basis of past trends of the economic growth. It shows that the Australian economy has fallen far below the level of output and income which should have existed and has fallen lower than at anytimesince mid-1972. This is the measure of the consequences of the have Fraser Government's pohcies for economic recovery-the government which was going to turn on the Ughts. Instead, the ANZ index throws an entirely new Ught on the state of the economy. is true that most people discount entirely the claims of recovery made by the Prime Mmister has he (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr not preLynch), who avoids Question Time. So they should discount those claims. The more charitable observers have thought that Australia was now just stagnating-strivin g for salvation through stagnation, as the honourable member to subfor MackeUar (Mr Wentworth) has said. But the evidence which is now becoming avaUable shows that far from recovering, as the Governfor its ment has claimed, the Australian economy has declined severely during 1977. There has not merely been stagnation; the recession is deepenLet ing and deepening. The central truth about this Government's tors economic management is that it has chosen poh-from of cies which are dehberately aimed at driving being most suitable down production, output and employment. This state of the economy. is the result of its hostility to the pubhc sector, siderably behind events. even when the effect of crippling the pubhc sec-able fairly quickly. They tor is to cripple the private sector equally. A competent, compassionate government would recogsection nise that its true task lay in reducing the rate ofimportant, inflauon and unemployment together, and that to these twin aims can'best be achieved selective, stimulatory pohcies aimed at moving the economy progressively towards fuller employment and greater price stability. This Government, however, has chosen the destrucavailable tive approach of dehberately retarding recovery.state The consequence has been severely to depress economic activity and to increase the difficulty eventual recovery because of the distortions which are being effected in the economy. Let us examine the facts. The ANZ Bank indexsevere shows a severe recession in 1961-the result the Menzies credit squeeze- a shallower trough in 1966-67, a sharp deterioration in 1971 ending in about April 1972, a splendid expansionary phase throughout 1973, a decline during the world-wide recession following the oil crisis 1974, and the beginning of recovery in late and early 1976 when the effects of the Hayden Budget were still working. Since the beginning 1977 it has been falling sharply. This new sion-the worse slump for five years-is all the activity. Fraser Government's own work. The ANZ index is made up of four indicators: Total new motor vehicle registrations, retail sales, factory production and job vacancies. Registrations of new motor vehicles have fallen in each of the last three months and in Septhe tember were 5 per cent lower than a year earher.estimated Retail sales increased by 11 per cent during last year. Since the existing rate of inflation 13.1 per cent, this means that real retail sales have fallen during the last year by 2.1 per cent. Factory production, which is the third indicaployment tor, has been falling since the beginning of 1977.year. The dechne has been continuous since January. Total factory production is now well below level in November 1975 when this Government was installed. The number ofjob vacancies regisUnder tered with the Commonwealth Employment Sermatic vice fell sharply during thefirstfivemonths this year and has remained at the same low levelssince since then. The ratio for unemployed to vacanof cies is now 16:1. me emphasise: These are not myfiguresor my chosen indicators. They are the key indicachosen by the ANZ Bank to show the cunent state the economy. They have been chosen amongst a great many available series as as indicators of the present Most indicators lag conThese ones are availrepresent a crossof real activity in the economy. And most they have been found by the experts be the most accurate guides to the real level of by careful,aggregate economic activity. The ANZ index has not been published before. We are fortunate that it should become now, because it shows us clearly the into which the economy has fallen as a all result of Fraser-Lynch pohcies. The message of of the ANZ survey is repeated in every other indicator published since the Prime Minister announced his panic election. The message is plain and it is always the same: There has been economic deterioration throughout 1977. of For example, at the beginning of this week the most recent month's home building approvals were released by the Statistician. They show that home building approvals slumped during the last year. In September they were 22 per cent of lower than in September last year. In fact build1975ing approvals are now 14 per cent lower than they were in September 1975. This is particularly ofsenous because building approvals are another reces-leading indicator of the level of economic Another indicator pubhshed a week ago is the Statistician's unemploymentfigures-the Prime Minister's own preferred index of unemployment. The Statistician says that 5.8 per cent of work force is now unemployed. He has also that at least another 65,000 people the have ceased to seek work because of repeated wasrejection and disappointment. He classifies them as 'discouraged persons'. So real unemployment is already above 400,000. This means that unemwill rise above half a milhon early next Unless there is a change of poUcies, and that requires a change of Government, it wiU the remain higher than in 1977 throughout 1978. this Government there has been a dradrop in private sector employment. Total of private employment has declined by 50,000 November 1975. So much for the recovery the private sector under a private enterprise Government! What we have now is a new slump brought on by dehberate domestic pohcy. This is not a tinuation of the world wide downturn of 1974-75. It is a new recession-all Australia's own work. Real government outlays have fallen during the last two years. In its obsessive hostility to the pubhc sector the Fraser Government has taken perverse pride in an indiscriminate and bitrary slashing of cost-effective programs. Yet does not have the wit to see that what it is does not make room for the private sector. merely reduces the demand for the goods and services produced by the private sector. Our obsessed and obsessive Prime Minister see that the two sectors depend on each other. The Fraser Government has been inflicting wounds on the Austrahan economy. We are now tween in the midst of a recession caused directly by Australia's domestic pohcy. In late 1974 and early 1975 Austraha shared a recession with the rest of world. In contrast, the 1977 recession is nally generated. This is all the Fraser Governcountries ment's own work. The Prime Minister, characteristic fashion, has tried to fusion about this in every Question Time. The facts are unambiguous. In 1974 annual rates of growth in Australia were one cent to 1.5 per cent respectively. During those two years the average level of economic activity feU in countries belonging to the Organisation Economic Co-operation and Development. In 1974 the OECD average feU by 0.1 per cent and, in 1975, by one per cent. In both those therefore, while output was falling overseas, continued to grow m Australia. The difference between the situation in Australia and the situOECD ation in the OECD countries as a whole was marked. Our rate of growth was 1.1 per cent faster than the OECD average in 1974 and 2.5 per cent faster in 1975. These ownfigures.The exact reverse is true for 1976 and for the estimates for 1977. In 1976 national income grew by 3.6 per cent in Australia but 5.2 per cent on average in the OECD countries. The rate of growth in Australia was well below the OECD average last year. In the current year the rate of growth in Australia is estimated to 2 per cent and, in the OECD countries, 4 per cent. That is, under Labor, Austraha's growth rate was higher than the OECD average; under Fraser it is lower. Only one conclusion can be drawn from these facts andfigures.During the years of interelected. national recession of 1974 and 1975 Australia's national income continued to grow. The Labor Government's poUcies prevented Australia from experiencing the worse of the international reconcession. Yet during the last two years the contractionary pohcies of the Fraser Government have forced an artificiaUy low rate of growth on Australia. Under Labor, Australia performed better than most OECD countries. Under the Liberals, Australia has performed far arworse than other OECD countries. And why? Beit cause other governments have been encouraging doing economic expansion while this blinkered It Government has been ensuring recession. The most recent Australian national accounts show that the national income actually feU in Australia cannot in thefirsthalf of this year. EarUer I gave the unemployment figures which showed that in 1974 and 1975 the gap be the OECD average and Australia was in favour but that in 1976 and 1977 it contracted and disappeared. Unemployment in the Australia is still worsening. Whereas Australia interused to be below the other industrialised in unemployment, it now has a rate of in his Unemployment inhigher unemployment than their average. create conrelative to the situation in has Australia been worsening most other indusand 1975 the trialised countries. per AU this havoc, deterioration and damage have been done in the name offightinginflation. So let us examine the facts about inflation. In the year for to September 1975 the rate of inflation in Australia was 12.1 per cent. This was the rate of inflation in this countiy when the last election was held. At that time the average annual rate of years inflation in the OECD countries was 10.4 per it cent. In the year to September 1976 the rate of inflation in Australia was 13.9 per cent; in the countries it was 8.3 per cent. In 1975 the quite difference between Australia and the OECD countries was 1.7 per cent. In 1976 it became 5.6 per cent. It sharply increased in this Governare the OECD's ment'sfirstyear. The rate of inflation in Australia in the year by from September 1976 to September this year was 13.1 per cent. The OECD average was 9.4 per cent. The difference is 3.7 per cent. The figures show dramaticaUy that Austraha's inflabe tion rate has not improved and has tended to worsen relative to other industrialised countries during this Government's term of office. The Fraser Government has had two years in which to experiment. AU the evidence shows clearly that its poUcies have failed. It refuses to change its policies; therefore a new government must be Two years ago, the Prime Minister demanded three years. He has only himself to blame when the people say on 10 December. - You've had enough-and we've had enough'.",37
107,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF CENSURE,Is the amendment seconded?,40
108,Mr HAYDEN,MOTION OF CENSURE," I second the in amendment The Government has persistently moving misled and has been consistendy untruthful in its statements to the Austrahan pubhc on the economy. It has been equally misleading and untrustwhen, worthy in its forecasts about the performance of polls the economy in 1978. Mr Bourchier- I raise a point of order.",40
109,Mr HAYDEN,MOTION OF CENSURE,The fact is that the Australian pubhc cannot afford another term of a Liberalnation National Country Party government.,40
110,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF CENSURE,"The honourable member for Oxley will resume his seat. Mr Bourchier- Mr Speaker, it is all right. clock was not on. It has now beenfixed.We would hate the honourable member to have any more time than he should have. He wastes wordsthere at any time.",40
111,Mr HAYDEN,MOTION OF CENSURE,"I repeat that Austraha cannot afford the high cost of another term of governelection ment by the conservative coalition parties. The 1976-77 recession cost Australia in excess of $3,600m in lost domestic product. A conservathe tive estimate is that lost domestic product in financial year will exceed $4,500m. The Government likes to imply that there is enormous ruption and cost to the Australian community cause of industrial disruption. Lost work days through the recession in 1976-77 exceeded 68 miUion. Compare that against a htde over miUion work days lost through industrial dispubUshed-ha putes. Compare the high cost in lost domestic product which was the result of the disastrous economic poUcies of the Government in that of year-$3,600m-wit h the cost in lost domestic jected product through industrial disputes of $ 170m. It is a simple matter to calculate the working days lost through unemployment after aUowing for hoUdays and so on and relating that as a of the total wage biU to gross domestic product. point out that the result is that the disastrous consequences of Liberal-National Country Administration during 1976-77 exceeded $3,600m in lost domestic product for this country. That means more than 5 per cent of thements, gross domestic product of this country for that year was lost. That is a conservative estimate cause it makes no aUowance at aU for hidden unespeciaUy employment which represents probably another 2 per cent on top of the official unemployment statistics. The Government is claiming that there wiU be a recovery in the new year. The Treasurer (My Lynch) is on record as saying this. Nothing could be more deceptive and dishonest than that statement. The Government does not believe it. If inflation is to be reduced to single digit figures the new year, if the economy is gomg to be Government forward again strongly, then why is the going to the people at this point poUtically its situation is so precarious? Why is it seeking an election when the opinion show so convincingly that it would be very lucky indeed to win government? The fact is that in the new year there wtil be record high unemployment, the countiy wtil be in the grip of stagand there will be Utde impact at aU upon the level of inflation in the country. That is why the Government is seeking a Senate election some seven months ahead of the normal time and a House of Representatives election more The than a year ahead of the normal time. The Treasurer's suggestion yesterday, which was reported in the media this monung, that is expected to be a substantial reduction in inflation in the course of thisfinancialyear is nothing but cheap pie in the sky served up as fare. Not even the Government beUeves that because none of its advisers beUeves it. Let us look at what these advisers have been telling Government. The Reserve Bank of Australia thishas told the Government that by June next year unemployment wtil be of the order of 6 per cent, dismuch higher than for any month this year. beMonth by month this year we have had the highest unemployment since the Great Depression of nearly half a century ago. The Reserve 3 Bank of Australia-the information has been s indicated that the rate of growth in the economy wtil be down to about 1.3 per cent-almos t a dead halt. After the very slow rate growth last year, which was higher than is profor next year, it is quite evident that as bad as things have been this year in economic terms, they will be far worse next year. The Reserve Bank report says blundy that the effects of the Government's monetary poticy and the general ratio thrust of economic management imply a credit I squeeze in the course of this financial year. That is a clear impUcation of Treasury documentation Party attached to the Budget Papers. The Treasury does not believe the false state-' the untruthful statements, the dishonest statements, which are being circulated in die becommunity by Government spokesmen, the Treasurer. It is a conspiracy of deception against the Australian pubtic for any Government spokesman to suggest even for a minute that there will be an improvement in the economy in the new year. Treasury documentation makes that abundantiy clear. I have quoted from the assessment of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of the Australian economy. I stand pretty much what I have said. My sources are reUable and impeccable.",40
112,Mr SHIPTON,MOTION OF CENSURE,Pretty much!,41
113,Mr HAYDEN,MOTION OF CENSURE,"Le t us be clear about the stance of these statements. Whether or not the review has been completed in literary detaU, the fact is that economic forecasts are avaUable the OECD, I checked with the local source of my information today, which show that the rate growth in 1978 will be about 2V4 per cent against an increase hi productivity of about 2 per cent and a growth in the work per cent. That clearly imphes an increase in unThe employment in calendar year 1978 of something as like In per cent. There have been grand claims by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that the deflator has increased by only 9 per cent. OECD forecasts and projections show that for this year the GDP deflator is expected to increase by about 11 per cent, an increase, therefore, the figure the Prime Minister has been quoting for an earUer annual period, but falling in part this calendar year, over this calendar year has been forecast by the OECD. More imporfaUed. tantly, the best forecast now before the OECD is about 1014 per cent for calendar year 1978. We are going to have the enormous dislocation massive increases in unemployment, an economy that is scarcely moving, a deepening of the rein cession, far more dismal prospects tor business and scarcely any dent at aU in the rate of inflation in this country. Something has been made by the Treasurer the increase in the consumer price index for September quarter of 2 per cent. This is only marginal improvement over the 2.2 per cent for the September quarter last year. Let us look the interesting paraUel between the excessively optimistic and totaUy hypocritical claims being made by Government spokesmen about thenBudget success in conquering mflation in the September quarter. If one goes back to newspapers subhas sequent to the release of the CPI figures for the September quarter last year, one finds that things exactly the same statements were made. I quotebecause from the Brisbane Courier-Mail of 22 1976. It said: The reduced inflation rate revealed by the latest Consumer Price Indexfiguresshowed that the Government's economic strategy was working, the Prime Minister Fraser) said yesterday. That is a direct quote. The article continues: 'The foundations for a sound, sustainable recovery in economic conditions, and employment are now emergmg', Mr Fraser said. That was a dishonest statement. It was made 12 by months ago but the Prime Minister's speech writer has not thought of anything new to say. The Prime Minister is making equaUy dishonest statements today about the inflation rate following the release of the September quarter figure. subThe Canberra Times of'22 October 1976 said: The Treasurer, Mr Lynch, said the September quarter movements reflected the important progress the Governin ment had made in reducing inflation. Some progress! Inflation for last iinancial year of was worse than for the annual period to Sepas tember 1976. The Sydney Morning Herald of77 force of about 2 October 1975 said: Treasurer, Mr Lynch, hailed today's announcement an important step in reducing inflation and a justification for the Government's economic strategy. Inflation was worse for the year ended June this year as against the year ended June the previous year, and is only marginally better for the year ended September this year than for the year on ended September last year, yet the Treasurer is making these outlandish claims. The fact is that of the Treasurer's pohcies, in fact the Governwhichment's pohcies in economic management have Let us look at the indicators of price change in the latest Treasury roundup. If we look at the broadly basedfigures,the early indicators of of price movements, wefind,for instance, that the impUcit deflator for gross non-farm product March was 4.8 per cent. Wefindthat the external impUcit deflator for imports of goods and services was 10.6 per cent in March and 5.5 per cent in June. The external impUcit deflator for imported materials used in manufacturing was of 11.4 per cent in March. Those forces now are the feeding through the economy because of lag a problems and economic effects. That means, very simply, that they will tend to telescope into the at December quarter and alter and accentuate the inflationary effects of the 11 cents per gallon increase in the price of petrol announced m the by the Treasurer. That is the sort of result we are getting and that is why the Government decided to caU an election earUer than later. The economy will not be better later so as bad as are now it is better to go to the poUs earUer the consequences politicaUy will be disOctober astrous if the Government waits. Let us look at the remorseless rise in unemployment which is the direct product, the con(Mr scious product, of the Government's poUcies. The Government beUeves the more it can increase unemployment, the more it can grind the economy towards a dead halt, the less mflation we wtil have. It has been very successful in increasing unemployment remorselessly, in grinding the economy towards a dead has not been particularly successful in reducing inflation. Unemployment in the early new year will be of the order of 7% per cent to 8 that is, between 465,000 and 500,000 people be out of work. As many as half a milhon people will be out of work in the early new year, most them young people. Compare that with the rent situation of a Uttle over 300,000. Since Government has been in office it has been succoarse cessful in the area of determinedly employment. It has increased unemployment by 24 per cent so far. It is going to increase ployment by 40 per cent on top of that in New Year. When we were in government we 300 increased the number of people in the work force by about 150,000. Since this Government came to office it has reduced the number of people the work force by 11,000. In that period about 120,000 people who would have been added to the avaUable work force are not accounted for the official statistics. Therefore, one gets a insight into the sorts of problems confronting country and the abject faUure of Government economic poUcy. What does this Government care about stage human suffering? Not a jot. In our last Budget set aside $153m for employment creating procattle, grams. The best this Government can provide in this Budget is $7m. If honourable members at page 92 of the Budget Speech and statements, in Statement No. 3 attached to the Budget they will find that $40m is allocated for the cattle, sheep and pig meat industries. Cattle, sheep pig meat are more important than human beings and the distress that they are suffering. The Utah Development Corporauon is able to ship this country, in respect of itsfinancialyear completed, some $20m which if adequate expired. income tax laws had been apphed could have been paid to this country as withholding tax. That $20m could have done a lot distress of unemployment in Australia. No step has been taken yet",41

Is it in order for the honourable member for Oxley continually to mislead this House with falsehood after falsehood after falsehood, knowing that the statements he makes are totally and absolutely untrue? It is a scandal and Armitage, J.L. a disgracehalt but it Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Denison will resume his seat. There is no substance in the point of order, per cent, and the honourable member knows it. will Mr HAYDEN-The honourable member for Denison, with a carnation in his lapel, a limp of wrist and a lisp on his Ups, makes a spurious curpoint. He has a mind Uke an unweeded garden thisthat grows to seed, possessed of things rank and in their nature. He is unworthy of any time increasing unin this Parliament. unemWhat this Government has achieved is an unthe employment rate amongst young people that is per cent worse than that for the rest of the population of Australia and a 35 per cent unemployment rate amongst Aboriginals, resulting in in a situation in which it is reported in the newspapers that young people are Uterally being driven to attempted suicide because of the disin tress and the depression of unemployment. It better was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 2 this November that 350 young people m the Blacktown area had attempted suicide. The article reads: Unemployment is a major stress factor which has set the for a large number of these attempted suicides . . . we The Government provides more money for sheep and pig meat than it is prepared to provide for human distress. Such is the measure look of the concern of the Government. The year 1978 wiU be a disastrous year for this country.

117,Mr HOWARD,PAIR,"This debate is about the pohtical credibility of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). It is entirely appropriate that at this time and in place we should have a debate about the poltiical credibility of the Leader of the Opposition. ought to have that debate for two reasons: truth Firstly, to remind the Australian people of just what happened when he was in charge of the affairs of this nation and, secondly, to remind them that if, by mischance, he were ever given the opportunity to be Prime Minister again would do it aU again. Out ofhis own mouth is an admission that if ever the Labor Party became the Government of this country again he would do it aU again. I think one of the most interesting commenQuestion taries on the pohtical fortunes of the Labor Party that can be found at present is an analysis of its Scholes, G.G.D. Uren.T. approach at Question Time. One would have thought that a parUamentary opposition, six weeks before an election, an election which it Willis, R. Young, M.J. » says it has a chance of winning, would have organised itself at Question Time and would have endeavoured to probe the poUcies and the James, A. W. Johnson, Les performance of the Government But no, do we see any sign of organisation? Do we see any trace of a systematic approach? No! The only element of co-ordination and synchronisation which has come from the Opposition during Question Time has been scurrilous attempts to impugn the integrity of certain Ministers of this Government. The levels to which members of the Opposition King,RS. Lloyd, B. have sunk, particularly the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), the sort of questions that have been asked and the sort of impUcations in them are a very sad commentary. They are a very sad commentary on the contribution to political Ufe by the ParUamentary Labor Party at present. More interesting even than that is that those Peacock, A. S. Robinson, Ian actions are a commentary on the Labor Party's own assessment of its chances of winning this election. They are a commentary on the internal divisions which are apparent to aU of us on this side of the House. Where, for example, is the 1 Staley, A A. Street, A A putative Treasurer of this country, the honourable member for Adelaide^ (Mr Hurford)? Where is he? We are having a debate on econWilson, I. B.C. TeUers: omic management and on the economic poUcies of the Labor Party when it was last in power. Where is he? He is not present. Where, for example, is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren)? I see he hasfinaUygraced us with his presence. This debate is about the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition and in a broader sense it is about the credibUity of the Labor Party as an alternative government of this country. In the short space of 15 minutes it is impossible to categorise all the misleading statements which this have been made by the Leader of the Opposition and more recently by the honourable member We for Oxley (Mr Hayden). Perhaps the greatest unof aU that has been put around persistently in the past 12 months is that this Government has used unemployment as an instrument for fighting inflation. Time and time again, Labor spokesmen have tried to demonstrate that we he have systematicaUy used unemployment as an instrument offightinginflation. Not only is that statement incorrect, but also it can be more accurately appUed to the pohcies that were pursued by the Labor Party when it was in office. During Time yesterday and today the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) referred to that rather infamous document that was comofhis missioned in 1973 entitled 'A Report on Possible Ways of Increasing Imports'. In other words was a report on how to export more Austrahan jobs.",43
118,Mr HODGMAN,PAIR,They would do it again.,44
119,Mr HOWARD,PAIR,"Of course the Labor Party would do it again. It was quite blatant and unrepentent at thetimeas to its objective. his own mouth, the present Leader of the OpporeaUy sition, shortly after announcing the decision for 23 per cent tariff cut, said: These measures will allow us to keep inflationary cies under control. In other words he was using the dehberate disThere mantling of protection for Austrahan industry protected. and the resultant unemployment as an instrument forfightinginflation. In other words he was sacrificing the jobs of thousands of trahan people. He was doing it quite openly and quite dehberately. Of course the real falsehood of it all is that the very charge which is untruthfully levelled against us was the very practice which was indulged in try the Labor Party when it was in office. That action and these statements were sympOpposition. tomatic of the punitive attitude that the Leader Minister. I believe of the Opposition took to so many sectors of our nation while he was Prime Minister. It is very strange that a person who seeks pohtical should take such a punitive attitude to so much selves that, when we listen should of the Austrahan nation. His punitive attitude to the Leader of the Opposition the primary industries of Austraha is well known. Is there any sign that he would be any different if he were again Prime Minister? Is there any sign told, that he would not again go to the rural areas of Austraha and wave hisfingerat an audience and everything say: 'You have never had it so good*? Is there any sign that he has learnt a lesson from the fact that as a result of the last election not one single but Labor member in this House represents a genutradict inely rural area of Austraha? Has he really learnt ment that he the that lesson? Of course he has not. The punitive attitude of the Leader of the OpIt position is not restricted to primary industry. He does not do things in small measures. a punitive attitude to manufacturing That attitude is extremely well known. It reachedAs its dizzy height during his Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association in 1975 when he talked about the nervous it went Nellies. Do honourable members remember talk about the nervous Nellies? Who were the nervous Nellies? They were ordinary Austrahan people who were worried about losing their jobsAge-surel m Tasmania. They were also, incidentally, own parUamentary coUeagues. So obsessed was the Leader of the Opposition at that time it with his punitive approach to manufacturing industry that he regarded his colleague and the Australian people who were concerned about jobs as being nervous Nellies. Do honourable members reaUy think that the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition towards Out of manufacturing industry has changed? Do they imagine that if he were given another opa portunity he would not do it all again? Of course he would. What did he say in his address to the National Press Club on 20 July this year in tendenanswer to a question about levels of protection for Austrahan manufacturing industry? He said: is no doubt that Australian industry is excessively In Other words, the Leader of the Opposition was Aussaying very plainly: 'Give me another chance and I wtil export some more jobs'. Of course that is what he was saying. Give him another chance so and he would certainly export some more jobs. It is right that this House should today look very carefully at the credibUity and the truthfulness of statements made by the Leader of the He is asking that in the weeks ahead the Australian people again make him Prime that it is the duty of this House and it is our duty as members of this House to support years 1972 and 1975. Wehappened rernind ourselves of what between the rernind ourto the statements of in the coming weeks, we cannot believe everything we are told. Not only can we not beheve everything we are but also we cannot believe that he beUeves he tells us. An interesting point about the Leader of the Opposition is that not only does he occasionally say things that are not correct, also he occasionally says things which conwhat he has said on earUer occasions. One of more interesting examples of this is a statemade on the television program This Day Tonight on 26 October 1977. He said: didn't hit Australia worse than other countries. He also hasHe went on to say: industry. When it went bad under uswe aU know, it went very bad under his famous address to the Governmentbad in every Western country without exception. the The Leader of the Opposition said that in October 1977. On 21 January 1975, when he was Prime Minister, he was quoted by the Melbourne y he would agree that is a reputable somenewspaper-as saying: Excessive wage demands had caused Australia's unemployment and inflation crisis. He then went on to say: You cannot blame Vietnam for inflation in the Western world. You cannot blame the oil crisis for inflation in Australia. You cannot blame the takeovers and the currency rates for inflation in Australia now. You have to place blame on wage claims. In other words, not only was he on that occasion speaking an element of economic truth, but also he was totally contradicting the stance that he had taken on other occasions. Of course, that is illustrative of the carelessness displayed by the Leader of the Opposition towards truth. Last night, during his interview on the Willesee program, he said that the total cost of the taxation concessions given by this Government to the mimng industry amounted to $ 1 billion. The true figure, of course, of $560m is almost half that. Last night he accused this Government of having twice devalued the dollar and denied that there was any devaluation under the previous Government. Everybody knows that a 12 per cent devaluation took place in September 1974. Everybody remembers that infamous September quarter of 1974 when unemployment rose by 53 per cent, when inflation reached afigureof 20 per cent and when interest rates rose to 10 per cent. Indeed, it was one of the worse quarters of all during thetimethat the previous Government was in office. It isrightthat we should draw the attention of Braithwaite. R. A. the Austrahan people to the fact that the Leader Brown, of the Opposition led the most disastrous governBurr. M. A. ment that this country has had since Federation. Cadman, A. C. Of course, he is a person of great modesty, a perCairns, Kevin son who is still quite happy to describe himself as Calder, the greatest Foreign Minister this country has Chapman, H.G.

H. trahan people that, far from having learnt any Edwards, lessons during the period that he was in office, Fisher. P.S. the Leader of the Opposition would do it all Fraser, Malcolm again. He would return to the printing presses. Garland. R.V. He would increase government spending to a Giliard, new level of irresponsibility. He would create Graham, B.W. once again the levels of unemployment, the Groom.

120,Mr SPEAKER,PAIR,"Order! As a matter of courtesy I ask the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) to return to their seats.",45
121,Mr HOWARD,PAIR,"That is the longesttimethat the they will sit on those benches for many years to come. During the next five weeks we will certainly be reminding the Australian people of what it was hke under Whitlam between 1972 and 1975. We will be reminding the people that if he should ever get the chance he would do it all again. He would be totally unrepentant and would lead this country in the manner in which he did during those years. I move: That the question be now put. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Rt Hon. B. M.

122,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE,I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) raising a matter of pubhc importance. I have been informed by the honourable member that he wishes to withdraw the matter because it has been covered in the matters debated earher today. I draw that fact to the attention of the House so that those people who are following the items listed on the program of proposed business will know that the next item to be called on will be Government Business. 65 Sitting suspended from 1.3 to 2.

123,Mr CONNOLLY,BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE," Mr Deputy Howard. J. W. Hunt, R. J.D. Speaker, I present the 166th, 167th and 168th reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Ordered that thereportsbe printed. King, R.S. Lloyd, B.",46
124,Mr CONNOLLY,BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE,"by leave-The 166th report comprises two Department of Finance minutes. The practice of presenting Finance minMACKeUar.M.J.R. MCLeay, J. E. utes is a result of a long-standing arrangement between the Committee and the Department of Finance which ensures that the Committee's recommendations and conclusions are followed up and reported to Parhament. These minutes Peacock. A. S. Robinson. Ian refer to the Committee's 158th report relating to expenditure from the Advance to the Treasurer in 1974-75 and the 160th report relating to Shipton, R.F. Simon, B. D. expenditure from the Consohdated Revenue Fund for the same iinancial year. The minutes detail the action taken to rectify faults in procedures and controls discovered during the Committee's examination of expenditure perforWilson. I. B.C. mance and the use of the Advance to the Treasurer by departments in the financial year Corbett, J. Cotter, J.F. 1974-75. The 167threportrelates to the Committee's inquiry into matters raised by the AuditorKeating, P.J. Klugman, R. E. General in his report for the financial year 1975-76. In the inquiry the Committee found that in the Department of Adrninistrative SerUren,T. West, S.J. vices on-the-job training was deficient and there was insufficient supervision of subordinates. The Willis, R. Department of Construction also had been negliTellers: James, A.

There was evidence of disregard financial instructions by senior officers of the partment of Foreign Affairs and incredible incompetence shown in the purchase and the renovation of a residence in Dublin for the Counsellor at the Austrahan Embassy. In the case of the Northern Territory electricity cedures, andtounacceptable supply undenaking the financial results since expenditure 1971-72 clearly indicate that increasing costs of provision should operation have not been matched by correAdditional sponding increases in revenue to recover the full was costs of providing power to residents. The Comfunds mittee records its extreme dissatisfaction that, as those requests a consequence, more than $23m may been recovered and believes that a major contributing factor was the division of responsibility between the Department of the Northern TerriHouse, tory and the Department of Construction. report on the electricity undertaking in the Northern Territory recently tabled in this Parhathree ment recommended that a statutory authority established to draw these responsibilities together. The Committee beheves that in fact responsibuities should be unified and that single authority should be created for all utilities in the Northern Territory as a duplicate adrninistrative machine will be wasteful and pensive for consumers. The Committee took evidence relating to fraud by officers of the Department of Social curity and beneficiaries. The Committee is cerned to note increasing trends towards overof payments of benefits and has sought a further submission on the matter. The Committee has recommended that further consideration given to the introduction of a national identity card system which could also have advantages other areas such as health and immigration. The Committee also received evidence that short periods of casual employment were being refused by persons on the grounds that it versely affects their unemployment benefit entitlements. The Committee believes that changes should be made in admirustering the benefits so that permanent job seekers are not disadvantaged by taking casual employment when the opportunity arises. The 168th report relates specifically to eviwhether dence taken in connection with items of expendiof ture from the Advance to the 1976-77. As honourable members are aware, after the close of eachfinancialyear the Treasurer submits to the Parhament a statement of expenditure from the Advance to the like showing allocations to heads of expenTerditure made by him under section 36A of the Audit Act. As our report shows, there were cases of where expenditure from the Advance was conDefined to urgent and unforeseeable requirements for which provision could not have been made in Appropriation Acts. In other cases, however, there was evidence of overtime being used to circumvent staff ceilings, inefficient estimating prodelays which caused be charged to the Advance when properly have been made in the Estimates. In general, however, there a reduction in the number of requests for from the Advance, and results of the Committee's examination suggest that the majority of were confined to urgent and unnot have foreseeable requirements. Mr Deputy Speaker, for the benefit of the I would hke to recall, very briefly, the A work of the Eleventh Committee, which concludes its work with the presentation of these reports. Your Committee was appointed in be March of 1976 and in the 20 months since then has met on 84 occasions and has presented 13 reports to the Parliament- a total exceeded only a by thefirstPubhc Accounts Committee chaired the by Professor Bland, M.P., which tabled 14 reports. These 13 reports have ranged in subject exmatter from tabling Finance minutes reporting the follow-up action taken in respect of the Committee's recommendations, examination of the SeAuditor-General's annual reports and expendiconture performance of departments, examination the financial affairs of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which we regard as a most significant report, and a special report on the conbe ference of Commonwealth and State public accounts committees which I tabled earher this inweek. Honourable members will recall that on that occasion I stated that the conference was of historic significance as it was thefirstoccasion since Federation that similar committees from adparliaments throughout Australia had gathered together to discuss mutual problems. Already we have begun to implement some of the initiatives outlined in that report. Because of the early prorogation of the Thirtieth Parliament the Committee has been unable to report on its inquiry into the former Overseas Property Bureau, and the Twelfth Committee will have to decide to continue a major inquiry into the use automatic data processing in the CommonTreasurer in wealth Pubhc Service. As this is my last statement as Chairman of the Eleventh Pubhc Accounts Committee, I would to thank my colleagues for their co-operation and the Secretary to the Committee and his staff for their devotion to their dudes and loyalty the Committee. I would hke to place on record the Committee's appreciation for the support given by the previous Secretary, Mr Tom Devine, who retired at the end of August after four years with the Committee, and his successor Mr Michael Talberg. I would like particularly note the loss to the Parhament and the Comserious mittee which will follow the retirement of Committee's vice-chairman, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). He has made a most significant contribution to work of the Committee and to the Parhament. When the Committee was re-established in Septry tember 1952 he was an original member. going to miss his wisdom in the next Parhament, but I know that all members of the Committee wish him well in his retirement. Mr Deputy able. Speaker, I commend the reports to honourable members.",46
125,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE,"by leave-I mittees thank the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for think Bradfield (Mr Connolly), for his kind remarks. I that thank him for the service I have enjoyed on the Committee. This Parhament has been a very difficult period because almost from week to week we have not known how many more weeks mittee. the Parliament was to sit. In the last couple of weeks the Committee has spent a great deal time just trying to finalise what was on its plate. These matters tend to get lost if they are not finalised before the conclusion of a Parliament. I have appreciated the opportunity to back on to the Committee. It has been a very valuable Committee in the 26 years or so since was re-established. Actually there was such committee in the very early days of the Federal Parhament; but it lapsed, I understand, for omy reasons in the 1930s. To my mind, that is business. simply typical of what can really be false economy. The Chairman referred to one or two matters. What sort of an economy is it when buildings worth hundreds of millions of dollars are the property of the Commonwealth and are not enough firemen to look after them properly, and when there are insufficient people to Committee work all sorts of mechanical devices satisfactorily? I think it is being rather absurd when, in the name of halting inflation, we cease mittee to employ an individual who, if he were wastes-a employed, certainly would return more in real terms than the cost of his wage or salary. It is Inquiry time that this sort of tiling was looked closely. I wish the Committee every success in the to future, in the very important work that it has to do. I said a couple of evenings ago that I thought the first Budget that I saw presented in this House in 1951 or 1952 was of the magnitude of a billion pounds or $2 billion. Now we contemplate Budgets of the magnitude of $22 bilhon. It to is about time this Parliament gave far more attention to the work done in committees the and, even at the expense oftimespent in this House, made more time available during the week so that committees could sit for several the hours at atimeinstead of having either to meet on days when the Parhament is not meeting or to to scramble meetings either at luncheon or We are dinner breaks. That is not sufficient. The work that is done in committees is valuI tliink we get a far better relationship between members in close committee work than we do in the more intense atmosphere of this place. I found that where differences occurred on comthey tended not to be on political lines at all but to be differences of opinion about what are often technical and mechanical matters. I can all of us are better for the cross-fertilisation be gained through committee work. I thank the Chairman in particular for what he has done, and the staff of the PubUc Accounts ComI hope that the staff will be strengthened so that the work that the Committee is supposed of to do can be more satisfactorily encompassed.

127,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"by leave-The two reports that I have tabled relate to the work of the Joint Committee on the Austrahan Capital Territory in the Thirtieth Parhament. The first refers to the inquiry currently being undertaken by the Committee into planning procedures in the Territory. The second is a report from the Committee on a matter refened by the Senate on the extent to which the Committee's report of last December on 'Canberra City Wastes- a Long Term Strategy for Collection and Disposal' has been implemented. The work of the Committee is now, however, Umited to investigations and inquiries referred by the Minister for the Capital Territory or by the Parhament. Members will be famUiar with the Committee's reports on proposals to vary the plan of lay-out of the City of Canberra and its environs. In this Parhament the Committee has examined proposals relating to the 60th, 61st, 62nd, 63rd and 64th series of such proposals and has presented reports to the House on each series. As well as providing a source of informasteps tion to Parliament about the planning of the national capital, the reports also provide a source of information for the local community. also permits a degree of involvement by the liament in the overall planning of the national capital. The decision taken by the Committee earUer this year to conduct meetings in public, at which the National Capital Development Commission far taken. and the Department brief it on proposals, rather than in closed session means that detaUs of prosatisfaction posals contained in the transcript of these prorecommendations ceedings are readUy avaUable for immediate and view that proposals future use by Press, pubUc and others concerned with or interested in Canberra's planning. The implemented Inquiry into Planning Procedures and Processes review in the Austrahan Capital Territory is well adfurther vanced and the Committee would have reported early in the next autumn session if the duration of this Parliament had allowed. Evidence has now been taken from 34 of the 63 persons and mendation organisations who have made submissions to the segregation Inquiry. The Committee also visited Darwin, other Adelaide and Albury-Wodonga to obtain stream; relevant background mformation for the Inquiry Continued and had proposed to extend this to include other Sources) capital cities. The report I have just tabled contains a strong recommendation that the inquiry into Planning Procedures and Processes in the Australian Capital Territory be again referred to the Committee if it is re-appointed by the thirty-first Parliament. An election for the Legislative Assembly will take place in 1978 at which issues of future constitutional development for the Territory will be widely canvassed. The role that the Legislative Assembly should plan in planning and development is a central point in this Inquiry and will be an important consideration in the debate proceeding that election. The Austrahan Capital Territory Committee's conclusions and recommendations on the role that the National Parliament should play, the future role and structure of the NCDC and its relation with the Legislative Assembly and the community, as well as relations between the various bodies involved in the planning process and their various relationships with the community should be avaUable for consideration by those involved in that debate. I would therefore emphasise this Committee's view that the re-appointment of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory after the election, and the referral of this matter to it again, should be a matter of priority. I have also tabled a short report deahng with that have been taken to implement the report from this Committee of last Decemberuseful Canberra City Wastes- a Long Term Strategy It for Collection and Disposal'. This report simply Parinforms Parliament of the actions that various Ministers and their departments have taken to implement recommendations made in the main report. Annexed to the report itself are copies of replies from Ministers to letters from the Chairman of the Committee, detailing the actions so The Committee notes in the report its general with progress so far made on the in its report but expresses the which have not been should be matters for continuing by the departments concerned, and that action should be taken where appropriCommittee are: matters which still concern the ate. Particular The failure so far to implement the Committee's recomfor a pilot scheme to test the feasibility of a household-based waste collection system that would involve of waste so that as much paper, metal, glass and valuable products can be recovered from the waste delays to enact the Air Pollution (Stationary Ordinance and Regulations. Air pollution in Canberra needs to be regulated by legislation and everything possible should be done to expedite the draft ordinance. In relation to the Committee's recommendations for the establishment of a waste authority to integrate various aspects of collection and disposal in the Territory, the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) has commented that, in view of possible transfer of this function to the control of the Legislative Assembly, would be wrong to pre-empt the Assembly making a decision about future arrangements and authorities. The Minister has, however, tablished an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee as an interim measure. In the Committee's view, as an interim step, this is a satisfaccontext tory compromise but it holds to its earher view that a waste authority is necessary if this matter to receive the expert and co-ordinated attention that it requires in a city such as Canberra. Finally, I should like to express my thanks all members and senators who have served on the Committee during this Parliament for the restrictive. support they have given me as the Deputy Chairman and the contributions they have made work of the Committee. Like the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), I pay ticular tribute to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Frank Crean, for his conthe tribution to this Committee. He has been on the Committee for only a very short time, but we were very pleased to have the benefit ofhis wide experience and knowledge. He made a conscienservices tious and valuable contribution in that time. should also like to thank the Clerk to this ComFurther, mittee, Mr Nairn, and the Committee's Research Officer, Mr Watson, for the work they have done for the Committee during this session. I mend the report to the House. TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL Liability Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time.",49
128,Mr FIFE,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY," I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the language Trade Practices Act to enable parties to certain ing commercial transactions, which fall within the to definition in the Act of a consumer transaction, to The hmit their liability above a minimum level. The Trade Practices Amendment Act, which came into force on 1 July 1977, extended the finition of a consumer transaction to include tain commercial transactions involving acquiconsumer sitions of goods or services costing less than $15,000. Since that amendment, the Governprovides ment has received representations from sections of industry expressing strong concern. This conbe cern relates to the possibility that, in certain circumstances, a breach of the non-excludable conditions and warranties implied by the Act into relevant commercial contracts could present it industry with enormous costs for consequential by damages. Furthermore, the Government has been informed that the risk involved in such cirescumstances is, for the most part, non-insurable. The Government has concluded that in the of commercial dealings in commercial goods or services it is reasonable to allow parties is to a contract to negotiate their own arrangements regarding habihty for consequential damages flowing from a breach of the contract. The Government is seeking to free Austrahan comto merce from unnecessary straitjackets imposed by legislation. The present position is unnecessarily to the In making the amendments to which I have just referred, the Trade Practices Aa will conparunue to maintain a basic philosophy that supphers of goods or services should stand behind quality andtitleof those goods or services in their dealings with business as well as with the public. Accordingly, the Bill does not allow liability for repair or replacement of faulty goods or or for a breach of the undertakings in I section 69 relaung to title to be excluded. the Bill does not allow relevant liability to be limited with total disregard to equity between the parties. The Government believes that comrecent amendments to the law in the United Kingdom in this regard are appropriate to the Australian situation. Accordingly, a Umitation of in a contract governed by the Trade (No. 2) 1977 Practices Act may be challenged on the grounds that the limitation was not fair or reasonable between the parties. Second Reading The Bill gives a list of indications as to the determination of fairness or reasonableness. Apart from the question of Umitation of liabtiity there are a number of technical difficulties in the of the present Act relevant to calculatthe monetary Umit. Particularly, these relate situations where goods are hired or leased or there are credit charges involved in a transaction. Bill remedies these technical difficulties. I now turn to another matter dealt with in this deBiU. Honourable members wtil be aware that cerquality standards for, and information about, goods is the central concern of the Australian consumer movement. The present Act for consumer product safety standards and consumer product information standards to prescribed by regulations. This has led to substantial delays due to complexities in drafting which have been greatly criticised by the consumer movement. This is an important area and the Government has decided to provide for alternative procedures to enable consumer prodthe uct standards to be brought into law more benefit, simply. The procedure envisaged by the Bill seeks to rely upon the very substantial work in the field of consumer standards by private organisations in Australia, particularly the dards Association of Austraha. Mr Speaker, in a Press statement. I made two days ago I referred to the intention of the Government to amend the Trade Practices Act allowance. with respect to manufacturers' warranties. Government will be dealing with this matter early next year, upon our return to office. I com-not mend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. NA Debate resumed from 20 October, on motion by Mr Hunt: That the Bill be now read a second time.",50
129,Mr HUNT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"I seek the indulgence of the House an amendment not included in the second reading speech of this Bill. As announced by Senator Removal the Honourable Margaret Guilfoyle, Minister for ried Social Security, the Government make provisions for a benefit to be paid to supporting fathers on the same basis as supporting mothers. In the Committee stage I shall move appropriate amendment to the Bill.",51
130,Dr KLUGMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"This Bill rovides a number of amendments to the ervices Act. The Opposition opposes only one the proposed amendments. To the motion that the Bill be now read a secondtimeI move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view stituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading House deplores the failure of the Government to abolish seven day waiting period when introducing payment in arrears for unemployment benefit.' I foreshadow that in the Committee stage of the debate the Opposition will be voting against clause 13 which concerns the payment ofunemf iloyment benefits for school leavers and those eaving tertiary education institutions. In dealing with the Bill I shall quickly refer to the proposed amendments. There is the extension of the bUity for the handicapped child's aUowance less severe cases where the famUy income is lowlast and financial hardship would otherwise be suffered. The Opposition supports this but has slight reservations about the manner in which the Government has made the amendment and ruled method that is being used to increase the namely, the widening of the discretion of the Director-General of Social Security. The Bill done gives no indication of how the handicapped chUd's aUowance will be appUed or how the StanDirector-General will decide whether a particular instance causes severefinancialhardship to the fanuly. Basically, we support the proposition that those famUies should be entitled to the The We support the extension of the Commonwealth RehabUitation Service to those who are at present ehgible. Provided they can benefit by the services I feel very strongly that the service should be extended. The only questions I have are: Are the facUities adequate? How many people are receiving rehabUitation treatment at present? How many people does the Govern1977 ment estimate will be entitled to the rehabUitaSecond Reading tion service when the guideUnes are changed? I now turn to one of the more controversial sections of this legislation. I refer to the doublespeak of the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) representing the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) when giving the second reading to foreshadow speech he said: of a provision which discriminates against marwomen in relation to sickness benefit and bringing the income test for sickness benefit into line with that applying to has decided to unemployment benefit That sounds very impressive. The Government is an removing some discrimination against married women. Anybody who heard the Minister making his second reading speech would have assumed that there will be a benefit for married Social women. In fact, what the Government is of introducing is the removal of the benefit which husbands, who would be entitled to sickness benefit on all grounds, except when their wives to sub-were working, receive at present. This benefit will now be removed in the case of husbands. So the it is the removal of a benefit and not the granting the of a benefit at all. Let me give an example of the sort of doublespeak to which I am referring. If the Government were to grant equal pay to women tofightdiscrimination and so on it would do that by reducing the male rate of pay. The founh item in the legislation gives effect to the Government's decision to make it impossible for school leavers to receive unemployment ehgibenefit until the end of January or early to February. Honourable members will recaU that year the Government made that decision believing, I assume, that it was entitled to make that decision. One case, the Karen Green case, was taken to the High Coun and the High Coun that that decision could not be made in an arbitrary manner although it was possible to make that decision in individual cases if the cases did not satisfy the guidelines. ment is to make this decision apply generally. The Government is also introducing retrospecastrous. tive payments for unemployment benefit and argues that this was recommended by Dr Myers in his report on the payment of unemployment benefit. What Dr Myers actuaUy recommended in his report was that retrospective payments should be introduced for unemployment benefit provided the waiting period of seven days abolished. I quote from paragraph 4.11.7 where, referring to payment in arrears which I think the officialtitle,and the abolition of the waiting period, he said: Indeed, the two measures ayment in arrears without the waiting period would ardship in the period before the first cheque was This would be fairly obvious to most people who have had any experience with the majority persons who become entitled to unemployment benefit. The changes in the procedure for the E ayment of unemployment benefit which have een implemented from the beginning of the November wtil create considerable hardship those people registering after that date. People will register. They will return a form on about day 15. The Government, on day 21 or thereone abouts, will pay a cheque for seven days benefit. Then, on day 34 or thereabouts there wtil be another cheque. So for thefirstmonth all persons entitled to receive unemployment benefit will have received only one cheque. They are asked to cope for a month or more on only one week's benefit. The main reason given for this change from the current system of payment in advance is that the system has led to over-payments. to have been largely as a result of staff shortages. The penalisation of the unemployed seems harsh. The seven-day waiting period has been retained despite the recommendation of the Myers mquiry that it be aboUshed. If the Governby ment were to accept the recommendation for the aboUtion of the waiting period the first cheque would then be for two weeks payment in arrears. This is what the Opposition would urge. The assumption behind the waiting period is that people actually apply for benefit as soon as are unemployed and will therefore have some carry-on money. There seems to be evidence that people often avoid registering as unemployed because they hope to avoid the stigma of being on unemployment benefit, or on Government calls the dole. These people therefore delay their apphcation until they are runNow the Governning out of money. For these people the new changes will be disThe long wait for the receipt of their first fortnightly benefit wtil leave them completely penniless. They wiU not receive theirfirstfortnightly benefit until the second month of unemployment. The current system, with the inevitable problems of bureaucracy, has already placed additional strains on many agencies is which are having to assist people waiting fbr theirfirstcheque. The change in the system can is only make the load on these agencies even heavier. I am now speaking about voluntary agencies or some agencies funded or helped by State governments. fit hand in glove, as fortnightly cause Let me state the Opposition's position on the received. question of unemployment benefit. Our pohcy is to pay unemployment benefit for the first week of unemployment. It is imperative now that payof ment of unemployment benefit is made in arrears after production of an income statement. We accept that proposition, but we say that that should be done only provided the other part of Myers suggestion is also accepted-the payfor ment for thefirstweek of unemployment. Without benefit being paid during the waiting period beneficiaries are forced to hve for a month on week's income. It has been found by people who have looked at this situation that 67 per cent of the unemployed have less than $50 in savings. We cannot condone the hardship, the chaos and the strain on voluntary agencies without a being national program of emergency aid. The Opposition has put a question on notice in an attempt tofindthe cost of paying the first week's unemployment benefits but, as far as I know, when I last looked fbr it, the answer has These seem not been given. very I would hke now to make a few comments on the Government's announced intention, both by statement by the Minister for Social Security and a foreshadowed amendment by the Minister for Health to amend this Bill in the Committee stage for the purpose of bringing in a lone father's benefit similar to the supporting mothers' benefit. The Opposition advocates this strongly. We announced some time ago that this they was part of the Australian Labor Party's poUcy for the forthcoming election. We all know that we are sitting here at present and will be sitting here for at least one and possibly two days next week, for purely cosmetic reasons as far as the what the Government is concerned. The many promises that it made have not been carried out and it is trying to bring in some amendments and, as far as it can, it will try introduce legislation covering the sorts of things the Opposition has promised. The Government has suddenly found that money is available after having said when the Opposition proposed the lone father's benefit that it was impossible to this sort of thing and that it was irresponsible. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr after Good luck) nods his head in agreement. I glad to see that. He knows that the Government has previously told him that certain things could not be done. As I understand it, the Treasury was asked to cost the lone father's benefit and the percentage range of its costing estimate was of the widest ever. The Treasury estimated that the cost would be between $9m and $45m a year. a That leaves a 400 per cent margin of error, which is quite considerable. It is one of the difficult things to cost because we do not know how many lone fathers will take advantage ofit. Inasmuch as many lone fathers at the present time may be working because they have no who is unable alternative, this benefit will make it possible for say that she can them to give up work, in some cases at least, and to look after their children. The children will obperhaps viously benefit. The family situation, such as it vices exists m those cases, will obviously benefit. Thereatime will be, at least in theory, a clawback because with to one assumes that the jobs which then will beSecurity, come vacant, because the lone fathers ing those jobs, will be taken by other people. The partment. There mayfrom net cost to the Government at atimeof very sigany other person receiving nificant or very high unemployment is, of course, benefits, whose chUdren have been less than the actual cost because unemployment benefit of, I think, $7.50. The chUdren is reduced and some people are enabled to ceive benefits at the sametime.I assume that it was a combination of these factors, the fact that there is an election coming on and the fact that the Government expects unemployment to get then much worse next year- I suppose those two go lowance together-whic h finally convinced the Governincome of ment overnight to bring in this legislation which probably a$11 had been foreshadowed by the Austrahan Labor income. That child Party. I do not want to take up the full time aUocated to me, but there is one other point I want to raise. It is related to school leavers. Perhaps it shorten the debate in the Committee stage if I make what to me is an important point. I heard the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges), when this matter was debated before, arguing that parents ought to be able to look after their chtidren; that they ought to take the responsipeople, biUty for looking after their school leaver dren for the six weeks over Christmas and January because to look after their chUdren is just one of the obligations that parents accept. to This may or may not be so. It is much easier for the honourable member for Petrie to say that or for me to say that than it is for people in much worse economic circumstances. I have received complaints from my electorate, and I am sure do that other people received them last year, from persons who were completely unable to look their school leaver children at that time. am They include pensioners and other parents. What Ifindparticularly unpleasant is the fact that the family allowance stops when the child leaves school. In the case of pensioners the dependant benefit stops when school finishes; yet one those chUdren do not become eUgible for anything else. That is fair enough if the chtid can find job, but we all know that it will be very difficult this year, as it was last year-it will be even more difficult this year-for young people to find a job. pension What does the woman who is on a widow's do for six weeks to look after her child to find a job? It is all very well to apply for special benefit or that the Director-General of Social Serwtil accept her as a special case. It will take longtimeto obtain that benefit. It takes a long get it at ordinary times; but Christmas, all due respect to the Department of Social are leavthe fastestis response not one of thetimeswhen one obtains be any government dethe case of a widow, or social security entitled to a have been reentitled to a family aUowance, depending their position in the famUy, of at least $3.50onper week.

There may be a sudden drop in very to $12 for that family, which is large proportion of the total then has the additional costs of trying tofinda job-the costs of going to the Commonwealth Employment Service office, going to the office of the Department of Social wtil Security,ringingup, buying newspapers which advertise jobs and that sort of thing. I hope that the Government at least wtil give instructions to the departmental officers to deal with appUcants in a sensitive way and not to treat them in the way that this Government normally treats these since it no longer wtil be facing an elecchUtion on 10 December. Hopefully, by then, the present Opposition wtil be in government and hopefully new instructions will be issued by a new Minister for Social Security. The other point with which I have some difficulty is the proposition put by the Government that it will not pay unemployment benefit for school leavers until six weeks after the examination is due. I am not quite sure how that will be interpreted. Basically, it means that a school leaver will not be able to leave school before his or her final examination for the year. The same will apply to people with some tertiary training. I think this is a bit rough on a number of people. I know that the Director-General of Social Services is able to give this benefit for good and sufficient reasons, but I am not quite sure what these good and sufficient reasons would be. One of the other changes I would urge, with regard to this general question of unemployment and sickness benefits, is that they be bought into hne with other payments as far as permissible income is concerned. The important point there, as those honourable members who try to claim such benefits for their constituents would be aware, is that, for example, in the case of a single pensioner the permissible income is $20 a week. In the case of a single person applying for unemployment or sickness benefit it is $3 a week. If that person earns more than $3 a week, or $6 a week in the case of a couple, there is a loss on a dollar for dollar basis. This means that only a very small income can be earned. People receiving unemployment or sickness benefit can get into strife very quickly. Finally, I am not one of those who argue women who become unemployed should be enlook titled to unemployment benefit when their husthe bands are employed. I know that this issue has been raised by a number of women, but I feel that it would be too difficult to police and too pensive. I cite the case of a family where both husband and wife have been working and it would be a very low income family if only one person was working. With both wife earning something of the order of $150 a week, the total family income would be approximately $300 a week, and probably $260 a week after taxation. This would be a quite reasonable income for that family. If the wife suddenly loses her job, that income falls to $ 140-odd a week. That is a hell of a blow family and I am sure that none of us could sursonally, vive for any length of time on that sort of income without drawing on our capital resources. This one of the questions that have to be raised. alise that in some ways it contradicts some of other arguments about school leavers, but I invite honourable members to compare the ing income of that family with the relatively high incomes of people such as ourselves who possibly have working wives. When one of the children reaches the age of 16 or 18 years and leaves school, and after a period of six weeks has not found a job, that family, provided the child is under 18 years, will receive $36 a week, and if the child is over 18 years the family will receive, I think, $49.30 a week even though there is a parental income of $500, $600 or $700 a week. Is this a fair way of doing it as far as means testing f ;oes? When the boy or girl is still at home and is ooking for a job the question of means testing is a very difficult one. We talk about the family unit in the sense of two spouses with a total income inasmuch as one or the other is entitled to a benefit, but the children are not taken into account. I am not going to advocate a means test based on parental income which takes into account unemployment and sickness benefits for children. I want to emphasise that. Otherwise I will be quoted during the election campaign as saying that I was advocating that. I do not advocate it. But surely people here can see that possibily there is something wrong with our approach in the situation which I was talking about before, where a couple whose incomes drops suddenly from $260 or $280 a week to $140 is entitled to nothing, but the other family with no drop in income at all and with a boy or girl still at home, as he or she has been for the previous 18 years, will get from the state $49.30 a week I think it is, in unemployment benefits. I hope that whichever that government is in power after 10 December will at this for the purpose of possibly increasing level of the means test for the unemployment benefit so that if a husband and wife really earn only a basic minimum income they still receive exsome subsidy when one or the other becomes unthe employed. I commend to the House the amendment that I have moved. I emphasise again that we will be dividing on clause 13 of the Bill in the the husband and Committee stage.",51
131,Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"Is around the amendment seconded? Mr Crean- I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. for that Mr HODGMAN (Denison) (3.7)- I perand I believe this Government, have a vision of an Australia where social justice shall is prevail and the needs of all underprivileged I remembers of our community will sympathetically my and effectively be cared for. I thirst for an era where poverty is eliminated, hardship and sufferare alleviated and all Australians shall not want for any of the basic fundamentals of humanearnings. existence. Whilst I do not agree with all that honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) has said, I commend him for the obvious sina cerity ofhis speech. I believe that it can be fairly said that the present Federal Liberal-National Countiy Party Government has done more to bring social jusdard tice to the Austrahan community than any prehave ceding government. Whilst I do not want to go through an exercise of comparing the behaviour of one government with that of another, I simply want to say that for the first time in the history this country the pensioners of Australia now able to hve in a climate in which politics has been taken out of the area of pensions. It was this Government which legislated for automatic indexation of pensions. I beheve that legislation did a service to the pensioners that it was not a matter for government to decide how much it would throw to the pensioners Budget time. Our Government legislated for indexation and the pensioners have received increases in accordance with the movements in the consumer price index. On 10 November the pension will again be increased as a direct result of the legislation we introduced. The single standard rate pension will rise by $2.20 to $49.30Also a week and the combined married rate will rise by $3.70 to $82.20.1 must in all fairness say that155,000 it was the previous Government which an introduced the 6-monthly indexation of pensands sions, and our Government has fallen into that pattern of indexing pensions automatically monthly intervals. I still beheve-I say this as criticism of the Government-that where there quarterly indexation of wages there should be quarterly indexation of pensions. I hope that some time it will be possible for this to effected. One of the most interesting points is that continue to reduce inflation the need for indexa-benefits tion at more frequent intervals diminishes beincrease cause in this situation where inflation actually dropping the question of indexation on a 3monthly or 6-monthly basis does tend to lose relevance. Nevertheless, I contend that prima facie there should be no distinction between wages on the one hand and pensions on the other. While I am on that point I compliment Government for resisting moves which were apgreat parently put to it to do something in relation Commonwealth superannuation. I know this not strictly witliin the terms of this Bill but a move to change the indexation of Commontage wealth superannuation pension payments from the consumer price index to average weekly I am delighted that the Government the determined that it would not create a system of indexation in respect of one area of pensions and different system of indexation in respect of another area of pensions. When this Government came to power the pensions payable were $38.75 at the single stanrate and $64.50 at the married rate. We increased those rates to $49.30 for the single rate and $82.20 for the married rate. I beheve that is an achievement of which we can be proud. More than that, we have taken a step to of remove from the backs of the Austrahan penare sioners the hardship of the taxation which was imposed on them by the previous Government because it was the previous Government, the Whitlam Government, which will go down in history as the first government in this country to because it meant tax pensions. each Dr KLUGMAN - Not true.",54
132,Mr HODGMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"In 1974 your Government introduced taxation scales which were a bitter rip-off of the pensioners of Austraha. I am proud nextto say that m this Budget of 1977 we have introduced tax reforms which will lift the yoke of taxation from 225,000 pensioners in this country. in our period in office we have abolished the property means test, as a direct result of which pensioners in this country have received increase in their pensions and many thouof others who were previously inehgible are now in fact ehgible for pensions. I do not at 6know whether the honourable member for no Prospect appreciates that as at 30 June this year is this Commonwealth Government was paying benefits in age pensions, invalid pensions, wives' at pensions, sheltered employment allowances, be widows' pensions and supporting mothers' benefits to 1,673,000 people. The cost to the Austrahan taxpayer of the unemployment benefit as wealone is $618m, that amount being the total of paid to 250,000 people. That is an on the previous year in which the cost of is the benefit for 188,000 people was $514m. its I hope that the honourable member for Prospect will be interested in some of these statistics I am about to give. Because of the time available we have limited debate on this matter the and my remarks will not be continuing at any length. I point out-the Minister for Health to (Mr Hunt) has pointed this out in the is Parhament-that Austraha has an aging popuit waslation. The increase of pensioners as a percenof the work force is quite dramatic. In 1968 pensioners as a percentage of the work force totalled approximately 17 per cent. Today the figure is 27 per cent. Pensioners as a percentage of the working age in 1968 was 12 per cent. Today it is 20 per cent. So the pension bill- I do not regret this but this is a fact of life that we will have to hve with-wil l continue to rise because Austraha has an aging population. At the present moment 78 per cent of our aged population in Austraha, that is all male persons over 65 years and female persons over 60 years, receive a pension. I do not begrudge that situation; I am simply mdicating that the number of persons over the age of 65 who are working has decreased. In 1968 the percentage receiving a pension was not 78 percent, the figure I have just quoted, but only 53 per cent. Therefore our commitment to those people will continue. I draw attention to the fact that last year we had an increase of 10.4 per cent in the number of such invalid pensions but the increase in the cost to scheme, revenue was 25.5 per cent. In pensions the increase was 4 per cent in the things, instead of scheme number of pensioners and 16.6 per cent in the particular girl for pohtical cost to revenue. I could go on at some length. The number of people receiving sheltered unemployment allowances went up by 11 per cent and cost by 41 per cent. The number of class A widows pensions went up 7.1 per cent and the number of class B widows pensions 8.4 per cent while the expenditure rose 13.8 per cent. The only other category to which I want to refer relates to a matter for which the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) has earned the praise and gratitude of this Parliament the nation. I refer to the campaign that he has successfully led for the introduction of supporthonourable ing benefits for lone fathers. He did a maglow nificent job and the people of Australia recognise it. I do not overlook work done by any other honourable members in earher years. I simply say that the credit for this victory properly on the shoulders of the honourable member Franklin, an indefatigiblefighteron behalf the underprivileged of this nation. His efforts have been rewarded. The increase in unmarried mothers pensions was 9.1 per cent last year. increase in deserted wives pensions cent. The increase in separated-de facto wives pensions was 14.2 per cent. The increase in the other categories, which included additional benefits for children, mothers allowances supplementary assistance, was 25.7 per cent. draw the attention of the House to these figures to indicate the enormity of the burden of the cost of social welfare to the community. We would all like to see pensions increased and we would all like to see benefits extended but when reach a situation when we have to say to the Australian taxpayer: 'We will tax you higher to meet these benefits'? I nouce that my time is fast running out, so I come to my concluding remarks. I refer to the Karen Green case. I say very quickly that I , Karen Green and her family deplore the political purpose to which her case has been put. Her mother has telephoned me complaining that this girl is repeatedly being thrown up in the newspapers and repeatedly being used for pohucal purposes when in fact she has been at work since March of this year. I want to say something about the right to work campaigners who latched onto the Karen Green case and used it for purely political purposes. I wish some of these people would get onto the schemes that we have going, as the Community Youth Support scheme, the Special Youth Employment Training the Commonwealth Rebate Apprenticethe field of age ship Full-Time and all those other using unemployment and one purposes. I conclude by saying that as far as the honour the able member for Franklin and I are concerned our consciences are clear on the question of unemployment in our areas. We have worked to alleviate unemployment. The figures show that the unemployment rate in Hobart is lower than in any other part of the State. We deplore people using the Karen Green case. We deplore the fact that she has been used for pohtical purposes. This girl has been used malevolently. I would and have hoped that members of the Labor Party would have adopted the sincere approach of the member for Prospect rather than folsome of the pubhcity hunters who picked on a Tasmanian girl and decided to make her a national political pawn. I support the Bill and congratulate the Government. I congratulate the rests good Samaritan Minister for Social Security, for Senator Guilfoyle, who is one of the unsung of heroes of this Parhament. She is repeatedly bashed and too infrequently praised. I nope we do not see a return to the wicked Hayden days The when the pensioners of Austraha were taxed and was 8.4 per used as a political football.",55
133,Mr BRYANT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL, I suppose the honourable member for Denison (Mr and Hodgman) had a few points to make but they I were obscured with what I would call rather specious arguments. He is proud of the situation that has developed in social security. I point out that this Government is the inheritor of most of these systems. It has introduced no new initiado we tives at all so far as one can tell.,56
134,Mr HODGMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,What about the family allowances?,57
135,Mr BRYANT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"There have been changes in quahty in one way or another and changes in years. description. Family aUowances, of course, are the direct descendants of such matters as child endowment and aU the rest ofit. There again the distinctions without a difference upon which the honourable member thrives. He mentioned that more people are now on pensions and that bigger proportion of people over 65 are now on pensions. He overlooked the rather important factor that the aboUtion of the means test for people over 70 years brought in a large number of extra pensioners. He used the mity of the burden' and I will deal with that moment. He expressed the views of all of us, I would expect, when he said that he wants to see what an Australia in which no human being will want to do with for the substance of human existence. I think that is the objective of all of us. But we have watched him support consistently a government whose whole program has been to deprive the people at accustomed the lower end of the scale to the advantage of the number of areas people at the top end of the scale. I have not time this afternoon to debate that matter but the shift in the wealth of this nation back from the work force and the household to the business corporations has been quite dramatic in the last couple of years. There is another fact that I think we should not ignore. The honourable member said that the percentage of the pension in relation to average weekly earnings was now higher than it was Press when, the Government came into office a couple of years ago. The fact is that the Government adopted the pohcy-and it has had it enforced through the various tribunals which decide these matters-that the rise in the consumer price will not be fuUy appUed to people's wages. So, there has been a fall in the relationship between the CPI and average weekly earnings pensions have been indexed in full. Some of those arguments are not all that real either. An increase of 2 per cent on $200 a week is only same in money terms as an increase of 2.6 per cent on $150 a week. I suppose that the lone arithmetic fathers benefit is one of these things that is overdue, but again it is a development of the syscent tem established in the past. Mr Martyr-The honourable member for Frariklm is a good httle feUow.",57
136,Mr BRYANT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,He would not have thought of it if there had not been an aUowance for lone mothers. Mr Fisher-You had three years in which to provide it.,57
137,Mr BRYANT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"We did very well in three I do not have the time this afternoon to explain it all. I will write to the honourable member from here after the election. We support the are handicapped childrens benefit. We support the extension of the rehabUitation scheme. I think the approach to the young people's unemploya ment benefit is totally immoral, callous and insensitive. I believe that the approach to married women and sickness benefits, which is put in the Bill as a demonstration of non-discriminatory tactics on the pan of this Government, is a term 'the enorspecious exercise. in a I want to deal with the general principles of we are talking about. Social security at this stage in Australia ought not to be just something the deserving poor. It is a right, not a charity. It has taken a long whtie for the community to become accustomed to it. We are to it in most areas related to pension benefits. We are accustomed to it in a good related to invahd benefits and things of that nature. But we are still not accustomed to accepting it in relation to people who are unemployed. I regard the use of the term 'dole' as offensive. I regard the use of the term 'dole bludger' as even more offensive. So I hope that members of this Parhament at least will stop using it. People who do not know any better cannot be blamed. I refer to those people who write for the and others but I tliink it is time we started to adopt an attitude' which has been expressed has for a long wluie in legislation passed by this place, namely, that there are people in the community who are entitled to a certain degree of index support from the community. When such support is given, the terms upon which they receive it have to be couched in such a way that they whereas retain their human dignity. So our aim in this place should be to estabUsh the a reasonable standard of living for all Australians: We should, I suppose, examine the of it for this year. I was calculating the long ngures only a moment ago, based on my own reobservations of statistics so I ask honourable members not to hold me to the arithmetic. What is the situation? I return to the statement of our friend, the honourable member for Denison, who referred to the enormity of the burden. There are some 14 milhon of us on this continent. About six and a half mUlion are doing work of various kinds, and I suppose that includes us, all the people in the normal work force, aU the people who are self-employed, and all the rest us. That leaves perhaps six and a half million seven milhon other people who have to hve the production, services and goods supphed those people. I suppose two and a half million of the 14 million populadon are at school; half a milhon who are at pre-school, I guess. I expect that two milhon people are hving at home in various circumstances-in retirement or in circumstances of the that nature. Perhaps one million married women force,ofno are not active in the work force and half a million those people people are unemployed. We have one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and we have at our disposal an enormous capacity to produce. We have accepted principle that a great number of people ought receive benefits without any means test being phed. We are accustomed to that situation. I pose at this stage we should be looking at such techniques as a guaranteed rmnimum income, hardship supplements or benefits of that nature. But we still have a htde way to go before we drag such a scheme out of the great tangle of benefits which we provide at the present time. Whenever we are talking about these things we should remember that a very large prowtil portion of the Austrahan work force goes mto retirement on community-supported means-testpersonal free income. We are a part of that group. pose that we pay more towards our pension or our superannuation, call it what you will, in portion to our income than almost anybody in the work force. I pay $2,500 per annum. been in the Parhament for 20 years. I do not know what my average contribution would be over those years but it is probably of the $2,000 per annum. On that basis I would paid so far $40,000. But, of course, I was paying only £500 or £600-say $l,000-during the first years after I entered Parhament so I probably would have paid in total about $30,000. If electors of the division of and retire me instead of exercising go out on a pension equivalent to three-quarters of our salary; that is, about $18,000. After Vh years I would be getting to the position had got back what I had paid in. We all accept that. I was in the Victorian teaching service for 20 years. During thattimeI was paying into a sion scheme which would have substantial benefits upon retirement. Under that scheme it might have taken longer back the money I had paid in. I do not what thefigureswould be, but there must be of more than half a miUion people in Australia conor tributing to superannuation schemes of various upon government instrumentaUties. There must be by 100,000 people in the defence services and its subsidiaries. So we are talking about something Uke three-quarters of a mUhon people at least will receive a substantial means-test-free government-supported income. We should be applying ourselves continuously to the idea that community should be able to provide that sort benefit for the remainder of the work matter how much it costs. I know that who put forward arguments about the means test are bedevUled by the sheer arithmetic of the situation. I do not claim to know the answer. AU I ask is that on occasions such as this the we do take time off to examine it. to I want to spend a moment or two dealing with apthe unemployment benefit. I am one of those suppeople who from 1932 to 1935 was unemployed. I know what it is all about. I left school and did not get a job and there was no unemployment benefit. I think that the system which is being can adopted here this afternoon is most callous, insensitive and mean. I hope that those spirited defenders of the freedom of the individual and of humanity, such as my friends from Tasmania, support us in this regard. A young person leaving school today is going into a very tense family situation. To add this to it is to I supcompound the misery we have imposed upon them collectively by not being able to solve the proeconomic problems of the country. It is not an else economic question; it is one of humanity.

Indeed, I believe my friends the Opposition have also been persuaded to adopt the same pohcy. It has been a httle disapspoken pointing to the country that the Government so far made no move towards implementing the pohcy which it has adopted. I beheve it is fair say in regard to the abolition of the means that for many years I have been the prime mover, that is, apart from a former member, Sirter Keith Wilson, who for the past 25 years and more has also been advocating this. When I was a Minister I was able to persuade the Government of the day-that was the icy MCMahon Government-to commit itself to the the speech aboUtion of the means test. That has been the policy of the Government parties ever lieve that it is time now for that policy to implemented. Something should be done about it. It is of no use the Government saying: 'We not have the finance to do it'. The amount money is substantial, but it is not astronomical. The honourable member for Denison Hodgman) earlier this afternoon quoted percenadmissible. tages of those who drew pensions. I think afigureof 78 per cent. He was wrong, because he did not allow for war pensions and other pensions of this character ably inflate that figure. Let us look thefiguresand remember that pensions are taxThat able. In practically all cases those who would would draw pensions if the means test were abohshed now but who do not draw them now would be paying means tax at the rate of at least 33c in the doUar. Some would be paying more. The actual cost to the revenue is by no means as great as certain people have endeavoured to put about.

A benefit shall not be granted to a person who is a supporting parent unless the Direaor-General considers that it is reasonable that the supporting parent should have taken action to obtain maintenance from the person or persons who is or are the father or fathers, or the mother or mothers, as the case may be, of the child or children in relation to whom the first-mentioned person is the supporting parent and that that person has taken such action to obtain such maintenance as the Director-General considers reasonable. 83AAE.

(2) A benefit in force under Part IVAAA of the Principal Act immediately before the commencement of this secuon continues in force, after the commencement of this section, as if it had been granted under the Part substituted for that first mentioned Pan by sub-section (1) of this section.' The amendment seeks to add to the Bill provisions whereby the benefits currently available to supporting mothers are extended to supporting fathers. This is to be achieved by inserting a definition of supporting father. Because the new benefit will encompass both supporting mothers and supporting fathers, it will be renamed 'supporting parent's benefit.' The new benefit will be payable to all fathers bringing up children on their own and will come into effect on the date the Bill received the royal assent. Fathers who have already been supporting their children for six months or more will become eligible for a period of not less than 10 immediately the Bill becomes law. The rates of the new benefit and the income test will be the same as for the existing supporting mother's benefit. A supporting father will be Territory, other than Norehgible for benefit of $49.30 a week plus $7.50 a week for each child, including a student child. In addition, a guardian's allowance of $6 a week will be payable where he has the care of a child under six years of age, or an invahd child-$ 4 a week if the child is over six years but not an invahd. Thus a supporting father with two children, one of whom is under six years of age may receive, subject to the income test, a total benefit of $70.30 a week. In addition, he will be able to have a separate income of $32 a week without any effect on his benefit. Where rent is paid, supplementary assistance of up to $5 a week may also be payable. Eligible supporting fathers will also be entitled to the range of Commonwealth fringe benefits that are available to supporting mothers under existing conditions. These concessions are a reduced rental on their telephone, free hearing aid and funeral benefit. The Government will be discussing the new benefit with the States to gain their acceptance the inclusion of supporting terms as supporting mothers. Two States-Wes tern Australia and South Austraha-alread vide assistance to this group. In the meantime, those States in which State government assistmatter. ance is not provided in the first six months, a supporting father will be eligible to claim special benefit which is paid at unemployment benefit rates and subject to the unemployment benefit income test. Due to the lack of data on supportDuring ing fathers-thei r number, the size of their ies, their income distribution-and a lack knowledge as to the number likely to seek assistdid ance and the period for which they would seek it is not possible to estimate the exact cost ing supporting fathers the same benefits as available to supporting mothers. It is estimated, however, that the cost of a supporting father's benefit would be of the order of $ 10m in a full year,and$6.5min 1977-78.",59

In respect of each Budget since then I nave prosupporter tested at it not being included. I protested when was in Opposition. I regret to say that at that time. I did not get a great deal of support from party in that regard. I protested when we were returned to office. I have previously described this matter as the greatest gap in our social vices structure. I congratulate the Minister Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) who been able to force this matter through. I think this is a great triumph. I know that the able member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) and country other honourable members have been tremensoon dously interested in it. As the person who, I think, was primarily responsible for putting this matter forward, I have the greatest pleasure in supporting it.

146,Mr BRYANT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"Let me give some of the history correctly. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) of course is correct. his career as Minister for Social Services familhe carried out some advances, and during his of period as a Government back bencher he also the things which he mentioned today. The it, fact is that the real breakthrough was when the of payLabor Government put the supporting mother's are benefit in the book. We should congratulate those people who initiated the idea. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), who was Minister for Social Security at the time, persuaded all the people involved that it ought to be done. There are so many difficulties of definition techmcahties that people dredge up at times this. To arrive at the stage when this Parhament is prepared to accept the fact that people Sermay be entitled to benefits of this nature, whether or not they live together and whether or not they have been legally married, is a great social advance. It has taken a long time. From my own observations, one of the most disadvantaged groups in the community are the fathers, the men who have lost their wives, the or other parent of their children. No I matter what level of income they have or what status of employment they enjoy, it is tremenmy dous hardship and a great blow. I hope we can take all these things a few steps further and make sure that we remove all such disabilities. I just sersay out of kindness to everybody here that all for those people hke the honourable member for has Franklin (Mr Good luck) and all the other people who have taken part can exercise only a honoursmall amount of influence on the way the is run. To those who will be leaving us as as the election is declared, I say that even if they feel that their contribution to the Parliament has all been very minimal, it has been for the now nation, and that is a much bigger contribution than painting the back fence of the kindergarten to do on Saturday afternoon in a working bee.",62
147,Mr MCVEIGH,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"The who National Country Party supports this innovation of the Liberal-National Country Party Governfather's ment. We are dehghted to be associated with it. beheve it is appropriate in a debate such as this to give real credit where it is due. Over a the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has fought to ensure that an injuslone tice would be corrected. In the twilight of his days in the House ofRepresentatives he has the opportunity to compliment the Government on implementing this notable reform in the area of social justice. I beheve it is necessary to recorded in Hansard the names of other people who have shown a vital and continued interest the matter. Notwithstanding the statements of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) home. we must remember that in October 1974 the able present Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) moved an amendment to an Ausbecause trahan Labor Party Bill seeking to ensure that time, what is now being done would be done. That wasresponsible three years ago. On that occasion we did not have the support of the Labor Party. Those the facts, and no clouding of the issue can ever distort that truth. Let us be fair and honest. Mr Fisher-The honourable member for ably Murray put this matter forward too.",63
148,Mr MCVEIGH,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"My colleagues the honourmeals, able member for MaUee mentions the wonderful foods. contribution of the honourable member for ray (Mr Lloyd). I recaU- I am subject to correcwith tion-that on at least three occasions in this Uament, in his usual forthright and forceful style,teenage he advocated non-discrimination against lone fathers. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm effect, Fraser), a man of compassion and concern for the underprivileged, is on record on many his occasions advancing the proposition that, in tice, lone fathers should have the same entitlement as lone mothers. More recently eral other people also have been advancing proposition. I believe it is appropriate to recall that over it many years the people who I enumerated were pressing very strongly for this amendment which fathers has now been moved by the Minister for Health Kingdom also make (Mr Hunt). It is good to see that in this modern fathers who unfortunately day and age the Government, a government position. which wiU move with thetimes,is prepared to change its emphasis in the light of social and demographic change. There are changes in the concept of the farnily. Greater responsibuities crue because we now have working mothers. Thebe family is under greater threat because of easier divorce laws. Too often the father is the person is offended against. His situation is particularly difficult. Unless benefits such as lone benefit are extended, it will be necessary Ifor a lone father to work fuUtime.What does he do with his children while they are waiting for hfetime him to come home from work? Unfortunately employers by and large have not extended to fathers the same consideration as they have been prepared to extend to lone mothers in the had arrangement of shifts and working hours. The Finer Committee in the United Kingdom did a great deal of analysis on the matter. It was have found that a third of the lone fathers in the United Kingdom were leaving their chUdren to in their own devices at weekends and after school, leaving them to wait for their fathers to return It is absolutely necessary that the father be to arrange his affairs so that he is a fuU tim guardian and custodian of the fanuly. Too often, of the many and pressing caUs on his both as the bread winner and as the person for the upkeep of the home, he has been placed at very serious disadvantage. It is are not possible for him tofindthetimeto do the necessary repair jobs. It is not possible for him, as it is for the ordinary housewife, to look for the bargains and purchase the cheaper foods. Probbecause he lacks culinary skills and it is impossible for him to cook good nourishing he has to resort to easily prepared fast MurA lone father also has emotional problems which to deal, particularly if he has teenage Par- chUdren. The problem is accentuated if the child happens to be a daughter. It is not so easy for the lone father to mix in society. In he tends to become socially isolated. That is a problem he can overcome if he hastimeon hands to do the things he wants to do and he jusdoes not have to worry about being a full time employee. There has been a world-wide acceptsevance of the need for social benefits for lone the fathers. Although I do not agree that South Australia is the most advanced State in Austraha, is good to note that on 1 July this year the South Austrahan Government extended to lone mark, of that State a lone father's benefit. DenSweden, New Zealand and the United special benefits avaUable to are placed in this The amount of money involved will be quite large. A recent analysis indicated that there were acat least 25,000 lone fathers in Australia who will able to obtain this benefit. We of the National Country Party are deUghted that the Government has seenfitto spread the umbreUa of social justice to include people who have been discriminated against. It is unfortunate that traditional standards of society have broken down and that so many fathers are placed in this situation. But it is not for us to criticise; we to accept the posidon as it is and do what is ible to uphold the dignity of the people who are so afflicted. We are going to iron out the anomahes and give help where it is needed. fathers can take some comfort from the fact people have been pressing this need for them over a hfe-dme. The voice of the honourable to member for Mackellar was the lone voice crying out in the wilderness for many years. He was ported by the Prime Minister, the present Miniswidowed ter for Social Security, the honourable member for Murray and now by other newcomers in the Parliament, particularly the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck). What was an idea in the mind of one person originally has been taken, hammered and chiselled into shape so that in thefinalanalysis justice will be done a most deserving sector of the community.",63
149,Mr GOODLUCK,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL," I supable port the Bill. I wish to congratulate the Minister for Social Security (Senator GuUfoyle) for. ing in this very important legislation which will assist many lone fathers in Australia and in ticular their chUdren, which is the most imporwhom tant thing. I shaU outline very briefly a few of reasons why lone fathers were due for this supto port. WhUst we Uve and breathe pohtics every day and whilst sometimes one party may beat the other party to the punch, we cannot get away from the fact that the legislation will be passed and lone fathers will get their benefit. That is important thing. I am a Uttle disappointed with the remarks of one leader of the lone father; think he is the president of the New South Westall ern Lone Fathers Association. He said that he only 50 per cent happy",64
150,Mr HODGMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,Ver y ungrateful.,64
151,Mr GOODLUCK,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"I do not think he is ungrateful: I think that he just does not understand that political impUcations come into these sorts of decisions. The decision has now been made and the people in need will benefit. Also their chtidren will benefit and that is the important thing. We could pick out members who have sisted so earnestly in the framing of this legistask lation, but why should we? I think everybody in this chamber has supported it. Now we have it before us: That is the main thing. All politicians should drive in the direction that will help Austrahan pubhc as a whole. I think everybody would agree that that too, is important. I should Uke to read into Hansard part of an the article which I wrote about nine months ago and which outlines my feelings and sentiments as to why lone fathers should get a benefit comparable have with that of lone mothers. If we beheve, as I do, possthat the fanuly has the main responsibUity for socialising the next generation, is an important agent for social control, and provides a unique Loneopportunity for the satisfaction of emotional thatneeds, it should be understood that an incomplete fanuly is Ukely tofindit more difficult carry out these functions. Therefore, society is bound to be concerned, and concerned it should supbe. When a wife and mother is deserted or and left without maintenance, the community, through welfare benefits, makes provision to take over the breadwinner's role. This leaves the mother free to pursue her accepted role of homemaker if she chooses, though often under great difficulty and strain. When a father is left alone, the struggle to maintain a fulltimejob while still providing for child minding during the time he is away outside school hours is extemely difficult. When a woman remarries she is still to stay at home with her chUdren. Concerned fathers have told me that they must think bringvery carefully before remarrying and consider the compatibUity of the chUdren with their proparspective new mother, as she will be the one with they will spend most of theirtime.It can thethus be argued that if the community is prepared take the responsibUity of breadwinner for a single mother then it should also take the responsibiUty for the provision of a substitute mother when a father is prepared, at all costs, to keep his famUy together. The necessity for a lone the parent on both roles may arise suddenly. The widowed must learn to cope with their grief; the I divorced and unmarried with any doubts. Above they must face the task of convincing themis selves and their children that they can manage alone. Invariably, tasks and responsibuities are given to chUdren which are far too much for them. I can relate my own situation. Unfortunately two of my sisters grew up before their time because they were left with the burden of looking after their younger brother and sister. The point I asmake is that we have succeeded in a mammoth of introducing legislation which is going to help not this generation, but other generations. As I mentioned before, we all believe in the family unit. I believe that as a result of this measure the the famUy unit will be kept together, though perhaps not altogether satisfactorily and that tms legislation is a move in the right direction. Mr Groom- Mr Chairman, I seek your indulto gence to raise one matter. Is there some way which the Committee can formally move that honourable member for Franklin (Mr they Good luck) be commended for his tireless efforts for the lone fathers of Austraha?",64
152,The CHAIRMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"No, there is no way at all. It is not relevant to the Bill before the House.",65
153,Dr KLUGMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Chairwill man, this has stirred me. This is ridiculous.

158,Dr KLUGMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"I should like to state formally the Opposition's objection clause 13. Hopefully the people of this in country, particularly those who have children the leaving school this year, will remember when are voting on 10 December that because of the niggardly behaviour of this Government their children will not be able to receive unemployment benefit for six weeks after their examinations are completed. We have the ridiculous provision in this legislation that tertiary students not be able to obtain unemployment benefit for six weeks after their examinations if they do not complete their courses, unless the Directoris satisfied that the cessation of their was not due to a voluntary act and that of there was good and sufficient reason for it. We is will have more people continuously asking questions, people who are already in strife because cannot get jobs. Hundreds of thousands of people leaving school or tertiary institutions of some kind will now be deprived of six weeks unemployment benefit. In some cases it will be not the much more than six weeks unemployment because even if they leave earher the Government can rule that they left without a good and sufficient reason, that they left by a voluntary act, the voluntary act being trying to find employment. Under this Government, of course, to get a job is not a good and sufficient These people will not be able to receive the unemployment benefit until some time in February, no matter what time they leave after about August. I think this is a very unpleasant way of saving money and of pretending that the number in this country is much less than it really is. The Opposition therefore opposes clause 13.",65
159,Mr HUNT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL," I would like to make some reply to the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) on my own behalf because I believe that he is a point, that is that when school leavers isleave school they have been accustomed to receiving pocket money of some sort. Under the old arrangement they went straight on to unemployment benefit. In some instances parents have that this was not good so far as the attitude of the children was concerned. In the view, they were entided to a social service unemployment benefit which tended to kill their desire or initiative to take a job. So I do not think there will be the objection that the honourunable member for Prospect says there will be, because I have found that many parents were concerned that their children became ehgible for unemployment benefit when they felt that the children should not be tempted in this way. I think that the honourable member will find that on 10 December the people will not be as sensiGarland, tive to this issue or will not be as inclined to beGiliard. R.R.

165,Mr SCHOLES,PAIR," I wish to raise a matter which is of specific importance and which affects a relatively small number of people. It really relates to the need for a pro58 vision in the Social Services Act for discretion in 15 regard to the sections of the Act which relate to the payment of pensions outside Austraha. I 43 think all honourable members would agree that the specific case which I will put before the Committee indicates the need for the provision which I am suggesting. Some time ago I had cause to take up with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) the case of a widow whose Katter. R.C. Killen. D.J. husband, prior to his death, had been an invahd pensioner, this entitling her to payment of the equivalent of the pension on the basis that she MACKellar. M.J. R. MCLeay. J.E. was the wife of a pensioner, but not as of right. When the husband of the woman concerned Millar, P.C. Moore. J. C. died her entidement ceased, although she was not aware of this fact. The family decided that Peacock. AS. the husband should be interred in Italy and his Robinson, Ian Ruddock. P. M. wife accompanied the body to Italy without filling in an application for widow s pension Shipton. R. F. Simon, B.D. prior to leaving Australia. The husbandhad been dead for about four days when she left Australia. She was under the impression, as was her family, that she was in fact in receipt of a pension. They did not understand the niceties of the payment of a wife's allowance to the wife of a pensioner. When her family inquired why she was not receiving the pension they were informed that she was not eligible because she had left Australia before establishing eligibility by making the necessary apphcation for a widow's pension. This is a matter of definition. I think it is oversight in the Act, although it may have been a deliberate oversight at the ume. This is an area where, quite clearly, the Minister should have discretion to take action in order to allow the woman's application to be received as if it had been made prior to her departure from Australia. This is a matter where hardship was caused. In order to obtain eligibility for a continuation of the payment she was already receiving-it is largely only a technicality of applying for a widow's pension and receiving the same-sh e has to return to Australia or else be without that pension. I raise the matter because, although the Act will not be altered at this time, it ought to be altered at a subsequent time to give discretion to the Minister in cases where a quite clear hardship is created because of circumstances which do not arise very often but which should be able to be corrected when they do arise.",66
166,Mr HUNT,PAIR," I will take note of the point raised honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), which essentially seeks to give discretion to the Minister. I will make sure that the honourable member is passed on to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle). I think I have comprehended the desire of the honourable member to ensure that the legiscompanies, lation has a degree of flexibility to cater for serious cases that arise from time to time. Remainder of Bill agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment; report-b leave-adopted . Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Hunt)-by leave-rea a third time. TAXATION: FOREIGN COMPANIES Ministerial Statement",67
167,Mr VINER,PAIR,"Staling-Minister for Aboriginal ing paper. Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer)-by leave-At present, foreign company groups Australia usually conduct their operations through a subsidiary company which is incorporated here and is thus resident in Austraha for income tax purposes. These investors pay company tax of 46 per cent on their Austrahan taxable income, plus dividend withholding tax on dividends remitted to their home country. The basic rate of withholding tax is 30 per cent, and this is reduced to 15 per cent where the shareholder is resident in a country with which Australia has a comprehensive double tax agreejust an ment. Some foreign company groups conduct Australian operations through a branch of a company that is incorporated overseas, and, for tax purposes, resident in another country. The Australian taxable income of these branches is liable to company tax of 46 per cent, but remittances of branch profits to head office and dividends paid to foreign shareholders do not attract Australian tax additional to the primary company tax of 46 per cent. The Government will correct the lack of balance by introducing a branch profits tax based on the Australian taxable income of foreign resident companies. The tax applicable to branch profits, which will be a broad substitute for the dividend withholding tax applicable to dividend remittances by subsidiaries, will be designed to ensure that the benefit Australia obtains from foreign investment by way of tax revenue is not reduced because of the form in which operations are conhere. Other countries have branch profits by the taxes and the Asprey Committee recommended that one should be introduced in Austraha. Consideration of imposing a branch profits tax began the request from some time ago. The tax that the Government has in mind will be related to taxable income of non-resident as distinct from a tax based on remittances of branch profits. As branches, unlike subsidiaries, are taxed on dividend income, it is not intended to apply the branch profits tax to the part of taxable income referable to such income; nor is it envisaged that it will apply to other y income of non-residents taxed under special provisions of the income tax law, namely,filmroyalties, shipping profits, or insurance premiums. The tax, when introduced under legislation to be d brought forward in the autumn, will apply to income of the 1977-78 income year and subsequent years and, hke company tax, will be due for payment in the year following the year in which the income is derived.

(10) If so, and if the oil companies rationalise their selling outlets as they desire, will this end price cutting and thus place the motorist at the mercy of the oil companies. (11) Does the Government intend to re-introduce the Rural Price Equalisation Scheme or will this area be left to market forces. (12) Does his Department have information on how many of the recently closed petrol outlets sold less than 5,000 gallons a month and conformed to the Royal Commission on Petroleum's description of many previously closed outlets as pumps of convenience in yards, factories and business sites, where economics in terms of distribution costs, pump utilisation and maintenance became too unfavourable to De persisted in.

Mr Fife-The answers to the honourable member's question are as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) My attention has been drawn to an article in the Adelaide Advertiser of 27 July 1977 regarding Adelaide petrol sellers. The article canvasses made about the petroleum industry. (4) The Government does not intend to continue an ination of the oil industry the place of small retail outlets and dealer arrangements in the industry are being considered in the context Government's general monitoring of the effects of the Trade Practices Act. (5 ) The Government has given support to collective acquipression sition schemes by its recent amendments to the Trade tices Act which place these schemes in a more favourable position than formerly. In making these amendments, the Government acknowledged that the schemes may play an important role in protecting the position of small businesses such as those in the petroleum retail industry. (6) The Trade Practices Act provides remedies for individuals who suffer as a result of contraventions Act. Legal aid may also be available for those individuals.

The measures outlined in that statement, the establishtions. ment of the Oil Industry Marketing Consultative Committee, and the recent amendments to the Trade Practices Act, are major initiatives taken by the Government regarding the petroleum industry. Genetic Engineering: Institutes and Dr Klugman asked the Minister representingthe the Minister for Science, upon tember 1977: (1) What institutes and laboratories under the control the Commonwealth Government are carrying in genetic engineering. (2) What are the topics of research being carried out (3) What safeguards are employed in each of these institutes to prevent contaminauon by genetically altered some of the complaints material. (4) What mechanism does the Government have to ensure examthat it has complete knowledge of all of these projects. in particular but matters such as Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has of the provided the following answer to the honourable small business and of member's question: By way of introduction, it may be useful to state that ex'genetic engineering' is taken to refer to research Pracwith artificially recombined molecules of DNA, the molecules carrying the hereditary message in cells. The answers to the specific questions are as foUows: (1) Under my portfolio, the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry. (2) Three projects have been approved by the Australian of the Academy of Science Standing Committee on Recombinant DNA and are being carried out under the biological and physical containment procedures recommended by the Academy. (a) Construction of molecular vectors for plant ceUs. to monitor (b) Chromosomal mapping ofribosomalDNA sequences. Consultative (c) Function of chloroplast DNA. to (3) The CSIRO projects fall into categories of experiments that may be carried out in standard microbiological laboratories, subject to the adoption of specified safeguards. It so happens that each of the three experiments mentioned above a is subject to different safeguards, as recommended by the last Academy, and details can be provided if the honourable member so desires. The laboratories in the Division of Plant Industry where the experiments are carried out are supervised by personnel framed in sound microbiological practices, including correct use of general and specialised equipment inactivauon of biological material, and procedures for emergencies. (4) The main channel of advice is the Academy's Standing Committee mentioned above. The Academy took the initiative in establishing that Committee to exercise control of of enetic engineering experiments, when Australian scientists rst expressed interest in conducting them. It reviews proof posals For research and makes recommendations on appropriate procedures and safeguards according to guidelines prodeveloped by British and United States scientists in cooperauon with the governments of their countries. CSIRO, in conjunction with all universities and Commonwealth and on State research laboratories, has agreed to submit all proposed projects involving recombinant DNA molecules to the Standing Committee and to observe its recommendaThe Department of Health maintains close liaison with the Standing Committee and is currently reviewing this overaU mechanism of control of genetic engineering experimentation in co-operation with the Department of Science and CSIRO.

(2) I understand that the number of deaths, whilst in custody, of persons detained by the South African police in nection with alleged offences of a political nature since 1976 is of the order mentioned by the honourable member. Stevedoring Companies and Farm Machinery considered Manufacturers: Charges Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Business Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 6 October 1977: (1) What evidence is there that stevedoring companies and farm machinery manufacturers have reduced their charges or the cost of spare parts as recommended by the Prices Justification Tribunal. (2) Has one major farm machinery manufacturer replaced its reduced spare parts price schedule with another one at least as high as that criticised by the Tribunal. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Prices Justification Act requires companies which have been taken to inquiry by the Tribunal to notify the Tribunal within 14 days of receiving its report of the prices they are charging or propose to charge in the Ught of the Tribunal'sfindings.The stevedoring and farm machinery spare parts manufacturing companies covered by the Tribunal's inquiries notified the Tribunal that they had accepted its in regard to the charges and prices found to be justhe honourable tified by the Tribunal. (2) A number of the manufacturers of farm machinery spare parts subsequently notified the Prices Justification Tribunal of proposed increased prices.

Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) Please see my answer to question No. 1396. Navy and Army Work Boats: Tenders (Question Na 1730) Dr Richardson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 October 1977: Since the contract for fifteen Navy work boats and seven conArmy work boats, for which tenders were sought in any of early four materials, wood, steel,fibreglassor aluminium, has been won by North Queensland Engineers and Agents Pty Ltd for $4.7m. will he give fuU reasons why the tender was superior to a tender by a joint-venture from Western Australian Marine Services Association, at approximately $2.3m. (QuestionNo. 1701) Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable and member's question is as follows: A contract worth about $3.4m for these craft has been awarded to North Queensland Engineers and Agents for the supply of 22 work boats; the $4.7m quoted represents the total project cost ofintroducing these boats into service. In April 1976 Australian and New Zealandfirmsin tendering for the supply of work boats were invited to register interest covering three options, namely: to a naval design package commercial design unaltered shghtly modified commercial design and incorporating Navy suppUed engines. Tenders were clearly advised that proposals submitted on the basis of a commercial design would be evaluated against proposals received for the supply of craft to the Naval design in aluminium. Tenderers were also advised that direct price comparison, economy ofoperation and other cost effective factors would all be considered in making a selection. Following an exhaustive evaluation of all tenders received covering all options it was Queensland Engineers and Agents would provide the Navy and Army with craft which met all requirements and particularly would be the most suitable for operating in the arduous service environment. The approach adopted sought the widest possible response from tenderers and did exclude consideration of any design or construction material. Navy's past experience with small GRP (fibreglass) boats indicated that it is not the most suitable duous duties planned for the twelve metre craft. However, by not excludmg GRP from the tender schedule the possibility of Navy benefiting from technological development in the field was retained. None of the GRP designs offered had qualities which met the Navy requirements for hull construcuon. Dr Richardson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 October 1977: In accepting the untried British Brooke-Marine 42m vessel with an unknown speed capability, rather 45m German Luerssen Went vessel with a known capability of at least 30 knots for the fourteen new naval patrol be built in Australia, has the Government decided to adopt simpler fishing protection vessel, rather than a comprehenof sive Naval patrol boat. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable 1977-78. member's question is as follows: Following an exhaustive examination of all available options the Government commissioned a project definition study of two proven patrol would satisfy the Royal Australian Navy's coastal patrol and surveillance work.

If so, is it considered that an untried, adapted 42m version of a 37.5m vessel is a proven vessel. (2) If the tender documents did not ask for a proven vesmaterial for the arsel, what was the reason.

Pharmaceutical Benefits Prescriptions Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 12 October 1977: What action has been taken, or is proposed, to remove present anomaly whereby a person requiring a pharmaceutical benefit prescription must pay $2 for presents it to a private chemist an approved hospital outpatient dispensary.",74
174,Mr HUNT,CURRENT LIBRARY ESTABLISHMENT,"The answer to the honourable Government member's question is as follows: It is not within the power of the State governments to collect patient contributions for pharmaceuticals dispensed at recognised hospital outpatient partments. However, I have instructed my Department to undertake, in collaboration with State authorities, an exarnination volved in recognised hospital pharmacy dispensing, and to report to me. It is also relevant to note that in three States and the tralian Capital Territory, privately insured persons who attend a recognised hospital outpatient unit are charged outpatient fee. The Government will adopt an attitude of co-operation with the other State governments should they also wish to introduce outpatients charges for insured persons. Broken Mill Proprietary Co.
