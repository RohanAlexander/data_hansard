2,The SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"On Monday the Leader of the House raised a matter of privilege relating to reports that the member for Ryan had complained to police authorities that he had been subject to undue pressure and to intimidation ‘to resign from parliament'. The Leader of the House suggested that the alleged actions could constitute a contempt as an improper interference with the free performance by the member of his duties as a member. The Leader of the House presented copies of two newspaper articles to which he had referred. Yesterday the honourable member for Ryan informed the House of his support for the consideration of the issue as a matter of privilege and provided some detail of the actions that had been of concern to him. I have considered the comments by the Leader of the House and the member for Ryan and I have had regard to relevant precedents. House of Representatives Practice states that an attempt to influence a member in his or her conduct as a member by threats is a contempt, as is any conduct having a tendency to impair a member's independence in the future. To be an offence against the House, conduct has to be found to amount to, or to be intended or likely to amount to, an improper interference. Complaints of breach of privilege relating to matters arising within political parties have been raised in the House before, although no cases have been referred to the Committee of Privileges. In responding to these complaints former Speakers have noted, using precedents from the United Kingdom, that arrangements made within political parties were unlikely to give rise to matters of privilege or contempt. It has been noted that the raising of the complaint by a third party may not be a good foundation for action to be taken in this area. The view has been expressed, however, that if any member sought the protection of the House in such matters the House ought to seek the advice of the Committee of Privileges as to the proper course. Although no reference of such matters has been made by the House, the Senate Committee of Privileges has reported on a case involving party processes. In this case, involving Senator Tambling, who had been disendorsed by his party, the committee found that a penalty had been imposed on him on account of his vote on a certain matter and that, although the actions of the party were ‘reckless and ill judged', on balance, and in light of certain developments, a contempt could not be found. It is worth referring briefly to a case in New Zealand in 1993. In this case the High Court considered a matter involving the disendorsement of a member of parliament from the political party of which he had been a long standing member. The court noted there must be no question of discipline or coercion which could in some way influence the manner in which a member of parliament goes about his or her business. However, the judgment went on to note that this had nothing to do with choosing candidates to promote for election, and so did not involve matters of privilege. While the matters I have referred to are not directly comparable, they illustrate that questions relating to the operation of political parties can present particular issues in relation to privilege. There seems to be a recognised role for political parties in dealing with matters of internal discipline and the endorsement of candidates. Such actions may at times be quite robust without being improper. However, it is the case that action taken within a political party could potentially amount to an improper interference with the free performance by a member of his or her duties. The question of whether such action would be found to amount to a contempt would be dependent on the particular circumstances. The following points are relevant to my consideration of this matter: - intimidating a member with a view to influencing the behaviour of a member in relation to his or her duties is a very serious matter; - the member concerned in this case has supported the initial complaint and provided some detail; - the matters complained of are focused on activities within a political party are related to questions of the endorsement of a member as a candidate for a political party; and - the member has confirmed that he has referred his concerns to the police. The allegations raised are serious and go to the ability of a member to be able to perform his duties freely and without improper interference. The fact that they have occurred within the context of a political party does not make them immune from considerations of possible improper interference. These are areas in which the House does not have precedents of its own to guide it. This matter is distinguished from earlier cases in the House because the member concerned has spoken in support of the complaint and has provided details of his concerns that he has been subjected to intimidation. Whilst I note that the matter has been referred to the police, my role is to consider the matter in terms of parliamentary law and practice. Having regard to the material before me, I am willing to allow precedence to a motion. This complaint may allow the House to receive advice in an area in which it has not had the benefit of informed consideration.",17
3,Mr ALBANESE,PRIVILEGE,"I move: That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests: having regard to the matters raised in the House on 31 May by the Leader of the House and referred to in the House on 2 June by the Member for Ryan, whether the Member for Ryan has been subject to improper interference, or attempted improper interference, with the free performance of his duties as a Member, and, if so, whether a contempt has been committed. Mr Speaker, I move this motion in accordance with your granting of precedence for and it. It would not be appropriate for me to comment in great detail except to refer to the member for Ryan's statement to the parliament yesterday, which I think raised some grave matters-some matters are the business of this House; clearly other matters are the appropriate business of the Australian Federal Police. The fact that this is alleged to go to such senior levels, including the allegations about the President of the Liberal National Party in Queensland but also the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, I think should be of real concern to all members of the House. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. NA (AVIATION FUEL) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Albanese. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",18
4,Mr ALBANESE,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (9.09 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill seeks to establish in legislation an increase in the excise applying to aviation fuel. On 11 May 2010, the Treasurer, the Hon. Wayne Swan, announced as part of the federal budget that the excise on aviation fuel would increase by 0.702c per litre on and from 1 July 2010. This will see the excise on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene rise from 2.854c per litre to 3.556c per litre. The excise equivalent customs duty on comparable imported aviation fuel will be increased by the same amount. All the funds raised through this levy will go directly to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), Australia's aviation safety regulator. The legislation that I introduce today will bring the increase in excise into effect and, together with the Customs Tariff Amendment (Aviation Fuel) Bill 2010, will provide an extra $89.9 million over four years to fund critically important safety activities. The funds will be used to recruit almost 100 additional front-line safety staff including safety specialists, safety analysts and airworthiness inspectors. This will allow CASA to expand its surveillance activities and fulfil its increasingly complex regulatory responsibilities. This long-term funding will also ensure that CASA can continue random testing for alcohol and other drugs within the aviation industry; invest in the development and maintenance of safety standards; and provide expanded and ongoing training for its staff. Full details of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Aviation Fuel) Bill 2010 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Aviation Fuel) Bill 2010 are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend this bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Wood) adjourned. NA (AVIATION FUEL) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Albanese. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",18
5,Mr ALBANESE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (9.12 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Aviation Fuel) Bill 2010 is the second of the related bills, which gives effect to increased rates of duty for aviation fuel. This bill will increase the rates of excise equivalent customs duty for imported aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene, by 0.702c per litre, to 3.556c per litre. The increased rates of customs duty will apply to aviation fuel imported from all countries, including aviation fuel imported under any of Australia's free trade agreements. These increases are complementary to the amendments contained in the Excise Tariff Amendment (Aviation Fuel) Bill 2010 and will ensure that the rates of customs duty on imported aviation fuel are the same as the rates of excise duty on aviation fuel, when produced in Australia. The increased revenue from imported aviation fuel will contribute to an increase in funding for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority that will enable the authority to meet its core safety responsibilities. As with the amendments to the excise applying to aviation fuel, the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 will take effect from 1 July 2010. I commend this bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Wood) adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Reference",19
6,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (9.14 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: HMAS Penguin and Pittwater Annex Redevelopment, Mosman and Clareville, New South Wales. HMAS Penguin is the home of the Royal Australian Navy diving school, the Army dive wing, the recompression chamber facility and the Submarine and Underwater Medicine Unit. The proposed works will provide to the Navy upgraded operational and training facilities at HMAS Penguin and the Pittwater Annex to enable the Navy to meet its training commitments. The proposed works, estimated to cost $63.34 million plus GST, will include redevelopment of the waterfront site, civil works and the upgrade of base services infrastructure at HMAS Penguin, along with an internal refurbishment of the Pittwater Annex. Refurbishment of two historic waterfront buildings at HMAS Penguin will preserve them for future generations. Traffic management will be improved on Middle Head Road with proposed changes to the base entry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in early 2011 and is expected to be completed in 2013. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to.

NA AMENDMENT (CHILD CARE BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 June, on motion by Ms Kate Ellis: That this bill be now read a second time.",20
9,Ms LIVERMORE,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010 and to talk about the achievements of this Labor government in the area of child care, and early childhood development and education more broadly. They are achievements that we are very proud of, and they are built on an unprecedented level of investment by any federal government in child care and early childhood education. Overall, the Rudd government is providing more than $17.1 billion over the next four years for early childhood development and support for child care. Ensuring that children and their families have access to high-quality, affordable child care is a key part of the government's objective of building a stronger, fairer and more productive Australia. Access to affordable child care is important so that families can maximise their employment and training opportunities. And the national focus on early child development and education in all settings, including childcare centres, family day care, kindergartens and schools, is vital if our children are to get the start in life deserve and a chance to participate fully in the future success of Australia. So first to the bill, which makes some changes to the childcare rebate. The first thing to remember is the change, the great improvement that this government made to the affordability of child care for working families across Australia. The previous government gave families a childcare rebate equal to 30 per cent of their out-of-pocket childcare expenses. Families could claim that rebate up to an amount of $4,354 per year. In 2007 we promised, and introduced on coming to government, a substantial increase in the childcare rebate. Families using child care are now able to claim a childcare rebate of 50 per cent of their out-of-pocket childcare expenses and, consequently, we increased the maximum amount of rebate claimable for each child in care to $7,500 a year. That is a big jump in assistance to families for a vital service that can really put pressure on their budget. In fact the maximum limit is 72 per cent higher than it was under the Howard government. The Labor government also took steps early in its term to make the payment of the childcare rebate back to families more frequently than had been the case under the Howard government. In our first budget in 2008 we honoured our election commitment to increase the childcare rebate and also made it possible for families to receive the rebate payment quarterly rather than annually as it had been under the previous government. Of course we all remember the situation under Peter Costello when the rebate was first introduced by the Howard government and families were told that they would be waiting 18 months to receive their first payment back from the government. We acted quickly in government to address that and the rebate is now more generous and paid to they families when they need it every quarter. That is a big jump in the assistance the government gives to families to help them meet the costs of the child care that they rely on so much to make their family life and their family finances work. We understand the pressures that families are under and have acted to make child care more affordable for them through these measures: the increase in the childcare rebate and the move to pay the rebate quarterly. It was good to see those changes reflected in the most recent data on childcare availability and affordability. The report released on 22 April this year-the State of child care in Australia-showed that out-of-pocket costs to families have fallen across all income levels. For example, in 2004 families earning $55,000 spent 13 per cent of their disposable income on child care. This has fallen to seven per cent in 2009. This bill before the House implements a budget measure that will make a change to the childcare rebate affecting a small number of families. From 1 July 2010 the childcare rebate annual cap will be set at $7,500 per child per year. There is no change to that cap, but there is a change to the indexation arrangements. Indexation of the maximum rate of childcare rebate will not occur for four years and therefore the annual cap of $7,500 will continue unchanged until 30 June 2014. The change in this bill needs to be understood in the context of our overall approach to the budget this year. This measure to keep the childcare rebate annual cap at $7,500 for the next four years delivers $86.3 million in savings. At the time the government put in place the package of stimulus spending and projects to protect our economy from recession in 2009, we made a commitment to fiscal discipline and a budget framework to ensure a return to surplus when normal growth recovered. This budget required the government to stick to those rules we set for ourselves, and that meant finding savings to offset new spending measures. In this instance, the projected savings of $86 million from this measure will go towards some important new initiatives also announced in the budget. First of all, there is $59.4 million improve the quality of 142 budget-based funded early childhood services in rural and remote Australia. This funding will help those centres to improve infrastructure and staff qualifications and will benefit some of our most isolated and disadvantaged children. In addition we have announced $81.9 million to implement the new national quality standards. This includes the first national ratings system for child care and early education services so parents have the information they need to make those important decisions about the best care for their child. There is also $1.9 million to support new regulatory measures to help achieve ongoing stability in the childcare sector in the wake of the ABC Learning crisis. This includes developing measures that require large childcare providers in the market to prove their financial ability-something that no-one would argue against after we saw what happened with ABC Learning not so long ago. Since taking government we have taken steps to improve the affordability of child care through assistance to families. Now we also need to continue our work with the sector on standards and quality. These three budget initiatives progress that quality agenda. It is fair to ask what effect the change in this bill to hold the annual cap to $7,500 until 2014 will have on the affordability of child care. The vast majority of families receiving childcare rebate-an estimated 760,000 or around 97 per cent of familieswill not be impacted by this change in the year following its introduction. On average, families use only 26 hours of care per child per week. This measure will mostly impact on the small number of families who use care for much longer periods, such as 50 hours per week, or those who use more expensive child care. Those families who are affected by this change will on average have to a reduction in childcare benefit of an estimated $5 per week, or $266 per year. Compared to that very small proportion of families who will be minimally affected by this change all families are benefiting, and will continue to benefit, from the significant lift in the childcare rebate cap introduced by the government. As an example, a family earning $80,000 with one child in full-time care would have received a childcare rebate of $3,359 under the Howard government. Under this government that same family receives $5,598 in childcare rebate. They are better off by $2,239 under our more generous system. We came to government with substantial commitments to improve the affordability of child care and we have delivered on that commitment. Not long after coming into office we were also faced with a crisis of vivi- ability in the sector. The collapse of ABC Learning at the end of 2008 threatened the closure of hundreds of centres across Australia. There was a very real prospect of families losing access to care for their children and thousands of childcare workers losing their jobs and entitlements. The collapse of ABC Learning was very much the product of the company's unsustainable business model but it can also be attributed to the Howard government's hands-off, let the market rip approach to the childcare sector. The Howard government did not care that child care was effectively an essential service for the families that relied on their childcare centre. It did nothing to ensure the ongoing viability of the whole sector, preferring to leave it to the market and those who sought to exploit opportunities while the going was good. It was left to the Rudd government to clean up the mess when ABC Learning fell over. We worked with the receivers and provided funding to ensure that the doors of ABC Learning centres stayed open, giving families assurance that their children could continue to receive care. Had we not acted quickly, over 62,000 families would have had to find alternative care or potentially give up work. There was good news for many of those ABC Learning families and childcare workers this week with the formal transfer of 570 childcare centres from ABC Learning to GoodStart, the not-for-profit company set up by Mission Australia, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Benevolent Society and Social Ventures Australia. Three of the GoodStart centres are in my electorate, at Rockhampton, Walkerston and Gracemere. Parents and staff can now be confident that these centres are in safe hands and their future is assured with their new owners. I am particularly happy to know that Mary and her team at the Campbell Street centre in Rockhampton can rest easy and get on with the great job they do for the kids in their care. They look after my daughter one day each week and I know she loves the time she spends with them. I am sure that is the case for the children at all three of these centres. I am pleased that the government has been able to play such a positive role in steering this potentially disastrous collapse of ABC Learning to a conclusion that gives assurance to parents and strengthens the sector by creating a better balance between private and not-for-profit providers. The recent report about the state of child care in Australia shows that, two years into office, child care is more accessible and affordable under this government. The other aspect of child care that is just as important, and which this Labor government has really put on the agenda, is quality. Quality in child care-whether that is achieved through better staff to child ratios, improved staff qualifications or the early years learning framework-is part of our drive for improved developmental and educational outcomes for children. Despite all the evidence that tells us how important the first five years of a child's life are in their overall development, for many years the federal government has not been seriously involved in policy or funding in this crucial area. This neglect was showing up in all kinds of indicators telling us that young children in Australia were being shortchanged-that not enough attention was being given to their needs and there was not enough investment in quality child care and educational opportunities for children under five. Too many children were starting school, and are still starting school, without having a chance to participate in activities that promote their development and get them ready to learn. We want to turn that around and the government has put massive funding towards improving the opportunities for children and in turn their educational and developmental outcomes. Our total investment in early childhood education and child care will be $17 billion over the next four years. One of our priorities has been to work with the states and territories to achieve universal access to early childhood education. Our commitment is that by 2013 every child will be able to access a quality early childhood education program in the year before they begin formal schooling. This will be a play based learning and development program for 15 hours a week, taught by fouryear university qualified early childhood teachers. It will be available across a range of settings, including childcare centres and family day care so that it fits in with parents' arrangements. I am pleased to say that the Queensland government has already responded by promising to build over 200 new kindergartens across the state because we have a lot of catching up to do in this area of early childhood education. For too long the federal government has had a ‘don't ask, don't tell' attitude to early childhood education and development. The previous government did not see it as their responsibility at all. They were content to just take pot shots at the states whenever it suited them to blame the states for any perceived shortcomings. It was never anything to do with the federal government, of course. We have a different approach. We want to know exactly what is going on with our children-the good and the bad-so that we know where extra support and investment is needed. We are doing that through the Australian Early Development Index, which asks teachers to answer a series of questions about the children in their class in their first year school. The data that is compiled is broken down region by region and will help communities to better understand how their children are doing by the time they start formal schooling. The data shows that there is a lot of work to do in my electorate to bridge the gap that exists in children's experience of preschool education. While children in Central Queensland scored around the average for things like their well-being and readiness to be at school, the measures that rely on some formal educational experience showed the lack of access to preschool education for many children in the area. I welcomed the announcement by the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth a few weeks ago that the government is going to fund local champions in the places where the Australian Early Development Index data indicated a higher than average number of children were developmentally vulnerable. I believe that there are certainly places in my electorate where that is the case and I will be urging the minister to allocate a number of those local champions to communities in Central Queensland. The local champions program will support nominated people or organisations with local experience and expertise to work with communities to make the best use of their AEDI results and ensure that children in those places can start school as happy and confident learners. The need is certainly there in Central Queensland for this extra assistance. That has already been identified by the federal government through its investment in the HIPPY program in Mount Morgan. HIPPY stands for Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters. It is a home based program that provides home tutors, books and other educational resources to help parents prepare their child for school. By helping parents to improve their child's readiness of for school, the program offers preschool students a better start in life. The program only started in Mount Morgan this year. It is great to know that parents are being given this support to get actively involved in their child's education. The town of Mount Morgan has had many setbacks over the years and that can lead to a sense of disadvantage and loss of motivation, but these kids should not have to carry that burden. Instead, this kind of program, with the right support from parents, can have kids starting school and being ready to make the most of their educational opportunities. These investments in child care and early childhood education and development are necessary and urgent if we are to achieve our goals of a fair and prosperous country. They increase the value of investments in other parts of our education and training system, because we know that every dollar spent on a child before the age of five has a cascading effect throughout the rest of their education and beyond. I am proud to be part of a government that places such value on children through these measures. We also realise that valuing children means supporting their parents. Our time in government has seen child care become more affordable and accessible and we will continue to support families by giving them the assurances they need about quality and the means to make reliable decisions about the best child care for their chilfederal dren. The changes proposed in this bill will create funding to go towards those measures and it has my support.",20
10,Mr NEUMANN,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010 is extremely important legislation. It is a timely reminder of the Rudd government's commitment to child care and to working families across Australia, particularly in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland. We have many fine childcare centres in my electorate-wonderful community centres such as Cribb Street Child Care Centre at Sadliers Crossing, which has been there for a long time; the childcare centre in inner-city Ipswich, which I know is struggling for numbers because of the demographic changes in the area; and the One Mile Community Child Care Centre in Leichhardt, which is staffed by very strong communitarian people and is devoted to the children in that community. There are for-profit childcare centres such as Bush Kidz. Why do I mention Bush Kidz, which runs the childcare centre at Brassall? Because Bush Kidz took over the ABC Learning centre at Brassall in the electorate of Blair. Brassall is the largest suburb in Ipswich in the electorate of Blair and, as a result of the debacle of the ABC Learning collapse under the watch of the previous government and the let-the-market-rip attitude that was permitted, ABC Learning centres across Ipswich were in dire need of support and assistance. Hundreds of young people were in a position where child care was at risk, which meant pressure on families across Ipswich. The reality is that the coalition government took little opportunity to provide for child care for working families. The truth is that, when it comes to child care, they saw no responsibility on the part of the government. Their attitude was: ‘It's not our responsibility. We should take no action. We should let the market operate.' That allowed one particular company to develop into an oligopolistic position in the market. When that company fell into receivership and liquidation then the consequences to about 62,000 families across the country was dire, including in the electorate of Blair-in Ipswich and the rural areas outside. The truth is that the coalition has never been a friend of the childcare sector. The truth is that the coalition harks back to some sort of 1950s mythical, nostalgic moment when women had no choice-or by economic necessity did not have to work. It was a sort of ‘leave it to Beaver' attitude that infests and operates on those opposite. The truth is that, because of the economic circumstances of families across my electorate and across the country and by reason of women wanting to fulfil their potential in life, women actually engage in the workforce. Those opposite, for nearly 12 years, let this sector down. That is the truth. In 2006 Australia was one of the worse ranking countries in terms of public expenditure on early childhood education-13th out of 14 in the OECD. The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Curtin, the then education minister, had this to say. She admitted it was: … unacceptable in a country with Australia's relatively small population to have a fractured and inconsistent system that can change dramaticomes cally between States. What a disgrace, what a failure, what a fiasco. The attitude of the coalition when it came to child care was: do nothing, say nothing, let it go, and blame others-claim child care was the responsibility of the states and territories and claim there was no national responsibility. We know adequate, accessible, affordable child care does not just benefit families, particularly those with young children, but it helps business. It is good for business. It is particularly good for small business and the nearly four million people who work in 2.4 million small businesses across the country. The coalition do not get it when it comes to child care. They claim they support small business, but if they did they would support child care and would have done so for nearly 12 years. Instead, they did very little indeed. I heard the member for Murray talking about this matter yesterday. It was 30 minutes of hyperbole, hysteria and hypocrisy on this topic. This is the mob that refused to bring in paid parental leave. Their current leader said in 2002 it would be brought in over his dead body. They have this mythical, fictional policy at the moment that they are never sure when they can do it. At some stage in the dim, distant future they might do it. That is their policy. I have read it. read the transcripts of what their leader has said and their spokesperson, the member for Murray, has said. It is esoteric, it is obtuse, and it is vague-it is just nonsense. No-one could possibly believe they would ever be committed to this stuff. They certainly never in 12 years brought in paid parental leave in this country-not understanding how important the link was with child care; not understanding at all. That is the legacy of the coalition government. They thought perhaps when it to child care a nanny might do, a babysitter might do. That is their attitudewithout realising how important education is to the development of a child. We were spending one-fifth of what our OECD partners were on early childhood education. That is the legacy of the coalition government. That is why we have invested massively when it comes to early childhood education. Giving a young person a chance in life in those very young developmental years is so crucial to educational attainment in primary school, high school and tertiary education. They did not understand that. It is not just about equality of opportunity; they also did not get the link with business, and they claim they are the party that supports business. They did not understand that as well. That is the legacy of those opposite. The new reports which the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth, who I see is at the table, welcomed on 22 April this year, the Child care vacancies quarterly snapshot and the State of child care in Australia, demonstrate that we are making progress. We are catching up after the failures of the coalition government. We are dealing with the apathy and the inaction of those opposite. We are seeing more affordable, accessible, stable and high-quality child care in the Australian community. It is good I have for business and good for families. The State of child care in Australia report makes it very clear. It undertook a statistical analysis of the Australian childcare market over the past five years. We have been in power for 2½ of those years, so it is a snapshot of us and them. What did it find? Amongst other things, out-of-pocket costs for families have fallen across all income levels. In 2004, families earning $55,000 a year-the average Australian would probably think that is a middle-class familyspent 13 per cent of its disposable income on child care. That had fallen to seven per cent by 2009. That is pretty clear: it fell by nearly half. So we are making progress. It is painstaking, but we are making progress. The report found that the Australian government's funding for child care more than doubled in the past four years, up from $1.7 billion in 2004-05 to $3.7 billion in 2008-09. That is clear, independent analysis of the achievements of the Rudd Labor government. It is not from a body or report of an internal Labor Party mechanism or organisation; it is independent analysis of the childcare sector and of the government's commitment and the previous government's lack of commitment when it comes to child care. We committed $114.5 million to deliver 38 early learning centres and care centres in the 2008-09 year, and we have provided that in my electorate. We have fulfilled our commitment. Recently the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth was in my electorate and we opened the Early Learning and Care Centre at Yamanto. I am pleased to say that that is the fulfilment of a commitment that we made at the last election. We invested $1.6 million in this new facility. It is a great facility. The minister and I were there, reading about the Billy Goats Gruff and all kinds of things and entertaining the children. I am not sure whether they were entertained more by me than by the stories. One little boy, Sam, had the good sense to be a Broncos supporter and was wearing a Broncos outfit. The Brisbane Broncos are a great team. Sam was there and said hello to us as we both walked in. It was great to see the delight on the children's faces. That is part of a new education precinct at Yamanto. We fulfilled our election commitments to the people on the south side of Ipswich-around Yamanto, Amberley, Walloon and Flinders View-when we said we would transfer Amberley District State School over to the Yamanto and Amberley District site. We said that it was up to the state government to determine the actual location. We paid nearly $28 million to the Queensland government while undertaking the expansion of the RAAF base at Amberley and for the relocation of Amberley State School to that site. We also said that we would provide sufficient money to relocate the C&K located at Amberley, and we have done that. In addition to that, Amberley District State School got BER funding. We are talking about an education precinct there at YamantoAmberley District State School-which received well above $30 million of federal government money to be built, and it is a wonderful facility. Numbers in the school have gone up from the low-300s to nearly 500. That is an indication that people are prepared to support the new school. There has been a very small reduction in the number of students just up the road at Churchill State School-only 12. There has been no loss of teachers there. So the alarmism and the criticism of my predecessor and some in the LNP in Queensland have not proved to be accurate. The Early Learning and Care Centre at Yamanto is simply a fantastic facility. It cares well for babies and toddlers and will help them progress all the way to primary school by just going next door in the same precinct. I congratulate the C&K Amberley family. They have been passionate about their support of child care in their area. With their advocacy and the listening ear of the Rudd Labor government, they have facilitated a wonderful community resource which has been highly prized and valued by local families and, of course, their children. I am very confident that that facility at Amberley District State School will continue to educate our young people very well in the Ipswich community. Government is about making some hard decisions. I know that this legislation before the House sets a cap on the amount of the childcare rebate-an annual maximum cap of $7,000 to $7,500 per child per year. But this government fulfilled its commitment by increasing the CCR from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. The member for Capricornia accurately stated what that increase means to families across the country-thousands of dollars per year on average. This budgetary measure saves $86.3 million across the forward estimates. This government is committed to economic discipline and responsibility. Those opposite talk about that stuff, but we have seen nothing except gutting Roads to Recovery Program funding, gutting computers in schools, getting rid of trade training centres and getting rid of the National Broadband Network, and there are so many more things that they would do if they sat opposite. We are about making sure that we bring the budget back into surplus. We have a good and steady record with respect to child care. It stands in direct contrast of those opposite, who should hang their heads in shame for their apathy, inaction and procrastination in this area for so many years.",25
11,Ms KATE ELLIS,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Adelaide-Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport) (9.51 am)-in reply-I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the speakers who have contributed to this debate. I particularly acknowledge the previous speaker, the member for Blair, who I did have the good fortune to visit and to open the new childcare centre at Yamanto which was the honouring of an election commitment and see first hand that the member for Blair does the finest ‘troll under the bridge' voice of the Billy Goats Gruff. He amused the children out there whilst also delivering on a very important election commitment. I would like to thank all of the previous speakers. We know that the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010 is in line with our commitment to deliver a responsible budget that secures our economic future and brings the budget back into surplus three years early and within three years. It is also, though, the result of our ambitious agenda for early childhood education and child care. As part of this, we have made the decision to keep the childcare rebate cap at the same level we committed to at the previous election: some $7,500 a year. I think it is really important to note that, in line with our election commitment, we have also lifted the maximum that families can claim under the childcare rebate from $4,354 under the previous government to $7,500 per child per year under the Rudd government. Given that this is a substantial increase of some $3,146 a year, or a 72 per cent increase over and above the previous government's cap, I am very pleased to see that the opposition has indicated that they to that will support this measure. In relation to affordability, we have also delivered on our election commitment to increase the childcare rebate from 30 to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket expenses. We know that last some 670,00 Australian families benefited from our significant reforms, which enabled them to claim back half of their out-of-pocket childcare costs where they spent up to $15,000 a year for each child in care. We have also delivered upon our commitment to change the payment of the childcare rebate from an annual payment under the previous government to quarterly payments under our government, giving parents assistance closer to the time when they incur their childcare costs. In total, we are proud that our government will provide $14.4 billion over four years in financial support to parents with the cost of their child care and to help them manage the family budget. This is some $8 billion more than the Howard government provided in childcare fee assistance in their last years, which you may not have picked up on from the shadow minister's contribution to this debate. Understandably, they are not trying to highlight the fact that we have more than doubled our commitment to helping parents with the affordability of their child care. We on this side have shown time and time again that we are committed to affordable and high-quality child care and that we are putting our money where our mouth is when it comes to delivering this. It is also really important to note that the majority of Australian families using child care-some 760,000 families-will not be impacted by this change. This is because the average claim for the childcare rebate is less than $2,000 per year per child which is obviously a long way off the $7,500 cap. Our government has a strong commitment to early childhood education and child care with a record investment of $17.1 billion over the next four years, some $10 billion more than that provided in the last four years of the Howard government. We are proud of this record; we will continue to get on with the job of working to deliver affordable, quality and stable child care. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",28

VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2010 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Griffin: That this bill be now read a second time.",29
13,Mrs MARKUS,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to place on the record the coalition's views about the measures announced by the Rudd Labor government in this year's federal budget. Beyond being a budget built on a house of cards, this budget has not met tests for all of Labor's pre-election promises. Before addressing the key provisions of this bill, which the coalition will not oppose, I would like to talk about some of the areas where the veteran community is still waiting for answers and action. Labor's budget does not deliver on commitments made to deal with the cost of pharmaceuticals for war caused disabilities. Page 12 of Labor's plan for Veterans' Affairs from the last election reads: Labor commits to reviewing this matter in the first term of Government and to establishing, in consultation with the ex-service community, a fair solution that relieves the burden on veterans of the cost of medications to treat their war caused disabilities. So far Labor has released a discussion paper following a $500,000 in-house review, a review which took 30 months to materialise, but there is no detail to the two options in the paper. Both options potentially exclude some ex-service personnel who are severely injured but who do not have qualifying service. More will be said between now and the election on this issue. I will continue to consult with the ex-service community on this important issue, an area where Labor has dropped the ball and will not meet its full commitment ahead of the election. Also outstanding is Labor's delayed review of advocacy funding for ex-service organisations due for release in the first quarter of this year. The largely volunindeed teer ex-service community does not know the fate of the key review into funding for their organisations. Many ESOs have been anxious about the findings. This year's funding round, including a delayed application date, has created considerable angst among the veteran community. Early analysis shows that Victoria's veteran and ex-service community value-adds almost $23 million in volunteer hours to the repatriation system throughout the network of veterans' advocates and welfare and pensions officers. This cannot be overlooked. I call on the minister to immediately release the findings of the ESO funding review to enable the ex-service community and the coalition an opportunity to chart the best course forward in the area of advocacy funding. The minister cannot criticise the former government for keeping reports hidden when he does the same thing. Yesterday in another debate the minister criticised the former coation lition government for not releasing a report into military superannuation when it was received by the then minister. The Podger review arrived on the former minister's desk in July 2007. The election was held in November of that same year and the government changed. The new government released the Podger review on Christmas Eve, 24 December 2007. For no more than six months was the report held from public view. Yet this minister forgets that until only recently he sat on the re-review of the Clarke review for 15 months and continues to sit on the findings of the review of advocacy funding. There is a re-review of the re-review of the Clarke review into the BCOF veterans' service, with no timetable for delivery. The Rudd Labor government took some 11 months to respond to the parliamentary inquiry into the F111 reseal-deseal issue. It is odd that the minister criticises actions that he condones through his own behaviour. Also ongoing is the review of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. A couple of weeks ago at the RSL state congress the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel, in a particularly partisan attack, criticised the coalition for not supporting this review. This is not correct. Since becoming shadow minister in September 2008, I have supported this review. It is an important review into a key piece of legislation introduced by the previous coalition government. This review is critical to ensuring the act continues to meet the needs of the people it is designed to assist, veterans and their families. However, our support for the review is reliant on the minister being upfront about the timeline for the review. I was happy to support the review carrying on beyond the 31 March 2010 deadline. Nevertheless, the ex-service community and the coalition hope to have some indicafrom the minister or the government that this review will be concluded either before or after the election. Veterans' affairs legislation has been a largely bipartisan area of policy in this country for nearly 100 years. I hope that the minister and the government will not use this review to partisan politics in the lead-up to the election. The review needs to be on the table for both sides of politics and indeed the ex-service community to scrutinise ahead of an election. This legislation enacts five measures by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Defence Personnel in the budget. The measures relate to the government's long-awaited re-review of the Clarke review of veterans' entitlements commissioned by the previous coalition government. The re-review, focusing on 45 unimplemented recommendations of the report, will accept only an additional four recommendations, with three being re-reviewed for a second time. Schedule 1 of this bill creates a new classification of service in the Veterans' Entitleing. ments Act 1986. The new classification, to be known as British nuclear test defence service, will provide additional benefits to mer Defence personnel associated with the British nuclear testing in Western Australia and South Australia during the 1950s and 1960s. The new classification will provide eligible ex-service personnel with access to disability pensions and their spouse access to a war widow or widowers pension and, in some cases, access to the repatriation health card for all conditions-the gold card. Approximately 2,300 ex-service personnel will benefit from this new classification, at a cost of $24 million over the forward estimates. Earlier this year, I met with some individuals who were involved in the nuclear testing here in Australia. Their stories were truly shocking. Moreover, the impact of this testing on their lives and that of their families is something that many would find hard to believe. I heard stories of personnel enter1978 ing the fallout zone within hours of the detonation taking place. I heard of Navy divers scouring the floor of the ocean off Western Australia in similar circumstances. Quite often, personnel working in the dry and dusty Outback had little protective equipment or clothing to protect them from the effects of the radiation on their bodies. The previous coalition government undertook in the wake of the recommendations of the Clarke review to conduct a cancer and mortality study. In spite of the recommendations of this study, which continue to be disputed by veterans, their families and some experts in this area, the previous government introduced the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Testing Treatment Bill 2006. The bill provided a repatriation health card for specific conditions and the white card for all cancer treatments for all former military personnel and civilians involved in the testThe card was provided without the need for a person involved in the testing to prove that their cancer was caused by their service. for- More than 9,000 people benefited from this scheme. This new schedule extends further entitlements to former Defence personnel in line with a recommendation of the Clarke review. Although I am disappointed that it has taken until the 11th hour of the life of this parliament for the government to deliver on its commitment, I know that it will be welcome by the ex-service personnel involved in nuclear testing and their families. Importantly, the legislation enacted by the previous coalition government will still enable civilians involved in the testing to access cancer treatment at no cost to them. Schedule 2 of the bill will alter the classification of submarine special operations at operational and qualifying service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Between and 1992, Australian submariners participated in special operations. Little is known of the specifics of these missions. Their covert nature means that the specifics cannot be discussed. Nevertheless, these submariners were potentially placed in dangerous conditions. As a result, the government has decided to reclassify their service and provide additional entitlements to the veterans involved and their families. Under the change, up to 890 personnel will benefit from access to the service pension, disability pensions, war widower pensions and the gold card once they reach 70 years of age. With ‘qualifying' and ‘operational' service, these individuals will be tled to veteran status under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I recently spoke to the President of the Naval Association of Australia, Les Dwyer. Les, I may say, is a great bloke. He warmly welcomes the extension of entitlements to the men who served in these missions. Les has written a very detailed article for the next issue of the White Ensign magazine in which he welcomes the government's announcement. At this point I would like to remind the House of a motion moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Fairfax and the Chief Opposition Whip, in February last year, which called on the reclassification of this service. Alex Somlyay's commitment to the reclassification of special operations service was widely welcomed in the veteran community. Together with a former minister for defence, Dr Brendan Nelson, a former minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Maranoa, Bruce Scott MP, and a former parliamentary secretary for defence, the member for Herbert, Peter Lindsay MP, the coalition moved and supported the call to reclassify this service. I am pleased with this amendment, and I pay tribute to my colleagues who pursued this issue in the parliament. The third schedule in this bill deals with service at Ubon in north-east Thailand between 31 May 1962 and 27 July 1962 inclusive. This change is brought about by a ‘nature of service' review by the Department of Defence, which considers that there is sufficient new evidence to upgrade the status of service at Ubon at the beginning of the RAAF deployment there in 1962. The history of Australia's involvement in the stability of South-East Asia during the 1950s and 1960s is perhaps not well understood by many Australians. Following the involvement of Australian defence personnel in the Malayan Emergency, and the Indoneentisian Confrontation, RAAF personnel were deployed to the Ubon region of north-east Thailand to protect the territorial integrity of Thailand. Ubon, located close to the Thai-Laotian border, was seen as a strategically important location in the protection of Thailand and other South-East Asian nations from the threat of communism. At the time, the domino theory-of communism sweeping southwards through Asia, one country at a time-prompted the Australian government to be involved in the protection of stable democracies and governments throughout the region. This deployment was sanctioned by the South East Asian Treaty Organisation, SEATO. In May 1962, the Australian government authorised the deployment of 79 Squadron to the Ubon region. According to a recollection by retired Air Vic Marshall Ray Trebilco, at Ubon: There was a 5,000 foot strip, a small American radar unit called Lion which was training the Royal Thai Air Force personnel, a non-directional beacon, jet fuel facilities and a control tower of sorts, but that was all. He goes on: We understood that the governor of the province and some of the local dignitaries would be flying in from Korat together with the Australian Ambassador and the press to meet our Sabres on arrival. We were also told there would be little crowd control at the air field and that … interested locals and even cattle could all present problems in having a clear runway to land on. The modest nature of the facilities during the early deployment could have put personnel deployed there at risk. The explanatory memorandum states: Service in Ubon … is to be re-classified as ‘qualifying service' due to the potential risk from the activities of hostile forces and dissident elements. Activities at Ubon continued until 1970. From 1965, personnel at Ubon had their service classified as ‘warlike' given the increased activity in the area due to the Vietnam War. However, service between 28 July 1962 and 1965 will continue to be considered ‘operational service' under the VE Act. Principally, personnel who worked at Ubon during the period specified by this amendment will have access to a service pension and, when they turn 70 years of age, the gold card, over and above what they can already access by way of disability pensions and the war widow/widower pension for their spouse upon death resulting from their war-caused disability. Schedule 4 of the bill corrects an anomaly in the VE Act regarding domiciled status for 18to 21-year-old Commonwealth or allied veterans with eligible service under the VE Act. Under the VE Act, British Commonwealth and allied veterans may be eligible for pensions and other benefits if they have eligible service with a Commonwealth or allied defence force and if they had Australian domicile immediately prior to their enlistment in that defence force. This policy was intended to cover those Australians who were travelling or studying overseas at the time World War II broke out and who could not return to Australia to enlist in the Australian Defence Force. In the absence of the legal concept of Australian citizenship until 1949, the domicile concept was adopted as a means of determining whether a British, Commonwealth or allied veteran could be regarded as an Australian at the time of enlistment. However, persons under 21 at the time of their enlistment in a Commonwealth or allied defence force could not establish a domicile of choice, as the common law rules that applied at that time meant that a person could not assume a domicile of choice before the age of 21. The Domicile Act 1982 has since lowered the age at which a person can claim independent domicile from 21 to 18 years of age. However this act does not apply to circumstances that occurred before the commencement of the act, and thus the common-law rules continue to apply in those circumstances. This amendment, a recommendation of the Clarke review, which was not implemented in 2004, will enable those veterans who were between 18 and 20 and unable to nominate Australia as their domicile of choice to gain eligibility under the VE Act for their service as Australian veterans providing they meet the other domicile and service eligibility requirements. The final schedule of the act relates to a loophole affecting war widows and widowers. This provision will close a loophole in the act which enables a war widower or widow living in a de facto relationship to claim a war widows or widowers pension after they enter the relationship. This is not consistent with the law relating to married or re-married war widow or widowers, who cannot claim the pension after marrying or re-marrying. I have a particular interest in this measure. As the daughter and grand-daughter of war widows, I am determined to ensure future war widows and widowers do not come up against the same challenges that my mother, in particular, did. It took my mother more than 30 years to access a war widows pension, because her first application was refused and it took an advocate, 30 years later, to convince my mother that she was indeed eligible for a war widows pension and to reapply. People do not live neat, tidy lives. This measure, which is prospective and will not affect, we are told, any war widow or widowers living in a marriage-like relationship who claim their pension before 30 September 2010, risks disenfranchising future war widows or widowers. At a time of grief and bereavement, the last thing anyone wants to be doing is filling in a form. Some widows may not be aware that they are indeed entitled to such a pension. Equally, people's circumstances change; they may enter more difficult times or unwittingly ship, denying themselves access to a pension in future years. I am concerned about this measure. Whilst I understand it closes a loophole in the existing legislation, I am concerned about the impact this will have on future war widows and widowers. I again make the point that people's lives do not necessarily reflect an ideal, or perfect, image. Community standards have changed. Of course, in 2001, the previous coalition government widened an earlier change to the legislation regarding war widows and widowers. Under the 2001 changes, war widows or widowers who remarried after claiming their war widow or widower pension and who lost their pension upon remarriage had their pension reinstated. However, this only applied to those widows or widowers who lost their pension after remarrying; it did not extend to people who had not claimed their pension before remarriage. My office has been contacted by one woman from Queensland who is in this situation. This individual remarried after the death of her veteran husband because of an economic need and the cultural and social norms of the time. She was not aware that the war widow pension existed-let alone that she was entitled to access it. When she discovered, after the death of her second husband, that she might be eligible for a pension, she was denied it because she had not applied for the pension before she remarried. What we need to aim for, ideally, is to ensure that war widows and widowers in the generations ahead are not in any way disadvantaged because they did not fill out a form upon the death of their veteran spouse. In conclusion, the coalition will not oppose the measures in this bill. While I do have concerns about the provisions of schedule 5, the other four measures of this bill are of benefit to the affected individuals and enter a relationtheir families.",29
14,Mr HAYES,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to lend my support to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010, which will go some way to improving the well-being of Australia's veterans and the wider ex-services community. It was only last week that I, together with many, rose in this place to speak on another bill that was introduced. This one actually made minor technical amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Nevertheless, they were amendments that were designed to further align the veterans law with social security law and were another step in making improvements to conditions for our ex-service personnel, our veterans. During my contribution I spoke about what the veterans community can expect under this government and how our efforts will address a range of veterans issues, particularly around entitlements, services, well-being and recognition. This bill is another step in building better services for the Australian veterans community. I have on many occasions had the opportunity to acknowledge the veterans community organisations that operate tirelessly in my area, the south-west of Sydney, such as the Macarthur veterans recreational centre, the Vietnam Veterans Association, the Ingleburn, Campbelltown and Liverpool RSL clubs and the Cabra-Vale Diggers. I should mention Mr Ron Brown of the National Servicemen's Association. Last time. I mentioned him, a number of members of the opposition approached me to tell me how active he was in organisations in their electorates pursuing the very just causes of national servicemen. Their hard work and devotion to improving the well-being of Australian veterans and the wider ex-services community particularly impresses me. On behalf of a very grateful community, I give thanks for their efforts. I know much of their effort goes unrecognised, but, without that assistance, the veterwelcoming as community would not have the voice that it has today. Despite all the well-meaning commitment of others to their cause, we need those veterans associations to ensure that veterans have a proper and unfettered voice in determining their needs. I have also had the opportunity on a couple of occasions to take Minister Alan Griffin out to my electorate. As I said, we have a very active veterans community there. Formerly, the Ingleburn Army Camp was plumb in the middle of my electorate, and a lot of people, after they demobbed from the service, stayed in the area. It is easy to stand why Werriwa is home to a lot of ex-servicemen. The minister has been very good with his time, coming out and addressing those issues with the local veterans community. I think he has a very clear understanding of the issues of the veterans community, certainly as it applies to my region, and I genuinely thank him for spending time with our local veterans. Veterans can be assured that, under this government, their interests will always be a priority. One of the things the previous speaker, my colleague from Greenway, had to leave out of her contribution to the House, for obvious reasons, was that in their 11 years they were very slow to act on improvements for veterans. I do welcome a degree of bipartisanship when it comes to these bills, however, to improve clearly and decisively the conditions of veterans across in the nation. I am confident that working more closely with our ex-services community will allow us to be more responsive to the needs of veterans and be prepared to meet the future challenges of our ex-services personnel and, importantly, their families. The introduction of this bill I think is an example of that. Only this week I had the opportunity of to Parliament House Greg Brassil and Ian Fulton from the local army cadets operating in my region. They spent time with the office of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, Mike Kelly, because of some concerns they had. They also spent some time talking with the Deputy Prime Minister. I should indicate what these people are doing in an area of great need. They have a base operating in Rosemeadow in south-west Sydney. You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that was the location of considerable social upheaval last year with riots in the 3M estate. The area very clearly is social under- disadvantaged and many of the families within that community do not have positive role models. What these two gentlemen have done is set up an army cadet base where they are actively providing very positive role models for younger people in the community. I know the juvenile justice services are working very closely with them now by referring young people to the army cadets. On a very positive note, over the last five years this one unit in the south-west of Sydney has been getting between 10 and 12 recruits into the ADF per year. Young people have decided to stay with the army cadets, finish high school and then apply to our military forces as a consequence. So I am certainly unashamed in introducing both these gentlemen to Colonel Mike Kelly's office and to the Deputy Prime Minister and in telling people what they do. They are without doubt doing a very good job in the community. But what I see them doing through their local cadet unit, in assisting recruitment of personnel into the ADF, I think is extraordinary. This bill will give effect to a number of veterans' affairs budget measures that I would like to take just a little time to go through. First, the bill will create a new cateting gory of service of eligibility under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, to be known as defence service. It will importantly provide participants of that program in Australia with access to compensation and healthcare benefits for conditions accepted as related to the British nuclear test service. Currently, former personnel who participated in the British nuclear tests program have access to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 for any related period of their service. However, the Clarke review, in 2003, recommended-but it was not acted upon-that these people be considered for acceptance into the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. It was recommended that participation by defence personnel in the British nuclear test program in Australia be deemed non-warlike hazardous service and, therefore, the legislation be amended to ensure that the declaration can have effect in extending Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage. While the recommendation was not acted upon by the Howard government, I do appreciate that on this occasion it is now being supported by members in opposition. When this comes into law, it will have an effect for 2,700 mer defence personnel, which is quite significant. The second element of the bill is the reclassification of certain submarine operations between 1978 and 1992 as operationally and qualifying service. At present, this service is classified as peacetime service. In the 2003 review of veterans' entitlements, conducted by Justice John Clarke, it was recommended that service on submarine special operations during this time be classified as non-warlike hazardous under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. As I understand it, over this period our submarines were equipped with special intelligence-gathering equipment and were deployed in covert operations. It was only fitin that instance to accept the recommendation of Justice John Clarke that this be regarded as non-warlike, but nevertheless hazardous, for persons qualifying under the Veterans' Entitlements ct. In 2009, Defence recommended that service on these operations and deployment on those submarines did meet the criteria for allotment of duty, the qualifying service requirement that applied at the time of those operations. Consequently, this measure will provide relevant members of the Australian Defence Force with qualifying service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, which will provide a service pension at age 60 and, importantly, an automatic gold card at age 70. I understand that, whilst this is long overdue, it is nevertheless very welcomed by the ADF and will affect 890 members as a consequence. The third measure in this bill I wish to discuss relates to RAAF service in Ubon, Thailand as qualifying service for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. After a review was undertaken by Defence, it was determined that the initial deployment between 31 May 1962 and 27 July 1962 mirrored the readiness of the RAAF presence in for- Ubon between June 1965 and August 1968. By the way, that later service is already deemed to qualify for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. This bill seeks to recognise that those RAAF air crews and ground crews, from which there were some 60 members on base in Ubon, were exposed to the potential risk of hostile activities and that as a consequence they should be treated as falling within the definitions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. It is the right thing to do. It recognises that the outbreak of fighting against the Pathet Lao forces along the Thai border with Laos and Cambodia was considered-and is still considered, when the history is looked at-a very real and imminent possibility which would have impacted on our forces. As a consequence, the period between May 1962 and July 1962 will be treated in the same way as the later occasion in 1968 in that the earlier of the two periods of service will qualify and be recognised under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Another measure in the bill will lower the age of domicile of choice from 21 to 18 for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I know a small number of British, Commonwealth and allied forces veterans have not been able to access the compensatory benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act because they were between the ages of 18 and 21 when they enrolled in the forces and, because of their age, were automatically determined to be domiciled in the same country as their father or, if their father was not alive, that of their mother. This was an automatic default position, and men who enlisted between the ages of 18 and 21 are directly impacted by it as a consequence. I doubt whether this affects many, but it is certainly an injustice to many of those who fought alongside Australian servicemen, who were part of the British, Commonwealth and allied forces at that time. It is almost anachronistic to us these days that an 18 year-old person could go to war and vote in this country but not have his place of residence acknowledged as valid when making an application to join the services. This bill corrects an anomaly that has long been a bugbear for a number of people, though I know that it does not affect many. One person it has affected, albeit in a slightly different way, is my father-in-law. He was 20 when he disembarked from a British Navy ship in Sydney, so he had his discharge papers signed here. He went through his whole working life, and it was not until sometime well into the future that issues were discovered, because his point of engagement on the British ship was in Scotland. We had to work a number of things through for him, but the measures in this bill will help a number of people in the same age group as my fatherin-law who joined the services outside Australia. It should be known that under this bill all other aspects of the domicile rules still need to be met. The condition of residency in Australia-including the intention to reside, the length of the period of residency et ceterastill needs to be met. So it is not just a matter of the point in time that the individual in question made application to join the service. I turn to the final aspect of this bill that I wish to mention. An amendment in this bill will end the eligibility for the war widows pension and the war widowers pension of war widows and widowers who enter into a de facto relationship prior to claiming the war widows pension or the war widowers pension. This seeks to provide equal treatment for partners who enter into a de facto relationship and those who enter into a marriage or a form of marriage-like arrangement which is registered. The amendment will apply only to claims made from 1 October 2010 or where there is an automatic grant of a widows pension or a widowers pension in relation to a death that occurs on or after 1 October 2010. So importantly, no existing widow's or widower's pension will be affected by this measure. In conclusion, this government will ensure that the ex-servicemen's community and our veterans get a fair go. I think this bill goes some way to improving the existing arrangements for veterans. Australians are justifiably proud of their veterans and their ex-service community. This government believes that the provision of robust services and support for our ex-service community is a sincere way to show our gratitude in recognition of the bravery and sacrifice of these Australian men and women in a time of need in this country. As the Prime Minister said on 13 August 2007: There is perhaps no greater duty that we as tion and as a parliament have than to honour, member and express our gratitude to those Australians who have served in the defence of our nation in times of war, because our security and liberty have not come without a price. I commend the bill to the House.",34
15,Mr BALDWIN,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise today to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. In essence, this bill will address a number of election commitments made by Labor during the 2007 election campaign. It is no surprise that these changes are only now being introduced, three years later, in the run-up to the 2010 election. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs regularly stands up in this House and says, ‘You had 12 years to do something,' and I accept that, but this government has been in place for nearly three years and only now are we finally seeing action. So let there be no doubt that the only thing that spurs this government into action is bad press or bad polls. The first measure contained within this bill concerns ex-defence personnel who have service relating to the British nuclear tests and is in line with the recommendation of the Clarke review. This measure seeks to insert a new classification within the Veterans' Entitlement Act titled ‘British nuclear test defence service' and will provide ex-defence personnel with additional entitlements. These entitlements will be equivalent to the existing entitlements contained within the Veterans' Entitlements Act for hazardous or nonwarlike service. Those persons who qualify under this definition will be eligible to access disability pensions, war widow/widower pensions and, in some cases, the gold card. Importantly, the reverse criminal standard of proof will be used to asses a person's eligibility to claim benefits under this measure. The next measure contained within this a nabill relates to service undertaken while on resubmarine special operations. This measure will reclassify service as operational and qualifying under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This change applies only to service undertaken on submarine special operations between 1 January 1978 and 31 December 1992, whereby some Royal Australian Navy submarines were engaged in special operations and intelligence operations to the north and west of Australia. The benefits available to qualifying and eligible persons are the service pension, the disability pension, the war widow/widower pension and a gold card from age 70. Eligibility for this entitlement will again be determined by applying the reverse criminal standard of proof and will be determined on service during the periods I previously specified, as well as on the basis that a member is entitled to be awarded with the Australian Service Medal with a ‘Special Ops' clasp. The next measure contained within this bill concerns service rendered by ADF personnel in Thailand-specifically service rendered at Ubon between 21 May 1962 and 27 July 1962. Currently, service at Ubon during this time is classified as operational; however, this amendment seeks to reclassify that service as qualifying service in light of the fact that those deployed at Ubon during the aforementioned period were exposed to potential risks arising from the activities of tile forces and dissident elements. However, it is important to note that this amendment does not affect the classification of service rendered throughout the rest of the north-east of Thailand during this period and, as such, this service will remain classified as operational service. This amendment will grant eligible persons access to the service pension, the disability pension, the war widow/widower pension and the gold card from age 70. The fourth amendment put forward under this legislation relates to the legal concept of a domicile of choice. By way of a short historical explanation, in the absence of the legal concept of Australian citizenship until 1949, the domicile of choice concept was used to determine whether a British, Commonwealth or allied veteran could be regarded as an Australian at the time of enlistment. That is, if a person was deemed, under common-law rules that applied at the time, as living in a residence located in Australia, they were regarded as a resident at the time of enlistment. However, a problem arose with this construct as a person aged under 21 years at the time of their enlistment could not establish a domicile of choice due to the common-law rules as they applied at the time. To correct this situation, the Domicile Act 1982 lowered the age at which a person could be legally regarded as establishing a domicile of choice from 21 to 18 years. However, the legislation did not apply to those cases arising before the commencement of that act. This amendment seeks to enable those British, Commonwealth or allied veterans aged between 18 and 21 at the time of enlistment to access Australian pensions and other benefits, provided that other common-law tests used in determining the domicile of choice are met. The final amendment contained within hosthis bill seeks to remove a so-called loophole which allows a widow/widower to claim a war widow/widower pension even if they enter into a de facto relationship prior to claiming the war widow/widower pension. By way of contrast, a widow/widower who marries or remarries before claiming the war widow/widower pension is not eligible for that pension. This legislation effectively means that the provisions for claiming a war widow/widower pension will now apply equally to those who are married or in a de facto relationship. Importantly, this amendment is prospective and will not affect any claim for a pension made before 30 September 2010. While the measures contained within this bill meet with the recommendations contained within the Clarke review, and I note they also have the broad support of the veterans community, it is important to note the timing of the introduction of this legislation. It is quite obvious that the Rudd Labor government has chosen to introduce this legislation during the time immediately preceding the election campaign proper. This point has not been lost on the veterans community. While they may be supportive of the changes I have just outlined, I am confident that they will also be cognisant of the fact that the timing of this bill is, to put it nicely, suspect. Take, for instance, the recommendations of the review of the Clarke report. These recommendations were delivered to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Griffin, in February 2009. It has taken Minister Griffin 15 months from the time he received the report for any action-at all-to occur on the recommendations of the review of the Clarke review. Yet only today in this House, Mr Griffin had the audacity to criticise the former coalition government for a three-month turnaround time on the Podger review. I put it to you, Minister Griffin: what are you going to do with the Podger review? You have had it for 2½ years and you have done nothing with it. Committing to release it says nothing about what you intend to do with its recommendations. It is just more talk, no action. The veterans community simply does not buy the line that because you said you would release it, and did, that you have discharged your responsibility on this matter. And I am here to remind you that you have a long way to go before anyone would consider that you have even come close to doing so. This is just more spin from a government trying to deflect attention away from its own failings-and there are lots of them. For the minister to stand in this House and claim that three months was far too long a time for the release of the Podger review, only to take over 15 months to act on the Clarke review illustrates the utter hypocrisy of this minister. And let us not forget that for all the fanfare made by the Rudd Labor government about ‘correcting' the service of BCOF veterans, some 30 months later it has decided to have the three recommendations reviewed again. So they are re-reviewing the re-reviewed recommendations! But that is the modus operandi of the Rudd Labor government: if it is too hard they will delay it, bury it or rereview it. Therefore, 2,700 aged veterans and their families are still waiting on the Rudd Labor government to fulfil their 2007 election commitments. I note that the measures contained within this bill will be widely welcomed by the veterans community. But I also note that the Rudd Labor government, through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Griffin, has waited until the last possible moment to introduce this legislation, all so he can maximise the political impact of these new measures. This is the action of a desperate government, a government trying to regain momentum. This is an act of a government that puts its self-interest before the interests of those in the veterans community. To conclude, veterans deserve a government that is upfront and honest with regard to its policies and promises, something that the current government has failed on both accounts. Veterans deserve a minister that will take action based on the interests of veterans, not the political interests of the Rudd Labor government. And finally, our service personnel, past and present, deserve to live out their lives in dignity and peace after giving so much to their nation. They deserve a government that will make the tough decisions and give veterans a sense of what is to come, instead of leaving them in limbo, waiting for answers on the important matter of their future financial and social security.",38
16,Mr HALE,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to make my contribution to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. It was an election commitment to look at the five areas that are in this bill. It is disappointing, to say the least, that the member for Paterson's contribution was overshadowed by having a swipe at the government. The point was made by the minister earlier today, when introducing the bill, that the former government had ample opportunity to address these matters and failed to do so. We are addressing them now. But we have come to expect that from those opposite, that even when they do support a bill, they still find it very difficult to speak in a proper manner of support. The bill will give effect to a number of Veterans' Affairs budget measures. Firstly, it will create a new category of service eligibility under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to be known as the British nuclear test defence service; secondly, reclassify certain submarine special operations between 1978 and 1992 as operational and qualifying service; thirdly, reclassify certain service in Ubon in Thailand as qualifying service; fourthly, lower the age of domicile of choice from 21 to 18 for the purpose of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986; and, finally, cease eligibility for war widow and war widower pensions for widows or widowers who enter into a de facto relationship prior to claiming the war widow or war widower pension. I will look at each of these in some more detail. The compensation for military participants in British nuclear testing is important because the British government conducted a series of nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga, Emu Field and Montebello Islands in the 1950s and 1960s and participants have long sought recognition and compensation under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 for conditions arising from their service. In reviewing recommendations of the 2003 Clarke review, the government has decided that former Defence Force personnel who participated in the British nuclear tests program will be provided with access to compensation and benefits under the VEA, as intended by the Clarke review. This will provide disability pensions and healthcare benefits to former Defence Force personnel who suffer from conditions accepted as related to the BNT service. It will also provide the war widow/war widower pension and gold card to the widows and widowers where the participant's death is accepted as related to the BNT service. People who will benefit from this will be former Defence Force personnel who participated in the BNT program. It is estimated 2,700 surviving personnel will potentially benefit, at a cost of $24.2 million over five years. The second item we have looked at is the domicile of choice. It is important that as who served with the British, Commonwealth and allied forces during the Second World War are able to access benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 if they have served during the war and were domiciled in Australia prior to the war. A small number of these veterans, the BCAL veterans, have been able to access VEA compensation benefits because they were between 18 and 21, thus automatically determined to be domiciled in the same country as their father or their mother if their father was deceased. The Clarke review of veterans entitlements recommended that this discretionary treatment be removed by lowering the age of domicile of choice to 18 years, but this was not implemented. The government committed to reviewing the unimplemented recommendations of the Clarke review and is now implementing these recommendations. The other aspects of the domicile rules still need to be met, such as integration into Australian society and residency in Australia including intention to reside and length of such residency. The BCAL veterans who enlisted aged between 18 and 21 and would have had Australia as their domicile had they been legally able to choose will benefit from this measure. It is estimated to affect only a handful of veterans and war widows but is an important point of principle. The cost of this amendment will be $700,000 over four years on the forward estimates. As to the reclassification of certain submarine operations, the Clarke review of veterans entitlements recommended that certain submarine special operations between 1978 and 1992 be deemed non-warlike hazardous for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. This recommendation was not accepted by the previous government. The government committed to reviewing the unimplemented recommendations of the Clarke review, and in 2009 the Vice Chief of veterthe Defence Force and the Chief of Navy concluded that the special operations met the special criteria for qualifying service and operational service that applied at the time. The reclassification of the service to qualifyaccess ing service and operational service will provide access to benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, including access to disability pensions, the service pension at age 60 and automatic entitlement to the gold card at age 70 to all submariners who served on certain special operations between 1978 and 1992 and who are eligible for the award of Australian Service Medal with Special Operations Clasp for that service. The beneficiaries of this amendment are some 890 former submariners and others who are eligible for the award of the Australian Service Medal with Special Operations Clasp for certain special submarine operations between 1978 and 1990. The government has committed $11.1 million over four years to fund this amendment. The fourth part of the bill concerns the Defence-initiated nature of service review and the reclassification of service at RAAF Base Ubon in Thailand. The Clarke review of veterans entitlements recommended that the classification of service at RAAF Base Ubon in Thailand between 31 May 1962 and 24 June 1965 not be changed. This recommendation was accepted by the previous government. Although not part of the revisitation of the Clarke review recommendations, a recent separate Defence nature of service review recommended the classification of service between 31 May 1962 and 27 July 1962 as qualifying service. This reclassification will allow veterans to access further benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 for this service, including a service pension at age 60 and automatic entitlement to the gold card at age 70. Personnel who served at RAAF Base Ubon in Thailand between 31 May and 27 July 1962 will be the beneficiaries of this. About 60 of the estimated 215 surviving veterans with this service currently do not have to these benefits. This will be funded by the government at a cost of $2.7 million over the next four years. The Clarke review also recommended the removal of inequities in treatment of widows or widowers who marry or remarry as opposed to those who enter into a de facto relationship. Under this proposal, if a deceased veteran's partner enters into a marriage-like relationship, they will no longer be eligible to claim the war widow or widowers pension, in the same way as those who marry or remarry are not eligible. This ineligibility will be permanent. Eligibility will not be reinstated if the de facto relationship ends. This removes the inequity in treatment of widows and widowers who marry or remarry as opposed to those who enter into a de facto relationship. This measure will ensure equal treatment of partners who marry or remarry and those who enter into a de facto relationship. This only applies to new claims. No current pensions are affected. There will be a saving to the government over four years of $1.4 million. There is always a lot of passion in this House when we talk about our veterans. Our war veterans are often left behind, and I know the member for Dobell has many veterans in his community who have served their country. I look forward to being able to inform the veterans in my community of the amendments that have been made to this bill. The 2010-11 budget delivers on key election commitments that the Rudd Labor government made to the veterans communitysome $246 million worth of new initiatives, greater access to compensation and income support, preventing unnecessary hospital admissions from members of the veterans community, action on further recommendations of the Clarke review, better access to health care and compensation for the F111 workers. I have often spoken in this House about the F111 workers and how moving and gut wrenching that inquiry was. I was very happy to see that there was compensation for those people affected all those years ago. Some $55 million will be invested to give an additional 2,400 F111 aircraft fuel tank maintenance workers access to better health care and compensation. These workers include those known as pick and patch personnel, who were not deemed eligible under the previous scheme. This means that more than 3,000 F111 workers will now have access to benefits should they need them. That is very important, and I was glad to see that that compensation will be paid to those people who so thoroughly deserve it. I know that people are now turning up in the chamber, but not to listen to me talk about this bill. That is being a bit harsh myself, but I would like to add my congratulations to the member for Kooyong. As a new member here, he is somebody I have looked up to and respected. He took many different positions on issues within the mer government. I certainly congratulate him on his contribution to this place, and I look forward to his valedictory speech. In conclusion, David Hardy has worked for me for three years. He is going back to work in his previous job. David Hardy is a lifelong friend of mine. During the election campaign he took 13 weeks annual leave to help me campaign and then he took a $5,000 pay cut and lost his airfares to come to work for me. He has finally seen the light and is going back to the Northern Territory government. So, to David Hardy: thanks a lot. And, to Petro: congratulations, and I look forward to your speech. I commend the bill to the House.",40
17,Mr GEORGIOU,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I was in the chamber to hear Kim Beazley's brilliant valedictory speech. One of the distinctive things he did was to thank people at the beginning rather than at the end of the speech. Expressions of gratitude are too often truncated by time constraints, so I will emulate Kim's example. One of the nice things in my case about getting older is that the black list shrinks while the white list, the debts that cannot be repaid, grow. I thank my mother, Anastasia, and my late father, Costandino Georgiou, for their enormous affection and commitment to their children despite the pressures and anxieties of migration. I thank my children, Costandino and Alexia, who, while still very young, felt the impact of my involvement in politics. Dino is in the gallery today; Alexia has unfortunately been caught in the fog in Melbourne. They are admirable young peoon ple. I thank Roxanne, who is everything. I thank my friends who have held me to my true compass through their support and by administering frequent and systematic beatings. I am grateful to have too many forfriends to thank them all individually, but they include Jo Szwarc, whose towering intellect has been totally committed to defending the vulnerable; Michael Kapel, a truly remarkable political talent; Ted Baillieu, whose devotion to the public good is unsurpassed. I also thank Alister Drysdale, Peter Wilkinson, Tony Staley, Giancarlo MartiniPiovano, Colin Rubenstein, Bret Walker, Brian Burdekin and Anna Cronin. Friends embrace staff: Andrew Manton, whose enormous capacities helped me to survive my first years in parliament; Helen Morris, my long-suffering secretary, for whom I worked for 21 years; Eleanor MCKinna; Kelly Sexton; and Tony Conheady. These people and all my other staff over the years have enabled me to perform far beyond my capacities. I thank my colleagues in the coalition, the Independents, third parties and those on the other side of the House. I thank Russell Broadbent, Judi Moylan, Judith Troeth and Bruce Baird. We have lived through some interesting times together. I will miss seeing them regularly. They embody the Liberal Party's traditions of strength, independent thinking and compassion. There is a special portal in the parliament. It makes people patient, sensitive, trustworthy, objective advisers and true defenders of the parliament. Unfortunately, passage through that portal is restricted to the clerks of the House of Representatives. I thank all the clerks I have known over 35 years. I thank the Parliamentary Library, Parliament House staff and Comcar drivers. I thank them for their indefatigable efforts to make an unruly parliament work. I thank the Liberal Party and the electorate of Kooyong. Kooyong is the birthplace of the Liberal Party. I have worked for the Liberal Party for most of my working life. As state director, as policy adviser and as a member of parliament, I have worked in pursuit of the Liberal Party values of enterprise, opportunity, incentive and social justice. I am grateful to the party in Kooyong for their support, and I thank Haddon Storey, Bill Clancy and Paula Davey for their work as my electorate chairs. The party in Kooyong is one of the powerhouses of liberalism and I wish it well. I have been genuinely humbled by the support I have received from the Kooyong electorate. Occasionally, some try to dismiss Kooyong as one of the ‘leafy suburbs', populated by doctors' wives. I note in passing leafy suburbs have been the backbone of the Liberal Party and that ‘doctors' wives' have always been at the heart of Australia's rural and urban communities. Not to recognise this is to disregard our historic traditions and our current realities. Kooyong is an open-minded and forward-looking electorate. Our people are active and socially responsible, with real insights on local and national issues. They are forthcoming in expressing their views, needs and values. It has been a great honour and a great privilege to have been able to serve them as their parliamentary representative. I would like to thank the press gallery. In the interests of transparency, I wish to disclose the following: my first media interview was with Laurie Oakes in, I think, 1975, for the Australian Playboy. I was a total novice. He was very fair to me. But I can truly say that I only bought Playboy for the articles. Journos, like politicians, can be good, bad or indifferent. They face imperative challenges, deadlines, the complexity of material and occasional misbriefing by interested parties. The good ones are full of insight and have a capacity to communicate with Australians and make politicians accountable. This is my 16th year in the parliament as the member for Kooyong and it is my 35th year in politics. I first sat on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1975 as an adviser to Malcolm Fraser, having brought some of the Khemlani telexes to Canberra as the coalition was blocking supply. Gough Whitlam's brilliant parliamentary skills defending a government that was weakened was mesmerising, as was the remorselessness of Malcolm Fraser's attacks. The fact that the supply crisis did not harm Australian democracy attests to the resilience of our political system. The fact that Gough and Malcolm reconciled years ago is a tribute to that their stature as national leaders. To those who have sought to denigrate Malcolm Fraser, I just want to say one thing: Malcolm's fusion of political toughness with compassion and social conscience is simply beyond their comprehension. I have been enormously privileged to have worked personally for Liberal parliamentary leaders over the last 30 years: Malcolm Fraser, Andrew Peacock, Jeffrey Kennett and John Hewson. Some have broken through; others have not. My respect for their commitment to creating a better Australia is boundless. Nobody forces people to be leaders but, nonetheless, the responsibilities volunteer to shoulder and the pressures they are subjected to are almost inconceivable. It is unfortunate that our political culture partisanship to the point of corrosiveness. I think our political leaders deserve more respect than we give them, regardless of which party they belong to. I came into the parliament at the age of 47, having been at the sharp end of partisan politics and also having contributed to public policy through the establishment of SBS Television and the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. I was strong in my view of what the Liberal Party stood for and confident in the common sense and fairmindedness of the Australian people. I believed that politics was a tough business. There were two dominant parties, they were in conflict, they had power and they had resources. They were strong and evenly matched. They punched and they counterpunched, and sometimes low blows were landed. In my view, however, scapegoating the vulnerable was never part of the political game. I still believe this. Not all politics is confrontation. Main force clashes, negative advertising and attempts to score lethal blows at question time-all too often unlethal-do dominate. But there are some less confrontational arenas. In parliamentary committees, the focus is on working cooperatively to inquire into issues of national significance and to scrutinise the executive. In my time on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, for instance, the committee, which included Senator Robert Ray, whose knowledge of the electoral system is as legendary as his lack of political tender-mindedness, managed to bring down three unanimous reports on the electoral system. This sort of cooperation provides some relief from a political landscape that is, generally, bleakly partisan. It they should be highlighted more often. Eleven years of my term was as a member of the government under John Howard. With takes Peter Costello as Treasurer, its economic achievements were remarkable. We enjoyed strong economic prosperity and record low levels of unemployment, and Australia was left with an enormously strong economy. These achievements should not be belittled and I do not think that they can be denied. During my time in parliament, a number of developments caused me grave concern. The emergence of the pernicious influence of Hansonism stirred up racial prejudice; multiculturalism, one of Australia's unique accomplishments, was denigrated; asylum seekers were subjected to increasingly harsh measures; our civil liberties came under challenge after September 11; and the proud Australian tradition of inclusive citizenship was, without sound justification, reversed. My experience in politics leads me to value party discipline highly. On some issues, however, I was unable to support the position of the party majority. A Liberal member of parliament has the right to do this. The Liberal Party has changed over the decades, but the right of Liberal parliamentarians to differ from the majority of their colleagues on matters of individual principle and conscience has endured. The belief that party discipline does not override individual principle is built into the very foundation of, and is the very reason for, our party's existence. In recent months there has been efflorescence within the party of the right to sent-dissent over climate change and alcopops spring to mind. I may have differed with my colleagues on their position, but I unequivocally endorse their right to dissent. Hopefully, we will never again hear a member of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party brand colleagues ‘political terrorists' because they took a stand on principle. I have not differed from the majority without considerable reflection and deliberation or without speaking with my colleagues and my party leader-and I have always known the consequences of my actions. Ultimately, however, being a member of parliament, especially a member of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party brings the responsibility of speaking with one's own voice on matters of principle. I am grateful the many members of the public, and in particular Liberal Party supporters, who have expressed their respect for my actions, even when they have disagreed. It is my conviction that public policy is served when members of parliament feel able to speak publicly about deeply felt concerns, even when their views do not conform with those of the majority of their colleagues. I believe that the public good was promoted by the attempt by myself and others to have the Commonwealth intervene to override the Northern Territory laws which jailed children for minor infractions such as stealing a bottle of spring water-laws which fell particularly harshly on Indigenous children. We did not succeed in getting the laws overridden; we did achieve the establishment of diversionary programs which effectively displaced jail. I believe that Australia benefited from the reforms that flowed from the attempt of a number of us to introduce private member's bills reforming the treatment of asylum seekers. Children and families were taken out dis- from behind razor wire. The Ombudsman was made responsible for publicly reporting on people being detained for prolonged periods. Thousands of people on temporary protection visas were given permanent protection. I believe that the resistance to draconian aspects of the anti-terrorist laws and the introduction of a private member's bill to establish an independent reviewer of terrorist laws-which was in essence taken up by the Labor government, with much reluctanceserved liberal principles well. I do not pretend that our efforts had anything like total success. The Northern Territory laws were not struck down. The policy of mandatory detention was not abolished by either the Howard or the Rudd government. What hapto pened, however, was that the compromises achieved made a significant difference to the lives of thousands of vulnerable men, women and children. For most of my life I have believed in the inevitability of progress. The reality is that many of the things that I believed were embedded parts of our polity-multiculturalism, the inclusiveness of Australian citizenship and the protection of civil rights-have been rolled back. Also rolled back has been a more decent treatment of asylum seekers. Until a few months ago I believed that the reforms made by the Howard and the Rudd governments meant that we had irreversibly turned the corner. I wrote that we were closing a dark chapter in our history. This chapter had seen men and women who were seeking refuge in our country incarcerated. It had seen innocent people imprisoned for longer than convicted rapists, robbers and kidnappers. Escapees from persecution were demonised and detention centres traumatisednot just the detainees, but their guards. This chapter, I am afraid, has been reopened. Regression has become the order of the day. With an increase in boat arrivals, asylum seekers are being subjected to increasingly virulent attacks. The Labor government has frozen the processing of Afghani and Sri Lankan asylum seekers and is reopening the Curtin detention centre. Historically, Curtin is the most notorious of the detention centres, which have all been places of despair and self-harm. Opposition policies would turn back boats, process asylum seekers in undisclosed third countries and restore the destructive temporary protection visas. These policies are cruel. They do not have my support. This regression does not reflect credit on either side of federal politics. Vulnerable people are again being made into a football to be kicked around in the interests of partisan politics. This is despite the facts and best values of our society. The fact is that Australia's punitive approach did not deter people coming to Australia. Mandatory detention, the charging of asylum seekers for the costs of their detention, the introduction of temporary protection visas and the Pacific Solution did not deter them. After mandatory detention was introduced, boat arrivals increased. After temporary protection visas were introduced, boat arrivals increased. Most of the people subjected to the Pacific Solution were found to be genuine refugees and resettled in Australia and New Zealand. I do not believe that we have lost control of our borders. I do not believe that people smugglers determine who comes into Australia and who does not. We can support orderly processes, we can warn people against people smugglers and we can warn them not to risk their lives on unseaworthy boats. We have to realise, however, that escaping from persecution is not an orderly process. Desperate people do take desperate measures. But beyond the arguments about deterrence, and what causes what, is a more fundamental point. It goes to our obligations. I believe that we have a fundamental obligation as a nation to, at the very least, not further harm those who bring themselves into our orbit of responsibility by seeking a safe haven. We should not, as Australians, compound the persecution of genuine refugees by delaying their processing, locking them up in unnamed third countries or keeping them in insecurity on temporary protection visas. I once said to journalist Michael Gordon: In life there are many things that you'd like to walk past and not notice. Lots. But sometimes you do notice and when you notice, you have to do something. I have noticed some things, and I have tried not to walk past. Progress is not inevitable. It requires commitment, and it requires effort. There are the setbacks and there are regressions. But I leave this place still optimistic that Australians will seek and find in their representatives, declarations and deeds that elevate hope above fear, and tolerance above prejudice. I am optimistic that they may be proud of the laws made by their parliamentarians and the contribution they make to help build a fair, decent and civil society for quickly coming generations. We here each bear a responsibility for our nation's calling and our nation's standing. It has been a profound honour to serve the nation as a member of the Australian Parliament. I am proud to have been part of this place during this time. Thank you.",43
18,Mr ADAMS,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010 addresses five parts of the Veterans' Entitlements Act that require amendment and it includes service relating to British nuclear tests, service on submarine special operations, service in Thailand, domicile and effect of widows and widowers entering into de facto relationships, and requires further interpretation of the eligibility criteria. The Veterans' Entitlethe ments Act provides eligibility for pensions, treatment and other benefits on the basis of the type of service that the veteran or Defence Force member has rendered. The three main types of service are operational service, which includes non-warlike service, qualifying service and defence service. Service regarded as operational service provides eligibility for disability and war widow and war widower pensions, treatment and other benefits, and the more generous reverse criminal standard of proof is used to determine pension claims. Operational service is overseas service within defined areas and dates in a time of war or during warlike or non-warlike operations. Operational service also grants veteran status under the Veterans' Entitlement Act. Qualifying service provides eligibility for service pension and associated benefits. Post Second World War qualifying service generally requires a person to have been allotted for duty and to have served in an operational area listed in schedule 2 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act or to have rendered warlike service. The other main category of defence-defence service-provides eligibility for disability and war widow and war widower pensions, treatment and other benefits. Broadly, defence service is peacetime service of three years or more in the Defence Force between 7 December 1972 and the commencement of the Military Compensation Act 1994 on 7 April 1994 and any period of hazardous service. Pension claims relating to defence service only are determined on the balance of probabilities, unless the member has peacekeeping service or hazard service, in which case the generous reverse criminal standard of proof is applicable. Then we have to look at those who were in defence forces during the series of British nuclear weapons tests which were conducted in Australia at the Monte Bello Islands off coast of Western Australia and at Emu Field and Maralinga in South Australia between October 1952 and October 1957. Minor trials were also conducted at Emu Field and Maralinga between 1953 and 1963. Both Australian and British personnel were involved in the tests and those involved included military and civilian participants but have yet to be included under this legislation. Workers compensation coverage for participants who were at the time members of the Australian Defence Force or the Australian Public Service is provided under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and its predecessors. In 1986 the government created a like safety, rehabilitation and compensation act administrative scheme to provide compensation coverage for civilians, including pastoralists and Indigenous persons, who were at the test sites. This scheme is still open to claimants. The test participants also had access to a special administrative scheme and an act of grace scheme, both administered by the then Department of Science, Education and Training. In 2006 the government enacted the British Nuclear Test (Treatment) Act to provide free testing and treatment for cancer for both military and non-military personnel who participated in the tests and related activities. The changes allowed a group of veterans who had been left out before to be included. As part of the 2010 budget, a new category of eligible service is to be created under the Veterans' Entitlements Act to provide former Australian Defence Force members who participated in the British nuclear tests and related activities with eligibility for benefits equivalent to those that are available to members with non-warlike or hazardous service. In addition, pension claims relating to British nuclear test defence service are to be determined under the more generous standard of proof of the reasonable hypothesis test under sections 120 and 120A of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. British nuclear test defence service is a distinct new category of service and is not non-warlike or hazardous service, although the benefits it will attract are equivalent to those for non-warlike or hazardous service or defence service. To achieve this, the British nuclear test Defence service will be incorporated into part 4 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The amendments will be made to sections 120 and 120A to ensure that pensions claimed relate to British nuclear test Defence service and are determined on the more generous reverse criminal standard of proof and reasonable hypothesis test. British nuclear test Defence service will be incorporated into part IV of the Veterans' Entitlements Act by including British nuclear test Defence service in the definition of Defence service in part 4 item 4 of this schedule, including members of the British nuclear test Defence service in the definition of member of the forces in part IV item 5 of this schedule and applying part IV of the VEA to members with British nuclear test Defence service. This requires a new subsection, 69B, at item 6 of this schedule. It will also define the teria a member must meet to have rendered British nuclear test Defence service. Because of the incorporation of British nuclear test Defence service into part IV of the VEA, members will become eligible for disability and war widow and war widower pensions under part IV; treatment under part V by virtue of section 81 of part V; allowance and other benefits under part VI by virtue of section 96 of part VI; rehabilitation under part VIA; the Veterans' Children Education Scheme under part VII; and the veterans' supplement under part VIIA. The second part of this legislation applies to certain submarine special operations, which will be reclassified as operational and qualifying service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This will provide eligibility for all pensions and associated benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and will mean that disability and war widow and war widower pension claims relating to this service will be determined on the more generous reverse criminal standard of proof. The amendments made by schedule 2 reclassify certain submarine special operations that were undertaken in the period between 1978 and 1992 as operational and qualifying service. Service regarded as operational service provides eligibility for disability and war widow and war widower pensions, treatment and other benefits and the more generous reverse criminal standard of proof is used to determine pension claims. Operational service is overseas service within defined areas and dates in a time of war or during warlike or non-warlike operations. Operational service also grants veteran status under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Qualifying service provides eligibility for service pension and associated benefits. Post Second World War qualifying service generally requires the person to have been allotted for criduty and have served in an operational area listed in schedule 2 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act or to have rendered warlike service. Persons with Defence service will generally have the same access to disability and war widow and war widower pensions, treatment and other benefits as those with operational service, except that pension claims will be subject to the civil standard of proof. On that basis a pension will only be granted if the Repatriation Commission, in deciding the claim, is able do so to its reasonable satisfaction. Persons with operational service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act are also eligible for subsidised home loan advances under the Defence Service Homes Act. Relevant submarine special operations service between 1978 and 1992 currently attracts dual eligibility under both the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and under the Veterans' Entitlements Act as Defence service. As such, under the Veterans' Entitlements Act claims for pension relating to this service are currently determined on the civil standard of proof and not the more generous reverse criminal standard of proof. All persons who served on the relevant submarine special operations were awarded, or were eligible to be awarded, the Australian Service Medal with Clasp SPECIALOPS. As a consequence of the inclusion of the certain submarine special operations as operational and qualifying service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act there is a need for consequential amendments to both the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Defence Service Homes Act. Eligibility under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will be retained for claims made before the commencement of the amendments in this schedule; that is, claims made under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act before 1 July 2010. Eligibility under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will cease for new claims relating to the relevant submarine special operations on and from the commencement of the amendments to this schedule, 1 July 2010. This means that any compensation payable under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act prior to the commencement of this schedule, including claims lodged before the commencement of this schedule and determined after the commencement of this schedule, will continue to be payable and may be offset against any subsequent disability pension payable under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The Defence Service Homes Act will be amended to provide eligibility under that act for members with the relevant submarine special operations service. Then there are the changes for those who served in Ubon in Thailand from 31 May 1962 to 27 July 1962 inclusive, which is to be re-classified as ‘qualifying service' due to the potential risk from the activities of hostile forces and dissident elements. The reclassification of this service to qualifying service will provide members with eligibility for service pensions and associated benefits. Service in Ubon in Thailand from 31 May 1962 to 27 July 1962 will retain its current operational service status. It should be noted that the qualifying service reclassification is limited to service in Ubon and does not extend to service in other parts of north-east Thailand during that period, as the circumstances justifying the reclassification applied only to those serving in Ubon at that time. Service in other parts of north-east Thailand during this period will remain operational service. Some of these areas of service have been the subject of much discussion over the years and I am pleased to see they have now been recognised. Domicile legislation is also to be altered by this legislation. Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, British, Commonwealth and allied veterans may be eligible for pensions and other benefits, if they have eligible service with a Commonwealth or allied defence force and if they had Australian domicile immediately prior to their enlistment in that defence force. This policy was intended to cover those Australians who were travelling or studying overseas at the time World War II broke out and who could not return to Australia to enlist in the Australian Defence Force. In the absence of the legal concept of Australian citizenship until 1949, the domicile concept was adopted as a means of determining whether a British, Commonwealth and allied veteran could be regarded as an Australian at the time of enlistment. However, persons under 21 at the time of their enlistment in a Commonwealth or allied defence force could not establish a domicile of choice-independent domicile-as common-law rules that applied at that time meant that a person could not assume a domicile of choice before the age of 21. Until the age of 21, a person's domicile would have been dependent on the domicile of the father, or if the father was deceased, the domicile of the mother. The Domicile Act 1982 has since lowered the age at which a person can claim independent domicile from 21 to 18 years of age. However, this act does not apply to circumstances that occurred before the commencement of the act and thus the commonlaw rules continue to apply in those circumstances. This will enable those veterans who were between 18 and 20 and unable to nominate Australia as their domicile of choice to gain eligibility under the Veterans' Entitlements Act for their service in a British, Commonwealth or allied defence force, as Australian veterans, providing they meet the other domicile and service eligibility requirements. Finally, the amendments made by schedule 5 will cease eligibility for war widow or war widower pensions for widows and widowers who enter into a de facto relationship prior to claiming the war widow or war widower pension. It will also cease eligibility for a widow or widower who is in a de facto relationship at the time of the veteran or member's death and who would otherwise have been automatically granted war widow or war widower pension. Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, a war widow or war widower pension is payable to compensate the widow or widower of a veteran or member of the Defence Force who has died as a result of war service or defence service. Under the current provisions, a widow or widower remains eligible for a war widow or war widower pension even if the widow or widower enters into a the de facto relationship prior to claiming the war widow or war widower pension.

19,Mr ROBERT,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"This bill implements Labor's 2007 election commitment to reconsider the unimplemented recommendations of the Clarke review of veterans' entitlements. The review was, of course, conducted by the Hon. John Clarke QC and was completed in 2003. I note that in 2004, the previous coalition government responded with a package of $236 million over five years. In Labor's plan for veterans affairs in the Kevin 07 election the Labor Party promised: A Rudd Labor Government will give further consideration to recommendations of the Clarke Review of Veterans' Entitlements that were not acted upon by the Howard Government. They said: This process will also give early priority to recommendations relating to those Australian participants in the British Commonwealth Occupational Force in JapanBCOFand Defence participants in the atomic tests in Australia. I do confess a conflict of interest: my uncle was part of the BCOF in Japan and would later volunteer and fight with the 3rd Battalion in Korea in 1951. On 9 September 2008, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs issued a great press release: ‘Government kicks off Clarke Reviewnuclear veterans and BCOF a priority.' Submissions from veterans about unimplemented recommendations were due by 1 December 2008. The recommendations were delivered to Minister Griffin in February 2009. And then we waited. We waited some 30 months from the election of the government, and 15 months from the time the report was delivered, for any action at all on the recommendations. And now we see in the budget, $36 million. The previous government spent $236 million. So another 15 per cent-$36 million-was certainly welcome over four years to implement the re-reviewed recommendations. The Rudd Labor government noted that three had already been accepted and acted upon; four have been accepted and are the basis of this bill; four deferred for further consideration; 22 referred to the review of military compensation arrangements; and 12 rejected for a second time. Noting my declared conflict of interest, I am somewhat amazed that recommendations relating to BCOF veterans have been further delayed. The government has stated it proposes to defer its response to these recommendations to allow further examination and discussion within the government and with the defence Nature of Service Review team. There appears to be no time line for the completion of this re-review of the re-review of the review, which is interesting because the minister's press release was titled ‘Government kicks off Clarke review: nuclear veterans and BCOF a priority'. But apparently there is no time line for this ‘priority'; it just seems to have disappeared into the ether. There is lots of noise from the government about correcting the service of BCOF veterans under the re-review of the re-review of the re-review of the review. But, again, nothing happened-30 months and there is still nothing for the 2,700 aged BCOF aged veterans, including my uncle, who has since died, and their families. And no-one is any the wiser about the commitment Labor made to them at the last election. I can only surmise that when the minister said ‘Government kicks off Clarke review' and ‘BCOF a priority' that a ‘priority' would not end up as a re-review of a re-review of a review. I can only assume that is another broken promise-I have to say that list must be exceptionally long by now. In terms of the substance of the bill, it deals with within the four accepted recommendations in five schedules, and there is one new issue there that was not part of the Clarke review. Schedule 1 deals with recommendation 45 of the Clarke review. The Australian government will reclassify the service of British nuclear test defence service veterans to an equivalent ‘hazardous, nonwarlike' status-costing $24.3 million over four years. Eligible ex-defence personnel will be able to access disability pensions, war widow pensions and, where applicable, a gold card. Of course, where I say ‘war widow' I also refer to ‘war widowers'. Eligible ex-defence personnel will be able to access those benefits. In 2006, the previous coalition government extended coverage of the white card to all ex-defence and civilian personnel who were involved in the tests. White card coverage will remain for civilian personnel who are not ex-defence personnel. Under changes to the VEA Act, a new classification of service would be entered into the act. Schedule 2 looks at the issue of submarine special operations-recommendation 31 of the Clarke review. The Australian government intends to reclassify the service of submarine special operations undertaken between 1 January 1978 and 31 December 1992 as ‘qualifying' and ‘operational' service. Considering that this service was on board the British Oberon class of submarines, I have absolutely and utterly no problem with this recommendation and where the government is going. I have not been or served on board an Oberon class submarine. I have been on board the Collins class submarine. But I know, from talking to my colleagues who served on the Oberon class, that it was like living completely wrapped in smelly, diesel-covered oily rags. thing we can provide for those men that served long periods in quite dangerous occupations in that sort of unknown environment is well and truly deserved. This change will entitle eligible people access to an assetand means-tested service pension at age 60, to the disability pension, to the war widow pension and to the gold card at age 70. The Naval Association of Australia strongly supports the extended classification, as do I. Schedule 3 looks at service in Thailand. The Australian government will reclassify certain service between 31 May 1962 and 27 July 1962 in Ubon in north-east Thailand as ‘qualifying service'. Again, this will entitle eligible veterans access to service pensions at age 60 and the gold card at age 70, on top of existing entitlement to disability pensions, and will entitle eligible widows to war widow pensions. This is not in response to the Clarke review. Yet a quick note of the history I think explains where the government has gone, and again I think it is a relatively good move. Throughout the 1960s, Australian service personnel were stationed throughout South-East Asia-in fact, some of them were stationed there from 1948, when the Malayan Emergency began, in which I think 36 Australian servicemen lost their lives. Australians were involved in confrontation in Malaysia. After 1965, of course, personnel were involved in the Vietnam War, specifically with the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam and then other forces that went there. On a quick side note, my first exposure to the Training Team Vietnam was through our school sergeant Jim Geedrick, a great Australian who fought at a very young age in World War II, fought in the Malayan Emergency, fought in the Korean confrontation and then fought with the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. He was a tremendous man, a great Australian and a great asset to my school, Rockhampton I think any- Grammar School. In May 1962, 79 Squadron from the RAAF, the Royal Australian Air Force, was despatched to north-east Thailand to protect the territorial integrity of Thailand. At the time, suffice it to say there were few facilities at Ubon. It was pretty rugged. It was very, very tough going for two months before something more permanent began to be constructed. I have lived in some fairly tough, disgusting places in the north of Australia and other countries on operations. The situation in 1962 I think took tough to a whole new level. So, for the government to reclassify ‘potential risk from the activities of hostile forces and dissident elements', considering the circumstances they were living in, is appropriate and just. Moving on to schedule 4, which relates to recommendation 60 of the Clarke review, the Australian government will correct an anomaly in the VEA Act to enable certain British Commonwealth and allied veterans who were aged between 18 and 21 at the time of enlistment in a Commonwealth or allied defence force to access the Australian repatriation system. Under the VEA Act, British, Commonwealth and allied veterans may be eligible for pensions and other benefits if they have eligible service with a Commonwealth or allied defence force and if they had Australian domicile immediately prior to their enlistment in that defence force. Again, that makes a fair degree of sense to me. Finally, schedule 5 deals with war widows entering into a de facto relationship. In line with recommendation 54 of the Clarke review, the Australian government will remove an entitlement from war widows who claim a war widow pension after entering a marriage-like-that is, a de facto-relationship. Consequently, the government will require eligible war widows to claim a war widow pension before they enter a new relationship in order to qualify for their pension. I note that, under current legislation, a war widow who applies for a war widow pension after marrying or remarrying is not entitled to that pension. However, a war widow who enters a marriage-like relationship could still apply for a war widow pension. There was a difference between de facto and married. I note the government is proposing a change. It is not retrospective, but it does make assumptions on the way people live. The government is looking to save $1.4 million over four years, which in effect denies about 10 new applicants per year. I think it is instructive to again look at tory. In 1984, the Hawke government put back pensions to married or remarried war widows who, until then, had lost their pension upon remarriage. Again, this was a prospective, not retrospective, change. In 2001, the previous coalition government broadened the 1984 change to include any married or remarried war widow who lost their pension as a result of their marriage or remarriage after applying for and being granted a pension. Justice Clarke recommended, inter alia, that no change to the present arrangements be made, including the broadening of the base of the war widow pension to people who had applied after marriage. The war widow pension is a compensation payment and is not means tested. I think it is paid at a rate of $703.90 a fortnight, and some eligible war widows may indeed receive an income support supplement. I note this change has the support of the veteran and ex-service community, including the War Widows Guild of Australia and Legacy. However, my view is that a war widow is still a war widow. Regardless of whether she remarries or moves into a de facto relationship, they have lost their partner-their husband and, in some cases, their wife-in combat operations overseas. I cannot imagine the horror and the pain of losing my wife or of someone losing their partner, but to lose them in the defence of the nation or in the national interest overseas in combat operations, in such difficult environments, is a whole new world of horror. There is an incredibly brave Australian in my electorate, Nicole Pearce. She is the war widow of David ‘Poppy' Pearce who died in combat operations in Afghanistan, fighting for all that we believe in and our way of life. I have recently got back from 10 days in the Middle East operations, including five days in Kandahar and in Tarin Kowt. In the midhisdle of the base is an Australian memorial, to the young Australian-in this case-men who have paid the ultimate price, who have died on combat operations serving their nation. David ‘Poppy' Pearce's name is there. I took a photograph of the memorial and a close-up of his name, of his plaque, and sent it to Nicole. I gave her a call, because she is in my electorate, and she said, ‘You know what: today would have been our 15th wedding anniversary.' You cannot imagine the horror. A war widow is a war widow-and we should never lose sight of that.",51
20,Mr NEUMANN,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. The Rudd government is committed to supporting our veterans and their families. The budget handed down this year has a suite of new initiatives totalling $246.4 million. This includes greater access to compensation, income support, preventing unnecessary hospital admissions for members of the veteran community, decisive action with respect to the recommendations of Justice John Clarke in what is known as the Clarke review, and better access to health care and compensation for F111 workers, particularly those who worked on F111s at RAAF Base Amberley in the electorate of Blair. I have been a strong advocate of our actions on the Clarke review and of acting on what I would describe as the Bevis parliamentary recommendations, which recommended more justice and fairness for those in the military who worked on F111s, particularly in refuelling and the deseal-reseal operations at RAAF Base Amberley. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs is probably heartily sick and tired of my speaking to him on this issue. Every time he looks at me he initiates the conversation before I mention it to him. But I am pleased with the budgetary measures we have undertaken on both of these issues. Certainly, 2,400 extra people will receive justice in the desealreseal operations that took place at RAAF Base Amberley. These include the ‘pick and patch' workers, at a cost of $39.6 million. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs said on budget night that more people will be eligible for care and compensation now, including those who carried out F111 fuel tank maintenance involving fuel tank entry. He announced a $55 million package of health care and compensation to those in need and the reopening of the SHOAMP healthcare scheme, which was closed on 20 September 2005 at a cost of $12.5 million. This is acting where the previous government failed to act. I am pleased that Kathleen Henry from the group who advocated for justice on this issue has liaised closely with us. I commend her work and the work of Ian Fraser on this issue. It is not only the people involved in the F111 aircraft fuel tank maintenance operations but also those people who, sadly, in a terrible tragedy of our history participated or were exposed to radiation as a result of British nuclear testing who will receive a degree of decency, compensation and health care as a result of the budget. British nuclear testing took place in a number of different locations in Australia. On 3 October 1952, the UK tested its first nuclear weapon, named Hurricane, at the Monte Bello Islands off the Western Australian coast. Two major test series were conducted at Maralinga called Operation Buffalo and Operation Antler. The Indigenous people in the area at Maralinga, who considered Maralinga to have very deep spiritual significance to them going back generation after generation, were simply ignored and treated appallingly at the time. This is a terrible period of our history, and it is not as though governments of the day did not know about this. These people were exposed to radiation which had lifelong impacts upon them. The government's response is to act on the recommendations of Justice Clarke, who recommended in 2003 in a report that the participation of defence personnel in the British nuclear test program in Australia be deemed non-warlike hazardous. This had implications for the provision of decent health care and compensation for these people. I say 2003: the actual review was the 2003 review of veterans entitlements conducted by Justice Clarke. We were not in power at the time; the coalition government was in power in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and nearly all of 2007. It is a terrible shame that the recommendations of Justice Clarke were not acted upon by the coalition government. We appreciate that now there is a bipartisan approach on this issue. We appreciate that from those opposite. But those opposite have failed dismally when it comes to the recommendations of Justice Clarke. After I was elected to this place in November 2007 a fellow came to see me, a conin stituent of mine, Merv Kleidon, who lives in Ipswich at a place known as One Mile. It is a nice place with a great community centre, and there is a great Baptist church in the Leichhardt-One Mile area. My uncle Merv Neumann is actually the president of the Leichhardt-One Mile Community Centre and secretary of the Leichhardt Baptist church. Merv Kleidon is a well-known figure in the Leichhardt-One Mile area. He came to see me because he was concerned about this issue. I pointed out to him that there were about 470 submissions made in relation to the Clarke review when the government was considering this issue. I said, ‘Tell me, Merv, why are you interested in this topic?' He said, ‘Well, Shayne, I've got a gold card. I got one for my service in Malaya in 1959 to 1961. I worked in the RAAF. I was an engine fitter and I was based at the RAAF base at Amberley in Ipswich,' now in the electorate of Blair. He said, ‘I worked on the Lincoln aircraft. Me and my mates worked on them.' I said, ‘Tell me about this.' So Merv proceeded on this occasion, and on numerous occasions subsequently when he popped into my office to have a chat with me, to say that so many of his friends had died from radiation sickness and poisoning. He said, ‘We worked on these aircraft which were monitoring the clouds that came across as a result of the nuclear tests.' He said he had been advocating for quite some time for justice, but he told me that the Australian Nuclear Veterans Association had contacted him about it. He said that the Australians who are involved in this association had contacted him and asked him to get involved. So he is actually on the editorial committee that publishes a magazine that deals with issues concerning nuclear veterans. He told me about the stories of his friends and what they put up with. Merv went to places like Alice Springs and Toowoomba to advocate for the cause. He said, ‘We were treated shabbily. They knew and we weren't told. We were exposed to this stuff and the authorities knew about it. We would go into the planes afterwards, the gunnery areas and where the pilots were, and they would have great packs of chocolate and nuts and food and we would eat these rations. We weren't told that they were exposed to radioactive material, we weren't told that we were damaging our health, but we were effectively fodder. We were misled deliberately and mistreated.' So he and his mates and their families suffered accordingly. Merv is obviously still alive and still advocating for the causes in which he believes. He claims that the British knew all about and he said, ‘We knew that they knew all about it later on.' He felt the Australian government knew about it at the time but did little about it. Artie Fadden, who had been Prime Minister for a while, supposedly said to the British, ‘What's going on about these clouds that are coming across the country?' And the previous coalition government knew about it as well. Merv's response when I had a chat with him today about this issue was, ‘Good one, Shayne. You have done what you said you would do.' Merv has got a gold card from his overseas service in South-East Asia, but he said it is long overdue recognition of what went on. He said that many people have been affected. I will never forget Merv coming into my office, with tears in his eyes, telling me about his mates. I want to commend Merv and all those like him who fought for justice for so long, who travelled around everywhere, who wrote articles, who advocated, who agitated, who annoyed politicians on both sides of the political divide. He said he was exposed not just for a couple of days but for a considerable period of time. We treat and have treated our men and women who have served in the military pretty shamefully at times and we have adopted the views and we have followed slavishly at times the advice and the actions of our great and powerful friends. But sometimes our friends deserve to be told that they got it wrong. Sometimes we need to stand up more strongly for the Australian public, the Australian veteran community and the Australian military who serve on our behalf. I thank Merv for his advocacy and I thank him for the many times he popped into my office. It is never a short conversation with Merv; he likes to let you know what he thinks. I want to thank him very much and I want to pay tribute to Merv and all those like him for what they have done in this regard. I see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs here. He will have nothing to talk to me about after the Clarke review and after the Bevis review. But I am pleased we have acted on those things, because he has honoured what he said he would do. This has not been an easy process, but it is a just decision. We will see legislation amended to ensure that the declaration of non-warlike hazardous service can in fact be extended to the Veterans' Entitlements Act. We have given action to the recommendation of Justice Clarke and it means veterans and their widows and widowers can get access to the kind of health care and assistance that they so deserve. This is the closure of a sad chapter in the military service of our country by so many people. Other aspects of this legislation deal with the reclassification of certain submarine special operations as qualifying service, the reclassification of service in Ubon in Thailand as qualifying service, the lowering of the age of domicile of choice from 21 years to 18 years for the purpose of the VEA Act and the cessation of eligibility for war widow or widower pensions for widows and widowers who enter into de facto relationships prior to claiming the same. Many of these things are the recommendations of Justice Clarke. I am sure that many people across the country will be pleased today with this legislation. It will help a lot of people. It will help honour their memories, particularly in relation to the British nuclear testing service. This change will potentially help up to 2,700 former defence personnel. This is a good day where we correct a terrible injustice that was perpetrated and perpetuated on Australian military personnel and their families for a very long time.",54
21,Mr GRIFFIN,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Bruce-Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel) (12.10 pm)-in reply-I will concentrate my comments on a number of issues that have been raised in the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010 and address some of the concerns that have been raised. Some of the issues include not only the legislation but also, in a wider sense, the government's conduct in veterans affairs over the last couple of years. I think some of these points need to be addressed. I will go back in time a bit, because much of what we are dealing with in this legislation is about going back in time and dealing with issues which were outstanding over many years. I make the point that the government, when in opposition, came forward with a very comprehensive plan for veterans affairs. It has been mentioned by some of the speakers and I have a copy with me today. The funny thing about it, though, is that a number of people who have brandished the document or have endeavoured to quote from the document have, frankly, just quoted selectively. They have not gone to the details. They have picked headings out. They have used quotes such as, ‘The government promised to restore the value of compensation and entitlements.' And, yes, we did. We then listed a series of specific commitments that we would act on, which we have overwhelmingly done. Some people have sought to expand upon that far beyond what the government ever said, far beyond what the government ever suggested. In that way, they try and say on the basis of a heading or one line, ‘That means that the government meant (a), (b), (c).' Well, it did not. We laid it right out there. That is why there was a document this big-some 28 pages-with details and specific commitments. What we heard from the ex-service community was that they were sick of being lied to, they were sick of being led down a path and they were concerned that matters were not getting addressed and had been outstanding for more than a decade. In fact, when we look at the Clarke review, some of the issues that it raised are dealt with in this legislation. The Clarke view was the result of, under the previous government, massive concern within the veteran and ex-service community about the government's lack of action around a whole range of issues. That is why the Clarke review was established. It was a commitment by the previous government earlier this century to look at what they had not addressed in the last part of the last century. It was about going to an all-encompassing inquiry which produced a range of different issues. The government of the day subsequently responded to that, but, as has been said, many recommendations were not accepted and that was the nature of the commitment that was made by the government. We made the commitment to review those recommendations, not to accept them all, not to impleprevious ment them all but to review them and to see what could be done about those recommendations that were worthy of action and those recommendations that were worthy of support. We stipulated in our election commitment-in fact, it was in our platform-two particular recommendations that had received a good deal of public interest and a good deal of concern. We made sure that the debate internally around those issues was considered carefully and we looked to the question of what should be done with those particular issues. On this occasion and in this response one of those key issues-British nuclear test participants-has been addressed. What is funny about it is speakers from the opposition saying ‘this has taken too long', ‘it hasn't gone far enough', ‘some of these recommendations shouldn't have been acted upon' or whatever-take your pick. But let us remember what this means. This is an opposition complaining about the fact that this government is taking too long to address reissues that they refused to address when in office. These recommendations were rejected by the previous government. It is great to see speakers like the member for Fadden and the member for Greenway standing up and endorsing, to a large extent, what is in the legislation and saying these are positive moves forward, even though the member for Greenway is a member of the party that rejected those recommendations-not so much the member for Fadden, seeing as he is a new member. I agree with him that action is long overdue in relation to submarine service, but, frankly, it was reviewed by the Howard government and it was rejected. I agree that action is long overdue on the question of Clarke's recommendation about British nuclear test participants, but, frankly, the government refused to go any further than they did with their response in 2006, which provided white card coverage for cancer treatment. Every single dollar under this legislation is a dollar that goes to members of the veterans community. It is money that they did not get, would not have got and were refused by the previous government. So it is funny to have the opposition stand in here today and talk about how long it has taken. It took them a long time to consider the issues in the first place, but then they were very clear: the answer was no. I am very proud of being part of a government where today the answer is yes on some of these issues. I am very proud to be part of a government that is moving forward in dealing with some of those outstanding concerns. There are other issues that have been raised today which again I would like to comment on and which I think also tell part of that story. The member for Blair made much of the F111 deseal-reseal program, and I know in comments if not today then certainly in the appropriations debate that the shadow minister, the member for Greenway, raised issues in relation to that. The member for Blair made the point that this was a positive $55 million commitment in the forward estimates to deal with issues around the deseal-reseal program-that it expanded significantly the number of people who were covered and gave people access to opportunities to receive compensation and health care for conditions they had developed. The shadow minister said of the F111 DesealReseal Support Group: They feel incredibly let down by the response the review. Maybe she should go back and check with them now, because I met with them in Brisbane subsequent to the budget announcement to discuss the issues around the response and what it means for the people that they have concerns about-and it is fair to say that there are concerns that remain. But one of the key people in that group, who has had a long involvement in this issue, Kathleen Henry, said in an open meeting, ‘I think you've got this 90 per cent right.' I will tell you what else: this was the result of a parliamentary inquiry conducted under the chairmanship of the member for Brisbane, Arch Bevis. It was a parliamentary inquiry that was a commitment I made as the shadow minister, in opposition, out at Amberley at a meeting of the deseal-reseal support group. I remember it very clearly because at the time. I was not sure what the answer was, I was not sure what needed to be done here, but I was concerned about the level and degree of concern being expressed by those people about their circumstances. I could not commit, and it would not have been sensible to commit, to firm action at that time in terms of a monetary sum or a system, but I committed to having the parliamentary inquiry. ‘Let's have a look at it,' I said, and that is what they wanted us to do. The next speaker after me that day was the then minister, the member for Dunkley. I have a lot of time for the member for Dunkley and, as I have said on the public record, I think he was a good Minister for Veterans' Affairs. In his time as minister I think he addressed some issues where action was long overdue on a number of fronts. But on this one he dropped the ball, because he was asked for the same commitment that day and he refused to give it. We have the shadow minister complaining about a response to an inquiry that, when they were into government, they refused to have. They refused to conduct it; they refused to allow it. As I said, there is some $55 million, according to estimates from the department, in health care and compensatory support, potentially going to up to another 2,700 or so members who were actively involved in the deseal-reseal area, and every single dollar of that exceeds the requirement and the allowance of the previous government in terms of what they were prepared to do. The opposition are saying: ‘Oh, it took too long,' and, ‘Oh, it doesn't go far enough.' bloody sight further than what the previous government did over a decade. I might add that the general response within the ex-service community on that issue, on most occasions-certainly from those who have actually read it-has been positive. The shadow minister also mentioned the review of ESO advocacy and welfare services, commonly known as the BEST review. It has been put, as I understand it, that this has been sitting on my desk. It started sitting on my desk today-today; not a month ago, not six months ago. I received it today, and what I received is what we said and what I have said publicly it would be: a key issues paper for circulation. I have made that very clear to the ex-service community. There are concerns about this review and there is good reason to be concerned, because it is a complex area. It is a complex area in terms of providing support where the ex-service organisations need it and where the people that they service need it. It is a complex area in which to make sure things are done properly, transparently and fairly. There have been issues, and the ESOs know that. It is one of the reasons why, despite their concerns about what the result might be, they have overwhelmingly supported the review. It has been embraced because people know there are issues that need to be looked at. I might add that there were probably more issues under the previous government, the reason being that there was less funding provided in their forward estimates for this program compared to what we have provided. So, if there are problems now, goodness knows what the problems would have been if the previous government had been returned. We are going to work through the issues in that review because it is important, but we are going to work through them with the ex-service community to ensure that we get a good outcome to deal with some of the isWell, it goes a sues in the future. My understanding is that it was also said, if not in the appropriations debate then today, that there were concerns about the MRCA review. I think it was said that I verballed the opposition so they would not support it. No. What I said was: when they were in government and they established the system in terms of the MRC Act, it was said by all and sundry, frankly, that there ought to be a review of it once it had been in operation for several years. I said that when we committed to that in opposition the then government did not. This is another example of today's opposition all of a sudden on the road to Damascus having an epiphany and deciding that they will now support something. It was not that long ago that they were in government and had an opportunity to deal with these issues but did not. It was not that long ago that they just sat on their hands. Concerns have been raised about the pharmaceutical costs review-it is longawaited but still has not quite been delivered. Many ex-service organisations regularly raised the very important issue of the cost of medications to deal with war caused disabilities. The commitment from the opposition at that time-the Labor Party-was to review that area to achieve a fair outcome for those who have war caused disabilities. It was always made very clear that this commitment would be acted on very late in the term, and the bottom line is that is what is happening. Once again this issue was raised repeatedly with the then government and they refused to take any action. Again this government is being criticised by the opposition for taking too long to consider an issue that they refused to consider. Frankly, it smacks of hypocrisy. There has been quite a bit of debate on military superannuation matters, which are also relevant to this. There was some debate yesterday on the legislation relating to the governance of superannuation schemes in the government sector. It has been suggested by members of the opposition that I made commitments prior to the last election to remove the confusion and ensure there was certainty. Once again they were sitting on a reportthey had information and they would not release it. Once again they had the ability to ensure people understood what was being considered, but they refused to do anything about it. It has been suggested that it has taken too long to consider Clarke. Yet they sat on that review for three months. They sat on that review for only three months because the election was called. I suspect that, had had another 12 months to wait, they would have sat on it for another 12 months because there was absolutely no sign of it coming out before the election. We have the opposition intimating they may take action around issues like indexation in the longer term when they are back in government and when the budget is in surplus, yet they were in government for over a decade and overwhelmingly in that time the budget was in surplus and they did not do it. In fact, the opposition sat on the report. When we released that report, it was roundly turned on by the ex-service and defence community as being not the way they thought the government should be going. The Rudd government publicly released a report produced under the previous government, as we committed to do. Having released it, we sought to have it discussed and commented on. We had a process for that. The response from that process was, ‘We don't want this,' and we have been looking at the issue since. I am happy to admit that it is taking a long time and it is taking too long. I am hoping to make some announcements in the next few weeks about where we will go with that issue. I think the opposition need to make clear whether they are supporting the Podger recommendations, the recommendations that were taken out of a review conducted under their stewardship. Are they saying they think that should be the military superannuation scheme for this country? The opposition also should have a think about what they are doing with the superannuation governance bills that are heading towards the Senate. The improvements and efficiencies that will be made by that new system will mean real dollars in the hands of military superannuants in the years to come, if we as they retire. Depending on the circumstances of the individual-their rank and their length of service-the lump sum under the MSBS that they will receive towards the end of their career will be between an additional $20,000 and $50,000. When this parliament has the opportunity to provide people with those sorts of benefits I do not think we should be playing politics with issues of symbolism-and that is what it is. I think that, when serving personnel on the bases around this country understand what the implications of the action being taken by the opposition are for their final payments, they are not going to be real happy. I do not think they are going to think that is a good or fair way to go. On the question of British nuclear test participants-one of the key issues covered by this bill-I want to put on the public record that we are talking about compensation, pensions et cetera being in the region of $24 million over the next four years. I also need to put on the record what that means in the longer term. We estimate on the basis of the age profiles of the people involved and their expected longevity that, although it is $24 million over the first four years, it will be some $71 million over the first 10 years. Beyond that, over 20 years, it will be in the gion of $135 million. There is significant compensatory support to be paid out over time, as is the system under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I commend the bill to the House. I urge the opposition to concentrate on criticising what we actually have done rather than what they say we promised to do when we never, ever did so.

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA NA AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Ms Macklin: That this bill be now read a second time.",62
23,Mr ANDREWS,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010. This bill is designed to align legislative arrangements relating to child care, particularly those relating to payments. Firstly, the bill aligns child support pay income estimate periods with financial years rather than child support years. Essentially, this changes the period over which income estimates are reconciled from 15 months to a financial year. This will ensure greater accuracy and effire- ciency as it is a simpler process to assess taxable income at the end of the financial year. This will also reduce delays in the automated reconciliation process. Secondly, the bill will align care determinations under both the family assistance law and child support legislation. This amendment will allow parents or carers who are recipients of family tax benefit and who are paying or receiving child support to have the same care determinations made for a child in the case of a child having multiple carers. Thirdly, this bill also allows for payments of family tax benefit to recipients who have not lodged their tax returns in the hope of having a lower accessible income to be cancelled. This will allow parents or carers who are entitled to FTB and also child support payers or payees to have the same care determinations made for a child where the care of the child involves more than one carer. This payment will be based on their adjusted taxable income. The coalition has a proud history of child support policy. It was the former coalition government that established the Family Law Hotline to enable Australians to access information and advice about family law and child support issues. It funded a child support strategy that was aimed at improving post-separation relationships and encouraging parents to maintain contact with their children, which, evidence shows, will increase the likelihood of child support liabilities being met. It let payers with second families claim 100 per cent of child support paid as a deduction from the household income used for determining family tax benefit and the childcare benefit entitlements and increased the family tax benefit income test deduction for child support paid by nonresident parents with a subsequent family. It was also the former coalition government that offered unemployed parents who had a child support responsibility access to community based parenting and relationship support services. When relationships break down and children are involved and where parents cannot agree on what support should be provided, our child support system plays an important part in ensuring that appropriate support is provided. If the government were serious about helping families and resolving disputes quickly and amicably, they would not have cut $50 million from family relationships centres and marriage counselling services in this year's budget. But Labor did just that. Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, has demonstrated that the government is genuinely disinterested in families when it comes to ensuring smooth and efficient dispute resolution. For example, the government has decided not to replace four judges in the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court, placing unnecessary pressure on the judiciary, meaning that family law matters will now take even longer to get to court, let alone to be resolved. The decision to cut almost $50 million from the Family Relationships Support Program is one to be deplored. In the budget papers the Treasurer announced a $4.5 million slashing of funding to marriage counselling in Australia. What was not in the budget papers, but was revealed in the next 24 to 48 hours, was a further slashing of $43.9 million to the family relationships centres. As my colleague here at the table will recall, these family relationships centres were established by the previous governmentMr Hartsuyker-And very important too.",62
24,Mr ANDREWS,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"and were very important centres. I think there were about 65 of them throughout Australia, set up with the intent of providing a place where families having disputes and problems or issues with their relationship could go to a one-stop shop for assistance. They could obtain advice, information and assistance in relation to those disputes with a hope that reconciliation of the difficulties might be achieved and, where reconciliation could not be achieved, to at least conciliate rather than litigate the outcome of those difficulties. The problem with this sneaky decisionsneaky because it was not announced on the budget night and was not in the budget papers but we found out afterwards-to slash $43 million from family relationships centres is that the very centres, the very organisations, the likes of Relationships Australia in the various states, and Centacare and Anglicare and other similar agencies around Australia, charitable and voluntary agencies that are providing excellent services to Australian families, will have less funding to provide those valuable and important services to Australian families right throughout Australia. As I said, it is something to be deplored and condemned and it is hard to understand why a government that routinely has used the phrase ‘working families' in its rhetoric would actually pull funding out from the very services that provide support for families right around this nation. There has been no explanation as to why that has been done. As I said, it is regrettable in the circumstances. The coalition support legislation that makes the interface of citizens and government departments and agencies simpler. We support aligning legislation in the areas of child support and family assistance to make life easier for parents and carers. Because of that, we will be supporting this bill.",63
25,Mr HAYES,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Werriwa) (12.37 pm)Family bonds are the link to our own being and, as a guide to our future, we rely on families a lot. As I have said in this place many times in a range of different debates, there is also no doubt about the cost of raising a family-and having three kids myself, and now four grandkids, let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it does not stop when they leave school or university. I guess that is one of the things that comes with parenting. There is a commitment to children because that is what we do, that is innate in us as ents. Without trying to put too fine a point on it, there are very real costs in raising children, with cost pressures associated with a range of different things, from school, to sport, to everything else. Unfortunately, an inescapable fact of life-and this statistic is extraordinary-is that for every, I think, 2.3 or 2.4 marriages or unions there is one separation. That has a real impact not only on the social and emotional well-being of the family but also on the financial aspects of raising children. Having been married now, as of last May-I have got this figure right-for 34 years",63
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,Congratulations.,64
27,Mr HAYES,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I could give you the date too, but I won't! My youngest son has been through a separation and I know the impact that has had emotionally on both sides and I know the effect on my granddaughter. It is something that involves the whole family and it is inescapable that people are going to look internally and externally for reasons. But, at the end of the day, we need to provide for the child. That is what this legislation we are debating is about-putting the child front and centre in all this. It is about encouraging parents to settle their disputes, to make sure that first, second and third in their thinking the proper raising of their child. That is what we are attempting to do. We are not trying to say that we are removing the emotional and financial stresses. We are trying to put a better balance in place that will at least allow the parties to address the real issue at stake, and that is providing support for the child. It is not uncommon for each of us as members of parliament to hear some very tragic stories when people come to our offices. Many of them are pretty emotional when they see us. We are the last port of call. par- In my electorate of Werriwa alone there are 11,000 kids on child support. We have to be pretty positive that we are making sure those kids in my electorate, and kids in the same situation in everybody else's electorates, are given the best opportunity so that they are not scrounging and will not be apologetic for life about coming from a separated family. We have to make sure that they are able to participate and feel included in a normal life as a child. This is what we are trying to do. As I said, parents have to learn to sort out their problems as maturely as they can, and I know that it is often somewhat difficult. But we must focus our arguments and our attention on what we deliver for these young people who are going to go on to become the Australians leading this country in the future. Responsibility does not just start and stop with the parents. We need to focus their attention on the cost factors associated with the child and we want to make sure that they are reasonably met. The bill before us, the Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010, will do a couple of things. Firstly, it will introduce amendments making rules easier for separated families by implementing the 2009 budget measure aligning care determinations between family assistance and child support. is The Child Support Scheme aims to ensure that children receive the appropriate level of child support from their parents. Conversely, to assist with the costs of raising children, many parents receive family tax benefit. Under the current arrangements, the Family Assistance Office and the Child Support Agency use different rules to determine the care levels for child support and family assistance, and this creates inconsistencies and unnecessary duplication of processes and decision making between both agencies. Under the current rules, where there is no alignment, parents may not receive their correct assessments unless they separately notify each agency. Unquestionably, this can put additional strain on separated parents who have to deal with two agencies and two different sets of rules. As a consequence, there can be numerous elements of inconsistency. To address this, the bill makes amendments to provide for a single determination of care for both child support and family tax benefit purposes. Aligning the determinations of care will provide consistency in decisions about the level of care being provided by separated parents who have to deal with both agencies. Another advantage expected is that this will reduce objections and appeals flowing from the separate determinations in the two agencies. To those parents I have had to have discussions with on this, I say that the government is listening, is taking these account and is trying to make it easier for them to balance their arrangements and finances and to do what they need to do in making provisions for their children. The bill also makes improvements to the process of estimating income for the purposes of child support. To determine their child support obligations, some parents estimate their income. The estimate is reconciled with the actual income earned and various corrections are made to ensure that the correct amount is being paid. Currently, when parents estimate their income to calculate their obligations under the Child Support Scheme, it is for a child support period of 15 months. This period can cross over up to three financial years. It comes as no surprise that estimating income over multiple financial years can be difficult for parents and often leads to inaccuracies. As a consequence, debts and credits can accrue. Often, reconciliation cannot occur until the parent's actual income for each financial year is known. We are therefore introducing measures that will help align these child support periods directly with financial years. This measure will make it easier for parents to estimate their income, which will be automatically determined with the filing of your tax return. This will mean that people will not have to wait until the end of their child support period before making adjustments. When you submit your tax return at the end of the year, the estimate will be automatically reconciled and this reconciliation can be taken into account in making any necessary adjustment. I can confirm that these amendments will not affect the length of the child support period, being 15 months, but they will make the adjustment process more practical and will allow it to occur automatically, as I said, with the filing of the matters into income tax return. Lastly, there is a minor amendment to family assistance provisions. The bill excludes two circumstances from the provisions that prevent family tax benefits being paid if tax returns have not been lodged. This amendment will put in place more flexible arrangements for the 2008-09 budget measures, which have applied since January of this year, 2010, to suspend fortnightly tax benefit payments for recipients who have not lodged tax returns and who have a family tax benefit debt as a consequence of not filing those returns. The budget measure was designed not to punish people but to encourage family tax benefit customers to lodge their tax returns to ensure that they receive accurate payments and, as a consequence, to reduce the incidence of overpayments. It was a measure that was recommended following the 2007 Australian National Audit Office report and one that is made more flexible by this legislation. I know this suite of amendments will not remedy the issues that arise for young people when relationships tragically break down, but what we are trying to do is to make sure that the loving products of those relationships, the children, have a fair stake in their life ahead. We are trying to encourage parents not to use children as weapons in protracted disputes but rather, in a loving way, to make sure that their children are put first and foremost in a way which provides for their future. I commend the bill to the House.",64
28,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010 and I am glad to have the opportunity to address the issues that it raises. The Child Support Scheme, as we know, was first introduced over 20 years ago by the Hawke government. It was implemented to ensure that separated parents share the cost of raising their children, subject to each of their financial capacities to do so. The system was, however, subject to heavy criticism over many years at a variety of different levels. It was subject to confusion, to misunderstanding and, in some cases, to misuse. Many parents felt that the child support formula was unfair and, whilst parents could understand the need for a system that looked after children, they felt that the system in place did not in some cases give them a fair go. For instance, many parents felt that it did not take into account the often large costs that were incurred by the non-custodial parent when the children were under their care. The 2003 report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs entitled Every Picture Tells a Story found that, of the 597,000 families who had a child with a natural parent living elsewhere, 41 per cent received no child support, 42.3 per cent received cash child support and a further 16.3 per cent received only in-kind child support. In the report of the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support entitled In the best interests of children-reforming the Child Support Scheme, a number of issues were identified. For instance, the report found that, under the fixed percentages that were paid in child support, it was assumed that people across the income range spent the same proportion of their income on children. However, the research of the task force found that, while the higher the household income the more parents spent on their children in dollar figures, expenditure actually declined as a percentage of their income. The report also found that, in setting the percentages paid in respect of children regardless of their age, the scheme did not adequately reflect the much larger cost of caring for teenagers, which was estimated at two to three times the cost of caring for younger children. The report also found that the system in place at the time did not take into account the issue of parents who had started new families with children and the extra associated costs that those children brought to their lives. These were just a few of the issues raised. There were many more. In response to the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support, the system was subject to a major overhaul between 2006 and 2008 to provide a fairer and more flexible calculation of child support. A key element of the reforms was the development of a new formula to calculate how much child support would be paid by using an income shares method, which calculates and shares the costs of children between the parents according to their share of the combined income. Currently, approximately 1.1 million children are supported through this scheme. The amendments put forward by the government aim to build on the recent changes already made to the system. Firstly, they allow for the implementation of the 2009 budget measure of aligning care determinations between family assistance from Centrelink and from the Child Support Agency. This will create simpler rules for separated families. Currently, the Family Assistance Office, which covers Centrelink and Medicare, uses rules to determine care levels for child support and family assistance that are different to the rules used by the Child Support Agency, creating inconsistent processes and decision making between the two agencies. Under current arrangements, where the rules between the Family Assistance Office and the Child Support Agency differed, many parents did not receive their correct assessments unless they notified each agency separately. It would be fair to say that many separated families undergo the strains of tense and acrimonious circumstances. Many members in this place, including me, can attest that very strongly. The fact that parents had to deal with two different sets of rules under the agencies created additional strain within these families. This need not happen. These amendments will make a single determination of care for both child support and family tax benefit purposes, thus removing the acrimony that can be created by separate decisions. It is expected that it will also reduce the number of objections and appeals that are lodged as a result of the two different minations from the two agencies. Therefore, it has the added bonus of saving Australian taxpayers money-money that was spent unnecessarily on appeals-through simple clarification of the system. Secondly, the amendments will correct anomalies that occur where parents estimate their income. Some parents estimate their income, and this estimate is reconciled against their actual income to ensure that the correct amounts have been paid and received. Under the current system, parents can estimate their income for a period of up to 15 months. This period has the potential to cross over into three different financial years. Understandably, where this means that parents have to estimate income over multiple financial years, it can easily lead to inaccuracies in their estimates. One of the outcomes of these amendments will be to align estimate periods with financial years, thus making it easier for parents to estimate their income. Once their actual income is known, it will allow the Child Support Agency to reconcile the estimate automatically. These amendments do not affect the length of the child support period, which will remain at 15 months. However, they will change the period over which the estimates are reconciled from 15 months to a financial year. Thirdly, the amendments will put in place more flexible and fairer arrangements where two fortnightly payments are ceased for parents who fail to lodge tax returns. Following recommendations in a 2007 Australian National Audit Office report into the reduction of family payment debts, new rules were introduced to encourage family tax benefit recipients to lodge tax returns in order to ensure that they received the correct amount that they were entitled to, thus reducing overdeterpayments. These amendments will retain those arrangements. However, they are also more flexible in that they will allow payments to continue in circumstances where people do not have a family tax benefit debt, or where the cessation of payment would cause hardship. There will also be the provision to suspend the loss of entitlement of family tax benefit where special circumstances apply. This measure is to target certain vulnerable sections of society, such as those affected by severe illness, domestic violence or bereavement. These measures build on and strengthen the comprehensive changes previously made to the child support system. The amendments make many improvements, particularly in the area of the estimation of family income. We are hoping, in fact we are planning, they will make the system fairer and more flexible. As other members have said and as I wish to say as well, this system will probably never be perfect for the reason that, with legislation and this area of public policy, probably more so than in any other area, we are dealing with human nature and intimate family relationships at a level that who are in those relationships can understand. It really can be a very difficult and very fraught area of public policy. The intent of these amendments and the intent of the legislation generally is to ensure that children in families where separation does occur are at the centre of the argument, the discussion and the debate, and that their ability to be cared for is uppermost in all of our minds. I know from the experience I have had in my office with some very difficult cases the lengths that people of both genders have gone to in the past to avoid their responsibilSo ity or to use the situation to pay back for some relationship issue they have had in the past. Where children are concerned, that cannot be countenanced. Where this legislation is concerned, everything we are doing is to put in place as safe and as secure a system as we can to allow the CSA process to work for the benefit of the children and the families concerned. I commend this bill to the House.",66
29,Mrs IRWIN,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"In what may be my final speech in this House, I wish to make a few remarks reflecting on my close to 12 years as a member of this parliament and express my thanks to those who have made my time in this place memorable. In my first speech in November 1998, in a parliament which would see Australia and the world entering a new millennium, I saw my challenge in a quotation by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who on her graduation expressed this thought: … for too long now, our leaders have used politics as the art of the possible. And the challenge now is to practise politics as the art of making what appears impossible, possible. this That is not an easy challenge, you would agree. On the same day as I made my first speech, the newly elected member for Griffith, now our Prime Minister, quoted only those Keynes's well-known remark: The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slave of some defunct economist. The member concluded: Debate, therefore, about fundamental ideas … about the proper role of the state in the economy and society, is critical to an informed discussion about policy. it is with some sadness that, when I reflect on my years as a member of this parliament, I note there has been little achieved in this place in addressing these challenges. Indeed policy-whether it be economic, social or foreign affairs-is increasingly framed within a straightjacket of orthodoxy. Think tanks, academics, editorial writers and radio shock jocks all sing from the one song sheet, all the slaves of some defunct economist. They cast a long shadow over governments and, it seems, this parliament. When I was first elected to this parliament, I had already been a member of the Australian Labor Party for more than 30 years. I have been described by some journalists as being the outspoken member for Fowler or ‘old Labor'. I wear those comments as a badge of honour. I believe that there are, as the title of the well-known Ben Chifley pamphlet declared, things worth fighting for. I saw my role as carrying on causes that so many former members had fought so valiantly for. I am one of the few remaining members who began their political life in what was Labor Youth Council in the late 1960s. Its leaders then included Paul Keating, Laurie Brereton, Bob Carr and Leo MCLeay. While we were on opposite sides of the factional aisle in those days, Leo proved to be a great supporter and friend during my earlier terms, and I thank him. Along with Michael Lee, those people held the soul of New South Wales Labor, and I believe Michael might have proved to be a fine Labor leader in time. I should also mention Labor's leader for most of my time here, Kim Beazley. On three occasions I walked proudly with Kim to caucus ballots, and each time he lost. I half expected Kim to ask me not to walk with him anymore, as I must bring him bad luck-so for that, Kim, I apologise. To my mind, Kim Beazley was the greatest Labor leader never to have become Prime Minister. In my time here, my spirit has not always made me friends on either side of this House, but I believe it has earned me the respect of those who I hold in high regard, especially Senator Steve Hutchins, who has made that very long journey from the Senate to be here today, and that is all that matters to me, Steve. On issues such as drug addictionespecially drug law reform-unemployment, single parents and refugees, I, like the Member for Kooyong, have not been afraid to take up the cause, even when doing so has not been in line with the popular view. And then there is Palestine. It could be said that foreign affairs matters are not often debated in this House, the Iraq War being one exception and the short debate on my Middle East peace motion in 2002 being another. The the nature of that debate explained why that issue is rarely discussed in this parliament. Even the 2006 war on Lebanon did not raise more than a ripple of concern. It seems that the our reluctance to participate in real debate about the Middle East has placed a muzzle over the parliament on all foreign affairs issues. A large part of the work of backbench members is their work on policy committees. I have had the opportunity to serve on a number of committees which have conducted inquiries into issues of great concern to me. I mention some of the inquiries which influenced me and which I believe have produced reports addressing some of the most important issues facing Australia today. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration report entitled Not the Hilton, which was tabled in 2000, reviewed migration detention centres at that time. The report raised concerns about conditions in migration detention centres and recommended improvements. However, unfortunately, in the wake of the Tampa incident and the so-called ‘Pacific Solution', it seems that most of the committee's recommendations were thrown overboard by the Howard government. My longest committee experience was with the variously named committees on family and community services, and my friend Annette Ellis, the member for Canberra, chairs the current committee. The social policy area has always been my main focus in public life, and this committee conducted a number of inquiries which covered some of the thorniest issues faced in our ciety. We began in my first term with an inquiry into substance abuse. As the oftendescribed ‘drug capital of Australia'Cabramatta-was in my electorate, the issue was of vital importance to me. As with later inquiries, there were widely different approaches to the problem of drug abuse as well as a great deal of common ground. Not surprisingly, I found myself contributing a dissenting view on some parts of the final report tabled under the title, Road to ery. The next inquiry was into the controversial area of child custody. With the member for Riverina as chair, the inquiry made forthme right recommendations on shared parenting and other custody issues which, thanks to the continued advocacy of the chair, have since been included in legislation. Other inquiries included overseas adoption and balancing work and family. Again, in the last inquiry, along with my Labor colleagues, a significant dissenting report was included. In terms of winning and losing on the many issues confronted, I would have to say that I have lost more than I have won, which has brought some of my friends and some people in the media to award me the portfolio as the ‘minister for lost causes'. Perhaps because of my record, or in spite of it, I appointed as the first Chair of the Petitions Committee, which was established in this term of the parliament. You could say that I have found my spiritual home, along with my deputy chair, a man of integrity, Russell Broadbent, the member for MCMillan. I have certainly found it to be the most rewarding of my many roles in this place. In guiding the committee in its formative years, I have attempted at every opportunity to make the committee a sounding board for the people of Australia in this parliament and to welcome public participation in the parliamentary process. I am very pleased with the proso- gress we have made and I look forward to the many potential developments in the petitions process which can enhance our parliamentary democracy. The other role of members of this place is their work in the electorate. Having worked in electorate offices since 1975, I have seen the value of this part of a member's duty. In assisting me to represent the people of my electorate of Fowler I have had the benefit of a loyal and dedicated staff. As I frequently recov- remind them, it may be my name on the door, but we are all part of a team. I have been fortunate to have had long-serving staff, including Joy Petrovic, who has been with from the beginning. Joy has assisted constituents efficiently and sympathetically as well as keeping me organised-and she has had to on many occasions-in times of acute chaos. I wish Joy and her husband, Petro, well in their future life with their family in Cairns. Margaret Brindley, also known by us as ‘Have a chat', is the heart and soul of the office, whose political knowledge has been invaluable and whose service to constituents has been outstanding. Rocco Leonnello's knowledge of the electorate, assistance with community groups and advice have been second to none. John Alam has ably supported me, particularly in Canberra. I promwas ised him when he started with me two years ago that it would not be boring-and I think I have delivered on that front, John. Pina Violi, my relief staff, was thrown in at the deep end when she started but has been quick to learn, in spite of the political culture shock. Others who have given so much of themselves in the past include Justin Lee, the wild man of my office and an adviser of the first order, and Dean Superina, who has always been a calming influence. Last but not least, Grahame Hungerford, who was with me for nine years, brought a touch of creativity as well as nitpicking correctness to the task. Grahame could be lovable, although infuriating at times, but he was dedicated and loyal to the end. All have shown great understanding and empathy with our local community and I could ask for no better support than I have had from all my staff in my years in this parliament. I should at this time add my thanks to those on the other end of the phone-the parliamentary liaison officers in the various government agencies, in particular, Immigration, Centrelink and Veterans' Affairs. Probably the most rewarding aspect of my work has been the small personal victories won on behalf of constituents, sometimes against an unfeeling bureaucracy but more often simply by putting a case on behalf of people who did not have the experience or resources to do so themselves. In an electorate such as Fowler, where economic and social disadvantage are more commonly found than in most parts of Australia and where too often people are not aware of their rights or are afraid to press their entitlements, I have always been proud to speak out on their behalf and felt especially receptive to their concerns. In such a diverse community as Fowler, community organisations have a special role to play. I am proud to have been associated with the ex-service organisations in Fowler-‘my boys', as I call them-at Canley Heights RSL, Liverpool RSL and Cabra-Vale exservices, and I specially mention the boys at Bonnyrigg Men's Shed. Indigenous and migrant community organisations have been crucial in developing the greater community of the Fowler electorate. Vietnamese, Chinese, Italian, Croatian, Serbian, Lebanese and so many other community associations and religious bodies provide the pillars for integration in our greater Australian society. I have been pleased to work with these organisations to benefit our local and national progress. To my loyal ALP branch members go my sincerest thanks for their loyalty and support, for their patience and for their assistance. They are too many to mention by name, but let me acknowledge two people: Sid Hugen and Joan Windsor, whose wise counsel and staunch support over the years have been much appreciated. Without the support of the people of Fowler, my role here in this esteemed chamber would have been all the more difficult. It has been a singular honour to represent them, and I trust that my representation has played a small part in helping them to fulfil their aspirations. After 11½ years as the member for Fowler, like many other members. I could say that I have never stayed in one job for this long. For me that has meant travelling to Canberra from my home in Sydney. Considering my work as a staffer since 1990, that is now 20 years of driving down from Sydney. I can say that the road has improved quite a for bit in that time, and I think at times I could almost make the drive with my eyes closed. But I am fortunate in that for the last 10 years I have had the hospitality of Anne and Michael Gardiner to look forward to on my arrival. I have come to feel a part of the Gardiner family and I have been privileged to share in their lives. As a member spending 20 or more weeks a year away from home, being able to spend some time with an ordinary family while in Canberra has kept me in touch with the real world, something that other accommodation would not have provided. While family are only a phone call away, it is always more comforting to have warm and caring people like Anne and Michael with whom one can share the ups and downs of each day of parliamentary life. Another part of my extended family in Canberra-and I will mention them-have been the Comcar drivers. Always courteous and always friendly, they have helped me get off to a good start to each sitting day and seen me safely home after a hard day's night, as well as kept us all in touch with the real world in, I will add, a most discreet way. The same can be said of the attendants and security staff here at Parliament House. When you think of the time we spend locked away in here during sitting weeks, it would be impossible to endure if it were not for friendly smiles and happy remarks of those staff. And I would especially thank the dedi- struggle. cated clerks and committee staff who make it all possible. If I have caused committee staff some angst over the years by insisting very strongly on making dissenting reports, they certainly showed no outward signs at the time. And if I may, through you, Mr Speaker, make my peace with the chair for my many lapses in decorum. Mr Windsor-No!",68
30,Mrs IRWIN,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Yes, I am apologising! I do not know if I hold the record for female members of this House-I may share the record with my friend and my mentor, the Hon. Janice Crosio, former member for Prospect-for the number of occasions of being sin-binned during question time, and possibly two or three times being asked to leave for 24 hours. But I assure you, Mr Speaker, that this morning-and you are going to be very, very proud of me-I finally did take the trouble to read standing order 94 and I can now see what all the fuss was about. And having said that, can I thank speakers past and present for the many indulgences I have been allowed over the years and in particular today. Which leaves me with the other 148 members of the House, friends and foes alike. As has been said before, not all the foes are on the other side of the House and not everyone on this side can be counted as a friend. Can I say to the friends, and they definitely know who they are, I thank you for your friendship and support over my years in this place. And to those friends who will go on to the next parliament, can I offer the tribute made by Les Haylen-a man I have had discussions with for many years, along with his son Wayne-in his book Twenty years hard Labor: the To my mates in Canberra, the ones who saw clearest, fought hardest and suffered most in the Mr Speaker, there is one other group that I must thank: my family. Unlike Petro, I am leaving this until the last. When I look back over what now seems a short time, I have seen my children, Rebecca and Blake, grow into adulthood, complete university and establish their own homes, and I am so proud of them. I have been blessed with two beautiful grandchildren, Liam and James Hunt, and I lost my beloved father, Alan Welsh, in 2006. Family life goes on regardless of what happens here in Canberra. With my mother, a true believer, a life member of the party, Lois Welsh, and my sister, Helen del Gallo, I have known the love, support and comfort of a very, very close family and I have been sustained through the highs and definitely the lows of life as a member of parliament by the love and support of my best friend, my husband, Geoff. Those members fortunate to have a loving partner will understand the bliss at the end of a sitting week of returning to a home-cooked meal and a chance to shrug off the mask of life in Canberra. Thanks to Geoff I have been able to return for another bout, refreshed, rearmed and ready for another battle. While there is much that I will miss in Canberra, I am looking forward to the role finally of being a full-time wife, daughter, sister, mother and grandmother. Mr Speaker, like Hillary Clinton I have not made the impossible possible, but I have definitely given it my best shot. I do leave this place with my heart bruised but it is definitely not broken, my spirit tested but not bowed and I leave with my integrity intact.",72
31,Mr BIDGOOD,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"To be or not to be a federal politician: that is question. Why? Because it is the road less travelled as a career path. There are very few people who can truly relate to the experience. In fact, when I came to Canberra for the very first time in my life in November 2007 as the elected member for Dawson, I was told that I was the 1,020th federal member of parliament to be elected in 107 years of Federation. I recognise the honour and the privilege that was bestowed upon me by the 45,000 people who voted for me in that historic Rudd Labor election win, with a swing of 16.9 per cent and a two-party preferred vote swing of 13.2 per cent. Labor won the seat of Dawson for the first time in 32 years. I consider it to be the greatest political honour and achievement in my life. This would not have been possible without the dedication of the rank-and-file membership of an active volunteer base of the Australian Labor Party and union movement in the seat of Dawson. So what is it that inspires a man or a woman to aspire to this office, where so many are called but so few are chosen by the people? For me, it was the passionate conviction in my heart for social and political change in our society and workplaces to improve the lot of everyday working people. All politicians are driven people. They are focused, determined and single-minded, and some, dare I say it, are ruthlessly ambitious. Their souls burn with conviction. What drives me is the passion to fight injustice wherever that occurs, whether it is in the workplace or the home. It may be the worker who is being victimised because they are speaking out for better workplace health and safety, or asking for better wages and conditions. That is why I am so proud to be part of this historic Rudd Labor government that said it would scrap Work Choices, and we fulfilled and delivered that promise to the the people of Australia. The good news for the workers of Australia is that this Rudd Labor government has saved you from unfair dismissal laws; this Labor government has saved your long service leave from being scrapped; this Labor government has saved your sick pay from being abolished. We can say with proud conviction that this Labor government has delivered to you, everyday working Australians. The global financial crisis revealed corruption and bad trading activities overseas which resulted in global capitalism being put into crisis and in meltdown around the world. This, in turn, had a knock-on effect in this country. Thankfully, the people had a Labor government who had as its priority the protection of everyday jobs for people. We were engaged in an economic stimulus package, and that would not have happened under a conservative Liberal-National Party government. They would have let the anarchy of the free market rip and shred over 200,000 jobs. They would have explained it away as merely a market correction. This government has a totally different view. We intervened when capitalism went into crisis, and we stepped into save those jobs from being lost. I believe in grassroots democracy, and that for me means being on the street meeting people outside newsagents, video stores, post offices, fish and chip shops and in the marketplace. During the election campaign it meant getting up at 5 am every day, being out at 6 am and standing outside the local newsagent, 7 am standing at a busy intersection greeting the early morning traffic and then, at 8 am, I would fulfil my duty as a single parent doing fifty-fifty child care, take my kids to school. I am proud to say I totally kept my commitment to my children during the whole electoral campaign, from April 2006 through to November 2007, as well as during the past 2½ years as a member of this parliament. It is not easy being a member of parliament and a single parent. I know there are a small number of people on both sides of this House who really know what it is like. Two of my three children are in the gallery today-Zoe, who is nine, and my son, Jade, who is eleven. Jazmin, who is 14, could not make it today as she has had exams this week. My children are the most important people in my life, and I will always love and be proud of them. I love their straightforward and ruthless honesty. Being a member of parliament also puts a huge strain on relationships, nerships, family life and personal time. Political life has caused a rollercoaster of tions for my partner Davina, and I want to thank her for her love through all the highs and lows over the last four years. I want to thank Brendan Greenhill and Lee Webster, a great couple who housed me at Curtin in their spare room. These good friends of mine I knew in Bowen before they moved to Canberra just before the election. They have truly given me a home away from home; a real brother and sister who looked after me with wonderful hospitality. Another good friend and brother who has been there through all the rough and tumble of this job is the member for Blair, Shayne Neumannyou are a good man, and I will deeply miss your company and our long political, religious and social conversations. There was never a dull moment! I would love to name all 34 of my Labor colleagues in the class of 2007-but time is of the essence! So I wish to have the whips list of new Labor members' names and phoand tos included in this speech. Perhaps I will table that. I am proud to be with you in history as helping to form the Rudd Labor government. Each and every one of you has so much potential, talent and vision to serve the Australian people. Thank you for all your friendship and support. I want to acknowledge the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the full cabinet and ministers in their commitment to grassroots democracy demonstrated by bringing the federal cabinet to Mackay in June 2008. That was a historic first for the city. Also I want to acknowledge the three other visits in this term of government by the Prime Minister as well as his three visits during the election campaign. The people of Dawson know you take the contribution of the region and its value to the bottom line of the nation's partwealth very seriously, compared with the previous Prime Minister who visited only emoonce in 11 years. I can say with confidence to the Prime Minister that your sacrifice of time has borne fruit and it is widely appreciated in the community that this government has delivered for the people of Dawson. Funding for Dawson includes, for example: roads $350 million, including $50 million for the southern approach to Mackay and $95 million for the port access road in South Townsville; health, $6.1 million for brand new training facilities for dental care at the base hospital in Mackay and a new clinical training facility at the Mater Hospital; and education, 2,022 computers for secondary schools across Dawson, $121,247,926 for the Building the Education Revolution, with 278 individual projects across Dawson, and $9,376,617 for trade training centres. In May 2010 the Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard-who I think has done a fantastic job-visited the nearly completed TTC for the Mackay Christian College-Carlisle Christian CollegeWhitsunday Anglican cluster. There is also a state cluster made up of Mackay North, Mackay High, Mirani High, Pioneer High and Sarina High. This project is in danger the Liberal-National Party form the next government. There is no guarantee for that cluster. For training and TAFE, there is $2,645,000 for the Mackay TAFE Training Infrastructure Investment for Tomorrow program, and $2,630,994 for Better TAFE Facilities Program projects in Bowen, the dekin Cannonvale and Mackay There was funding for community infrastructure: $4.9 million for Mackay Regional Council, Whitsunday Regional Council and Burdekin Shire Council; there was $742,727 under the National Bike Path Project for the Whitsunday Regional Council. Under Caring for our Country there was the Reef Rescue package worth $15,106,424 in 2008-09 and 2009-10. That is delivering for the people Dawson. There was the Better Regions program. There is more! There was $8.8 million for the Mackay Stadium; $4 million for the Bluewater Lagoon; the Australian Mining Innovation Centre based in Mackay is worth $14 million. For social housing, there was $24,496,692 for 82 new housing units and 281 units to undergo repairs and maintenance. I am proud to be a part of this government's increases in pension payments-the best in 100 years. These increases, following on from 2009, mean that total pension payments for those on the maximum rate, including base rate and pensions supplement, is $701.10 a fortnight for singles and $1,057 a fortnight for couples, combined. This represents an increase of around $100 per fortnight for singles and around $74 a fortnight for couples, combined, in pension payments as a result of the government's increases and indexation in 2009. Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, has done a fantastic in delivering for the pensioners across the whole nation. To all my electoral staff, I say thank you for all your work during very difficult times, if particularly during the Mackay floods in February 2008. We had only just moved into our federal office in December 2007 and then were completely flooded out. We moved into my house and operated from a spare lounge room for three months. Then we moved to The Dome Shopping Centre in Bur- Mackay's CBD before finding permanent accommodation in November 2008. It was an incredibly disruptive and stressful first year. No-one should underestimate the problems it caused on many different fronts. I still have all the same staff. None of us had worked in a federal office before, and I can tell you that we are now all older, wiser and greyer. I put on record thanks to government services based in Brisbane for all their help of in re-establishing offices we could work from. I also thank all parliamentary staff in this building and thank the Comcar drivers for their professionalism in helping MPs do their job. I thank Roger Price, the Chief Government Whip, for his wisdom and advice over the last 2½ years and all the executive for their support. I, James Bidgood, federal member for Dawson, can stand here today with my hand on my heart and truly say I made a promise to deliver for the people of Dawson. The Rudd Labor government and I have delivered over $600 million to the people of Dawson in 2½ years-more than was delivered in the previous 2½ years of the conservative Liberal-National Party government. The only way for this to continue is for the people of Dawson to vote Labor in the upcoming election. I totally endorse Mayor Mike Brunker of the Whitsunday Regional Council who is the new Labor candidate for the seat of Dawson. I am proud to have established a Labor job legacy in the seat of Dawson, and long may it remain a Labor seat into the future. I have passionately served with all of my heart, soul, body and mind. I have given 110 per cent, and I thank the people of Dawson for the honour of serving them.",73
32,The SPEAKER,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"During the member for Dawson's contribution he sought to include material in Hansard. There were no dissenting voices, so I take it that leave was granted. However, that might be a challenge to the Speaker's guidelines for incorporation, so, given the intent and the generous spirit of the member for Dawson, leave will be granted for the documents to be tabled and they will form part of the parliamentary papers.",76
33,Mr NEUMANN,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I will speak briefly in relation to the Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010. The organisations which impact on Australians the most in terms of services are Centrelink, Medicare and the Child Support Agency. These government agencies impact on people's lives by providing financial support, providing care, reimbursing people for their health costs, and providing assistance at times of loss of economic security through the loss of jobs and at other times. Making sure that there is alignment in relation to these great government organisations is absolutely crucial to ensuring that we deal with Australians consistently and decently. We need to make sure that they have access to all the information and financial support that enables them to meet their family's needs, pay for their household challenges and get the kind of health care and assistance that they richly deserve in the Australian community. We want to make sure that they have the kind of help that allows them to clothe themselves, house themselves, educate their children and make sure they have jobs and job security. These are vital for the needs of average Australians. The bill makes amendments to implement our budget measures. It lines up care determinations between the Family Assistance Office and the Child Support Agency; it makes improvements to estimating the income for the purpose of child support; and it makes some minor changes in relation to family assistance law to exclude two circumstances from the provisions that prevent the payment of family tax benefit on the basis of an income estimate if the relevant tax returns have not been lodged. Since coming to office the Rudd government has been diligent and determined to deliver significant reforms across a suite of areas, particularly in areas of pension reform. The member for Dawson talked about the very significant pension reforms-the largest pension rises and the biggest change in the 100 years of Australian Federation. We have substantially increased assistance to carers for those with a disability and in the House of Representatives we have legislated for Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme. These things make Australia's systems of help for families better and simpler. It is a real scheme that we believe will make a difference in people's lives. Those opposite have failed to assist Australian families, whether it is in the area of paid parental leave, the area of social security and pensions, or whether it is in the area of child support and other sorts of assistance. We have provided enormous assistance. The Child Support Agency was a reform of the Hawke-Keating government back in the late 1980s. For a long time before thatdecades before that-the child maintenance systems in this country were inadequate. When I was practising as a family lawyer all manner of child maintenance was avoided by both mothers and fathers at various stages. You had to end up taking cases to court on behalf of clients who were not being paid, often without legal assistance. It was a really difficult set of circumstances. Enforcing those orders were very difficult and costly for people in time, effort and money. The Child Support Scheme, for all its failings, faults and foibles, has taken us forward. It not without difficulty or problems. It interfaces with people at the coalface. Most people do not get charged with criminal offences, most people do not involve themselves in fraud, most people do not have contract breaches, most people are not injured in car accidents and most people do not face the litigation system in this country. But many people end up separating from their partners and spouses, and child support becomes a real thing of them. The child support systems in this country say very clearly that parents have a primary obligation to support their children and provide for their proper needs from reasonable and adequate shares in the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of both parents. It is stated very clearly in the Child Support (Assessment) Act. Similar words are used with respect to the care of children in the Family Law Act. Indeed, in section 3 and section 114 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act the act says that there are extra duties and responsibilities and that parents have a primary duty to maintain their children. If people are unhappy with the outcome of the decision that is made with respect to child support, they can always seek internal reviews and they can rely upon section 117 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, which sets out the grounds for departure orders. They can undertake internal reviews and then look at the SSAT and the Federal Magistrates Court for further justice if they feel they have been hard done by. The legislation here makes the interaction between the family assistance provided to people and the child support arrangements more consistent. In determining people's child support obligation some parents use an estimate of their income and that estimate is then reconciled against actual income to make sure the correct amounts are paid or received. Also, if they are not happy with a is child support assessment and a feel that their income is 85 per cent of or less than the actual estimate, they can, under section 60 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, request the Child Support Agency to look at it again. We have made changes in this regard in terms of the estimates and the reconciliation. The measure in schedule 1, which talks about child support income estimates, will make it easier for people to estimate their income and allow the Child Support Agency to reconcile the estimates automatically once the actual income is known. The amendments do not amend the length of the child support period, which remains at 15 months. The amendments only change the period over which an estimate can be reconciledfrom 15 months to a financial year. That makes sense, because most people look at their budgetary arrangements on a financial year basis. There are also changes with respect to percentage of care. This implements a 200910 budgetary measure to create simpler and clearer rules for separated families. We know that the Child Support Scheme aims to provide adequate levels of child support, which of course is used to meet children's needs. But there is also assistance given with family tax benefits, which help parents pay for their costs of raising their children. Currently the Family Assistance Office-that is really Centrelink and Medicare-and the Child Support Agency use different rules with respect to determination of care levels for child support and family assistance. Those care levels are always difficult and problematic, and often discussions with respect to these matters take place on the doorstep of courts and also in lawyers' offices, at mediations and arbitration, at conciliation conferences and at Family Relationship Centres. The reconciliation and removal of inconsistencies and unnecessary duplication is a good thing. The amendments make plain it is to provide a single determination of care for both child support and family tax benefit purposes. There are some amendments, too, with respect to schedule 3, as it deals with more flexible arrangements with respect to details concerning family tax benefits. That follows a recommendation of the Australian National Audit Office in a report concerning the reduction of family payment debts. This second change will have some benefit, because there are people whose personal and financial circumstances are such that they are vulnerable and are open to challenges. Dealing with separation is really hard. They do not always think of Centrelink and Medicare changes or electoral enrolment changes or child support issues. I was a litigation lawyer practising in ily law for more than 20 years before I came to this place. People do not always think as clearly as they should or as they would normally think when they separate and are facing circumstances that they never thought they would face. Often they are affected by illness, domestic violence or other circumstances which cause them not to think clearly. Anything that makes the situation better for them or makes their circumstances easier with respect to family tax benefits is good thing. Flexibility, simplicity and clarity are important for them in those circumstances. The member for Menzies had a go at the government about family relationship centres and other types of assistance that we are viding within the family law system. But the member for Menzies did not talk about the great initiatives that the Rudd Labor government is undertaking in these areas-the extra $154 million that is being given to ily law services, particularly legal aid services, for people who are facing child support issues and family relationship breakdowns. The previous government-the Howard government-gutted legal aid in this country. They came up with a ridiculous artificial distinction between Commonwealth matters and Commonwealth persons. The Rudd government is seeking to address the failures of the previous government to invest in legal aid, providing for Indigenous people and those with family law or child support needs in a way that the Howard government never thought to do. It is providing additional legal aid and putting a greater emphasis on family dispute resolution, particularly with the new civil dispute resolution bill implementing recommendations made by the National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Council. There is also a greater emphasis on mediation, particularly the use of family relationship centres for property and famspousal maintenance matters, with very few exceptions. The member for Menzies is simply not correct when he criticises the Rudd government's commitment to alternative dispute resolution. We have improved access to justice with this bill. That was a budgetary measure. The Commonwealth contribution to legal aid services across the country now totals over $1.2 billion, far more than the Howard government ever had the wisdom, a the wit or the will to undertake. We are putting a huge amount of resources into making sure that there is access to legal services in rural, regional and remote areas through providing additional funds. The previous government should stand condemned for its failpro- ure to provide adequate legal services. In Ipswich in my electorate of Blair, we are giving additional assistance through Centrelink; Commonwealth, state and local government services; Job Services Australia; fam- disability employment services; and education providers. Community welfare organisations are going to join Centrelink to provide improvements in services for disadvantaged job seekers. We are one of four locations across the country which will host this initiative. They will be wraparound type services-a local connections-to-work program, providing disadvantaged job seekers with access to justice. This will be all at one tion, providing the kinds of services that will deliver for all of us and deliver for those who are disadvantaged, helping with financial assistance advocacy, housing, employment, health services and education as well as giving advice on child support and family assistance, which is the topic of this legislation. This is important reformist legislation. Those opposite would not do it. Those opposite failed on legal aid, they failed on child support and they failed in providing these integrated services. It is up to the Rudd Labor government to do that which is necessary to help those in need.",76
34,Ms MACKLIN,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (1.49 pm)-in reply-I thank those who have contributed to the debate on the Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010 and particularly recognise the previous speaker, the member for Blair, because he has considerable experience in this area. His contribution to the debate has been very valuable, as is his advice on child support and other family law matters. The bill contains three measures affecting the family assistance law and child support legislation. All measures are largely administrative and are designed to make government systems easier for families. Firstly, the bill includes a measure from the 2009-10 budget that will align care determinations in the child support and family assistance systems. This will simplify administrative decision making, making life easier for separated families. Current rules allow for two different care percentages to be determined for the same child in child support and family assistance. This amendment will provide for a single determination of care that applies across both systems, bringing consistency locaand reducing administrative complexity. Secondly, the bill amends the income estimate process under the Child Support Scheme. A number of parents provide an estimate of their income to assist in determining their child support obligations. To make sure that the correct amount of child support has been paid or received when actual income is known, the amount is reconciled against the estimated income. This amendment will align estimate periods with financial years and is intended to avoid inaccurate estimates, which can occur when parents are providing estimates for multiple financial years. It will also allow automatic reconciliation against tax returns, speeding up the reconciliation process. This will also help improve the accuracy of child support calculations to make sure that the correct information is used. Lastly, the bill contains amendments to the family assistance law to provide greater flexibility in dealing with family tax benefit non-lodger debts. This will amend rules introduced in January this year that allowed for the temporary suspension of fortnightly family tax benefit payments where a person has not lodged their tax return more than 18 months after the end of the financial year. These amendments will give the secretary the discretion to determine that the rules that will apply in special circumstances and to clarify that, where there is no outstanding family tax benefit debt due to the failure to lodge a required tax return, the new provisions will not apply. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",79
35,Ms MACKLIN,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (1.53 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Stephen Smith: That this bill be now read a second time.",80
36,Mr TRUSS,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"This Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2010 underlines yet again the sheer administrative incompetence of the Rudd Labor government. It breaks at least four specific election promises. It is another botched program that shows this government's complete lack of understanding that what business needs most is certainty. In 2007 the Labor Party promised before the election that it would revitalise the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. It said it would increase the maximum grant by $50,000 to $200,000. It would allow the cost of patenting products in the international marketplace to be treated as an eligible export marketing activity. It would allow approved regional not-for-profit economic development bodies, including tourism bodies, which promote Australian exporters to access the scheme. It would lift the maximum turnover limit of eligible applicants from $30 million to $50 million. It would cut the minimum threshold of expenditure by $5,000 to a $10,000 minimum. It would extend the limit on the number of annual grants from seven to eight annually and it would replace the list of eligible services provided in Australia with a negative list which means all services would be considered eligible unless otherwise specified. The Labor Party said in its election platform: These sensible changes will revitalise and update the EMDG and will assist businesses, especially small businesses, to break into the export market. The program will be more accessible, especially to businesses in the service sector and those based in regional areas. I can recall debating these issues at the Lowy Institute with the then shadow minister for trade, the current minister, when he outlined the importance of all of these measures and promised Australian exporters that there would be a much more generous EMDG scheme in the future. This bill breaks four of those commitments. One, the negative list for items to be covered, was never even implemented. So, in effect, almost all of the Labor Party's pre-election promises to the tradie sector and almost all of the reforms that the government promised to make to the EMDG scheme are being reversed in this legislation. The scheme will largely go back to the scheme that was in place before Labor came into office. They said they would make substantial reforms. The reforms have not worked and now Labor is reversing those changes. This bill will reduce the maximum grant from $200,000 to $150,000. It will reduce the maximum number of grants available for an individual recipient from eight to seven. It will cap intellectual property registration expenses at $50,000 per application. It will increase the minimum expense threshold from $10,000 to $20,000 and it will increase the eligibility income limit for members of approved joint venture consortia from $30 million to $50 million. If we go back through these listed changes, the government in this legislation is reducing the maximum grant from $200,000 to $150,000. That is precisely the size of the maximum grant that the previous government had in place and that the government said it would change. They have decided to reduce the number of grants available to an individual recipient from eight to seven. The number of grants available under the previous government was seven. They are increasing the minimum expenses threshold from $10,000 to $20,000 and that is a specific reversal of the commitments that the government has made. It is indeed a humiliating backdown. The government is returning the scheme largely to the one that they inherited. All of the specific changes that the government said it would make are being reversed. The EMDG scheme operates by reimbursing eligible enterprises for 50 per cent of the cost spent on specific export promotion activities above a threshold. The scheme has been capped at $150 million per annum since 1997 and through the forward estimates except in 2009-10 when a $200 million cap applied. Labor knew that its changes to the EMDG scheme would cost more money but it only funded an amount for an increase for just one year. There was no additional funding provided in the long-term even though the government knew that a more generous scheme would inevitably cost more. So that they could allow for better refunds in 2007-08, there was some top-up funding in that year. That was a top-up for payments under the scheme of the previous federal government. So Labor knew that the scheme was more than exhausting the funds that were available. They promised additional grants and additional benefits but, in reality, did not offer the money that was going to be necessary to fund those benefits. Because this is a capped scheme, it meant inevitably therefore that thousands of small businessesexporters-did not get the export market development grants that they expected-and had a right to expect-on the basis of the rhetoric of the government before the election.",80

72,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the announcement this morning by mining company Xstrata that it has suspended $586 million of current investment in two major mining projects in Queensland as a result of his great big new tax, putting at risk total capital investment of over $6.4 lion and 3,250 jobs in regional Queensland. Given the statement of Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, who said, ‘This is no longer of war of words; this is causing real pain to Queensland families,' and given Xstrata's statement that neither of these two projects would be viable if the new tax were imposed, will the Prime Minister now listen to these warnings and dump this tax before any further damage is inflicted on the Australian economy? Why did the Prime Minister gutless out of fully debating this issue, first in response to me and second in response to the member for Kennedy?",89
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The last part of the question is ruled out of order.,89
74,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, this is such a matter of national importance to the opposition that their stated matter of public importance today is about the government's failure on people smuggling. Those opposite, frankly, speak again with two voices on these matters. The Leader of the Opposition, come the end of each sitting week, feels the need always to move a censure-and not just at the end of a sitting week; in fact, according to my numbers, every third day on average since he has been Leader of the Opposition there has been a censure, a suspension or some other parliamentary device in order for the Leader of the Opposition to assume the dispatch box. I also say in response",89

77,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The first thing I would say in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question is: this government will not be inbiltimidated by any statements by any mining company anywhere. This government will not be intimidated by the statements of any mining company, foreign or domestic. This government does not stand here as the puppet of parts of the mining industry, as those opposite do; this government stands here to act in the national interest on behalf of all Australians.",89
78,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,89
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,89
80,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Out of his depth!,89
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Flinders is warned! He might have been a bit unlucky, but he filled the vacuum. I simply say: for the next short period of question time could members try to show a little bit of respect for each other. The Prime Minister has the call.",89
82,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition's question also went to the impact on jobs. I find this remarkable from the Leader of the Opposition, who has resolutely opposed any form of stimulus in the economy, which has created 225,000 jobs in this economy. Had we followed the prescription of those opposite, we would have had 200,000 more people in Australia out of work. So, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to stand on his feet here and speak sanctimoniously about his concerns for jobs, I would ask him to reflect on his own party's record on the question of how we responded to the global economic recession. That is the second point. The third is this, and it goes to the particuissues lar statement put out by Xstrata this morning: it is passing strange that, when we have a new system which was announced just one month ago, we have 12 months to go before draft legislation and we are 24 months away from the start of a new system, a company of this nature would issue a statement of this type. Furthermore, in relation to the particular project at Wandoan, I add the following: under the proposed RSPT, first of all, such a project would have been eligible for a 40 per cent tax credit on its investment-that is the first point. The second is that coal royalties payable to the Queensland government would have been refunded. Furthermore, when it comes to the use of the tax credit, that becomes available to the company irrespective of whether it is generating a profit or not. This stands in stark contrast to the royalty system, which is a crudeMs Julie Bishop interjecting",89
83,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition seeks to interject again, I presume in the national interest.",90
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should learn to cease interjecting and the Prime Minister should ignore her.,90
85,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition always interjects in this place, with enormous credibility! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, each time she opens her mouth, is in fact greeted with the shaking of heads on the part of all those behind her-and we know the reasons why. This set of taxation arrangements replaces a royalties regime which is a crude instrument applied only to, firstly, volume and, secondly, revenue. In response also to the question of the Leader of the Opposition, he should also pay attention to the fact that it is our understanding that there are a number of other existing impacting on this particular development, concerning the feasibility of rail access, port infrastructure and power supply. My understanding is that these issues have not been fully resolved. I conclude my answer to the Leader of the Opposition by saying this: we on this side of the House stand for the national interest; we do not stand here as the instruments of Clive Palmer or anybody else. I would say also to the Leader of the Opposition that Clive Palmer's intervention in this debate yesterday was to make the remarkable statement that the minerals in the ground do not belong to the Australian taxpayers. This is the individual, Clive Palmer, who is the major contributor to the Liberal National Party in Queensland; he is the major contributor to the conservative parties in Queensland. He seems to also dictate the policy position of those opposite-and he stands in this capital and says that these resources are not owned by the Australian people. That is wrong. Those opposite obviously believe that this  stand for the national interest, not for the sectional interests of an individual mining company, foreign or domestic. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, in response to the Prime Minister's claim that Xstrata are being untruthful, I seek leave to table the Xstrata statement issued earlier today. Leave not granted.",90
86,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister explain how the national accounts reflect the consequences of strong economic management, and why it is important to continue to reform for the future?",91
87,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Franklin asks a question about the strength of the Australian national economy. The strength of the Australian national economy depends fundamentally on strong economic management in the national interest. But can I also say in terms of the strength of the government's economic performance that we have been underpinned by a resolute prosecution of the need to stimulate this economy during the global economic crisis. The national accounts yesterday demonstrated that we had a 0.5 per cent increase in growth in the March quarter. We see commentary also from others in the last 24 hours about the key role of stimulus to keeping the Australian economy afloat. Chris Caton from BT has said: … that stimulus has kept the economy afloat. Scott Haslem, the chief economist of US, said yesterday: Traditionally economic growth has been split 8020 between the private and public sector. Over the last year it was 60-40 in favour of the public sector as the private sector struggled. The bottom line is this: public sector stimulus was absolutely fundamental to keeping this economy out of recession. That is the bottom line. Notwithstanding that, many families and small businesses across this country are still doing it tough. The Liberal and National parties made the very wrong call on stimulus last year. They said that stimulus was not necessary. They said that stimulus should not occur. They said that stimulus has been misdirected. Economy Opposition members-That's a lie!",91
88,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice their interjections whereby they object to the accuracy of what I have just said. I would draw their attention to the following statement by the now Leader of the Opposition. First of all he said, and I refer to his comments from last year: … all of the money that they are spending, it's not going to stop us going into a recession. Wrong. Second statement: It's not going to stop the recession being long and deep. Wrong. And I would argue that the recession will actually be worse in the long run because of the measures that they've taken. Wrong, wrong and wrong! So said the Leader of the Opposition. That was his prescription for economic policy. He then went on to say, ‘One of the reasons why we have opposed the $42 billion cash splash is because it is not the right way to go about stimulating the Australian economy.' If you are not going to use money to stimulate the Australian economy, what are you going to use? Is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that if you do not use money to stimulate the economy then you are going to use a rousing speech, some comforting words or perhaps a form of Viagra to keep the economy going? I would say that it is axiomatic: if you are going to stimulate the Australian economy, you invest finance to stimulate the economy. But those opposite recommended a different course of action. The Leader of the Opposition, who has no interest in economics, whom the former Treasurer Peter Costello said he would never appoint as a treasurer of Australia, has said that the one model we should have followed was that of New Zealand-five consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. The Liberals and Nationals were absolutely wrong on the response to the global economic crisis, and it is time admitted it. Furthermore, there has been a debate in this place about the government school modernisation program. I would quote what the Macquarie Bank economist Ben Dinte has said specifically about this. On 2 June he said, ‘Much of the 0.5 per cent expansion in the Australian economy in the first quarter of 2010 was the result of significant government spending on education building projects.' In other words: it is not just stimulus at large, it is also the investment of school projects in particular that has kept the Australian economy afloat. On the question of the school modernisation program, it is very important to listen what those opposite have been saying on this. The Leader of the Opposition has said that he intends to slash the quantum of the investment in the school modernisation program. That is what he has said. He has been backed in that by the member for North Sydney, as the shadow Treasurer, to slash the quantum of the investment in the school modernisation program. But today we have another voice: the member for Sturt. The member for Sturt answered a question by saying, ‘We believe the infrastructure spending in schools'-this is the member for Sturt, this is what he said-‘is wise and sensible, and we will keep the infrastructure spending in schools if we are elected in a couple of months.' Then he is asked this question by the journalist, ‘In that quantum as well?' So says the member for Sturt, ‘In that quantum, as we've said all along.' So we have the Leader of the Opposition saying that he is going to slash the quantum of investment in the Building the Education Revolution program, and now we have the member for Sturt saying they are going to keep the quantum of investment intact. What all this points to is once again that those opposite have been absolutely loose with the truth. The truth is, they as articulated by the Leader of the Opposition, he is going to slash and burn the school modernisation program, and what the member for Sturt has tried to do is paper stack over that. The contrast between us on these questions is very, very basic. We stand for responsible economic investment; they stand in support of a strategy which would throw Australia into recession. We stand for supporting jobs through the recession; they stand for casting hundreds of thousands of people into unemployment. We stood for taking the measures necessary to keep the Australian economy and the retail sector afloat; they would have consigned hundreds to of thousands of people across those sectors into unemployment. We stand for the Building the Education Revolution program; those opposite stand for slashing that program. We stand for returning this budget to surplus in three years time, three years ahead of time; those opposite refuse to nominate the date at which it will be returned. The purpose of keeping the economy strong is as follows: to deliver a fairer Australia for all Australians, and that means being able to deliver on three sets of tax cuts for working families, being able to deliver a new health and hospital system for working families, being able to deliver the biggest increase in the age pension for working families, being able to boost the investment in our nation's infrastructure and skills for the future of the economy. But fundamental to all of the above is of course tax reform, making sure we take our current strengths and reform the economy for the long term. That is what underpins the long-term economic strategy of this government. We believe, and argue passionately, that a profits based regime for the future taxation of the mining industry is essential. That is government policy. Interestingly, it is also the policy of the member for Wentworth. The member for Wentworth has re-entered the fray. Malcolm Turnbull says: The miners have been arguing for years that royalties should be levied as a share of profits as opposed to a percentage of gross revenues or ume of production of order. Mr Laming-Yes, sit down, supermouth.",91
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Bowman is warned.  ter has been going for eight minutes. He could not possibly still be relevant to the question he was asked.

91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Gippsland is warned. The standing orders are silent on the length of answers. Members should read Practice in full, because Practice might not be silent. This is another matter that perhaps the House, through the Procedure Committee, could have a look at at some stage. The Prime Minister is relevant to the question, and I had a feeling that he was coming to a conclusion before the interruption with the point of order. I give the call to the Prime Minister with that anticipation.",93
92,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, because part of keeping the Australian economy strong lies in continued reform. That is why we are seeking to reform the economy and boost investment in skills, in infrastructure and in productivity, and also to prosecute a program of regulatory reform across the Australian economy. Part of that reform is tax reform, and part of tax reform is mining tax reform. That means a system which is based on profits, not volume, and profits, not production, as was confused by the Leader of volthe Opposition the other day, and as I notice the former Leader of the Opposition backs in his remarks today and the member for Goldstein backed the other day as a rational way to impose a tax regime on mining projects, as has occurred with the offshore regime since the introduction of the petroleum resource rent tax in the mid-1980s. We stand, therefore, for the continued reform of the Australian economy, to keep our economy strong. Those opposite, it seems, have one attitude to economic policy and that is it-simply to abandon the field and take up the sectional interests of elements of the mining industry. Budget",93
93,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, the mining company Xstrata has today announced that it will suspend the $6 billion Wandoan coal project, near Roma in my electorate of Maranoa, which will put an immediate stop to $170 million worth of current works and see the immediate loss of 150 jobs as a result of this government's investment-destroying great big new tax on mining. Given that the Prime Minister did not have the guts to attend the Minerals Council's dinner last night, does he have the courage to come to my electorate to personally explain why he says his great big new tax is so good for the town and the region? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, part of that question was out of order.",93
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In black and white, a lot of the question was out of order because it contained argument, and it gives a title to a program that is argumentative-it is not the official title. Over the last 2½ years I have allowed those things to go through. The element that could be seen as debate about personality is not of assistance within a question, and I rule that part out of order. Reference can be made to the first part of the question; the latter part should be ignored.",93
95,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. I note that the member for Maranoa often stands in this place and speaks of the infrastructure needs for his part of Queensland. I note that the member for Maranoa has stood in this place recently and demanded extra funding for road construction in his part of Queensland. I note that the member for Maranoa is in repeated correspondence with the minister for infrastructure and local government requesting investment by this government in the infrastructure needs of his community. What the member for Maranoa does not do is stand on his feet with integrity and ask this question of himself and the House: ‘And how should such investment in infrastructure be funded in the future?' This government has taken measures in terms of its proposal for an RSPT to provide a delivery of infrastructure investment funding for regional Australia. The member for Maranoa is very good at standing up and posturing in this place about the infrastructure needs of his region but on the other hand providing no solutions in terms of delivery of investment back into his region and the source of revenue which should provide the basis for it. As to the honourable member's question about Xstrata, I refer to my answer earlier to the question asked of me about the company: firstly, the impact of the proposed RSPT on that company through the refund of the royalties that they would otherwise pay to the Queensland government; secondly, the 40 per cent tax credit which has been recommended as part of the proposal; and, thirdly, their ability to use that across the life of the project particularly in its early loss-making years. That is why, for example, editorials across many parts of the country and the world, including most recently in the Financial Times, have said that this in fact is a rational way in which to tax the resources industry of this country and in fact others abroad.

99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney is now warned.,94
100,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for the question, because he appreciates this debate is far more complex than a simple debate about a profits based system for the mining industry of Australia. Our tax reforms are also, importantly, about broadening and strengthening the economy for the future. It is also a debate about those who are up for the hard reforms that are worthwhile in Australia's national interest, and those on the other side of the House who are not up for the debate. It is also about those who always put the special interests of particular groups ahead of the national interest and those who are prepared to take on the major reform for the long-term national interest of Australia. I say that because I actually think Australia is well-positioned to have this debate at the moment. I refer to the overall strength of the Australian economy. We all appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition gets up every morning hoping and praying that he gets a bad economic indicator. All I can say is that he has had yet another week of waiting. We as a community can handle the tough debates. Why shouldn't we take on the tough debate about taxation against the backdrop of yesterday's national accounts? Even though we appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition finds economics boring, I am sure his advisers at least brought the national accounts to his attention yesterday. Let's consider the nature of the national accounts and our capacity as a nation to actually front hard reform. The economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter and 2.7 per cent over the year. Perhaps more importantly, Australia was one of only two advanced economies to avoid recession during the global financial crisis. I also remind the House that the report of the national accounts yesterday very clearly stated-and we should never forget that the opposition leader opposed, every inch of the way, the economic stimulus package of our government-that the Australian economy would have gone into recession, contracted for three consecutive quarters, if we had not taken the decisive action that we did. It is in that context that the member for Leichhardt has appropriately raised the all-important question: how do we assist those local communities who are feeling the pressure of the infrastructure requirements out of the strength of the Australian economy and the importance of the resources sector? That is why this debate is broader than the debate about resources; it is also a debate about broadening and strengthening the Australian economy. I can feel a few visits coming on next week for the Leader of the Opposition. We will have the fluoro jacket and the hard hat, and I am sure he has already telephoned his close mate, Clive Palmer, and said, ‘Mate, mate, mate, can I borrow your Mineralogy jet?'-the largest corporate jet in Australiaand there is no doubt that Clive will be on board and will also be talking about the next round of donations for the purposes of funding the forthcoming election. When it comes to pressures of infrastructure of order. How could this be relevant to the question?",94
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is responding to the question. The minister is well aware that he has to be relevant.,95
102,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It goes to the question of infrastructure and the pressure the resources sector is putting on local communities in Northern Queensland-the pressure on infrastructure, the pressure on the budget and the pressure on the daily lives of workers in these communities. Perhaps when the opposition leader is on the Mineralogy plane next week he could drop into the seats of, for example, Leichhardt and Herbert and actually look first-hand at all the investment by the Australian government in key local infrastructure projects and the pressure it is putting on the Australian economy and the pressure it is putting on the budget. He could go, for example, to look at the $255 million being spent on the Bruce Highway from Sarina to Cairns; have a look at the port access road in Townsville, at $95 million; have a look at the Townsville ring road, at $79.5 million; have a look at the Douglas arterial duplication, at $55 million; have a look at the $150 million for the upgrade of the southern approach to Cairns along the Bruce Highway; and a range of other projects in North Queensland. That is why we are also working with, for example, the member for Kennedy, because we understand the importance of reliability on energy. We are working with him about how we upgrade the grid between Mount Isa and Townsville. We are confident that out of that process we will also get a key commitment to a growth in renewable energy opportunities in that particular area of Australia. This government, unlike the opposition, understands and appreciates the pressures on local Queensland communities because of the resources sector and the expectation of people in those local communities that the mining sector pulls its weight in terms of sharing the huge profit growth they have had out of the opportunities to develop Australia's national resources, which are 100 per cent owned by the Australian community. Compare that approach to the view of the opposition leader. Let's go to what he said yesterday at the Minerals Council lunch: ‘The resources sector is paying a fair amount of tax.' That is contrary to what a range of resource companies are actually saying. They are actually conceding that there is room to pay more tax. He then spoke in opposition yet again to a profits based tax. I referred yesterday to the clear statements by the CEO of the Minerals Council of Australia that they themselves believe that we should be introducing a profits based system in Australia. I will tell you what all this is about: a desire by the Leader of the Opposition to create a class war in Australia. He spelt that out in speech to the Minerals Council of Australia at lunchtime yesterday. The Australian government is going to continue this debate because this is a very important opportunity for us as a nation to put in place a modern tax system, not only of long-term benefit to the resources sector in Australia but, importantly, of long-term benefit to the Australian community. We are committed to getting the balance right between attracting investment in the resources sector and returning a fair benefit to the Australian community. That is why the proceeds of this debate will help the states provide the major infrastructure necessary to continue our economic growth in Australia. I appreciate why the Leader of the Opposition is standing up for special interests in the Australian community. I refer, for example to the donations of Mineralogy to the Liberal-National Party in 2008-09: $400,000 to the federal Liberal Party; the WA National Party, $110,000; the federal National Party, $50,000; the Liberal-National Party, $20,000. Then we go to the archangel of the coalition: a personal donation by Mr Clive Palmer of $280,000 to the Liberal-National Party. That was last year.",95

If you look right across Australia and at the employment performance of the Australian economy over that period of time, we have seen jobs added when they have been lost in so many other parts of the world. A large number of jobs in international tourism, for example, have also been affected by the impact of the global economic crisis. Take, for example, Far North Queensland-the member comes from Queensland: the unemployment rate in Far North Queensland is currently in the vicinity of 12 per cent. One of the factors associated with that is the competitiveness in Far North Queensland of tourism businesses affected by a high Australian dollar. In response to those sorts of factors, what governments can do is to bring down the overall company tax rate for companies competing internationally.

120,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member's question goes to jobs. He asked specifically about jobs in one part of Australia and in one industry. My response goes also to the fact that employment across Australia is generated by many factors, not least of which has been the government's investment in stimulus for the last year and a half. As a consequence of those measures, we have added in the vicinity of a quarter of a million jobs in this country while we have seen jobs being lost right across the rest of the world. Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition interjected before that in fact he had never argued that stimulus was not necessary. I believe I have got his interjection correctly. He said before in an interjection that stimulus was not necessary. I also draw the attention of the House to what the Leader of the Opposition has actually said on this subject. The Leader of the Opposition, who is carefully avoiding the attention of the debate at this moment, said the following: … the economic stimulus wasn't necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession. That is whatMr Abbott interjecting",97
121,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I beg your pardon? The Leader of the Opposition continues to say that he did not argue that the stimulus was not necessary. On 30 March 2010, he said: … the economic stimulus wasn't necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession. ‘Was not' he said",98

123,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Solomon is on thin ice. I am not sure whether there is much ice in Darwin, but he is on thin ice. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: on the widest interpretation of the meaning of ‘substance of the question', the Prime Minister is clearly not being relevant to the question that was asked. I refer you to page 553, second paragraph, and ask him to return to the substance of the question or else sit down as he is unable to answer it.",98
124,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Page 553 goes on to say: In practice the word has been frequently accepted by the Chair as meaning relevant in some way or relevant in part, rather than directly completely relevant. It might be a matter that the procedures committee could address in the next parliament or the parliament after.",98
125,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Groom's question goes to jobs-what generates jobs and what protects jobs-and I am responding to that both for the economy in general and for regions in particular. We have argued in this place that continued positive growth in the economy and in employment has occurred on the basis of stimulus through the course of the global financial crisis. The reason I am engaging in this debate is that the Leader of the Opposition has interjected across the chamber repeatedly that his position has never been one of opposition to stimulus. That is untruthful. That is fundamentally untruthful. The Leader of the Opposition has a very deep problem with telling the truth in this chamber. The Leader of the Opposition said that the economic stimulus was not necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession. We might well ask: was that just said, or was it written down? Guess what? It was written in a speech. Therefore, it is the full gospel truth. It was a considered, scripted, written speech in which he says that the economic stimulus was not necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession. Not only was that wrong in terms of economics but also he has been untruthful today in pretending he never said it. He did say it. That is their position, and it has been consistently.",98

131,Mr HAYES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will remember in future. My question to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation is: how is government stimulus supporting jobs in Australia, particularly in south-west Sydney?",99
132,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. I acknowledge his very important work towards improving community infrastructure in south-west Sydney, such as the upgrade of the F5, the refurbishment of the Campbelltown stadium, the cancer centre at Liverpool Hospital and, significantly, the development of the autismspecific centre at Liverpool. I remember well door-knocking with the member for Werriwa in his electorate several years ago and meeting Julie Darmer-somebody who has been very active in the area of autism. I commend the member for Werriwa for his work. The national accounts that were released yesterday represent another solid outcome for Australia's economy, which continues to be amongst the best in the world at a time of great economic stress. The Australian economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter of this year and by 2.7 per cent over the year. That outcome was strongly supported by continued public investment, which rose 12½ per cent in the quarter to be more than 40 per cent up over the year. This contributed 0.8 per cent to GDP growth. About half of that is attributable to the government's stimulus strategy. The stimulus is gradually being withdrawn as the economy returns to something approximating normal growth. Nonetheless, it is still playing a very signifiThat cant role in supporting jobs. Infrastructure projects are continuing to plug the gap in private building activity, which has been substantial, while stimulus payments to households and tax breaks to businesses have in effect flowed through the economy. There is very clear evidence in the national account figures released yesterday of the critical ongoing importance of the government's stimulus strategy in sustaining reasonable economic growth at a time of global economic challenge and sustaining jobs. The Prime Minister has drawn attention to the statement on 30 March by the Leader of the Opposition. I will repeat it again, just so that people realise the true nature of the position taken by the Leader of the Opposition: The economic stimulus wasn't necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession. This was in a speech amazingly entitled ‘Economic fundamentals'. Anybody who is not bored by economics-anybody who is not innumerate, as the Leader of the Opposition was once described by the former Treasurer, Mr Costello-would read the national accountants and see just how critical the government's stimulus strategy has been. But it is not just the government that sees this as the outcome of the national accounts figures. In fact, the man who I presume the Leader of the Opposition will be enthusiastically arguing to be Victorian Treasurer at the Victorian election, due in a matter of months, shares the national government's view. I quote the Victorian shadow treasurer, Kim Wells, in a statement today, referring to the Victorian figures in the national accounts: The result would have been far worse had it not been for solid consumer and government spending in the quarter, generated by the continued effects of government stimulus payments and programs funded from Canberra. is the Victorian Liberal shadow treasurer, who I assume the Leader of the Opposition will be saying is the right person to be managing finances of the state of Victoria come the Victorian election later in the year. The member for Werriwa asked me about the issues of stimulus and local infrastructure projects in south-west Sydney. I want to refer to the seat of Macarthur and just indicate to the people of south-west Sydney and particularly the people in the seat Macarthur what they stand to lose not just in macroeconomic activity but in local infrastructure if the position is elected to govern Australia. It will be $1½ million for three black spots projects, $1½ million for three local councils for 25 community infrastructure projects, $48.7 million for 212 social houses, $206,000 for repairs and maintenance in social housing and, under the Building the Education Revolution program, $114 million for 141 projects at 59 schools. These are the things that are helping to keep people in jobs in the seat of Macarthur in south-west Sydney and all around Australia, helping to keep growth positive at a time of great economic tribulation internationally and delivering important new facilities for the people of south-west Sydney. These are the projects that the opposition is committed to eliminating. If ever you wanted an illustration of the economic illiteracy, the vandalism and the complete lack of concern for the jobs of working people, this issue tells you all you need to know. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney stand for depression era economics when the government sat back and did nothing and hundreds of thousands of people were thrown on the scrap heap. That is their position. The government stands to protect jobs, to support jobs, by investing in infrastructure at a time when the private sector is retreating, and that is being shown in the national accounts. Australia's economy continues to grow and employment remains reasonably strong because of the efforts of this government. Budget",99
133,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. What job transition and employment assistance arrangements will be offered to mining industry workers who lose their jobs as a result of the government's great big new tax on mining, includop- ing the 60 contractors who have lost their jobs today as a result of Xstrata's decision to suspend the expansion of its Ernest Henry copper mine near Cloncurry in Queensland?",100
134,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I would say to him that, a little like the question earlier from the Leader of the Opposition, for those opposite to now have an interest in (a) jobs and (b) workers rights is very interesting indeed. Firstly, on the question of jobs, I would say to the member for Stirling he should have a long, long hard look at the impact of the government's stimulus strategy on employment in the state of Western Australia. Look at the impact of investments that we are making in the infrastructure of Western Australia in the Ord, prospectively at Oakajee, in the middle of Perth-hospital constructions as well as road constructions, notwithstanding the investment in social housing. There are investments also in the Building the Education Revolution program in Western Australia and the community infrastructure program in Western Australia. These are core contributors to jobs growth in the state of Western Australia. If he looked at the breakdown of the state accounts, and the contributing elements to gross state product within his state, he would reach the same conclusion.  der: the Prime Minister was asked about the employment assistance arrangements for the 60 workers at Cloncurry. We would hope he would answer that specifically.",100
135,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt will resume his seat. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting,101
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is warned. The Prime Minister will relate his material to the question. He understands that he has to and the Prime Minister is responding to the question.,101
137,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member's question went to both jobs and workers entitlements. On the question of jobs, my response to him, being a member from the west, was along the lines I have just described. Those comments equally apply to the impact of the government's measures on stimulus payments in the state of Queensland. I suggest that he also looks at the impact through the most recently released gross state product figures for Queensland and other states to conclude where the actual contribution lies from federal government stimulus investments. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation has just referred to that in the case of the state Victoria and made appropriate reference to statements recently by the Liberal shadow Treasurer of Victoria to that effect. Secondly, on the question of workers' entitlements, I would say this to the member for Stirling, as he cries crocodile tears about workers entitlements and workers rights: workers entitlements and workers rights are infinitely better as a result of this government's change to the laws than existed under the government of which he was part. We had also under this government, through the abolition of Work Choices, made sure that basic conditions for working people and working families were protected, not destroyed-not least of which was protection from unfair dismissal. Those opposite stand for the repeal of the government's protections against unfair dismissal. We stand for the protection of workers from unfair dismissal and we also apply the standard support measures for any worker in this economy who finds themselves unemployed for whatever reasons. This government's policies in support of jobs and in support of measures relating to the conditions of workers and, on top of that, protection from unfair dismissal exists in a legion above and beyond anything ever considered or supported by those opposite when they occupied the Treasury bench. Education",101
138,Ms BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on school education programs, including Teach for Australia, and on any threats to these programs?",101
139,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank for member for her question. I know that the member for Chisholm is very focused on the question of of quality education and quality schools in her electorate and that she is aware, as are many people around the country, of the impact of our Teach for Australia program. This program already has 45 of the best and brightest graduates who have undergone a training program teaching in disadvantaged schools around the country, most particularly in Victoria. It is a great quality program. I know that this program is under threat and I know the member who asked me the question is concerned about these threats. The threat arises because the Leader of the Opposition has said that, if he is elected, he will cut the money allocated to the national partnership program that supports Teach for Australia. This has been welcomed by principals, by people who care about education right around the country with words like, ‘I feel like I have won the lottery to have one of these high quality graduates in my school.' I know that the member for Chisholm out in Melbourne's east has been involved in some community discussions about this question. I know that that community discussion is also continuing in the electorate of Aston. My attention has been drawn to the flyer of the Liberal candidate for Aston, Alan Tudge. I had a good look at it. I was a little bit intrigued when it said that, among his various claims to fame, he had worked at a national level formulating initiatives to give school communities more funding and control. That is interesting. Why is the name Alan Tudge familiar? Then it occurred to meMrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I would refer you to the statement that ministers should not engage in irrelevancies, which include contrasting government and opposition positions, which is precisely what she is doing. I would ask you to ask her to sit down.",101
140,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. The question was in order. The question went to any threats. I have a feeling that something is emerging in this answer. The Deputy Prime Minister understands that she must relate the material to the question.,102
141,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about threats to the Teach for Australia program. I know the name Alan Tudge because he is on the Teach for Australia Board; that is how I know that name. This is the very program that the Leader of the Opposition is a risk I am a person who looks to research things in depth, so I did not stop there with the community flyer. I have managed to obtain the Liberal Party of Australia application for preselection endorsement by Alan Tudge. There is interesting reading on the question of education. I will not be tabling it, because it contains personal details. But I will be making extracts available for all.

There will be no more as for commercial retailers, as for parts of the standing to. orders or anything else. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call. She is responding to the question. She now has the chance to complete her response.",102
149,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On Teach for Australia, in this application Mr Tudge tells us all about his involvement and how valuable it is-the very program that the Leader of the Opposition wants to cut the money from. That shows how erratic that they are and shows how little that they care about school eduction. This preselection election campaign talks about Mr Tudge's claims to fame. It says: ‘I helped develop the popular Investing in Our Schools Program, which was both practical policy and great assistance to coalition members in their individual seats and their local campaigns.' When we on this side of the House invest money in schools, we do it for the benefit of schools, not for the political benefit of coalition members. If you ever need to know the difference between this side of the House and that side of the House when it comes to education, have a look at this document. We are about benefiting schools. Mr Tudge and everyone sitting there are about cutting the money that goes to schools. As revealed by the Leader of the Opposition, they are going to cut the Building the Education Revolution, trades training centres, computers in schools and now this teaching quality money as well-those are the things that the opposition threaten with their budget cuts. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition should talk to Mr Tudge about the benefits of Teach for Australia. But we know that the Leader of the Opposition is a risk to local schools right around the country. Infrastructure",102
150,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to remarks made last night by Sir Rod Eddington, who is chairman of Infrastructure Australia, who questioned the policy-making process behind the government's great big new tax on the mining industry and urged the Prime Minister to dump the tax and start again. If the Prime Minister will not listen to warnings from his principal business adviser, who will he listen to?",103
151,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said when asked about this by the media earlier today, as far as Sir Rod's comment goes on the question of consultation we welcome any commentary from those outside who want to see a good outcome to the negotiations currently underway between the government and the mining industry. Therefore, within that spirit I welcome Sir Rod's comments on the question of consultation. I note however, that this question was asked by the Leader of the National Party and I note that he is not actually bringing into the frame the leading pin-up boy of the National Party in Queensland, Clive Palmer. I know Clive was in town yesterday. It is hard to miss Clive-not just his jet but Clive himself-when he is in town. He made some interesting comments last night, I think. His description, which I presume reflects the position of those opposite, was that once there was Marx, then there was Engels and now there is Rudd. Marx, Engels and Rudd-so there is a communist conspiracy underway. But what I find confounding is this: the Clive Palmer who bankrolls the Liberal and National Party in Queensland seems to make a powerful amount of money from Chairman Mao's China. I say to those opposite that when they seek to invoke the names of various commentators in the debate on the future of the super profits tax it is very instructive to reflect on, firstly, who bankrolls the Liberal and National parties? Clive Palmer. Secondly, who stands up, therefore, and says that these resources are not owned by the Australian people? Clive Palmer. And thirdly, therefore, are those opposite acting in the national interest in their participation in this debate or acting simply as emissaries of various branches of the mining industry? On the question of employment which was raised simply ask you: how could it be relevant when the Prime Minister was asked about Sir Rod Eddington's comments, for him to go into a diatribe about another member for the community, who is not part of this question?",103
152,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am going to have to be very careful or these comments will be misinterpreted. The question went to: if the Prime Minister would not listen to Sir Rod Eddington, who will he listen to? He seems to be indicating somebody that he has listened to. I do not want that to be misinterpreted to but that is where it is at.",104
153,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Elegantly summarised, Mr Speaker, because",104
154,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do not overdo it, Prime Minister.",104
155,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will not be listening to Clive Palmer. I do not think anyone on this side of the House will be listening to Clive Palmer, but I know those opposite will be listening to Clive Palmer because he bankrolls those members opposite in terms of their political parties-$800,000 contributed to the LNP last year alone. On the question of consultation, the government is engaged in a process with the mining industry. That will continue. This is a tough negotiation process but we in the government are up for an exercise of national economic reform. Those opposite are simply acting as emissaries on the part of a mining industry, which the Leader of the Opposition says pays too much tax already. The government's view is this: this tax reform is necessary to deliver better super for working families. It is necessary to bring down the company tax rate for all Australian companies. It is necessary to bring about a tax break for Australian small business and it is necessary, also, to fund the future infrastructure needs of Australia. That is why the government is committed to fundamental tax reform and that is why those opposite are acting purely as the mouthpieces of Clive Palmer as they engage in this debate. Superannuation",104
156,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Human Services and Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law. What will be the impact on the retirement incomes of working Australians if the government's stronger and fairer superannuation reforms do not proceed? How would this particularly affect the communities of outer eastern Melbourne?",104
157,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I also note that there are 46,000 working Australians in his electorate who stand to benefit from our reforms to superannuation. Perhaps it is unsurprising that there are so many people in the electorate of the member for Deakin who will have their retirement incomes boosted by our reforms, because there are 8.4 million Australians across the country who will benefit from our reforms, and there are 3.5 million low-income Australians who will benefit from having their contributions tax given back to them under this government, each of whom stands to lose those benefits if the Leader of the Opposition gets his way. At the moment, the average lump sum of somebody aged between 60 and 65 is $245,000 for men and $170,000 for women. By 2035, as a result of more people being under compulsory superannuation for longer as a result of our reforms, that will increase to $485,000 for men and $345,000 for women. Of course women stand to get a greater proportion of the benefit because females have lower incomes and our reforms are very much targeted at those who need to put more money aside for their retirement: people on lower incomes. The simple fact is that nine per cent of salary and wages is not enough for a comfortable and dignified retirement in Australia. It is a very good starta start for which we can thank previous Labor governments. It was something that the opposition opposed all the way and something that they continued to oppose all through the years of the Howard government. They opposed giving Australians a more comfortable and dignified retirement. The member for Deakin asked me about the impact on outer eastern Melbourne. As I said, the member for Deakin can report to 46,000 of his constituents that they will be better off because of this government's reforms. But the member for La Trobe, who rejoins us in the chamber, will have a much harder task, because he will have to report 52,000 of his constituents that they will miss out on a greater retirement income because of his opposition to our superannuation reforms. He will need to report to 17,000 of constituents aged over 50, who potentially could benefit from our improved catch-up payments for superannuation, that he stands against them getting a more comfortable and dignified retirement. These are people who do not have a private jet with which to fly to Canberra to make their case at the National Press Club. They rely on us to make it for them. At least a little more than half of the people in this chamber are standing up for people to get a better retirement income. A little fewer than half are more interested in defending mining companies than interested in boosting the retirement incomes of Australians. They are lions on behalf of Clive Palmer; they are mice on behalf of working families. They have not a word in response-not a word in defence of the retirement incomes of Australians. So we look forward to the member for La Trobe's next newsletter. He will be explaining to 52,000 of his constituents why he opposes them getting a better retirement income. He could make it a bumper edition. He could explain why he opposes the trade training school at Boronia Heights. He could explain why he opposes the GP superclinic at Berwick. It could be a bumper edition. He would have to rely on all his eloquence to do it, but I am sure he could do it. It is time the Leader of the Opposition gave working families a break. It is time he gave them a tax break for saving through their superannuation. If you asked the shadow minister for superannuation what he thinks about superannuation all he will tell you is what mining companies think. But this is about much more than the shadow minister for superannuation not being up to the job. It is about the Leader of the Opposition thinkto ing superannuation is a con job. He told this House it was a con job. It is about an opposition more interested in boosting their donations from mining companies than boosting his the retirement incomes of Australians. That is what this is about. It is time the Leader of the OppositionDr Southcott- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. I think we have strayed well away from outer eastern Melbourne and to areas which do not even relate to the minister's portfolio",104

159,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Boothby for pointing out that all Australians stand to lose from the opposition opposing our proposals.

165,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to a statement today from Mr Ian Henderson, head of JPMorgan Chase London's $7 billion natural resource fund, where he says that he has: … reduced our Australian exposure … It's been a wake-up call frankly. I had not thought that the changes in Australia would be quite as drastic as they are proposed to be. He goes further in relation to the mining tax: It clearly does reduce the attractions of developing new projects in Australia and indeed investing in Australian-based mining ventures… It has made people aware of the potential for these industries to be used as milk cows by governments. That has altered the risk profile for the mining industry probably for quite a long time. Does the Prime Minister still think that his great big new tax on mining is going to grow investment and jobs in the industry?",106
166,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say to the member for North Sydney that he should spend some time reading the Treasury's analysis through the independent modelling contained in the Econtech report on the impact of (a) the overall growth in the mining industry and (b) employment in the mining industry. As far as employment in the mining industry is concerned, Econtech's independent analysis says the implementation of these reforms will result over time in a 7.7 per cent increase in employment in the mining industry. Furthermore, the member for North Sydney goes to comments from third parties. Can I draw his attention also to the comment of the former head of the Minerals Council, David Buckingham, who said that reactions to the mining tax proposal to the government have, quite frankly, been ‘hysterical' and: Apoplectic responses of that kind simply don't help the cause in any realistic way. Budget Furthermore, I draw his attention to a former Liberal Treasury spokesman and a former Liberal leader in this place, John Hewson, who has also come out in his attacks on the scare campaign which has been launched against the government's RSPT. I draw the member's attention also to the support for the government's proposals being delivered by the former leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, John Brogden. I draw his attention to the statement by",106

Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked the Prime Minister about a company that has reduced its exposure to Australia's industry",106
169,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The question was very open-ended, about whether the PM does stand by his position.",106
170,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney's question went specifically to the impact of the government's measures on the growth of the mining industry and on employment in the mining industry. I sought to answer both those things by reference to the government's modelling contained in the Econtech government report. The member for North Sydney simply leapt to the dispatch box in order to make a separate political point himself. Mind you, I say that it is pretty interesting in this debate that the Leader of the Opposition seems to be rationed to one question a day these days. Perhaps that is because there has been some concern on the part of the member for Sturt about the, shall I say, demeanour of the Leader of the Opposition in this place. Can I say in response to member for North Sydney's question, given that he does ask all the questions on the economy-as the Leader of the Opposition seems to have been banned from asking any questions on the economy, because the Leader of the Opposition is bored by questions on the economy and is regarded by the former Treasurer as being innumerate on questions of the economy-that there are multiple third parties in this debate, many of whom have supported the government's RSPT proposal. Many of them have contributed to Australian newspapers in recent times. Many of those views have been reflected in international journals as well. I would draw again the member for North Sydney's attention to the editorial contained in the Financial Times only earlier this week. It said specifically: The charge that it turns Australia into the “number one sovereign risk issue”, made by Tom Albanese, chief executive of Rio Tinto, is Furthermore, the Financial Times said: It will be a long-overdue update of the medieval practice of levying royalties on gross production. Being regressive, royalties squeeze marginal producers while letting those with the most abundant mines keep the largest share of their loot. I draw his attention to that editorial. Editorials in the Financial Times are not written lightly. They are written on the basis of a considered analysis of all the contending views and all the contending analyses. What those opposite are doing at the moment is what they always do: engage in a fear campaign-a fear campaign on the resources tax, a fear campaign on the emissions trading scheme, a fear campaign on asylum seekers. All they actually do in the public policy debate is engage in a fear campaign, because that is what the Leader of the Opposition is an expert at doing. We always hear opposition from the Leader of the Opposition; we never hear him propose anything. We hear negativity all the time, never positivity. We hear him stand opposed to everything the government puts forward. We never hear him propose anything, except one thing and that was his own great big new tax on everything. Having gone onto the Neil Mitchell show and sworn hand on heart that there will be no new taxes under the Liberal Party which he led, what did he do one month later: he jacked up the tax two per cent on all companies in the country with a turnover in excess of $5 million. Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition: on the question of the economy and why I presume he has been sin-binned by the member for North Sydney and the member for Sturt from asking any questions on the economy, he would be very well advised to go back to Fundamentals 101 and revisit his earlier statement that this economy could absurd. somehow survive the absence of stimulus over the last 18 months. The illiteracy of the Leader of the Opposition on questions of the economy becomes more apparent day by day not just in this place but right across the country, as he simply does not know how to add up. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the document ‘JP Morgan sells Rio, BHP on Australian tax concerns'. Leave not granted. Infrastructure",106
171,Mr TREVOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Why is funding certainty and consistency in long-term planning important in delivering major road and rail infrastructure projects and are there any risks to these investments, particularly in Central Queensland?",108
172,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question, because he understands that long-term planning and consistency is absolutely crucial when it comes to delivering infrastructure into regional Australia. But, of course, we know that consistency is not the coalition's forte. They say one thing here in the parliament and something completely different in their electorates. Just one week after the budget, on 20 May, the member for Hinkler wrote a letter to the editor of the Isis Town & Country newspaper. He said this: Labor has betrayed local motorists by ignoring the urgently needed Isis River Bridge upgrade its Budget. Wrong! The May budget delivered another $15 million to start the construction on this important bridge this year, money brought forward this year, jobs in Hinkler this yearsomething that could not be achieved by that other mob in their 12 years of government. The member for Hinkler also saidAn opposition member-At least you put the people of Hinkler on notice.",108
173,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is after we provided the funding, you nong-a week after the budget.",108
174,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will withdraw.,108
175,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. In the Isis Town & Country newspaper he also said: I have put the Government on noticethis is one week after we provided the fundsthat I expect to see funds brought forward to have the job done … I will be in Hinkler tomorrow and I put the opposition on notice: is this project on your secret infrastructure hit list? The shadow minister for finance, in a letter to another local paper, said ‘There are still many projects worth billions of dollars in the Rudd government budget which have not started' and he would not commit to supporting any of those projects that are in the Nation Building Program. He has made it very clear, and he confirms it today, that if construction has not started it will be on the hit list. Maybe the $250 million Bruce Highway safety package will be on the hit list. We know that the Roads to Recovery program for every local government in Australia is on the hit list, because he has told the Colac Herald and the Geelong Advertiser. So Bundaberg Regional Council, $7 million in gone; Fraser Coast Regional Council, $6 million gone; North Burnett Regional Council, $7 million gone-and we know that there will be other critical infrastructure cut in Hinkler as well; 841 computers in schools, gone; and over $112 million for 58 schools, gone. We know that over $70 million of the 283 new social housing dwellings will be gone and we know that the trade training centre which is proposed to be built at Bundaberg State High School at a cost of $11 million will be gone. You have got to come clean and be fair dinkum with the Australian people. You cannot tell the electorate that you are fighting for more money for them and come here and be part of a show that is about making all these cuts. The member for Maranoa raised a question earlier on today and it went to the issue of infrastructure and employment in Queensland. The member for Maranoa is quoted in the Toowoomba Chronicle. He wants another $500 million in funding for the Warrego highway. He said: On advice given to me by Main Roads Queensland, $500 million is needed for a full upgrade and I am calling on the Rudd government to commit this funding as a contribution to the state Government's infrastructure plan for Surat Coal Basin. He goes on to say: ‘With critical time lines now in place for local road, rail, airport and housing infrastructure, the Rudd Government' must deliver this. He has given up on his side! He has given up. I say to the member for Maranoa: part of our RSPT proposals is about providing a fund for infrastructure in regional areas. That is what it is about. So you should be voting for it, and I look forward to the member for Maranoa's support on the RSPT. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",108
176,Mr ABBOTT,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah from moving the following motion forthwith: That this House censures the Prime Minister for failing to govern Australia in a way that: (1) takes the nation forward and not backwards; (2) grows our economic prosperity, not risks it; (3) enhances our international reputation as a safe investment destination not trashes it; (4) keeps promises, not breaks them; (5) reduces debt and builds a surplus rather than reckless spending and billion dollar deficits; Kelly, M.J. (6) stands up for our world leading industries, not hides from them; (7) spends taxpayers dollars like it comes out of his own pocket, not throws it out the door; and (8) has the mettle to defend his decisions and not run away; and, finally and most importantly, for the damage that his great big new tax is doing to investment and jobs as evidenced by Xstrata's decision to suspend $596 million of current investment today.

188,Mr ROBB,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, yesterday in this House in response to a question the Minister for Transport made accusations about me which were quite erroneous. The minister said: … the shadow finance minister when asked how he would fund roads said that he would use Roads to Recovery funding-a big woops moment from the member for Goldstein. He went on with that sort of drivel. What I actually said in the paper was: Unlike the Labor Party, we are not in the business of ripping up contracts and let me make it perfectly clear that this project is not under threat, and Mr Fitzgibbon knows this, considering the Howard government spent $110 million on the preliminary stages. I challenge the minister to show where I have claimed anything about Roads to Recovery.",113

191,Mr TRUSS,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2010 talks about the assistance provided to Australian exports. In the couple of minutes left before the House adjourns for a week, I want to talk about the importance of mining exports to the Australian economy and in particular how important it is to encourage this industry. It is hypocritical of a government on one side to be claiming that it wants to assist industries to export through the Export Market Development Grants Scheme and on the other side to invent a great big new tax to make mining uneconomic in this country. The Prime Minister must surely be the only person in the world who actually thinks that you make your mining industry more prosperous by taxing it more. The President of Zambia once tried this route to encourage mining in his country, and he quickly realised it did not work-there was no point, he said, in collecting a few million dollars in tax if you lost thousands of jobs in the process. Our Prime Minister has not learnt that lesson. He believes that if you put a tax on alcopops you will reduce consumption. He believes if you put a tax on cigarettes you will reduce consumption. But, if you put a tax on mining, you will have more of it-you will have more investment. Ask Xstrata how much more investment they are going to have in Australia with this great big new tax hanging over their head. Ask the people of Whyalla what is the future of their steel works with this great big new tax hanging over their heads. Ask other investors, like British Gas, who have a proposal to open up coal seam gas harvesting in Queensland, what the future of that investment is, and the $20 billion LNG train in Gladstone. All of that, along with hundreds of other projects in Australia, is at risk, might not proceed, because of this government's great big new tax on mining. Last night the Prime Minister had an opportunity to explain this to the Australian mining industry. But, instead, he ran awayhe went to a function for the centenary of Andrew Fisher's government-a one-term government, I might add. But the centenary was actually three weeks ago, so this function was put on in Old Parliament House so the Prime Minister could run away, not face the mining industry but talk to a few party faithful about events of 100 years ago. Debate interrupted. NA",113

193,Mr LAMING,ADJOURNMENT,"Bowman) (4.30 pm)Facebook is an emerging and powerful tool for local people to communicate with their elected representatives. Just 48 hours ago I wrote to 1,400 local Redland residents, none of whom are aligned to political parties, and asked what they think about Mr Rudd and where Australia is heading-Redlanders having their say. I will read out their words, condensed but not selected in any way. Damien Buckley, 35, Thornlands: ‘Where is my broadband, Mr Rudd? Why am I paying for your campaign advertising, Mr Rudd? Why are you slugging my meagre investments? Why am I paying for illegal immigrants to be kept in motels?' Amy, from Cleveland: ‘ Mr Rudd is turning everything that we want and need to suit himself and not our country.' Emily Wilson, 22, Cleveland: ‘Does “he is a clown” sum it up?' Terri Davidson, 42, Alexandra Hills: ‘Dear Mr Rudd, if you believe you're doing such a great job for us, please feel free to come and live my life, on my budget, and see how much you enjoy the life you are giving us.' Tim Marley, 22, Wellington Point: ‘The young people are watching our Prime Minister waste our nation's money on poorly designed and poorly implemented plans for the future.' Katrina Malone, 39, Alexandra Hills: ‘What happened to Mr Rudd's promise for more support and help for autism?' Anthony Davis, 19, Birkdale: ‘Andrew, can we get cheaper fuel please, because I've got a fourwheel-drive now. I like to get outdoors and have some fun, but I can't afford it on uni wage, which is jack all. Thanks.' Chris Schneider, 28, Thornlands: ‘If only hot air could solve problems. If only rhetoric could find solutions. If only bureaucrats knew how to look after working families. If only dictators could understand the people, Kevin Rudd would be doing a great job.' Anonymous: ‘No substance, policy back-flipping, the bureaucrat is only concerned with what is most popular in the polls.' Bronwyn Hope, Redland Bay: ‘I'm getting tired of constant electioneering and spin. Let's have some substance. Answer a straight question with a straight answer without treating your country like it's full of idiots.' Marie Stuart, 46, Cleveland: ‘I want to see some outcomes and less talk.' Adam Haylock, 24, Mount Cotton: ‘Kevin, why are you letting Anna Bligh take it upon herself to sell Queensland Rail and various other assets that we own?' Sheriden Merrin, 19, Redland Bay: ‘He has a lot of empty promises. He's promised to stop whaling and improve health care.' Anthony Nix, 43, Wellington Point: ‘Andrew, I personally do not think Kevin Rudd is a bad person and he could have been a good Prime Minister. What has let him down is really bad advice and a really incompetent ministerial team. That left him having to lie to regain some type of credibility with the Australian people.' Nikki Palelei, 22, Thorneside: ‘I think Mr Rudd is doing a good job. I didn't vote for him but I'm glad he got the job and say “Well done” to him.' Kieran Ewald, 19, Thornlands: ‘I agree Kevin's doing a good job. I'm glad he is where he is. I agree, though, that I don't like Anna.' Matthew Russell: ‘If you think Mr Rudd's doing a good job, you're living under a rock. Pick up a newspaper and see Mr Rudd's empty promises. One thing you can say to Mr Rudd is: “When will we get our stay in a four-star hotel on taxpayers' money when we come to this country illegally?”‘ Brian Gleeson, 36, Alexandra Hills: ‘ Mr Rudd, if the buck stops with you, as you have stated on so many occasions, why are you still drawing a pay cheque, if your programs have all failed and then cost taxpayers millions to fix?' Clare Jansz: ‘ Mr Rudd, get your head out of the clouds and your hand out of our pockets.' Kate Miller, 22, Birkdale: ‘Stop flicking your hair. It makes you look like a creep.' Rob Spence, 21, Birkdale: ‘I think the great big new tax should be called a get-out-of-town tax.' Nicole Blight, 37, Alexandra Hills: ‘As my two-year-old would say: “Who are you, Mr Rudd, and what are you doing there?' Megan Mothershaw, 27, Capalaba: ‘Don't fail Australia, Mr Rudd. Give us the PM we so desperately need.' Karl Haase, 22, Alex Hills: ‘Kevin Rudd did poorly during the recession and is now trying to make it worse with a resource tax. I don't like either option, but I do not like a resource tax which will kill the Australian economy.' Darrin Hewitt, 44, Cleveland: ‘Stop overpromising and underdelivering.' Anne Howe, 50, Thornlands: ‘It's outrageous that trainee nurses are forced to find tuition fees.' Anousha Gilroy, 20, Birkdale: ‘I think that workplace bullying needs to be addressed.' Darren Skiggs, 40, Victoria Point: ‘Do as I say, not as I do: buy Australian made.' Cheryllea Shooter, 52, Victoria Point: ‘Krudd. What more can I say? His name says it all.' Matthew Pannam, 17, Thornlands: ‘Where is our national broadband, Mr Rudd?' Kurt Henselin: ‘Kevin Rudd is a dud Prime Minister. Get rid of him.' Peta Egan: ‘ Mr Rudd, I don't believe anything you say anymore.' Luke Clifton, 21, Victoria Point: ‘Tell him he's better than Howard, but he still needs to improve.' Dean Bottrell, 21, Capalaba: ‘Another $900 please.' Alicia Anne Black, 29, Birkdale: ‘Why does my three-year-old have to pay for Mr Rudd's incompetence?' Matthew Russell, 21, Wellington Point: ‘ Mr Rudd, you fail at your job. Anyone else would of been fired by now because of your mistakes.' Nic Hansford, 18, Cleveland: ‘Why can't Australia have a 24-hour rail network?' Dean Davison: Mr Rudd, just look beneath the surface and see through your facade of trustworthiness and competency disappear.' Sheriden Merrin: ‘You're all talk and no action.' These are young people in the Redlands having their say. I am sorry, Mr Rudd-this year they will also have their vote. (Time expired) Computers in Schools",114
194,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to talk about a very successful Rudd government program in relation to computers in schools and the threat that is being posed to it by the policies of the opposition. The Central Coast is one of the poorest areas in New South Wales; in fact, I think we have the poorest average family income area in New South Wales. One of the great things about the computers in schools program is that it provided computers to both public and private schools in areas right across the country, and particularly in areas like mine where many of the children going to school do not have access to computers on a daily basis. That is why it has been so important, so popular and so successful. I was talking to the principal of Tuggerah Lakes Secondary College, Mr Andrew Newman. He wrote to me and said: ‘The Digital Education Revolution in New South Wales has been an outstanding success in government schools.' He went on to say, ‘To cease such a successful program would be an enormous backward step that would be opposed by principals and teachers and parents.' This is the principal of the largest secondary school on the Central Coast. He is the college principal of a campus that goes across three areas, and this is what he said about the importance of the Digital Education Revolution. I spoke to him today and he said, ‘Look, you can say that it's not just me as the college principal. I am also the Deputy President of the New South Wales Secondary Principals Council, and that is the view of the Secondary School Principals Council. The digital revolution in relation to putting computers in schools is absolutely vital for the education of kids right across New South Wales and it is something that should be supported. They are terribly upset that the opposition are looking at slashing $700 million from this vital area, which will mean computers will not be able to be provided for many schools.' In fact, in my area-an area that, as I said, is one of great need-over 600 computers would be cut if the opposition's policy of cutting computers in schools was implemented. I will go through the list of schools and the cuts they would suffer. MACKillop Catholic College would lose 66 computers; Wyong High School, 51 computers; Tuggerah Lakes Secondary College, The Entrance campus, 81 computers; Tuggerah Lakes Secondary College, Berkeley Vale, 60 computers; Lisarow High School, 87 computers; Tuggerah Lakes Secondary College, Tumbi Umbi, 53 computers; Wadalba Community School, 68 computers; Central Coast Grammar School, 37 computers; Wyong Christian Community School, 15 computers; and Lakes Grammar, nine computers. Over 600 computers would be cut from my electorate on the Central Coast because of the opposition policy decision to slash and burn in education, announced in the budget reply that was delivered in three stages. In my area, we have youth unemployment of over 40 per cent. In some of my high schools, we have retention rates of less than 40 per cent. In these areas, education is the key to making sure kids who leave our school system have the skills that will enable them to get a job locally. Over 30 per cent of those in my electorate have to commute to Sydney and Newcastle to find a job, yet employers in the area say that they sometimes have difficulty recruiting the right people and they actually recruit people from outside the area. The key to making sure that local people in my area get jobs that match up with the jobs that are being offered by employers-that they are given a chance in life, that we do not condemn a generation of kids to unemployment-is making sure that we make the proper and right investments in education. Part of that is making sure that there proper investment in computers in schools. In my electorate it is absolutely vital that those 600 computers, the ones we plan to roll out under the program, are not ripped away from these kids-that they get the proper facilities and the proper equipment to make sure that they are job ready. We have to make sure that these kids have a future, that they can get employment in an area of very high unemployment. This is absolutely vital. The opposition should be condemned over their decision to cut this program. It will disadvantage kids in my schools and disadvantage kids in my electorate and electorates right around Australia. This slash-and-burn education policy is only going to subject another generation of kids to high unemployment like the 40 per cent youth unemployment in my area. (Time expired) North Sydney Electorate: North Shore",116
195,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"All of us in this House understand the important role that local newspapers play in the lives of the communities we represent. Today I want to reflect on the success of one of those papers, the North Shore Times. I do so because last month the Times turned 50, a considerable milestone for both the paper and the North Shore community in Sydney. The newspaper's golden anniversary is worthy of celebration because the North Shore Times has been the primary journal of record for such a large part of Sydney. In 1960, when its first edition was published, the North Shore was a very different place. The last North Shore trams had stopped running just two years before. The Warringah Expressway was yet to be built and motorists would wind their way from the Harbour Bridge along the Pacific Highway through North Sydney. Most North Shore residents were of Anglo-Saxon heritage, livis a ing in private homes following the urban subdivision patterns of the time. Much of the upper North Shore was still bushland and many of northern Sydney's suburbs were yet to go through the so-called gentrification that continues today. The past 50 years have seen dramatic change, all of which has been recorded by the North Shore Times. That change has mostly been for the better. I think particularly of the many people from different nations, including my own father, who have made the North Shore their home. Our communities are more diverse and vibrant as a result. We have seen the growth of places like North Sydney and Chatswood as major commercial centres and we have witnessed the revitalisation of other suburban centres like Lane Cove and Crows Nest in my own electorate. As with all of Sydney, the population on Times the North Shore has grown dramatically. Many often reflect that it is harder to maintain a sense of community in such large metropolitan areas. Some fear that we have lost the ‘togetherness' that communities bring, that we have become suburbs of strangers. While the character of our communities has changed, I am not so pessimistic. That the North Shore Times has survived and thrived is testament to the fact that people still place a high value on strong local communities. The Times both reflects and assists that aspiration. Every week I see people coming together as a community, be it in the hundreds that attend Chinese New Year celebrations in Chatswood or in the thousands that come together every weekend through local sporting organisations or in the strength of community groups working to protect our local environment or assist those in need. As our region has grown in population, the role of the North Shore Times has become more important, not less. It was Rupert Murdoch's vision that saw the North Shore Times established in 1960. It needs to be recorded in this House that the North Shore Times stands alongside the Australian as one of the two papers that Rupert Murdoch created from scratch in Australia. In fact, the North Shore Times was the first paper he created from scratch in Australia. The Times records in its golden issue that one of its first journalists, Peter Sinclair, holds the original layout for the paper prepared by hand by a young Rupert Murdoch-right down to the size and placement of advertisements in those early editions. Today I thank all of those people that have been involved in the first 50 years of the North Shore Times-its editors past and present, including particularly Mr Ron Bendall; its journalists, many of whom have gone on to bigger and better things in the media over many years; and, importantly for any successful newspaper, those in production and advertising. It says a lot about the whole of Cumberland Newspapers. The current staff, led by the editor Catherine Zuill, reflect the dedication and professionalism that are the hallmarks of good journalism. No-one can really predict what the North Shore of Sydney will look like in another half century, but I am absolutely confident that the North Shore Times will still be there to reflect the triumphs and, occasionally, the disappointments of all of us who call this part of Sydney our home. Newcastle Electorate: Innovation",117
196,Ms GRIERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"In many speeches to the House I often find myself making special mention of innovation in Newcastle, and that is for very good reason. Over the past few years, Newcastle has gained a well-earned reputation as a centre for innovation across a wide range of industries and sectors, reflecting its economic strength and diversity. If it is not a new announcement regarding clean energy or an advance in medical research, it may be a current or former Novacastrian making a name for themselves on the national or international scene. A recent example of that is the appointment of former Director of the Newcastle Regional Art Gallery, Nick Mitzevich, who is now taking up a corresponding role at the still Art Gallery of South Australia, following in the esteemed footsteps of the now Director of the National Gallery of Australia, Ron Radford. For somebody who has only just nudged 40, as Nick is, taking up the role of director after only two major gallery appointments is a recognition of the quality of his work. He is very well regarded for his innovative approach in attracting new crowds to galleries. After cutting his teeth at the Newcastle gallery, Nick was very successful at the gallery at the University of Queensland in attracting record numbers of crowds, particularly online crowds, with his conceptual, youth oriented approach. I know that Nick will be just as successful in his appointment to the Art Gallery of South Australia and I wish him all the best in his new role. In the education sector, a particular high school engineering program, the Science and Engineering Challenge, which was developed at the University of Newcastle, will this week see the participation of its 100,000th student. Established in 2000, the challenge encourages high school students to pursue careers in science and engineering. It has actually been very successful in increasing the take-up of maths and science subjects by senior students throughout Newcastle and the Hunter region. It teaches students team work and problem-solving skills in practical engineering activities. It now has been rolled out all around the nation. I congratulate all those involved in making this program such a success. The University of Newcastle has also been very well recognised in the innovation field in other areas. I can turn to a much wider scale of innovation success when I look at the Hunter Central Coast Innovation Festival, hosted in Newcastle, which was held last month. The festival provides a unique opportunity to hear about or see products, services, equipment, technology, science and engineering innovations emanating from this region and its highly skilled, dedicated and inventive workforce. Regional Development AustraliaHunter managed the project this year, assisted by some funding from the New South Wales state government through Industry and Investment NSW and through the federal AusIndustry initiative. AusIndustry has been sponsoring the Australian Innovation Festival since 2002, and it does a wonderful job in it. I congratulate all the sponsors, supporters and organisers of the event, particularly Neville Sawyer, chairman of the innovation festival board. Now in its third year, the festival's main theme-building sustainable businesses-aimed to highlight the importance of innovation in meeting the challenges of the current business environment. Almost 50 events were held as part of the festival, from public forums to TAFE and university open days-even a paper plane throwing competition. I was pleased to speak at a clean coal symposium held as part of the festival, to which people from all around the country came to share the latest information in clean coal innovation. I was also pleased to be at the final event at the innovation tival and to speak there on the closure of the festival at NBN Television studios in Newcastle, where the amazing new technology of TV stations of today was showcased. Again, I congratulate everyone involved in the festival. Overall, the Rudd government has been incredibly supportive of innovation in Newcastle. Of the $1.37 billion that has been spent in my electorate so far by the federal government since its election in 2007, a total of $116,695,883 has been spent on research and innovation. It is an amazing amount of money and it is an amazing foundation for the growth of innovation in my electorate. Only last week I spoke of some of the clean energy innovations, and I will not revisit those except to again congratulate Newcastle on its SmartGridCity initiative, one that I am hoping will be very successful. I also make mention of the recent success of University of Newcastle Professor Behdad Moghtaderi and Dr Elham Doroodchi on the television show The New Inventors. Their invention, known as Granex, is a revolutionary new form of geothermal technology and won over the judges' panel in April. I am very confident that, with this sort of support from the Rudd government, Newcastle will continue to build its reputation as a centre of innovation. (Time expired) Asylum Seekers",118
197,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"Many people are not aware of some of the facts and figures surrounding asylum seekers in this country. In fact, some time ago I put out a brochure in my electorate to answer some commonly asked questions and to highlight the facts with help from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Parliamentary Library. In my former role on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I had the privilege of touring Australia's detention centres for a first hand view of the fessituation. Despite my initial trepidation, I was nothing short of impressed by what I saw. Behind the high fences were green fields where children were running and playing. They were given new shoes and clothes if they needed them, access to dental and health care, internet access, Kosher food if they had such dietary requirements, and both single and family accommodation. I am certainly not saying that the mental trauma and stress these people have faced in their home country, which drove them to sell their possessions, raise the $6,000 to $15,000 to pay a people smuggler and take a boat, no longer impacts them when they arrive. Of course it does. But I am saying that they receive adequate care under our watch. Under the United Nations convention, a person is entitled to seek asylum in their closest safe port. Australia is not always the first safe port, yet they still risk their lives to bypass other countries and come to Australia. Why? At the risk of sounding callous and having my detractors say I am a racist, it is a sense of fairness that motivates me to speak up. I am concerned about Australia's ability to provide the resources for the thousands that have arrived and continue to arrive. I am not prepared to see our seniors, many of whom in Gilmore are doing it tough, go without. I still have many pensioners who live in terrible conditions, and we have many homeless and a waiting list for dentists and hospitals. In fact, a figure that is not widely known by communities is just how much it actually costs Australian taxpayers to cater for one asylum seeker while their assessment is being carried out. The amount is $82,000. That is the taxes of nearly seven average wage earners on $62,000 a year. This means that the relentless flood of asylum seekers is costclaims ing taxpayers $250 million each year, and that cost is growing. The government has to reopen detention centres that the Howard government had closed down to cope with the demand. There are plans in the pipeline to build new ones. In the latest development the government wants to turn a disused mining village in the middle of the Western Australian desert into a processing centre. This will only add to the ever-growing cost from Kevin Rudd's watered down and failed border protection policy. Since January the number of detainees held in onshore detention centres has risen by more than 240 per cent due to the record illegal boat arrivals with hundreds of detainees transferred to the mainland. Last week nine detainees broke out of the Villawood detention centre and that is another added cost in resources and energy. Sadly, there are 427 children being held in detention centres right now. Where are all the voices that criticised the Howard government when we had 21 children in detention centres and others who lived in the community and attended regular schools? Each new boat arrival stands as an incentive for others to test the system and jump the queue, not to mention those still waiting in refugee camps with no ability to buy a place on a boat. It is going to cost Australians well over $1 billion over the next four years just to deal with the present flood. Unless the government takes a more resolute approach in discouraging immigration queuejumpers, immigration laws will never be taken seriously or the sovereignty of our nation. Since the Rudd government announced their asylum freeze, 22 boats have arrived carrying almost a thousand people. The overwhelming majority of these illegal arrivals, who will be from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, will be staying for at least six months and three months respectively before their are even assessed. The fact is people smugglers are using the opportunity the federal government has created in softening the Howard government border protection policies and people smugglers now have a highly desirable product to sell-like permanent residence in Australia-and maybe the government will give you a special deal to process you quickly in an attempt not to lose face politically. I am pleased to report that the coalition have put forward a policy or strategy to address community concerns which Australians will have an opportunity to vote on at the next election. Part of our policy will include (1) the commencement of discussions to establish an offshore processing detention facility in another country; (2) temporary protection visas and benefits with the proviso that recipients make a contribution through a work for benefits scheme as is required of Australian citizens; (3) we will require those who arrive illegally onshore to make any claim within 45 days and we will turn back boats where circumstances allow. This will send a clear message to opportunistic people smugglers who take people's lives into their hands, allowing them to travel on leaky boats just to make money. It will tell them that people who come to this country through illegal channels will not arrive on the mainland and will not automatically receive a permanent visa. So then there is no product to sell. So far the number of illegal boat vals under Mr Rudd is 129 which is over 6,000 people. The problem is growing; the cost is growing, and this government has no real strategy to deal with it. Economy Braddon Electorate: Schools",119
198,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to raise two things this evening. The first is to recognise this government's very good record in keeping our economy moving. The newspaper headline, ‘The economy on the march', written by Andrew Carswell, clearly indicates the importance-contrary to what the other side sayof the government's stimulus packages to keeping this economy working. That means working in the sense of jobs being sustained. It clearly indicates through all the information available that the private sector has been lagging but the good thing that is predicted by a number of analysts is that from the current and future quarters, the private sector should increase its investment in the economy and together with the government keep this economy moving. I think we should be congratulated on that as a nation, and this government in particular, but do you hear that from the other side? Not on your nelly. But I wish to recognise it. On an even more positive note, I would like to congratulate a number of schools in my community that were kind enough to invite me on behalf of the Minister for Education, Julia Gillard, to attend the opening of their wonderful new facilities. You hear from the other side about a number of instances that may be questionable under the BER scheme on the mainland and, if you read the Australian, you would swear that every school in Australia was going backwards in terms of their infrastructure. I can tell you that in Tasmania we have a first-rate record of rolling out the Building the Education arriRevolution. In my electorate alone there are 139 projects in 63 of my schools worth something like $99.6 million-that is being spent in my region keeping people employed and producing excellent teaching and learning facilities. Every community I have been involved with thinks they are first rate. Say what you may, warts and all, in terms of rolling out this massive $42 billion in BER projects throughout Australia-these facilities, particularly in primary schools, would never have happened under the other mob and did not happen in their term of government which you never hear about. Many states would be struggling to provide these facilities for primary schools throughout the nation and particularly in my region. If I have to pick paradise on earth, may I suggest you go to Natone on the north-west of Tasmania. The day of the opening was magnificent. The sun was pouring down; the grass was growing milk because the cows were asleep, and in the Natone Primary School of 55 students, a magnificently kept school, was this wonderful facility, allied with its eco centre. Many schools and their teachers come from not just the north-west coast but from the whole of Tassie to the Natone Primary School. It had $300,000 for a magnificent addition. The Latrobe Primary School, the mighty Latrobe, had $2.1 million for a multipurpose facility which I saw in action the other day with magnificent dancers and wonderful exhibitions. I cannot imagine more flexibility in a building than at the Latrobe Primary School. Also the Devonport Christian School had $925,000 for a fantastic addition to their library and other aspects of the school. These are just three examples of the BER at work and very happy communities. All I want is for Senator Colbeck, Senator Parry and Mr Abbott to come in and tell my people which projects will be being closed in the future and what is going to happen to the trades training centres that are promised now and are on the way and they are going to stop. Come in and tell us. I bet you we don't see them within cooee. (Time expired)",121
