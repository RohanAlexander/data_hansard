1,Mr BAMFORD,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,"r-Has the attention of ihe Minister of Defence been drawn to the following paragraph, which' appears in this morning's Argus f - ' DYNAMITE MYSTERY. DISCOVERY INA FORT. Thursday Island, Thursday - Nothin g further has been ascertained with regard* to the explosion of dynamite at the Green Hill fort on Monday. On that day a packet of dynamite, a box of detonators, and a piece of fuse were found under a 6-in. gun. The fuse had been lit, but had gone out. Hy some the whole matter is regarded as a joke, but, in view of the fact that' a quantity of common shell was stored near where the dynamite was found, the consequence ' of an explosion might have been extremely serious. Will the Minister cause inquiries to be made as to.the correctness of .those statements? Is he aware that, in some of our forts, it is the practice to employ' aliens as cooks and officers' servants; and will he ascertain whether any are so employed in the fort mentioned? - Air. EWING - On seeing the statement referred to - I think in a telegram published some days ago- I communicated.by telegraph with the Queensland. Commandant, who informed me that he was making inquiries, and hoped to furnish a report within a day or two. I shall communicate that report to the House when received. As to the second' auesfion, I shall make inquiries, and inform .the House later. PRICE OF MORPHIA . . Mr LIDDELL - H as the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs been calledto the following paragraph, published in this morning's Age?. The med'cal profession, chemists, nurses, and others interested in the relief of suffering are complaining bitterly against the duty of. 30s. per lb. .levied upon the opium constituents of morphia. The imposition has been taken advantage of by some chemists to greatly increase the price of the morphia of commerce. The case certainly seems one for reconsideration before the '1'arifl is finally disposed of by Parliament. We have received several letters from nurses, pointing out that the heavy duty really means that money is Taised "" at the expense of poor sufferers whose last hours are soothed by .the use of morphia.""' I do not quite understand the latter portion! of the paragraph, but apparently chemists are charging for morphia more than they charged formerly, and misleading customers by stating that the increase DEFENCE. . . in price is due to tihe Tariff, whereas AT THURSDAY morphia, for medical purposes, can be imported duty free. Will the Minister ascertain the facts, nnd give effect to the highest principles of the protective system which he upholds?",14
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,"If the honourable member cannot understand the paragraph, I can hardly be expected to do so. Morphia is dutiable as opium, but opium, .imported for medical purposes, is not dutiable. I shall be glad to look into the matter, and do what I think right. REVENUE RETURNS.",14
3,Mr WH IRVINE,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,"Accordin g to the State returns of revenue for the month of April, - just published, there is a decrease in the Comi non wealth balance paid to Victoria of- £ 4 7 , 5 4 7 , and in that paid to New South Wales of .£77,797, which, if not due to exceptional circumstances, indicates a falling off ,in returns from Customs and Excise duty of - ,£2,500,000 a year. Has the Treasurer reason to believe that the circumstances of the past month were exceptional, or does he regard the figures as an indication that there will be a general falling off such as he foretold?",15
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,"I cannot answer the honourable member's question definitely now, although I have just been speaking to the Secretary to the Treasury on the subject. I am not sure that the occurrence of the Easter holidays had not an effect ora the revenue. However, I shall make further inquiries. I do not think that the figures indicate any permanent decrease, though, no doubt, the revenue returns are not likely to maintain the present standard. I shall give the honourable member-perhap s this afternoon - a detailed and official reply. Later.",15
5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,"I promised the honourable member for Flinders that when I had an opportunity - I would give him a further reply to his question. I have seen the Secretary to the Treasury, who informs me that the Treasury officials think that the decrease or shortage for the month is on account of the slight falling off usual in the winter months. Probably the absence of rain in certain parts of the country may have something to do with it. They think also that another cause is that the winter goods were taken out before last month. In addition to that, there was a large withdrawal of certain goods when the increases were requested in the Senate, for fear, I suppose, of those increases being agreed to by this House.",15
6,Sir JOHN FORREST,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,"And a wellanswer. grounded fear, too.",15
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,Ver y likely.,15
8,Mr WH IRVINE,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,I am obliged to the Treasurer for his courtesy - I should like to ask when the quarterly return of revenue and expenditure for the first quarter of this year is likely to be published? It is now about four or five weeks overdue.,15
9,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,"I am informed by the Secretary to the Treasury that the quarterly return is printed, and will be issued immediately.",15
10,Mr REID,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,"H as the Treasurer considered the effect on the revenue of the. Senate's requests for amendments of the Tariff ?' If . so, what is his estimate of the effect-whic h direction will it takeup or down?",15
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,"I slated the other day when I was introducing the Senate's requests that, so far as I could judge, the effect would be a loss of revenue of from .£150.000 to £[200,000. Mr. JOSEPH .COOK - The honourable member said .£300,000. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - T think I said between £[200,000 and ,£300,000. I believe £[200,000 will be as much as the loss of revenue will be, perhaps a little less.",15
12,Mr REID,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,Then the tendency is not to increase but to reduce the revenue? . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Yes . FRANCO - BRITI SH EXHIBITION .,15
13,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,"Have arrangements been made for the representation of the Commonwealth at the FrancoBritish. Exhibition? If so, who has been appointed ? ",15
14,Mr DEAKIN,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,"- For reasons which are known to the House* the Commonwealth is not represented by exhibits. Any representation of ours there may be will be in connection with the opening ceremonial, and no appointment has yet been made. TARIFF. DUTY ON ABSORBENT COTTON. Mr LIDDELL . - I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a. question, an answer to which I have alreadv 1 received from one of his officers. As I have received a letter from a business firm in Sydney asking me to put the question, I am sure that the honourable gentleman, with his usual courtesy, will - not refuse an I wish to know whether absorbent cotton prepared for surgical purposes is to be admitted free of duty? It seems that there is some difficulty on the subject with the Customs officials in Sydney, and [ should be very much obliged if the Minister would give a reply to the question now.",15
15,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DYNAMITE EXPLOSIO N,If the honourable member will give me all the particulars I shall be glad to look into the matter at once and see that the proper thing is done. NA DEPARTMENT. LATE FEE LETTER-BOX AT SYDNEY RAILWAY STATION - COLLECTION OF MAILS AT ADELAIDE.,16
16,Mr HUME COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member for Nepean asked a question the other day with respect to a letter-box and lamp at the Sydney railway station, and I submit the following information, received from the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydthis ney,"" in reply to the honourable member's question1. A kerosene lamp is at present used in late fee letter room at Sydney Railway Station, pending the provision of a gas installation being arranged for by the Railway authorities. 2. A red letter-box, containing a clear notice that only ordinary correspondence is to be posted therein adjoins the late fee box. fee letters are sometimes wrongly placed in, but as the box is invariably cleared final departure of mail trains no delay resulted. 3. In order loavoid any public misapprehenlate sions steps are now being taken to remove ordinary box to a position 26 feet distant the western""side of the entrance to No. 2 form.",16
17,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to ask question of the Minister representing the to. Postmaster-General. Some, time .request was made for full reports as the collection of mails by motors in laide. I wish to ask Avhether the reports have yet been received, and, if so, whether the officers of the Department have acthe use of tobacco. knowledge of what is commonly reported in Adelaide as a fact, that the mails are sometimes collected by the men emplovecl ' Mx. GLYNN by the contractor for the supply of the ter of Trade and motor cars, unaccompanied by . any - officer the proclamation issuedCustoms of the Department?",16
18,Mr HUME COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I believe that a report on the subject has been prepared into for the information of the Department. I Act, and, shall find out whether it can be made it reliance i is available. With reference to the second section 52 of placed part of the - honourable member's question, there are any other sections I have no knowledge of the truth or otherMinister relies for. his authority wise of the statement made, make inquiries. NATIONALIZATION OF - TOBACCO INDUSTRY. Mr .FRAZER - I wish to ask the Prime Minister, whether his attention has been directed to a paragraph appearing.in the Herald of yesterday evening dealing  French Consul ? In the report the statement is made with reference to France that, in 1907The State sold manufactured tobacco to the value of ^19,738,287 and realised a profit of ^'i5,oSo,ooo, a trifle more in 1906. The smoking of cigarettes in France appeared to have prodigiously increased. In 1872 the value of the cigarettes consumed was ^40,000. In 1882 the value was ^680,000, at which level it remained stationary for several years, but reached to ^2,880,000 in 1907. The general profit accruing to the Government through the manufacture and sale of tobacco in France is 92 per cent, of the amount of the sales. In view of the statements appearing in report, I should like .to ask the. Prime Minister whether he does not think that the experience of France'- in connection with the the nationalization of the tobacco industry now is sufficiently encouraging to warrant the adoption of a similar policy in Australia?",16
19,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The question raised by Late the honourable member is properly one of therepolicy, and will require .great considerabefore tion. The only fact which I can add to has the statements already quoted is that by French newspapers 1 see that a deterthe mined effort is being made to put down the on cigarette smoking which is beingindulged platin to such, an excessive extent in France.",16
20,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That involves only a £2,000,000 of the ^17,000,000 referred ago Ri Mr DEAKIN - That is as the honorto able member has pointed out. As to anAdeother aspect of the question raised by the honourable member, it could be better dealt with by those who are more familiar with SIZE OF GRAIN BAGS. I wish to ask the Minis; whether in relation to the size of corn sacks, which is to come force on the 15th of next month, has been issued under the Customs f so, whether in respect to on paragraph G of the Act only, or whether on which the to issue but I shall the proclamation?",16
21,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The proclamation was issued under the Customs Act, and I was assured that we had every power to issue it . I believe now that our power is questioned. No exception is taken to the prqposed reduction in the size of the bags. We were assured by the Crown Law officers that we should be absolutely right in the course proposed, and the matter was considered closely before we issued the proclamation. If the honourable member desires to be supplied with detailed particulars, I shall be very glad to supply him with them.",17
22,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Seeing that there is some doubt as to the legality of this proclamation relating to corn sacks, will the Minister of Trade and Customs be good enough to inform us on whose advice he issued it?",17
23,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"On the advice of the law officers. . I have no doubt as to the legality of the proclamation, though evidently the honourable member has. ADVERTISING AUSTRALIA. PURCHASE OF "" LONE. HAND "" ARTICLE.",17
24,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, a question with reference to the papers connected with the purchase of the Lone Hand article, which were laid on the table yesterday. He will forgive me for doing so, because the details there given are really fragmentary. I wish to know whether the article was circulated in England in the Lone Hand magazine, or as a separate pamphlet ?",17
25,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The question is a proper one, and I am glad that it has been asked, because yesterday I omitted to mention one of the chief advantages of the transaction. The Government obtained the free publication of the article in the 50,000 copies of the first issue of the Lone Hand, which were sent to every newspaper in the United Kingdom, and to every leading newspaper in the United States of America. Those copies were in addition to the 10,900 copies of the article purchased ancl circulated by us throughout the United Kingdom as a separate pamphlet.",17
26,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the Mr Fox who received .£10 a page for the Lone. Hand article the gentleman who represents the Bulletin in the press' gallery of this House ?,17
27,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"- I am not aware. No doubt ithe Mr Fox alluded to is the Mr . Fox associated with the Bulletin, though our payment was made, not to him, but to the proprietors of the Lone Hand magazine. Later",17
28,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not wish to weary the Prime Minister with questions about the copies of the Lone Hand procured for advertising purposes, but the honourable gentleman will admit that the information given is so fragmentarythat it is really necessary that we should endeavour to get a little more. In explanation of my question, I should like to say that the arrangement to take the copies of the Lone Hand was entered into, as the papers show, a considerable time before the first issue of that magazine.",17
29,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think it was issued within a month of the' date of the letter of ours. Of course, I was away after that.",17
30,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"So far as i can judge from the papers, and, .of course, I do not wish to do any injustice in the matter, it was issued some time after the arrangement was entered into, and I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he is able to say what advertisements the proprietors of the magazine were able to secure on the strength of the Government undertaking to purchase 10,000 copies of it?",17
31,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Of course, I have not the least knowledge on that point. The letter to which I have referred is dated ist March. At that date, my honourable colleague the Treasurer had already left for the Old Country ^ and I left immediately afterwards, on the 4th or 5th of March. Though I am not sure on the point, I understand that the first number of the magazine was published immediately after that time, and I doubt whether the proprietors would have neglected to make arrangements for advertisements for the magazine 'until a date so close to the day of publication ",17
32,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wit h further reference to the Lone Hand matter, I ask the Prime Minister whether he is able to inform the House when, how, and where the 10,000 copies which have been referred to were delivered? I should like to know also whether any steps were taken to ascertain if other prominent Australian pressmen were prepared to contribute articles at the same figure or less than the sum paid for the article to which reference has already been made?",17
33,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Why did they not give the War Cry a chance?,18
34,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have had occasion two or three times before to remark upon the comments made across the chamber during the asking or answering of questions. I presume that no honourable member would ask a question without a sincere desire to obtain! the information he seeks. It is, therefore, most improper that his attempt to obtain information should be blocked or interrupted by comments. I must again ask that when questions are being put, and the answers to them are being given, there shall be such silence in the chamber as - will enable honourable members generally to have a knowledge of the nature of the question and of the answer to-it.",18
35,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I saw a letter from our officer in London, Captain Collins, describing the distribution of the first 6,000 copies of the Lone Hand that arrived, and suppose the same course was adopted in dealing with the remaining 4,000 copies. Possibly a certain number of .copies were sent to the United States of America, where a very energetic British Consul cn Chicago is good enough to act for us. I think that .practically the whole issue was absorbed by reading-rooms and other public institutions of the kind in the United Kingdom. I made no inquiry as to the contribution! of articles by other literary persons. ""An intimation was simply madeto me that there would be a circulation of 50,000 copies of the article which has been referred to, and, of course, we only paid for the copies we received.",18
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable gentleman think it a fair thing,18
37,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member can ask a question on the subject later.,18
38,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"All the distribution occurred in my absence, but personally I am of opinion that it was one of the best bargains in the way of advertising that was ever made-on e of the cheapest payments for.one of the largest returns. . Mr KELLY - The Prime Minister in his answer to the question, put by the honourable member for Lang, said that a number of the copies of the Lone Hand arrived in London at a certain period, and that other copies arrived later.. Inasmuch as they did not all arrive together I should like to ask the honourable gentleman whether he had any guarantee that the whole of the 10,000 copies supplied to the Government were not supplied from the.. unsold issue of the magazine?",18
39,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The only reason for any doubt I have as to the details is that the whole distribution was completed and carried out while I was going to and returning from England. As I have said, I remember a - particular letter about the 6,000 copies, and other letters relating to the remaining copies; and am perfectlycertain that every copy printed for us wasreceived, and every one distributed.",18
40,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"May . I ask, on behalf of the Australian press and Australian writers, whether the Government are open t ) act with similar liberality, paying £?io a page, to other-leading newspapers in the Commonwealth ? I know the names of deserving literary men who would be quite prepared to do such work at the price.",18
41,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The £ 1 0 a page, as I have more ' than .once mentioned, had nothing to do with us. We did not pay £TLO a page, but we paid .£120 for, first of all, 10,000 copies of this illustrated article, published and printed separately and circulated by us, and, next, for the advantage of having the same article included .in the 50,000 copies of the magazine which, being copies of its first number, were circulated to practically the whole of the important press in the English-speaking world. . We also received for this payment the plates and diagrams for our own use afterwards in connection with advertising Australia. For ,£120, therefore, we obtained 60,000 copies of the article, together with the plates and diagrams ; and I am prepared to make as good a bargain with any one else who offers.",18
42,Mr SALMON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether this is the first time that a bargain of this character has been entered into by the Commonwealth - whethe r he was acting under precedent, and whether, if a number of articles were received under a previous arrangement made by a previous Government, he can inform honourable members of the name of the leader of that Government? I should further like to know whether the number of articles received, and their value under anyprevious arrangement,. compare at all with the number and value of the articles now under review.",18
43,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Agai n I have to rely on my' memory as to the fact that an ' arrangement was made by a previous Government, of which the right honourable anember for East Sydney was Prime Minister, for the circulation of articles in the English press. I believe that those articles cost a great deal more than ^ 1 2 0 ,",18
44,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The poor man worked for a year, circulated the articles, and paid - the postage, for ,£200.",19
45,Mr SALMON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the right honourable member for East Sydney, through vou, Mr Speaker, whether it is a fact that .£400 was paid by the previous - Government referred to, on his order as Prime Minister, for the writing of a numTer of articles, of which two only arrived at the Commonwealth offices, 'or at the rate - of .£200 each ?",19
46,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I have much pleasure in answering the question. The arrangement then made was of a different character from that now under review.,19
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Of course ! - Mr Reid - May I answer the question ? The arrangement referred to by the honourable member for Laanecoorie included a whole year's work by one of the leading English correspondents in Australia, who contributed articles to all the important newspapers of the world. were submitted to the Government before their despatch, and the Government paid the postage expenses for a period of twelve month's, at the rate of one article a week. That was not at the rate of .£10 per page, or £ 1 2 0 for twelve pages.",19
48,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In view of the example set by the right honourable member for East Sydney. when Prime Minister, in handing over the preparation of these articles to a correspondent for foreign newspapers, while there are some of the ablest writers in the world on the Australian press, I desire to know whether the Prime Minister will now open such contributions to competition?",19
49,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The whole thing has always been open to competition.,19
50,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We heard precious little about this business !,19
51,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Honourable members were informed of the transaction, totallingthe magnificent sum of ,£120, as soon as they displayed the slightest interest in it . Owing to the circulation of the article, I - should imagine that bractically every member was, or could easily .have made himself, acquainted with the facts; and I supposed that honourable members knew all about the - matter. The articles Were not hidden away, but circulated throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom; and English press notices referred to them again and again. Honourable members have only to refer to the English newspapers of that period, to refresh their memory. The Government have always been open to receive from any Australian journalists offers for advertising Australia"" which appear to be to the pecuniary advantage of the Commonwealth.",19
52,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In view of the fact that the Prime Minister is now inviting similar contributions from all sources in Australia, I desire to know whether he will make some arrangement in the future so that we may not have the undesirable practice of political writers for newspapers coming into touch first of all with the Prime Minister, whatever Government may be in power, or whoever the writer may be. I should like to know whether in the future there could be instituted some impartial authority to receive and judge applications of this kind?",19
53,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The question i , such s a long one that I have almost forgotten to what the first part related. I remember now that the first part of it contained an Those articles imputation. If there are any copies of the particular article left, I shall take care that every honourable, member is supplied with one, when it will be seen that there is no reference in it, direct or indirect, of any political character.",19
54,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I did. not sav there was.,19
55,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That was' the implication. - Mr KELLY - Not for a moment.,19
56,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The article is an absolutely fair statement of the productive possibilities pf Australia, and nothing else. It has no party complexion whatever : and, consequently, there is no ground for suggesting that some impartial' person is requiredto consider whether future articles are or - are not in the interests'. of the Commonwealth. No impartial person could resist the evidence of that article, or could - deny that it was an excellent business bargain.",19
57,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Prime Minister quite misunderstands me. I do not desire to take up any more time on this subject,19
58,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the honourable member asking a question ?,19
59,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall ask a question at the conclusion of my explanation. The Prime Minister quite misunderstands me. What I refer to is the undesirable practice of political writers getting into personal touch with Ministers, when those writersare going to receive some personal benefit out of the transaction. I do not say that the practice is more than undesirable. Mr KING ""O'MALLEY - The honprable member is making an un-Christian insinuaDr tion. M.r. KELLY - There is no insinuation; I am merely asking whether that practice can be avoided in the future.",19
60,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There are few tralian writers of eminence who are not political writers; and those honourable members who know the comments continually made on myself, I shall not say by the writer of this article, because I cannot distinguish him from others, but by the publications with which he is associated, will realise that I had no personal interest to serve. KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA out",20
61,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask Leagues. the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs what is the present position of the survey of the route of the proposed railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. This is the ist of May, and we are now noticeapproaching the .best season of the year for carrying out the work. I desire to urge upon the Government the necessity of taking every step possible to push, on with the work during the cool season.",20
62,Mr HUME COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,For some little time negotiations had to take place to get the co-operation ' of - both States Governremedied? ments concerned. That has now been obtained.,20

66,Mr HUME COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Almos t at once. The negotiations are, I think, completed, and I should say that the work will be begun immediately. IMMIGRATION OF RUSSIAN JEWS.",20
67,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Prime Minister, upon noticei . With reference to questions asked up:n notice on .gth April , relating to immigration payments made to Dr Arthur, M.L.A., in nexion therewith, has his attention been directed New to references to this subject in The Australian Star (Sydney) of the 23rd April, in which tracts from correspondence are given showing that Dr Arthur was trying to promote an tensive immigration scheme of Russian Jews whom the correspondence indicates not receive, and which 'a contributor describes as a scheme "" to turn this essentially British community into the dumping-ground of the scum and riff-raff of Europe, and to endanger .the very existence of Australia as a nation?"" 2. In view of the subsidies already paid to Arthur in furtherance of his immigration schemes, and in view of his (the Prime Minister's) statement in reply to previousquestions that "" it must be clearly understood that no person is ineligible as an immigrant because he is a Russian or a Jew (or both),"" is it proposed to continue the efforts to promote immigration Ausof this class and character?",20
68,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"-Fro m a general acquaintance with the proposal referred ""to, I may say that the scheme will be dependenton the obtaining of concessions of land from the States. ' So far as I am aware, except in the .case of South Australia, some considerable time ago, no one ever got so far as the making of anything like a proposal to any State. In regard to the second question, it has been already pointed that it is not intended after this year RAILWAY. to make further grants to the Immigration EXPORT ENTRIES.",20
69,Mr SALMON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"for Mr CROUCH) asked the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon 1. Wliether at present a shipper of goods upon a through bill of lading from Geelong is compelled to make an export entry in Melbourne, necessitating the employment by nonMelbourne firms of Melbourne' agents for this purpose? ' 2. If so, will he arrange that this disadvantage to Australian export trade be in future",20
70,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions s the work to be are as. followi and 2. If the goods are shipped at any port on board a vessel which clears at such jjort the law requires that the export entry must be made out for such port. Any other course would lead to inextricable confusion and to wholly complication of statistics. PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT. Mr KING O'MALLEY asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeIn prospect of the statement given out by President Roosevelt to an American interviewer that, on the expiration of his term of office, and ' he intended journeying to Africa for the purconpose of hunting big game, and also visiting Zealand to study modern industrial economic methods, will the Prime Minister, on exbehalf of the Australian nation, extend an invitation to that great man to visit the Australian exContinent and - be the guest of the Commonwealth while here, assuring him that we can Canada will furnish a kangaroo hunt?",20
71,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think no man would receive a warmer reception in Australia than Mr Roosevelt, should he do us the favour of paying a visit here. But in reference to the suggestion for his entertainment, I trust that the honourable member will not mislead his distinguished countryman by suggesting to him that the kangaroo is dealt with in the fashion which I understand is observed by. the hunters of smaller game-by putting a pinch of salt on his tail.

I hope that-the Minister better price? will reconsider his determination to oppose the request. The arguments adduced in this chamber previously should have appealed to every honourable member who desires to see a fair thing done in the interests both of the manufacturers and of those who have to use the article. It was shown that a duty upon wire netting would impose immense disabilities upon settlers throughout Australia, and would seriously handicap them in their laudable enterprise of opening up the interior- a work in which ' we hope that they will succeed. That work is of immense value not only to themselves personally, but to the Commonwealth as a whole. The Committee would do well to view the matter from that standpoint. We should consider the .advantages that will accrue to Australia as a whole from giving to settlers in the rural districts every facility to obtain the materials necessary for their enterprise at as low a rate as possible. That can be done in in the this case, as was sfjown previously-, without the ist injuring in any way those engaged in the the ist manufacture of wire netting in Australia. district The netting is made chiefly from imported wire, and the industry is only a matter of It is .im- twisting the wire together.

The reason why there has been such a consumption of the imported wire netting has been simply because the local manucent. facturers, though working all their chines to their utmost capacity, have been unable to supply the requirements. The consequence has been that, even against their own inclination, many persons who use wire netting in large quantities have obliged to secure the imported article order to. avoid the delays which would have been enforced upon them. I hope that the Minister will not persist in his objection to the Senate's request, and that even if he should it will be carried.  also ask the Government to agree .to the request.

In accordance with that intimation the honourable member for Riverina-notwithstandin g what the honourable member for Grey has said-move d that the duties should be 15 and 10 per cent.

128,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Robertson) f - S ] - - X t seems to me that in this matter 12 I we are being left to decide as between a primary and secondary industry, which shall receive the benefit of the course we adopt. It is contended by one honourable member, who sits on this side, and votes with honourable members on the other side, that the retention of the duties will mean an advantage of an extra 5 or 10 per cent, to manufacturers of wire netting, whose employees live in his electorate. On the other hand, the Minister says that to accept the requested amendment of the Senate would involve a loss of revenue - It should not be forgotten that we are dealing in this matter with a staple industry, the success of which means everything to Australia. All our industries depend upon the land, and we know that rabbits can only be kept under by the use of wire netting. In some parts of the State of New South Wales settlers, who some time ago were impoverished by losses of stock, due to the fact that their pastures were denuded by successive years of drought, are to - day experiencing the benefit of a good season. They now have plenty of grass on their pastures, and though they know that while rabbits can obtain young grass they will not take poison baits they have very little monev wherewith to erect wire-netting fencing to keep them out of their pastures. The Minister contends that a certain amount of revenue will be derived from these duties, and admits that their imposition means that settlers will have to pay an increased price for the wire netting they require. Are we going to tax people who have so little, and who The hon- have lost so much, now that they have an opportunity of conserving grass by erectThe ing wire-netting fences? The honourable member forGippsland regards these duties as protective duties, and proposes to vote against the amendment requested by the Senate, in order that the secondary iridustry for the manufacture of wire netting may be kept going. The honourable member's contention is that that will lead to a reduction in the price of wire netting, but the Minister has told us that a revenue of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , and in some quarters it has been said that a revenue of .£40,000, is at stake in this matter. We should bring common sense to bear upon our consideration of the question, and I should like to remind Victorian representatives that at the present time stock are starving in Victoria, and that thousands of Victorian stock are being sent to other States where grass is to be found. Victorian pastoralists are at present going through a very severe experience, and yet Victorian representatives are supporting the imposition of a duty on wire netting, which must lead to a higher price being charged for the grass which they require for their stock than would be charged if wire netting were admitted free of duty. Victorian representatives are so wedded to high protective duties that they are prepared to impose them even if , in doing so, they should penalize the' man on the land, and all that makes for the progress and wealth of the State. This is a matter which should come home to every Victorian representative, because Victorian settlers on the lancl are feeling the pinch more at the present time than are the settlers in any other State. If wire netting is made more costly, those who require to put. their cattle out to grass on other people's land in more favoured districts will have to pay more for the privilege; and I hope a common-sense view will prevail, and that this necessary, will be placed within the reach of men of small means. Those of large means were able to get their wire netting in the past at a much cheaper rate, but now"" a higher price is demanded from the small settler, who is not able to afford it. This is truly a national question; and I appeal to the Minister of Trade and Customs, as a reasonable being, to have regard for the staple industries of Australia, and, particularly, to the interests of the small settlers. Mr THOMAS BROWN' (Calare) [12.21] - The original proposal of - Government was a duty of 30 per cent, under the general Tariff, and 25 . per cent, on wire netting from the United Kingdom, and after a lengthy debate it was decided to impose duties of 5 and TO per cent. The Senate conpresent sidered the' item fromall its various points of view, and in the interests of industries affected, requested that the commodify should be placed on the free list. When the first Tariff was under consideraworth, tion there was a proposal to impose a duty on wire .netting, but the Senate, on' that taxed to the extent of £[100.000. occasion, also decided to place it on the free list; and I trust that the request the Senate now before us will be adopted. When the item was uncier consideration in October last, I dealt with it fairlv exhaustively, and I do not propose to cover the ground today : but I emphavote .size the fact that at that time the ing price of imported wire netting in New South Wales was from , £ 40 to £[45 per mile, and the best quality of locally-made netting of standard measurement was £[45 per-mile. So serious had the position then become, due to the high prices and Customs [REPRESENTATIVES.] Tariff Bill. the increasing need on the part of smalP holders to protect, not only their grass area, but their cultivated areas, that the State Government of New South Wales decided to come to their assistance, and entered into large contracts, so as toplace wire netting at their disposal at a cheaper rate. The local manufacturing; firm of Lysaght Brothers had the option of tendering, ancl their first tender for 4,000 miles' of netting, 42 inches by i-Jinch, was at the rate of £[31 per mile, while the accepted tender from abroad, for the same class of netting, was at the rate of £[26 per mile, landed in Sydney. This wire netting was retailed at £ 2 6 5s., showing a difference of £ 4 1:5s., as compared with the price of the local article.",29
129,Mr TILLEY BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That was before the duty was imposed.,30
130,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes . Since then,, - with a f all in the price of metals, the price of . locally-made wire netting has been reduced, though it still stands at over £[30, whereas I am informed', that the last tender from abroad, for the same class of netting was £ 2 2 per mile. Here we have' a difference of something like £[9 'per mile. In 1906 about £[500,000 worth of wire netting was imported, and the local production is estimated at about the same the value, showing a consumption! of about ,£1,000,000 worth. Arid the consumption . is increasing, for the reason that rabbits are gradually spreading over the agricultural areas, and rendering precautions increasingly imperative. Assuming, that the consumption of imported wire netting is represented by £[500,000 worththe and the greater portion of it is from Ger- many, America, and France;-and that the local production is another £[500.000 we .see"" that a-duty of 10 per cent, means that the farmers ancl graziers will be The honourable member for Dalley was elected as of a free-trader, and is politically known in New South Wales as the champion of champions of the free-trade cause; but he has decided, in the interests of the manufacturers within his electorate, to cast a in favour of the duties. From the sellstatement of the manager of Lysaght Brothers I find that the highest pay-sheet for one week is £ 7 0 0 , an|d, assuming the wages to be at the standard rate, we find that the cost, in this connection, of conducting the wire-netting industry is about £[36,000 per annum, or £[64.000 short of the revenue from the duties. There are only from 300 to 400 hands employed; and, under the circumstances, the farmers and settlers would find themselves about £[60,000 in pocket «if they were to pay the wages of those at present employed, and have wire netting duty free. Throughout the settled districts of New South Wales the .rabbit pest is an increasing menace to the very existence of ' agricultural industries. In New South Wales there are about 74,000 separate holdings, 69,000 of which are of 1,000 acres and .under, representing a total of about 11,000,000 acres; there are 5.500 holdings under 3.0,000 acres, totalling 13,000,000 acres, and there are 722 holdings, totalling 22,000,000 acres. When the Tariff, of 1902 was under consideration, wire netting was placed oni the free list, in furtherance of the large pastoral interests; but today the rabbit wave has reached the agricultural areas! and the small holders are affected. No protectionists will claim that the proposed duties can have any protective effect. Protective duties range from 25 per cent, to 50 per cent., and even to 3 50 per cent.; and I ask' whether it is reasonable to burden the farming and grazing industries with a purely revenue ' duty ? I trust the Committee will accept the recommendation of the Senate. The number of free-traders is very small compared with the - total membership of that Chamber; and yet it . was considered only just and fair that wire netting should be placed on the free list. I. trust that the Committee will decide to bring the Tariff, so far as regards this item, into line' with the previous one. In that case, the question was purely a grazingor squatters' question. I hope that under this Tariff the farmers, settlers, and small land-holders generally will receive the same treatment as was given then to the larger land-holders.",30
131,Mr COON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Batman) [12.36] - To listen to honourable members opposite, one would think there was no wire netting being made in Australia, because people who prefer to use imported wire netting are charged a duty on it . Wire netting is being made in New South Wales, at an establishment where some 400 men are employed. Last year they turned out about . £500,00 0 worth, and if they are given sufficient protection they can produce the whole of the wire netting required in Australia. In 1902 we imported netting £[130,000 worth; in 1903, £[95,000 worth; in 1904, £[129,000 worth; in , *9°5> , £ 3 3 5 < 0 0 0 w o r . > in 1906, £[521,000 ' t h worth; and in 1907, £[581,000 worth. .

In my own constituency I do not think there is a single individual who purchases anything but Messrs. Lysaght Brothers netting, as the result of bitter experience of the netting purchased from the Government. The farmers imaginedwhen they dealt with the New South Wales Government-that they would secure wire netting which would keep out rabbits from their holdings, but they were soon disillusionized, and they .have since had to buy wire netting from Messrs. Lysaght Brothers to duplicate their fences.",35
197,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is a serious reflection upon the State Government.,35
198,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I never believed in the action of the New South Wales Government in supplying inferior netting. When they first proposed to purchase netting for land-holders the condithe New tions imposed were similar to those which obtained in Queensland. In other words,' the wire was supplied to the farmers and was to be paid for at the rate of 5 per cent, over a period of twenty years. But subsequently the term was reduced to ten years, and conditions were imposed which was the B caused many land-holders to become perfectly disgusted. These conditions required them to mortgage their properties, It was and to send in a report as to the condition of the netting every twelve months. As a result, a great many persons in the Albury and Wagga districts would have nothing more to do - with the New South Wales Government. The conditions were so positively ridiculous. It is imperative that our farmers should be supplied with an article with which they are satisfied, and one which will keep out the rabbits,, which the' imported netting will not doespecially the netting imported by.the.New South Wales Government.  in Queensland.",35

215,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Hindmarsh)' [2.35J. - Severa l honourable members opposite have manuadmitted that they voted for duties of 1 10 and 5 per cent, because they could not secure the admission of wire netting duty free. The honourable member for Calare has interjected that honourable members on this side of the Chamber ought to be opposed to a 10 per cent, duty, because it is a revenue duty. Well, I am against 10 per cent, duties, but I voted for 10 and 5 per cent, in this instance, precisely because those'were the highest duties I could get. I declined to vote for lower duties for several reasons. In the first place, I desire our settlers to be able to get cheap wire netting, and, in the second place, I wish to protect those who are manufacturing wire netting in Australia at present. What guarantee has been given us that if we were to make wire netting duty free the settlers would get it cheaper? When there .was no duty our experience was that the purchasers were very badly treated by the importers. In South Australia we use an enormous quantity of wire netting in proportion to population. I suppose that we use more than any State in the Commonwealth. When there was no duty the price charged was so enormous that the Government .of the State had to step in and import wire netting themselves, selling it to the settlers at cost price. It is a curious thing that the moment something is proposed to be done to benefit thefarmers .we find certain honourable members opposite saying, "" Oh, we must not touch the farming community."" Chemical manures could not be sold at the price at which they are sold today had it nol been for the local manufactures. It is precisely the same with wire netting-. able members make the item free, and wipe out the local industry. I am quite satisfied that wire netting will become very much dearer. The result will simply be to leave the whole field open to a ring of importers, and the settlers will consequently have to pay much more than they are now doing. Even if the local manufacturers were to come to an arrangement with the importers-whic h I do not think they will do-ther e is nothing to prevent any State in the Commonwealth doing what was done by South Australia; namely, purchasing wire netting at the cheapest market price, and selling it to the settlers at that price.",36
216,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The . State Government will not be able to do that if we impose a duty?,37
217,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What is the difference between purchasing wire netting at the cheapest price in.any part of the world when there is no duty, and doing the same thing when there is a duty ? There is no difference whatever. In fact, I should like to see the whole of the States doing what Victoria is now doing. I should like to see wire netting made in all the gaols of the Commonwealth, so that the settlers might get it at the cheapest possible price. Wire netting is not an article.that comes into competition with the produce of workers in .the same sense as do boots and shoes and other commodities.",37
218,Mr WH IRVINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is not wire netting being made out of the gaols?,37
219,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Yes .,37
220,Mr WH IRVINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Will not.the gaolmanufactured netting come into competition with that manufactured out of the gaols?,37
221,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I would have wire netting manufactured in the gaols and sold at' the same price as that manufactured by private enterprise - We have been .too long keeping our prisoners at the expense of the taxpayers. They, ought to be made to earn their living; but what they make should not be brought into competition with goods made by workers outside. If wire netting were made' in all the gaols of the Commonwealth and sold at cost price, we' should do a good thing for the settlers and for the taxpayers also.",37
222,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Would the honourable member allow the prisoners to strike for higher wages if they wanted to? If honor- Mr HUTCHISON - That remark suggests a reason why the honourable member should support me in this case; because if there is a strike and wire netting is not being made in the gaols, the farmers will be at the mercy of the importers, who will charge whatever price they like. They will say that the increase is due to the strike, and will charge £ 5 or £ 6 per ten more than is justifiable. While the proposed duties are not as high as .they ought to be, I shall vote for their retention, because they are the highest I Can secure. The local manufacture affords the best safeguard to the settlers against being penalized by importers. Some honourable members expressed their determination not to vote for the duties, because of the low wages paid in the industry. But if the wages are not fair, I take it that that is the fault of this Parliament and of the States Parliaments.",37

Therefore, the workers have not had proper representation in the other Parliaments of Australia. Some honourable members .say that they are not going to vote for higher duties because it is not worthwhile fo preserve an industry in which the wages are so low. Sir JOHN.FORREST - Does the honourable member think that is the reason why we are voting for low duties?",38
227,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is the reasongiven by more' than one honourable member. I have a better opinion of the farmers of this country than to believe that if they had to pay a trifle more for their wire netting in order that-a fair wage might be paid in the industry, they would not be willing to do it - In my opinion, it is the duty of this Committee to encourage the manufacture of wire netting in the Commonwealth. I hope to see the industry established not only in New South Wales, but in the other States also. Since the .Tariff has been laid on the table we have been manufacturing barbed wire in South Australia, and it' is just as easv to manufacture wire netting.",38
228,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"l t is merely wiretwisting. ' Mr HUTCHISON - If we establish a number of industries, they will require an' - enormous amount of capital and machinery. These industries may be small individually, but collectively, they lead to the employment of a large number of hands. In addition' to that, mechanics are employed in the manufacture of the machinery: These industries' will grow, and afford more' and more employment according as we give them protection against the outside world.",38
229,Mr FOSTE R,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"New England) [2.45] On general principles, I am opposed to 10 per cent, duties as being absolutely revenue duties. Wire netting is not only heavy but extremely bulky, and freightage is an extremely important factor in the total cost. That being so,' a duty of 10 per cent, in respect of it is equal to a duty of 15 per cent, in the case of many other articles. Evidence such as that given by the honourable member, for Hindmarsh as well as the facts within my own knowledge convinces me that we shall secure cheap wire netting for Australian users only by means of local competition. The quality of the Australian-made netting ' is infinitely superior to that obtained from abroad. Many men have to mortgage their holdings to obtain the wherewithal to purchase wire netting to enclose them, and we can .well imagine their dismay, on finding that the imported netting, which they have used for that purpose is rapidly falling to pieces.",38
230,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is what is happening in many-cases.,38

In the circumstances, I think thai I am justified in claiming the vote of the honourable member for Grey., in favour of these duties in order that his constituents may secure an effective netting at a cheap rate.",39

By the course proposed, although we are sup posed to have settled .the whole question of the Tariff, an invitation would be offered for a renewed discussion of this particular item, and it would be left to the Government to reopen the consideration' of this portion of the Tariff, and throw the House into the turmoil of a Tariff debate at any time they might feel disposed to do so. Such a proposal should not be accepted without the gravest reasons being advanced in support of it. We have heard a good deal of talk from the Treasure^ and from' some, honourable members supporting him, about the character of the votes we have given, and about changing our views in respect to votes we gave on some of these items when they were previously before the Committee.",42

After going full y into the whole' matter of the Tariff with the report of the Tariff Commission before them, Ministers I deliberately brought down to this House a Tariff in which they proposed ' locks, to including knobs, keys, .escutcheons, and staples should be dutiable at only 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and free comi f imported from the United Kingdom. in - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Hear , hear !",42

298,Mr WATKINS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member Is not so much opposed to the protection of an industry if it is a Victorian industry. Mr . W . H . IRVINE - The right of the Senate to make requests or suggestions is deliberately embodied in our Constitution, ancl yet the honourable member would contend that it is our duty as members of the House of Representatives to flout the requests of the Senate.

I shall be prepared to justify honourable the votes I have given in the proper place; but I wish to tell the Treasurer that to assume, as he does, that honourable members are guilty of some sort of political inconsistency if they chancre the votes they gave in the first instance upon any item when that item comes before, them again upon a request received from the Senate, is practically to contend that the Senate has no right to make any suggestions.",43
305,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Government have changed their attitude in regard to this item.,43
306,Mr WH IRVINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Q u it e so; .and we ought not to assume that it shows consistency to vote for the same duties as before, and that there is nothing whatever to consider in the requests sent to us by the Senate.

307,Mr WH IRVINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member , asks me a question which I think may be relevant to the matter before us. The Senate has not ""the power of amendment, but only the power of suggesting amendments, though, personally, I think there is very little difference in substance between the two; and I make the honourable member a present of that admission. But whatever the power means, it is part of the diverse constitutional right of the Senate; and surely it is our duty lo at least give a courteous consideration to the suggestions made?",43
308,Mr WATKINS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not obiect to that; I only say it is funny how the votes are given. Mr W\ H . IRVINE - If the honourable member means to infer that honourable members are governed by considerations as between New South Wales and Victoria, and so on, I have no answer; all I can do is to assure him that I am not governed by any considerations of the kind. When honourable we find the-Treasurer, having originally introduced this item to be subject to a duty of 5 per cent, and free,' deliberately threatening honourable members on both sides with all the terrors of his displeasure if they do not at once vote for his proposal there is only one of two views open to useither that the Minister did not go into this item as he said he had done, or that he has discovered, since he introduced, the Tariff, that this is a struggling industry which requires protection.",43
309,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"A duty of 5 per cent, and free is not protectionist, but a revenue duty of the lowest kind.",44

If the Minister cannot give us that information, I shall vote for» wiping the duty out altogether.",44
313,Mr HARPER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Mernda) [3.25] - The Treasurer ought, [ think, to listen to those who take exception to this kind of legislation. It is most objectionable to have conditional protection, leaving it within the power of the Ministry, at any particular juncture, to ask Parliament to declare that a manufacture is sufficiently established to justify a duty. The honourable member for Boothby was perfectly right when he said that if an industry can be brought into existence without a duty, it is a strange proposal to afford protection at a time when protection is not needed. Personally, I cannot conceive a better way of preventing an industry being established than - such a. condition as that suggested; because no one will enter into an industry with the prospect of facing a battle in two House of Parliament, in order to show .that it is sufficiently established to justify a duty. I suggest to the Treasurer that he ought to make up his mind to accept a duty of 20 per cent, or, perhaps, some lower figure, and to abandon this excrescence on the Tariff. The proposed conditions .are a new departure, and, quite apart from other considerations, I think honourable members ought to set their faces against it. There should be a protective duty 'or there should not be; and we ought to decide the question on its merits. The request of the Senate introduces a most insidious and dangerous principle. As a protectionist, I am prepared to vote for a duty.",44

The Senate has the constitutional right to suggest amendments; and we - ought not to take up the position that honourable members are bound, in every case, to vote in a specific way.

The fact is that the Go Sir WILLIAM LYNE vernment in the Tariff as introduced themselves, proposed not one shred of protection for the lock industry of Australia.

That is a matter more for other honourable members than myself, but a on a general ground, upon which protectionists and free-traders alike ought to meet, it is a pernicious principle that the Tariff should be liable to be re-opened at any time, and that there should be a over an industry which comes to Parliament for assistance - That is the sort of thing that leads to lobbying.",45

333,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Since locks can be indusmade very easily without the expendia ture of ' much capital;, it seems to esme that if we agree to the request as it stands, we practically say to a man: "" You They start the industry, and when you have started it we will give you a protection of 20 aiid 15 per cent."" Within three montlis any man with from £150 to £200 could come back to this Chamber, and say: "" am in a position to demand the protection that you promised."" What was in the mind of the Senate was that the industry should be placed in such a position as to be worthy of some sort of support. Their proposition is not so ridiculous as it appears at first sight, because no industry does receive tection in Australia unless it is struggling on to its feet. When it is said that dustry ought to receive protection, what the objection that is urged against it the stand-point of the free-trader? It is that there is no such industry. On another occasion it will be said "" There twenty men, or three men and a boy, employed in the industry; it is one proposition which should not be protected, because tax. it employs so few persons."" But directly a man comes forward with a - statement to the effect that he employs 50, 60, 100, or 500 men in an industry, then, from the protectionist stand-point, case is made out for the grant of some prothe tection. The mere fact that the' industry is on its feet does not take away the of the manufacturer to be protected. Theremember fore, I do not. see anything very absurd the .proposition. I apprehend that there is absolutely nothing to prevent a man f rom competing as readily with cheap locks as with cheap boots. I shall not vote for duty on locksthe proposition, because, from my standTo point, it is perfectly absurd. If this reby quest be acceded to,' it will be inviting a as man to invest- £1,000 in an industry, and at the end of three months to to Parliament for some protection. If a protectionist Ministry be then in office with a majority at its back, the promise will have to be kept. We shall be called upon to grant to that man a protil tection which we are not. prepared to cede at the present time. If we are prepared to agree to duties of 20 and per cent..' or 5 per cent, and free, let do so at once. A duty of 5 per cent, no protection to an industry. If the leader of the Opposition had been in office, 1 no doubt that he would have agreed to duties of 10 and 5 per cent. be fair revenue duties. I suggest to the Treasurer that, instead of asking for duties of 20 an'd 15 per cent, with absurd proviso, he should be prepared to take duties of 10 and 5 per cent. necessity Tf he will agree to adopt that .suggestion, he will get revenue, and also give a little protection to the industry.

The commercial aspect of this proposition was put very clearly by the honourable member for Mernda. He pointed out that the main' justification) for the grant of a duty was to help an infant industry; but now it is suggested by the Treasurer that an industry must be full grown before it can ask for such assistance. It must be well established before it is entitled to take advantage of this devious provision, and ask the two Houses for a protective duty. There will be no waste of time in discussing this request. Treasurer says that he wants to withdraw his motion in order to propose the insertion of something else; but if his suggestion were' adopted that would only get over the present difficulty. I want to know whether the withdrawal of the motion, is to cover similar requests in connection With the items relating to oils,' timber, and paper.
