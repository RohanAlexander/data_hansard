(2) Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to a statement made in World Oil, October 1995, that unscientific reserve claims for political reasons may obscure the fact that most large, economic oil fields have been found, and permanent oil shock is inevitable early in the next century. (3) Will predicted shortages of oil have a profound impact on the Australian economy; if so, what measures will the Government take. Mr Moore---The Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. I am not aware of this report, and am unable to comment on the sources used by its authors or the scientific basis of the assessments undertaken in the course of its preparation. The Australian Government has at its disposal substantial, world-class expertise through the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) in the assessment of petroleum reserves and the potential for further reserve discoveries. AGSO has determined that, at current rate of production, demonstrated economic reserves of crude oil in Australia account for about twelve years of demand; sub-economic demonstrated reserves and inferred reserves account for several further years' demand. It is worthy of note that estimates of Australian reserves-to-production ratio have not varied significantly for more than a decade, indicating that continuing additional discoveries and additions of reserves in already producing oil fields have added to Australia's production capacity. Identified world oil reserve estimates by the World Energy Council suggest an ultimate reserves to production ratio of some 62 years, based on current knowledge of available reserves. This estimate relates to conventional oil production only; it does not include non-conventional oils, such as shale oil, reserves of which are some 2-3 times those of conventional oil. Australia's resources of non-conventional oils, particularly shale oil, which AGSO assesses as subeconomic at current oil prices or inferred rather than demonstrated, are also substantially greater than reserves of conventional oil. AGSO considers the level of confidence in these resources would increase significantly if the current Stuart shale oil pilot project in Queensland were successful. (2) No. I am not aware of the report or of any evidence that may have been cited in support of the claims. There is a high level of interest by petroleum exploration companies and governments around the world in evaluation of petroleum discovery prospects in hitherto unexplored areas. There is a continuing strong interest, also, in exploring for petroleum in Australia's offshore areas, with 23, 27 and 20 permits having been awarded from the last three annual acreage releases. Indeed, Australia has been ranked as the second most popular country outside of North America for new petroleum exploration and production ventures. It is evident from ongoing levels of exploration activity that those most concerned with petroleum field exploration and development do not necessarily hold to the view that most large, economic oil fields have been found. Nor is it consistent with a view that there is political advantage to be gained from an unscientific overestimation of available reserves. (3) The ready availability of competitively priced energy is a key factor in the international competitiveness of the Australian economy and the continued economic and social well-being of Australians. Energy supply and use are also significant factors in responses to major environmental challenges facing Australia. They are therefore of considerable importance in economic decision-making, by governments as well as by business and individuals. However, it is not simply a matter of determining in isolation the impact of availability of a single form of energy; supply and use of all forms of energy, the ability for inter-fuel substitution, the open and effective operation of markets within which energy is traded, greater efficiency in supply, transmission, distribution and end-use, and the development of new, innovative alternative forms of energy and high efficiency technologies are all key elements in an holistic approach to energy and its impact on the economy. The Government has policies and programs in place which address each of these elements.Forests Industry Structural Adjustment Program: South-West Region (Question No. 918) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, upon notice, on 20 September 1999: (1) What are the respective powers and functions of the Commonwealth and State Governments as detailed in the Forests Industry Structural Adjustment Program (FISAP) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed with Western Australia on 4 May 1999. (2) Has the Commonwealth since sought to amend or terminate the MOU; if so, what are the details. (3) Does the Commonwealth remain committed to contributing $20m towards a South West FISAP, as he announced on 4 May 1999; if not, what are the details of any variation proposed by the Commonwealth. (4) Subsequent to the WA Premier's announcement of 27 July 1999 that logging of old growth karri and tingle forests will cease when current contracts expire, does the Commonwealth consider that the South West region requires additional structural adjustment funding; if so, what further measures are proposed to assist affected workers and communities. (5) What estimated sum will the Commonwealth provide under FISAP to WA in 1999-2000 for (a) business exit assistance, (b) worker assistance, industry development assistance and (d) rescheduling assistance. (6) What sum has the Commonwealth provided under FISAP to WA since 4 May 1999.",150
37,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the Western Australian Hardwood Timber Industry Development and Restructuring Program, also known as WA FISAP, provides for the program's implementation on a joint basis between the Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments. The MOU outlines the WA FISAP's objectives, program assistance components, basic administrative arrangements and the funding commitments of the two Governments. A copy of the MOU has been given to Mr Ferguson. (2) No. (3) The MOU for the WA FISAP, signed on 4 May 1999, provides that the Commonwealth will contribute $15 million to a joint WA FISAP. As part of the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement, the Commonwealth also agreed to contribute $5m for developments in the South West region. The Commonwealth stands by these commitments. (4) Yes. The responsibility for addressing the impacts on forest businesses and workers of Premier Richard Court's announcement of 27 July 1999 rests with the Western Australian Government. (5) (a) and (b) Implementation of the WA FISAP, including expenditure under Business Exit Assistance, Worker Assistance and Industry Development Assistance, is dependent on finalisation and agreement of specific guidelines for each component. Once guidelines are finalised and the timing of application, assessment and approval process is agreed, an estimate of likely Commonwealth expenditure in 1999-2000 will be available. (d) Nil. The MOU for the WA FISAP does not provide for Rescheduling Assistance. (6) Nil. Forests Industry Structural Adjustment Program: Mount Beauty Timbers (Question No. 932) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, upon notice, on 23 September 1999: (1) What are the respective powers and functions of the Commonwealth and State Governments as detailed in the FISAP Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed with Victoria on 16 August 1998. (2) Has the Commonwealth since sought to amend this MOU; if so, what are the details. (3) Has he given private undertakings to Mt Beauty Timbers that the Commonwealth would meet one-third of the cost of retooling the firm's mill if the State Government provided the rest of the funds. (4) Has the Victorian Government agreed to provide funding to Mt Beauty Timbers; if not, what reasons have they given.",152
38,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The MOU includes the following provisions: the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments will each provide $13.8 million to the Victorian FISAP; a hardwood timber industry development strategy will be completed by both Governments, in consultation with the hardwood timber industry, to provide a framework for the development of guidelines; guidelines for assistance will be jointly agreed by both Governments; a Forest Industry Development and Adjustment Committee, consisting of Commonwealth and State officials, will be established to implecommitment ment the program, assess applications and make recommendations to Ministers on the allocation of funds under the program; an Advisory Panel will be established by the relevant Commonwealth and State Ministers to provide views to both Governments on the progress and direction of the program; a Program Office will be established by Victoria to provide. support to the program and carry out day-today administrative and financial functions. (2) No. (3) No. I have advised Mount Beauty Timbers that the Commonwealth is prepared to provide a of the order of one-third of a restructuring proposal examined by PricewaterhouseCoopers. This assistance would be subject to an agreed investment strategy and be funded under and be subject to guidelines of the Commonwealth's FISAP. The provision of the remainder of the funds by the State Government is not a requirement. (4) While this is a matter for the Victorian Government, I understand that it has not agreed to provide funding to Mount Beauty Timbers, on the basis that licensed log supply commitments will be maintained.",152
