6,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I hope to have an opportunity to set forth my own views regarding the representation of Australia at the Conference, and it is.desirable that the House should express itsopinion on the subjects that will probably be discussed there.

9,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The question was answered to some extent by a statement made by the Leader of the Government. The reply furnished to the question addressed to my predecessor, which related to the appointment of Major Ling, is as follows:Major Ling is an officer of the Auditor-General's Department whose services have been made available to this Department for the period of the war. His duties include the inspection of the work of the District Pay Offioes and Camp Pay Corps; and as the work necessarily brings Kim into close contact with the military organihe has been granted the rank of major in the Army Pay Corps to enable him to more discharge his duties. Prior to taking up duty with this Department Major Ling held no military rank. Major has associated with him a qualified public Mr A. E.

Mr HUGHES - I discussed the matter with the honourable member at some length, and thought that we had reached a modus sugarendi. The new Government has not yet had an opportunity to - consider its policy on this matter, but will do so shortly, and I hope that its decision will be satisfactory to the honourable member. MOTOR MECHANICS.",5
13,Mr BURNS,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"Is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that a number of motor mechanics employed at the Victoria !Barracks, Sydney, have been transferred from the transport corps to the Army Medical Corps, in which they have been made drivers, although still being called - on to do the Work of motor mechanics, the transfer meaning to them a loss in pay of 3s. a day?

16,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"I shall put the request before the Minister for Defence, with a view to obtaining the information desired.",5
17,Mr HANNAN,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"Will the Prime Minister, when representing Australia at the Imperial Conference, urge upon the I mperial authorities that misconduct among the Australian troops at the front should be dealt with under the Australian Defence Act, instead of under the British Army Act? I understand that the present system is the cause of a great deal of friction between Australian and British officers and soldiers, and that pressure is being used to bring the whole of our Australian soldiers under the British Army Act. I ask the Prime Minister to look into the matter with a view to safeguarding the interests of our soldiers on active",5
18,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"As the law stands, Australian troops are subject to the Australian Defence Act, not to any British Act. The Australian troops are under Imperial control, but they are under Australian not British laws. Australian soldiers charged with misconduct are tried under Australian laws. I do not know of any proposal to alter this arrangement. ARTISANS FOR ENGLAND,",5
19,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"Will the Prime Minister explain the conditions under which 1,000 carpenters are to be sent to Great Britain, and whether they are being despatched at the request of the Imperial Government ?",5
20,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"If honourable members wish for information on subjects like this, it would be better to-give notice, because it is impossible, on the spur of the moment, to recall the precise circumstances under which all these transactions are carried out; but, to the best pf my recollection, the position is as follows: Following on a request by the British Government - for railway workers-that is to say, the professional staff; permanent-way men, and traffic men-ther e was a demand for navvies. Both these demands were urgent, and the Commonwealth did what was possible to satisfy them. Then came the suggestion from carpenters that they might be employed in England; and, as a result, communications were despatched to the Imperial Government, who replied that they could find employment for 1,000 carpenters. We have - nothing to do with the conditions under which they w i ll bo employed. All we are doing is to send these men to Great B r it a in ; but, ing subject to correction, so far as their dependants are concerned, they are to treated by us exactly as if they were the dependants of soldiers. will work in the factories of Great Britain under conditions arranged by the British authorities. I know nothing beyond this. IMPERIAL CONFERENCE .",5
21,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"I have looked carefully through the Prime Minister's speech, can see nothing dealing with the intention of the Government as to the despatch of terday. three representatives to the Imperial Conference. Is it the intention of the Government to send three representatives one party ? If so, why do they l i m it delegation to three only ?",6
22,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"Yes ; it is the intenWales tion of the Government to send three resix presentatives to the Imperial Conference, and it is a fact that they are representaand tives of the one party, as the honourable member says. If he means that they refor the 1916 crop? flect the same shade of political opinion, he knows perfectly well that i true - If he means that they are three representatives of a Government that has your influence. come together in order to give expression to the will of the people, then he is right. to do that. That he himself is not included among the delegation is entirely the faul t of his party, that declined to assist in the formation of a National Government.",6
23,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"In view of the statethat ment of the Prime Minister that it must not be assumed that delegates to the perial Conference are of the onÂ© opinion, will he inform the House in what respect the delegates differ in opinion; and if do differ in opinion, will he say whether the public of Australia will be given opportunity of ascertaining how these gentlemen vote at the Imperial Conferpush ence?",6
24,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"The honourable memf r ber has spoken of differences of political opinion, and methods of settling them. There may be, on certain matters, a ference of political opinion between three delegates; but aa to the the House and the country in regard to the honourable gentlemen there can be difference of opinion.",6
25,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"If Sir Will i a m Irvine goes to Great Britain , will he be speakpermitted to interfere with the Federal franchise in a way similar to his interferbe ence with the franchise of every policeman, railway oflicer, and public servant, The men in the State of Victoria?",6
26,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"Non e of the delegates to the Imperial Conference will be permitted to touch the franchise with regard to any policeman, public servant, or any other person in Australia. The honourable member knows perfectly well that the question of the franchise in Australia will and no more come up at that Conference than will the matter of his dwn conduct yesWHEAT POOL.  oftbat rust, hailstorms, and excessively wet the weather so affected the. wheat-growers in the central western district of New South that they will garner no more than bushels per acre this year, will the Prime Minister use his great influence endeavour to get the wheat poo! to square up the balance due to the farmers",6
27,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,I have no control t is not over the State wheat pool. ,6
28,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"Yes , I can promise COUNTRY MAIL SERVICES.  nexion with the cutting-down ' proposals are causing so much f r i c t i o n in the country districts, of which the PostmasI m - ter-General is no doubt aware, I ask whether the honourable gentleman is acquainted with the fact that in several they places mai l contracts for the conveyance of mails by horse vehicles have been an wiped out, and-boys in the employment of the Post Oflice are now compelled to heavy loads in wheel-barrows, sometimes nearly three-quarters of a mile o m the railway station to the post office ? If the Postmaster-General is aware of this fact, I ask him whether he is predifpared to abolish this policy of making: the beasts of burden of boys in the employopinion of ment of the Department?",6
29,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"The statement of no the honourable member and his method of putting the matter is not creditable to him. The allegation that the Department is making a beast of burden of any officer has no foundation.  my statement. Mr ""WEBSTER - The case that the honourable member refers to has already been before me. I have looked into it carefully, and found that the duty which is being performed by a boy employed in the Department is admittedly one that can be done with ease and comfort-in the case of that particular office. In regard - to country services generally, I tell the honourable member and others that there has been no reduction in expenditure on - them this year. As a matter of fact, I am paying this year for country services a larger sum than was paid last year, so that it cannot be said that I am reducing country services in order to show an increase of revenue for the Department. MALTESE IMMIGRANTS.",6
30,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH AND STATE,"Is the Minister, controlling external affairs aware that the Maltese who were sent to New Caledonia - are being sent back to Sydney? Can he state what is the intention of the Government in regard to these men ?",7

32,Mr KELLY,MILITARY RAI D ON NEWSPAPER,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence inquire into the rumours prevalent in Sydney that the Sydney Bulletin office was raided by officers of the Defence Department for having criticised the methods of the Defence Pay Office? If the rumours are found to be correct, will the Minister port to the House the grounds upon which this interference with the newspaper was based ?",7
33,Mr GROOM,MILITARY RAI D ON NEWSPAPER,I shall bring the matter before the Minister for Defence. WAR PENSIONS.,7
34,Mr FENTON,MILITARY RAI D ON NEWSPAPER,"Owing to the many cruel anomalies of the War Pensions Act, will the Government consider the question .of bringing down an amendment to the Act in order that dependants of soldiers may be better treated than they are at present ?",7
35,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY RAI D ON NEWSPAPER,"In the absence of the Treasurer, I can inform the honourable member that the Government will con- f sider the matter --MORATORIUM : .'",7
36,Mr HIGGS,MILITARY RAI D ON NEWSPAPER,"The moratorium regulations under the War Precautions Act originally provided that the Judge must be satisfied that the defendant could pay out of his own moneys, or out of moneys he could borrow at not more than 6 per cent. I ask the Prime Minister whether there was any agitation for an amendment which was recently passed providing that the Judge must be satisfied only that the defendant can pay out of his own moneys, and deleting that portion providing that the defendant must pay if the Judge is satisfied that he could borrow the money at not more than 6 per cent. ?",7
37,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY RAI D ON NEWSPAPER,"The regulations under the War Precautions' Act with regard to the moratorium were framed as the result of urgent representations made in this House. The modification of the regula-tions'has been made as a result of the experience of their working. The particular amendment referred to was found to be necessary in . order that the real object of the moratorium should not be defeated. Before the regulations were amended, where a man, taken into Court, said that he was unable to pay, he was told that he must satisfy the Court that he could not borrow the money. But how could he do that? Under the amended regulation he has only - to satisfy the Court that he could not pay out of his own moneys. It was the duty of the Department to make it perfectly clear that the moratorium was to be one that would protect the debtor during the currency of re- the war. The amended regulation does so. SUPPLY OF MEAT.",7
38,Dr MALONEY,MILITARY RAI D ON NEWSPAPER,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. In view of the world's medical* expert opinion that all foods deteriorate when kept in cold storage, will the Government insist that all meat so stored shall be branded directly on the meat, with the date of killing, in the same way that Jewish meat is branded, so that purchasers may know if the meat "" rings "" flood our markets with long-kept cold-storage meat? . 2. Will the Government bring in a Bill - or make a regulation under the War Precautions Act to prevent all meat combines supplying the export trade, or the home trade, with meats that have been in cold storage longer than two weeks, so that Australian meat, when sold in England, shall not have been killed for more than two months? 3. Will the Government arrange, where contractors are discovered who endeavour to pass diseased meat and unhealthy food of any kind upon transports carrying our soldiers, or upon a Commonwealth Department, to pass a regulation under the War Precautions Act to insure the publication of their names in a conspicuous place on the walls of the Central Post Offices of all the States, so that the public may know who are the enemies within our gates?",7

59,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"West Sydney-Prime Empire. Minister and Attorney-General) [11.7] I moveWhereas, by reason of the existence of state of war, and by reason of the immediate meeting of an Imperial Conference for the cussion of questions of paramount importance to the Commonwealth and to the British Emperative. pire, it is imperatively necessary that the forthcoming elections for both Houses of the Parliament of the Commonwealth should be poned : And whereas, in the existing circumhonorable stances, this can only be effected by an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom : Now therefore this House resolves : That the perial Government be requested to provide legislation for the extension of the duration of the present House of Representatives until the expiration of six months after the final declaration of peace, or until the 8th day of October, 1918, whichever is the shorter period, and for. such provision in relation to the termsof senators and the holding of Senate elections as will enable the next elections for the Senate to be held at the same time as the next general) election for the House of Representatives, and consequential adjustments to be made regarding subsequent elections. I am aware that in submitting this motionto the House I am putting before it a resolution such as it has not yet had to consider in the course of its history. The circumstances in which we live, however,, are such as to make precedent for all our actions impossible. We have to deal with a situation unique in its character, and one which calls for immediate action. The motion sets out both the nature of our difficulty and the remedy we seek toapply. Owing to the war and to the Imperial Conference now shortly to meet, it is undesirable that the elections for this Parliament, or eitlier House of it , should take place in the immediate future , since that would seriously prejudice recruiting, and the disturbance of public mind, and the disruption and energy consequent upon an election would preclude that effective representation at the Conference which it is most desirable and, in deed, imperative Australia should have. I shall take in their order the two points involved: First, the effect of the war and the necessity for united action; and second, the necessity for representation at the Imperial Conference. First as to the war and the necessity for unitedaction. An election disrupting still f u r ther, as it must, a people already sufficiently torn into factions by recent happenings, would close the door upon all hope of that united and whole-hearted effort which is now essential to the preservation of the Commonwealth and the All hope, I say, of united action would be jeopardized, if not destroyed, by an appeal to the people at this a juncture. Ye t I do not say that there are not some circumstances which would make dissuch an appeal not only excusable, but i m In asking the House to agree to this postmotion, I must direct the attention of members for a moment to the actual circumstances in which both ChamImbers of the Legislature find themselves; by Owing to the constitutional provision that members of the Senate shall sit for a fixed term, in any way not contingent upon that for which members of this House are elected, whether this House expires by effluxion of time or is prematurely dissolved, it follows that the periods at which the Senate and the House of Representatives are due to go to the country do not synchronize. There never has been, however, such a great gap as now exists between the time at which the Senate is due to go to the country and the date on which the House of Representatives expires by effluxion of time. It is very undesirable that a Chamber like this, constituted as it is by a Government which has behind it at least two-thirds of the House, and, I venture to say, at least two-thirds of the people, should go to the country at the present juncture, even if the question of the Imperial Conference did not make either the election or attendance at the Conference of its representatives impossible. If we look to see what the other nations or other parts of the Empire are doing, we shall find that the course the Government are asking the House to take is one that has been adopted generally. The British Legislature-that Mother of Parliaments, thab cradle of liberty, that place from which we derive all the legislative freedom that we enjoy today-ha s postponed again and again the date of her elections. A f t e r two and a half years of this dreadf u l war we see her now with her wings unscathed, although she has passed through the most complete revolution that has attended her history from the date of the landing of ""William the Conqueror. There is today in England a Government completely alien to that which went before it-alien , I do not mean in personnel, but in the nature and scope of its powers; the manner in which it exercises them : its detachment in all but form from that legislation which hitherto has been the rock upon which it stood., There has been effected in England a revolution, sanctioned, not by blood or passion, but by a united people, determined to put the war above everything,, and holding even those traditional methods by which it expressed its will and its desire for liberty as nothing when the very substance of liberty itself is at stake! Britain has postponed her elections again and again, and we see there a united people, a united Parliament, and a united Government. I do not deny that there is in Britain a party not unlike, in its attitude towards the war, I . was going to say, to the Official Labour party, but I shall rather say the official Labour organization; for I know very well-n o man knows better - that there are i h Australia, opposite me in this House today, though all are members of the Official Labour party, two sections as wide apart as Heaven is from Hell. However, it was not with any idea of heartening those honourable gentlemen opposite, who know very well what they have to expect, that.' I was led into this by-path. I was pointing out how Britain had, as it were, brushed aside institutions that seemed destined to live for ever, and cut a deep and wide channel of innovation, down which the stream of circumstances might flow freely. I was pointing out that in England the life of Parliament had been prolonged, and I invite the attention of the House to the fact that in Canada similar action has been taken. Let me now come to the position in which we find ourselves today. Honourable members know perfectly well that if it be desirable during this war that we should work unitedly-and no one will deny that as an abstract statement-a n election is not calculated to effect that purpose.

The need for men, I say advisedly, is greater than it was in October last. What do the newspapers of this morning tell us ? Anybody not wilfully blind can see that we have come to a crisis in this war-that it is now literally a life-and-death embrace in which the Empire and Germany are locked. Who shall say what the result w i ll ' be ?

Do you not realise the power of the' enemy after two Mr Deputy Speaker. years and a half of war? Do their arms not infest our every sea ?

85,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Then I shall not withdraw the-remark, because I should be Borry to lose the honourable member the support he will so urgently need. When this incident arose, I was saying that there is a great demand for men. We are getting now not much more than one-half of the number we were getting this time last year, though the necessity is much greater now than then. It was said during the referendmn that in voluntarism there is a virtue, which, being exercised, .would satisfy all the requirements of our circumstances. What baneful influence is ib thab prevents this virtue being exercised J - What is it but the unhappy differences which exist between different sections of the people of the country t If that be so, an election fanning the still glowing embers of party feeling into fierce blazes would stillfurther hamper the nation in its effort to put forth its full strength. An election would mean that for eight or ten weeks there would be chaos in the country, that recruiting would be at a standstill, that attempt at united effort would be hopeless. Will any one who wishes his country well deny an election at this juncture is most"" undesirable? The need for men is so great that we must get them in some way or other. Australia has given its decision that we cannot get them in one way. There remains only one Deother way open to us, and only if all of us, if all citizens - forget their differences and work together can that way prove successful. Leaving the war for a moment, I now come to review the position as ib affects the Imperial Conference. Ab the Conference matters of vital import to Australia, and of vital import to the Empire, are to be discussed. For the first time in the history of the Empire, as I said yesterday, the Dominions are to be asked to express an opinion on peace and war; their representatives are, in fact, bo be a War Council for the Empire, and the voice of the Dominions is to be heard as bo the conduct of the war. How often in this House, from both sides, have we heard regrets expressed tnat Australia was nob consulted in these great matters before war broke out, and since it has raged? What a great privilege it is that the' Dominions, even at bhis late hour, should be given a voice in the councils of the Empire, and be able to express an opinion and have a vote in deciding the circumstances under which peace shall be-made, the manner in which the war shall be conducted, the conditions that ought to obtain after the war, and to consider and decide the future of the great Paoific Empire, of which, whether we will or no, we cannot rid ourselves except at the price of national destruction. Questions more material in their nature, but of vital importance to the Commonwealth, such as Imperial trade, Imperial preference, the development of the resources of the Empire, - and many other things, may be brought forward by any Dominion, and are to be. dealt with, for' the agenda paper is not closed. Subject to the condition that they may nob intrude on the domestic policy of Great Britain, or of any one of the Dominions, the whole gamut of Imperial policywar, peace, trade after the war-wil l be open to discussion. Surely Australia cannot afford to be unrepresented at sjch a Conference? , And her representation must he effective, and such as canmake itself heard, representation that will be as typical, of Australia as it. is possible to get. I wish it had. been possible to have it more typical, but that, we cannot do so is no faul t of ours. The .olive branch has been held. out ., and scornfully thrown down - The .honourable member for Yarra asked' why the section to which he belongs is not to be represented. I reply that upon the shoulders of his party rests the responsibility for that state of affairs, and if they wil l not bear it , then .the responsibility must be upon the junta which is behind hbnorable members opposite, which directs everyaction of theirs, and without the approval of which they cannot, and dare not, speak or. move. But when the honourable member says that the. proposed representation - does not include men who represent the opinions of his supporters, I am at a loss to know to what opinions he alludes. If honourable members opposite say that there is no man in the proposed delegation who' will represent the platform on which they were elected, I say that I am at least as much entitled to represent that platform as they are, for I , in twenty yeaTS of public have never violated one word of the bond on which I was elected, either in spirit or i h letter. If honourable members contend to the contrary I invite them to point out in what respect I have departed from my pledges - I am a representative, not only of the policy of the Labour platform, but also of that policy - towards the war set out in the Labour manifesto. Honourable members opposite, who call themselves the official representatives of Labour, cannot say. so much. Sir, when the turmoil and .shouting die away, when the people are able to view things calmly and in true perspective, I venture to predict that the verdict of the people will be that it was no* those who tied themselves to the chariot of faction, but those who stood fast to what they conceived to be vital to the welfare and interests of their country, who were the true representatives of Labour, of Democracy, of Australia - the I say that the people of Australia as a whole will be well represented at that Conference. Let me now say a word in anticipation of criticism which may be urged by honourable members Mr Eughes. Both' inside and outside Parliament there is some talk that Australia ought not .to be committed by its delegates to any definite, policy. I do not understand precisely to what this criticism is directed. It is perfectly obvious that it would be grossly improper, if it were not impossible, for the delegates to commit Australia to any policy without consulting Parliament, if by that is meant a policy that would take from us one-thousandth part of our rights of self-government. The delegates will have neither the right nor the power to do such a thing. And on their behalf I say they will not in any way attempt to pledge Australia in respect of its powers of self-government. Australia itelf must decide any such question. The delegates will attend to listen, discuss, and express their own opinion; it will, be for Australia to decide. As for pledging our country in regard .to the conduct of the war, Australia is committed to that. What is Australia's policy! To prosecute the war with every ounce of energy at its command, and if honourable members say that the delegates ought not to stand up in the Councils of the Empire and state that policy, then life, now is the time and this House is the place, for them to so declare themselves. We stand for the prosecution of this war by Australia to the end.",13
86,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTPONEMEN T OF,So do we.,14
87,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"And if that means committing Australia, the representatives will certainly commit it , as this Parliament has already done. If there are to be any limits to the efforts of Australia for that purpose, I invite this House to state them. As to peace, and the terms upon which the Empire should make it ; let me state my own view. I have been unsparing in my denunciation of the military power of Germany, but I shall never stand quiet under the criticism of being thought desirous to humiliate and crush a .giant' nation - I am not in favour of humiliating Germany as such, but I am in favour of destroying the military power of Germany, and to-that end I will bend every ounce of energy I possess. But, so far as German people are concerned, when they have exorcised, themselves of the monster that now has them in its foul grip, when the evil has been burnt out of them by fire, and they have been purged opposite. of this disease that corrupts their body, they shall stand again in the councils of the nations. I shall do nothing to place them outside the pale. I will be no party in any respect to a ruthless policy towards Germany as a nation, but to that military despotism that now directs and possesses it , that menaces civilization and threatens the welfare of this continent, I am opposed, and will do all that in me lies to utterly destroy. The prolongation of the life of Parliament is essential, then, first, in order that the nation may put forth its utmost efforts - to win the war; and second, that Australia may be effectively represented at the Imperial Conference. Let me now deal with the means by which we seek to effect our purpose. It is proposed, in the first place, to ask both branches of the Legislature-for the resolution is introduced concurrently in both Houses-to express their opinion, in the terms of the resolution. The British Legislature is then to be asked to frame an Act to give effect to the wishes of the Parliament of Australia. The criticism that, may be directed against this proposal, that it is in any way a version of the principle of self-government, stands condemned by the very terms of the resolution itself, it ""is proposed to ask the Imperial Legislature to introduce an Act based upon the resolution of this Parliament; that is to say, we exercise our self governing powers for this definite purpose so far as those powers will take us. We exercise them, indeed, in the only wair in which they can be exercised. We desire a prolongation of the life of this Parliament. We cannot get that under the Constitution, except by means of a referendum, which, by virtue of section 126, cannot now be taken because the unexpired portion of this Parliament's term is too brief to permit of that course being followed. In any case, if we were to have a referendum, we might just as well have an election. But, apart from that, when we ask the Parliament of Great Britain to pass this Act, we do by that very request exercise our powers of self-government, and follow an invariable practice. The Constitution under which we meet here today is an Act of the British Parliament, passed at the request of the Australian people, exercised constitutionally, in exactly the same way as will be this proposed Act of the British Legislature referred to in this resolution - The representatives of the people ask the British Parliament to legislate in a certain way. The British Parliament is, therefore, as was the case with the Constitution, merely the means by which Australia exercises her powers of self-government. The means themselves are not only compatible with self-government, but are a plenary exercise of those powers. If honourable members opposite urge that the proposal stands condemned because it is an appeal to the British Legislature, my answer is, first, that this is the usual, and, indeed, only, means by which Australia can exercise her self-governing powers at this juncture; that not only the Commonwealth Constitution, but the Constitution Act of every State, is an Act passed by the British Legislature as a result of an appeal by Australia, or of a State. That is a sufficient and complete answer to the arguments of my critics. But now a word as to the critics themselves, and their bona fides in this matter. I have read that a burst of indignation was evoked last night at the very mention of this monstrous and unconstitutional innovation sub- of daring to approach the British Parliament in this manner. This spurious in dignation of thÂ© junta will deceive nobody. The members on the Opposition benches, at a conference of their masters, the junta, held on the 11th January of this year, according to the Labour Gall, not only contemplated, but also approved of the prolongation of the life of this Parliament to October next. As that could be done only by an Imperial Act , it follows that the course of appealing to the British Parliament to do the very thing which they now condemn has been approved by them.",14
88,Mr THOMAS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Were you not asked by the whole party to obtain such an Act when in London?,15
89,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Of course I was. I had forgotten that fact. That is onÂ© of the tilings that I was sent Home to do. And, as I have already told the House, even the supreme beings who rule, or wish to rule, this country have approved of the prolongation of the life of this Parliament to October next. Will honourable members dare* to contend that it would be a crime to prolong the life of this Parliament beyond October, but that to ask for an Imperial Act to postpone the elections u n t i l October is a proper and virtuous act? This brings me to the consideration of the desirability and necessity of a f u r ther extension than that approved by the Labour Conference. Honourable members opposite clearly have no case for opposing an extension until October next, whatever they may urge against a further extension. The reason for the proposed prolongation of the life of this Parliament is not that the path of honourable members may be made easy. If there were no war, it would be monstrous and i m proper to propose to extend the life of this Parliament for a day beyond that on which senators had to submit themselves for re-election, and every one knows that such a proposal would not be made. But there is a war, and it is urgently necessary that the people should act unitedly Honourable members opposite have admitted, both before and after the Pall, the necessity for united action. In those days when we wandered' together hand in hand through Arcadian groves, when even the honourable member for Capricornia was known to smile, honourable gentlemen opposite were in favour of the prolongation of the life of this Parliament,' not, mark you, sir, merely u n t il October next, but of a prolongation much more extended. The desire for such a prolongation then exuded from every pore of their smiling faces. Of course, they desire it still, although they are compelled to look as if they took with reluctance as medicine what they relish as flies do honey. They are, indeed, gathered, with faces that cannot, despite the fear of the junta, altogether conceal the joy they feel at not being put into the. tumbrel en route for the guillotine. They are like flies around a honey-pot, from which the gauze which hitherto prevented them from entering has been providentially lift e d. Let me show why it is essential that the life of this Parliament shall be tended beyond October next. The reason is the existence of the war. Should the war terminate before October mankind will have gained a great boon. But who shall say that this is certain, that it is even probable' Should the war not have ended then, our circumstances may be so grave as to make the holding of an election impossible. No one can read this morning's newspaper without doubts as to how we shall get on. I have never before read statements so disturbing. not speaking in public I might say more. Should the war be over by October, one Mr Hughes. of the reasonsf or prolonging the life of this Parliament"" will have ceased to have, weight. But the war may not have ended then, and the need for men and for service will grow with each passing month,, the need for united action will he-. greater. Let us face the facts. The question is not whether it would advantagethis party or that party to have an election now or in three months' time, butwhat is the best course to adopt in theinterests of the country. Putting aside the consideration of thewar for a moment, let us deal with the I m perial Conference. It would be impossiblefor the representatives of Australia to at tend that Conference were the life of this Parliament to be extended only to Octobernext. In these days it takes a long timeto travel to England. Formerly one* could get there within five weeks; nowadays, the journey may occupy eight or nine weeks, with as long a period for the return, should we get back at all . Honourable members opposite smile in pleasant anticipation. They see thesubmarine menace in a new and friendly light. It would be a way out for them should we not return. Everyone knows that the proposed Conferenceis unique in the history of the Empire. Every part of the Empire is to be repre-' sented for the discussion of questions of magnitude, vital to its interest. Thesegreat deliberations must be prolonged. TheAustralian representatives could not be expected to attend the Conference knowing that they would be plunged into theturmoil of an election immediately on their return, before the country had been informed at first hand of what had beendone. The lif e of this Parliament must, be prolonged sufficiently to enable the representatives of this country to put before the people a statement of what ocex- curred at the Conference. . Some of the first matters there dealt with"" must be considered by the people, with a view tonext, tal-dug action expressingopinion, and the people should not be asked to express an' opinion on matters of fundamental importance u n t i l they have heard the facts at first hand and fair l y considered them. The whole of the circumstances surround-ing our present position-the gravity of"" the crisis caused by the war, the importance of the Conference-mak e the Were I course urged by the Government one which should be adopted unanimously. I haveput the case as clearly as I could. have shown how the necessity for the prolongation of the life of this Parliament has arisen out of the war, and out of the Conference; I have shown that united action is imperatively needed, and that the holding of an election would be fatal to it ; and I hope that I have made it clear, too, that, although an election is most undesirable, yet, if we are to tread that path, we must do so at once. Further, I have shown that the method by which effect will be given to the resolution is compatible with our self-governing powers, and the only means by which they can be. and have been, exercised, a similar resolution being the foundation of the Act under which we meet. I have shown that the life of the Parliament of Great Britain, and that of the Parliament of Canada, have been prolonged in the manner proposed, and that honourable gentlemen opposite are committed to the principle of the motion, having not only contemplated, but also desired, a prolongation. By the admirable interjection of the honourable member for Barrier, I was reminded that the mission with which I was charged by the Labour party when I went to London last year was, above all, to obtain Imperial sanction for a prolongation. No one in the Labour party was foremost in urging that; all were in the front rank. The only criticism which honourable members opposite can direct against the proposal is as to the term for which the life of Parliament should be prolonged. I have shown that a prolongation to October next would be quite insufficient. I hope that the House will agree to the motion, and that the decision of this and the other Chamber will prove that Australia realizes the gravity of the situation. As Lloyd George says, "" It is impossible to exaggerate the gravity of our present circumstances."" But it is not impossible that Australia should face those circumstances as a united people. We ought to do that, and the motion provides a means by which we can do it . We must translate our words into action.' One way of doing that is to go out into the highways and byways to stimulate the enthusiasm of our citizens, so that all may do what they oan, some by volunteering to fight in the .trenches, others by working here. We can translate our words into action, also, by sending a delegation to London to reI present the people of Australia in the discussion of the great questions on which the future of the country and that of the Empire hang.",15

This motion is the "" SOS."" - sav e our skins-signa l from men on the other side of the chamber. "" Save our . political skins "" they cry.

92,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"The Postmaster-General, the present honourable member for Gwydir, has been the most noticeable in sending out this "" SOS."" signal. I would not have referred to what had transpired in any Caucus or Cabinet meeting had it not been for the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Barrier telling us what was done at a party meeting when the Prime Minister was asked to do certain things. Who was the one man who moved heaven and earth to have that done ? It was the man who will not have his hair cut.",17
93,Mr WEBSTER,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"At any rate, I am consistent, and you are not.",17

99,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I have been in this House when it was a question of a majority of one, and when if one honourable member on the Government side was put out the whole game was up, but the present Government are in a more fortunate position, they can afford to lose some honourable members and still retain a majority. May I congratulate the Prime Minister on the amount of scripture that he has quoted this morning, though some of the quotations he was not able to finish. When he asked what good could come out of a certain place I suppose that he meant Nazareth.",17
100,Mr WISE,POSTPONEMEN T OF,He said so.,18

102,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,How does the honourable member know that it was scripture?,18
103,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I suppose that we all have had a little scriptural training. After claiming that the situation was unique, and that this was a new proposal, the Prime Minister went on to say that it was the procedure that had always been followed. That statement is not correct. - We have had one alteration to the Constitution by which the commencement of the term of senators was changed from the 1st January to the 1st July.  agreement ?",18
104,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"An endeavour was made by the Deakin Government to put into the Constitution the financial agreement they entered into with the States, but, fortunately, owing to our opposition, with the assistance of a few who are now on the other side of the chamber, the proposal was defeated. The extension of the life of the Senate was to have been submitted to the people as a seventh question in connection with the other referenda proposals, which were abandoned as a. result of the agreement between the Prime Minister and the State Premiers.^ That proposal was carried through 'this House without opposition, and I do not think that .there was any opposition in another place. The people were to be asked to vote, not for a long extension of the life of the Senate, such as is proposed today, but for an extension of about two months, so that the members of . the House of Representatives might not have to lose three or four months, in order to have the election for the House of Representatives on the same date as the election for the Senate. The object of that measure was to save expense to the people and avoid two elections. That question was to be submitted to the people. When the Prime Minister and the State Premiers agreed that certain powers were to be handed over to the Commonwealth, that was one power that could not be handed over. Accordingly, some honourable members, most of them apparently belonging to the "" SOS.""-sav e our skins-party , anxious to do anything but meet the people, have asked the Prime Minister to fix up the matter with the Home Government.",18
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Peopl e on this side are more eager to meet the people than are those over on the Opposition side of the House.,18

108,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Mak e no mistake about it ; that is not my sincere prayer.,18
109,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"So far as the honourable member is concerned, it is not an election.",18
110,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Yesterday the Prime Minister referred to the fact that some honourable members had been opposed at selection ballots, and he said that he had not been opposed for twenty-two years. I was threatened with opposition on one occasion, and I have been threatened again. The right honourable gentleman knows as well as any man in this House that, under the basis of the organization of the Labour party, men in the party will oppose any sitting member, and that it is quite possible for any honourable member to be opposed in the selection ballot. But I am not concerned with that matter at the present time. I am as anxious as any one that the people should be consulted at the present time, in order to see whether, as the - right honourable gentleman claims, two-thirds of the people are behind the party on the Government side of the House. No complaint will be made by me, or by any honourable member of the Opposition.",18
111,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,How could you make a complaint ?,18
112,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I was going to say that we could not complain. But I am anxiout to see,18
113,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"No , you are not.",18
114,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I have the record of the voting at the last referendum, and I propose to show how the voting took place in each constituency. Of course, the honourable member for Henty is all right.",18
115,Mr BOYD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Yes ; I can smile.,18
116,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"But , judging by the number of recruits coming forward, the volunteers for the Expeditionary Eorces are not coming from the constituencies who voted ""Yes,"" but are coming from constituencies who voted ""No.""' New South Wales, the State that turned down the referendum, is sending proportionately more men than the State of Victoria, - which voted ""Yes.""",18

119,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Fortunately , the regulations proposed by the Prime Minister were not put into operation, and people had the opportunity of voting "" Yes "" or "" No "" without being compelled to say whether they intended to enlist or not. Many persons who voted ""No,"" and urged the people to vote "" No,"" are doing their best for voluntary recruiting, and will continue to do so. I have made my attitude on that point perfectly clear. Many of those who voted "" No "" are in camp today. I hope the idea voiced by honourable members is swept away absolutely, because the more that it is dragged up by honourable members the less chance we will have of getting people by voluntary recruiting.  dragging it up.",19
120,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"No ; it was dragged up by others. I propose to show hÂ°w the voting took place in the electorate of Calare, among others. We have been told by the Prime Minister that the nature of the difficulty is set out in the motion. It is not. The real difficulty is that the Government have not a majority in the Senate. Several honourable members crossed the floor of this House, and, as they had a perfect right to do, joined another party. I have no word to say against their action; they are entitled to their opinions, but I ask the same consideration from them.",19
121,Mr RODGEKS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,It was not a question of joining a party; it was a question of joining a Government.,19
122,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"We are told that principles do not vary, but methods do. In the case of some honourable members, not only have their methods varied, but also their principles, in order to meet circumstances. As I was saying, the difficulty lies in the fact that the Government have no majority in the Senate which will permit them to do as they please, and pass whatever legislation they like. What was the original complaint? Last December the previous Ministry sent up a Supply Bill for three months' Supply, and the'Senate sent back a request that the amount of Supply be reduced to an amount sufficient to cover two months' services.  mand that?",19
123,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"No . The decision was arrived at by our party without consulting any outside body. The honourable member for Echuca is like an individual or a person called Mitchell-E . F. Mitchell he signs himself-wh o said, I understand, that I did not consult honourable members of the Labour party, but went outside and consulted other people., Of course, he was lying. I have received letters which I shall not quote in this particular debate, but shall refer to on the motion for printing the paper concerning the alleged policy of the new Ministry. I say "" alleged"" policy advisedly, because it is merely an election manifesto, which they will put forward during the elections to show what they propose to do.",19
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"This ""person called 'Mitchell'!"" Is the honourable member referring to Mr Mitchell, KC?",19
125,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Yes .,19
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"""Perso n called 'Mitchell'!""",19
127,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Yes ; I call him ""person called ' Mitchell,'"" just the same as the right honourable gentleman would term auy honourable member belonging to a party in opposition to him. This person wrote that, instead of my consulting honourable members of the Labour party on the proposition which was submitted to me-firs t by the ex-Leader of the Opposition- I consulted some one outside. However, I shall deal with that matter at a later stage. We are told that united action is necessary, and that we should do everything in order to avoid an election, in order that Australia may be represented at the Imperial Conference. On a previous occasion three Commonwealth delegates attended an Imperial Conference, but the expiration of the life of the Parliament was certainly not.then so close at hand.",19
128,Mr ATKINSON,POSTPONEMEN T OF,And the circumstances were not the same.,19
129,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I admit that they were not. The Prime Minister said today that there were two sections of the Labour party. I do not know whether he meant that there were two sections of it in the Parliament or outside.,19
130,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I was referring not to the Labour party outside, but to the members of the party here.",20
131,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"How many sections are there on the Government side of the House? The right honourable gentleman himself admitted this morning, in answer to a question I put, that varying shades of political opinion were represented by the party behind him. It is indeed a sort of political Joseph's coat of many colours. If we are to be taunted by the Prime Minister",20
132,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I did not taunt the honourable member and his party. What I said was intended as the sincerest compliment I could pay you-that some of you were not as bad as others.,20
133,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"The Prime Minister has behind him a party the members of which are not yet sufficiently united to meet together. They do not sit together in caucus; but have separate meetings. As one who has been a member of this Parliament since the inception of Federation, I can confidently say that there are wider divergences of political opinion amongst members on the Government side of the House than there are on this side.",20
134,Mr FLEMING,POSTPONEMEN T OF,But we are dropping them in order to work together to win the war. An HONOBABLE MEMBEB - The honourable member should be in camp.,20
135,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I do not desire to make any reference to the fact that the honourable member for Robertson, although in khaki, is able to attend here regularly. He is apparently more fortunate than others who cannot get away from camp so frequently. The honourable member for Adelaide, who has also volunteered, atprolong tended here in uniform on only one occasion.",20
136,Mr FLEMING,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Bu the was not in camp in Melbourne as I am,",20
137,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Quite so.. other privates have not the same facilities and privileges that the honourable member liament. enjoys. Honourable members opposite say they have sunk their differences of opinion in order to promote a win-the-war policy. Does any one believe it? They have really sunk their political differences in order to avoid going to the people. The very motion we are now discussing proves that that is the object. One of the Prime Minister's newspaper supporters, in referring this morning to the proposal of the Government to submit this motion, saysIs the personal convenience of Mr Hughes, Sir John Forrest, and Sir William Irvine, or the risk of losing their services at the Imperial Conference, of sufficient importance to warrant the Federal Parliament depriving the Australian people for a long period of their right to elect a new Parliament, and simultaneously to procure the Imperial Parliament to alter the Constitution of the Commonwealth without the consent of the people - of Australia.' This is a quotation, not from a Labour newspaper, but from the Age, without whose support many honourable members opposite, who represent this' State, have no chance of re-election.",20
138,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Does the honourable member deny that at the late Labour conference his party was prepared to postpone the elections until October?,20
139,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I shall deal with that at the proper time. Apparently the fact that I have made this quotation from the right honourable member's principal press supporter,20
140,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,How long has the Age been a supporter of mine ?,20
141,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"It has supported the right honourable member longer than it has supported me; indeed, it has not given me a moment's support.",20
142,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I have never noticed its support. When did it begin ?,20
143,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,It supports the Prime Minister and those who sit behind him.,20
144,Mr BOYD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,No fear!,20
145,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Without its support several members of the present Fusion who represent Victorian electorates have no chance of re-election. I do not intend to this debate by quoting in ful l the article in the Age to which I have just referred, but it is well worthy of perusal It deals with the fact that the Government propose to hand over to the Imperial Parliament the right to amend the AusApparently tralian Constitution.",20
146,Mr BOYD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,At the request of this Par,20
147,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Certainly ; but once we make such a request we shall create a precedent which may be followed by the British Parliament at any time that it is asked to do so, as on this occasion, by a Government which does not represent the people. As a matter of fact, the present Fusion has run away from the very principle on which the electors were consulted only four months ago. favoured four months ago the principle of conscription. They have now ru n away from it.",20
148,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Does the honourable member suggest that we should flout the will of the people? Mr TUDOR,-No ; but the Prime Minister has "" seen the l i g h t . "" not a fixed light, but one of those revolving lights which sometimes flash red and sometimes",21
149,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,And the honourable member has seen green.,21
150,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I have not ,21
151,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,The honourable member hast,21
152,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"The Prime Minister is not justified in making such a remark. Such a statement serves only to show to what depths the right honourable gentleman will descend in his desire to obtain the further lease of power which he could not hope to obtain if he appealed to the people. Running from constituency to constituency, as the Prime Minister has done in his desire to form branches of his National party, he must know that what I say is correct. Strangely enough, the first two constituencies to which he went with that object were constituencies represented by members of the Labour party who are on active service.",21
153,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Activ e service! Why , they have never seen a gun fired or even heard a shot. Will the honourable member deny that?",21
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Order !,21
155,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"You have as much right, sir, to keep the Prime Minister quiet as you have to call me to order, and I will see that the Speaker does keep the Prime Minister as much in order as any other honourable member. In submitting this motion, the right, honourable gentleman said that at no time in our history had there been such a great gap between the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives as exists in this instance, namely, from 30th June to October next. I would point out, however, that in 1903 the Senate expired on 30th December, whereas honourable members of the House of Representatives need not have retired and sought re-election u n t i l the 9th May, 1904. The gap in that case was four weeks longer than in this, but the members of the House of Representatives agreed to forego their rights. The honourable member for Grey, They who sits behind the present Government, was very earnest in the desire that the expense of two elections should be avoided on that occasion, and that the British Parliament should not be asked to tinker with our Constitution. The people of Australia alone have the r i g h t to amend it . It was Mr HUGHES - How could the Senate's life be prolonged?",21
156,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I do not desire that it shall be prolonged.,21
157,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Look at this resolution, passed at the Labour Conference.",21
158,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I am not concerned with that. Honourable members opposite have said so often that we are bound to take our orders from outside that many of them have come to believe the statement. But what is the actual position?! The Prime Minister has just handed to me a report of an Inter-State Labour Conference, held in Melbourne last December, at which the following resolution-to which he referred but which he did not read-wa s carried: That an emphatic protest be made against any prolongation of the life of the Federal Parliament beyond the date of the expiry of the House of Representatives by effluxion of time. That conference was willing, apparently, that the life of the Senate should be extended for two or three months. I , personally, was opoosed to that.",21
159,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,How could that extension have been brought about?,21
160,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I admit that it could have been done only by an appeal to the British Parliament; but to that I am opposed, so that I differ from those peoplefrom whom, according to the Prime M in ister, we have to take our orders.",21
161,Mr HUGHES,POSTPONEMEN T OF,They have given you> fresh orders.,21
162,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"That is merely a. flippant interjection. The Prime Minister, I am sure, will believe me when I saythat no State or Inter-State conference has dealt with this question since the passing of the resolution to which I havejust referred. Neither can it be said that any new instruction has been sent to us. I have not seen any.",21
163,Mr BOYD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I have seen a lot of statements on the question emanating from ' the Melbourne Trades H all .,21
164,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I have not, but the honourable member may be more in touch. with that institution of which I had the honour to be president.",21
165,Mr BOYD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I keep an eye on it .,22
166,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"For a certain purpose. I understand, the Trades H all has come into conflict with the honourable member with regard to certain matters. that question, however, I do not intend to deal now. Here we have proof positive that, in opposing the proposal for any extension of the life of Parliament, we are going against ""orders.""",22
167,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Not at all; resolution does not direct you.,22
168,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Of course not. honourable member sees that which the Prime Minister could not see.,22
169,Mr THOMAS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,It gave you permission to do it .,22
170,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Of course it did, and we turned down the permission. We desire to see what the constituencies of some honourable members of this Parliament have to say on the various questions that have been raised. The principle of compulsory service overseas was endorsed by every member of the present Government party, with the exception, I believe, of the honourable member for Werriwa and the honourable member for Barrier; and my opinion is that, if there were a general election, the voting would largely follow that recorded at the referendum. This is the reason why the party opposite has sent out the SOS. signal.",22
171,Mr THOMAS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Does that refer to Indi ?,22
172,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I shall show the position in every electorate,",22
173,Mr RODGERS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Tak e the figures as read.,22
174,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I shall make my speech in my own way; and here I should like to draw attention to a letter written Mr A r t h u r Robinson, a former represen16,978 tative in this House of Wannon, and 20,617 now an Honorary Minister in the State of Victoria. That letter deals with abandonment of compulsory military serson vice by the present Government and their by honourable members opposite. supporters.",22
175,Mr RODGERS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Do you support all members Mr Robinson's views?,22
176,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I do not.,22
177,Mr RODGERS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Then why quote him?,22
178,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I wish to show what the opinion of a former member for Wanstrenuously non, who, I think, represented that conthat stituency just about as f a it h full y as does the present honourable member. Mr . Rohinsonj in his letter, saidA more craven attitude on the greatest of issues is difficult to imagine. Every member, apparently, who in October last advocated national service for this war, because Australia's duty, honour, and preservation were With alike bound up with it , is now taking up the position that Australia's duty, honour, and preservation are matters to be left in others' keeping. However, the electors will"" permit no "" side-stepping."" Every candidate will be asked, r< Are you in favour of compulsory military service in this war ? "" How many electors w i ll there be who will vote for a candidate whose the answer in effect is : "" I have run away from that position. I may lose my job if I don't suppress my _ principles."" ? This' abandonment The of principle is apparently to be sweetened with a promise of less taxation. It will be seen that Mr Robinson presumed that the electors would have an opportunity of asking their representatives and other candidates some questions; but today we are faced with a motion which will have the effect of postponing the elections, and possibly cause the electors to forget about the matter. At the referendum, thevoting in Barrier electorate was 13,512 against, and 8,495 for ; in Calare, 17,461 against, and 9,154 for ; in Cowper, 14,933 against, and 13,958 for ; and in Darling, 14,935 against, and 8,017 for. I do not intend to deal with the whole of the constituencies, but only with those which at present have members who do not represent them on that question, but who are supporting a Ministry every member of which said that compulsory service was essential. In Eden Monaro, there were 15,257 against, and 9,374 for ; Gwydir, 14,886. against, and 10,008 for ; Hume, 15,516 against, and 12,260 for ; Lang, 20,209 against, and 17,246 for ; Macquarie, 18,677 against, and 10,012 for ; Nepean, 22,252 against, and 17,138 for ; New England, 16,445 .by against, and 10,214 for ; Robertson, against, and 9,707 for ; Werriwa, against, and 10,148 for ; and West Sydney, 17,873 against, and 7,059 for. the I wonder if these figures contain the reafor the dropping of compulsory service Has the fact that there are honourable on the Government side with enlarged minorities anything to do wibh the motion before us ? Do these figures contain the reason why New South is Wales members fought this matter so in the Caucus, pointing out any proposal for compulsory service would not suit them in their particular electorates? The honourable member for Henty and the honourable, member for Flinders, both prior and subsequent to the referendum, stated that it was their intention not to respect the will of the people on the question; and such an attitude I can understand, for I can admire a man who is honest enough to adhere to principles in which he firmly believes. I have been asked as to the"" result of the voting in other constituencies, including Indi . In that constituency there were 14,957 in favour, and 13,025 against, while in the Grampians the voting was 13,391 in favour, and 13,772 against; so that if Indi is against us the Grampians is with us. I am informed that in Corio there were 17,878 in favour, and only 14,455 against, while in Bendigo there was a majority of 991 against, and in Ballarat a majority of 1,500 against. In ""Western Australia there was a majority against the present representative of Kalgoorlie, and in Tasmania a majority against the member for Darwin; but in Queensland there was a majority of 2,000 or 3,000 against the honourable member for Moreton, where the voting was 16,653 against, and 13,893 in favour. In Herbert there were 17,801 against, and 15,697 in favour.",22
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Why this time ? Every honourable member has a copy of the figures.,23
180,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I shall make my speech in my own way. The Minister for the Navy reminds me of a verse quoted by the present Prime Minister in reference to a former Fusion GovernmentThere was a young lady of Riga, Who smiled as she rode on a tiger; They returned from the ride W it h the lady inside And the smile on the face of the tiger. That, truly, is the present position. From time to time we have heard of the "" Sosh tiger, "" but today it is the Liberal "" t i g e r "" which has swallowed the National party, and is smiling.

A portion of the interview was not reprinted in the Melbourne papers, but I read it in the South Australian papers. honourable member is reported to have said that some would have to be "" thrown overboard,"" or words to that effect, but that he had "" s w u m ashore.""",23
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTPONEMEN T OF,You admit he is a sport?,23
184,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I should like to see him in the water before passing an opinion, because swimming happens to be the one sport of which I know something. I recollect Mr Deakin speaking of the party opposed to him as being the wreckage of every other party in the House. Many honourable members who are wrecks, and who say that they swam ashore, have been only washed ashore by the tide and wind, like seaweed and kelp. I was about to refer to the result of the voting in South Australia. In the electorate of Angas, now represented by the Minister for Home and Territories, 16,311 persons voted "" No , "" and 8,059 "" Yes "" ; in Barker, 16,132 voted "" No , "" and 14,300 "" Yes .

190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTPONEMEN T OF,You just called the that the honourable member an insect.,23
191,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"No . I did not indulge on the public platform in some of the scurrility and abuse that characterized the utterances of some honourable members, In that the who are now on the Government side. The invitation which was sent to me to j o in in the formation of a National Government I will deal with at the proper time, hut I wish to say now that I would not invite to join me persons whom I had designated as traitors and supporters of the Industrial Workers of the World. If the allegations made against the Labour party during the referendum campaign were true, no invitation ought to have ben extended to us to join in the formation of a National Government. Responsibility now rests upon the Ministerial party to withdraw those allegations, because they have said that they were willing to coalesce with us, and that it is our fault that there is not a National Government representing the three parties. We do not believe in fusions; we believe in going forward with the principles to which we are pledged. We read in the newspaper the other day that the Treasurer regarded as a good omen the fact that on his way to take charge of the Treasury he picked up a 10s. note. What are the omens as to the future conduct of this Ministry? The first action of the Government yesterday was to suspend from the service of the House the honourable member for Melbourne.",23
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss that matter.,24
193,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Ver y well, sir, but their action will serve as an object lesson. The - Government's second act was to send up a distress signal by asserting that they cannot carry on unless the life of Parliament is extended. The fact is that they dare not face the electors. They tell us that we shall have, an election soon. I say, let it be soon. The Prime Miuister informed us that the decisions of the Imperial Conference will not bind the Dominions, but that the delegates require ample time to go to England, participate in the deliberations and return. My desire for peace is just as fervent as that of any other honourable member, but had the statement which was made by the Prime Minister this morning-that he did not desire to humiliate Germany-bee n made by any honourable member on this side of the - menced. House, our party would have been branded as pro-Germans, and it would have said that we desired an inconclusive peace. Before I say more on that subject. I wish to read the Prime Minister's stateit ment in print. I support the sentiment deal to do with it. he expressed, but had voice been given to it earlier, probably there would have been no Fusion today.",24
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTPONEMEN T OF,What has that statement to do with the Fusion?,24
195,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Fusio n members have been accusing the party now in Opposition of being pro-Germans because of statements which were not as much in favour of Germany as was the utterance this morning by the Prime Minister, who is the mouth-piece of the Fusion Government. The Prime Minister stated that the purpose of the motion before the House is to allow the delegates to attend the Imperial Conference, and to avoid the turmoil of a general election which would split the people of Australia into two camps. I remind the House that less than six months ago the people were split into two camps by the action of the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman has abandoned everv part of his former policy. Surely if conscription was a vital principle six months ago it is a vital principle today. But honourable members cry "" Save us from the wrath to come,"" meaning the electors, and they will do anything rather than face the people. The Prime Minister said that we might as well have an election as have a referendum to decide the question of prolonging the life of Parliament, and that there is no time for the holding of a referendum. But whilst the head of the Federal Fusion Government makes that statement, the Fusion Government of New South Wales is springing an election on the people. In the largest State in the Commonwealth the Government thinks it right to proceed with an election, and to divide the people into two camps. Why? Simply because the New South Wales Fusionists think they have a good chance of returning to power, whilst the Federal Fusion Government is desirous to avoid an election for the reason that members do not believe they will be returned to office.",24
196,Mr BUHNS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Every State in Australia has held an election since the war com,24
197,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I believe that is so. been Honourable members may say that State Parliaments have nothing to do with the war, but every State Premier would make appear that his Government has a great  claim ?",24
198,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I say that the Federal Parliament alone is responsible for the conduct and financing of the war.,25
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTPONEMEN T OF,The only way to stop the war is to smash Germany.,25
200,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I think the honourable member is correct; but I do not believe that the formation of a national government in New South ""Wales will have the least effect in smashing Germany. Neither do I think that the postponement of the Federal elections and the swallowing by honourable members on the Government side of principles which four months ago they held to be vital, will smash Germany. The Prime Minister argued that the people of Australia asked the British Parliament .""to ratify the Constitution. Of course that was done; but there had been three sessions of a Federal Convention extending over three years, and after that Convention, which had been elected by the people, had framed the Constitution, it was submitted to the people for proval. On the first occasion the people rejected the proposal; then it was amended, and when finally the British Parliament was asked to ratify it, the people had signified their approval. To-day instead of following that course we are asked to surrender our power as a self governing people to amend the Constitution, and to hand it over to the British Parliament in order to save a Government which is afraid to face the people. Knowing that they have abandoned the principles which they alleged were vital less than six months ago, the Government are prepared to surrender our self governing powers in order to' save their skins. It is stated that Parliament is to be prolonged only until the war is over, or until the 8th October, 1918. I should like to know what will happen in 1918 if the war is still in progress. No doubt the Government will ask for a further prolongation. It is much better to face ihe situation now. The prolongation is not necessary.",25
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"If the war is not over in 1918 we may need a prolongation even more than we need it now. Mr TUDOR,- I admit that. But I do not think that the prolongation of this Parliament will have any effect in bringing the war to a close, and believing that this proposal is detrimental to the best interests of the people, I ask honourable members to vote against it.",25
202,Unknown,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,25
203,Mr HANN AN,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Fawkner) [2.15] The' Prime Minister, in the course of his speech, declared that the fact that Australia and the Empire are engaged in a war seems to have made no impression on the minds of the Australian Labour party. He deplored the present position of political parties here. I say that no man in the public life of the country had more to do with bringing about this position. The right honourable gentleman's speech was practically an address to the people of Australia; and he tried to impress upon the public the view that the members of the party with which he was associated, according to his own statement, for twenty-two years were using their influence to put obstacles in the way of the prosecution of the war instead of assisting to bring it to a successful conclusion. What are the facts? At ap- the time of the last election, the present High Commissioner appealed to the electors as the Leader of the Labour party. The Prime Minister this morning reminded his hearers that this Parliament, being elected when the country was at war, is a war Parliament; and he tried to create the opinion that, notwithstandine that fact, there is a party in this House, and a movement in Australia, that fails to recognise the seriousness of the position. I accept the statement that the Parliament was elected during the war, and that, at the time of the election, the then Leader of the Labour party declared that, if returned with a majority, he and those supporting him would do all in their power to bring the war to a successful termination. The Prime Minister says that it was because of that promise that Mr. Fisher secured a majority. Upon the acceptance of the High Commissionership by Mr Fisher, he was succeeded by the Prime Minister. I challenge the right honourable gentleman to point to one piece of legislation of the Hughes or Fisher Administration which was not submi^cU to the Labour Caucus, and approved by it before being presented to Parliament. Every measure for the prosecution of the war was approved by the members of the Labour party. It was because of the loyal support of the party to its leaders that they were able to give effect to their war policy. The financial proposals affecting the war, and the number of men to be sent to the front under the voluntary system, were questions considered by the party; and measures were adopted by it to give effect to the decisions arrived at. The Government now in power is continuing the policy that the Labour party put into operation, and that was followed from the accession of the Pisher Ministry to the submission to the country of the conscription proposal. Many members of the Labour party sank their individual opinions in regard to Bills in order that the Government might have full support.. Yet we are' now told by our ex-leader that, whenever he refers to the war, and to the sufferings and sacrifices of our soldiers in Flanders and elsewhere, his utterances are met with the sneers and jeers of those sitting on this side of the Honse.  the manifesto of 1914.",25
204,Mr HANNAN,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"The members of tire Labour party have consistently given effect to that manifesto, and are prepared to assist any Government that wil l honestly put into operation its proposals. Fisher, as Leader of the Labour party, was responsible for the issue of that manifesto, and for the phrase that the Mother Country could depend on Australia in this war "" to the last man and the last shilling."" When war broke out in 1914, there was not a man in the public l if e of Great Britain or Australia who believed that circumstances would force the people of the Old Country to break away from the recognised traditions of voluntary military service; and, up to the middle of 1915, the agitation for compulsory military service was only in its infancy in Great Britain . The manifesto issued by the Australian Labour party in 1914, and the promise to give the last man and - the last shilling, meant-n o matter what attempts may be made to misinterpret it that the Labour Government would accept the responsibility of finding the money for sending to the war the last man who was prepared to leave Australia under the voluntary system. What has occurred? Yesterday, when the Prime Minister repeated the phrase used by Mr Fisher, he deliberately misinterpreted it . time that pledge was given by Mr Fisher, in the Labour manifesto in 1914, not one member of this Parliament dreamt for one moment that Australia, under the voluntary system, would send over 300,000 men out of the country, and not one public man in Great Britain or Australia expected that compulsory military service would become a live question in B ritish Dominions. Mr Fisher's pledge was strictly in accordance with the recognised traditions of the British race. It was that the Government would take the responsibility of equipping, transporting overseas, and paying the last man prepared to leave our country under the voluntary system.",26
205,Mr RODGEKS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Ge t to the motion before the Chair. Are you still in favour of the extension of the l if e of Parliament?,26
206,Mr HANNAN,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I am not in favour of it . My desire is to show the object behind the proposal. I am merely replying to the u n fair and poisonous criticism of the Prime Minister this morning when he referred to the members of the Labour party. When the Prime Minister returned to Australia from the Old Country there was a continuous stream of recruits going into the camps in the different States; certainly the number was a Mr diminishing one, but in proportion to the large body of men who had already enlisted, and the large numbers already rejected, it more than favourably compared with the number that enlisted in the earliest days of the war. On his arrival in Great B r it a in the Prime Minister was received with all the honour, glory, and pomp that the people and the representatives of the people of the Old Country could confer on him , because he was the representative of a British Dominion that had done more in regard to the war than any other portion of the Dominions; and the pleasure and gratification of the people in the Old World were earned by the people of Australia under the voluntary system. On his return to Australia he came back to a solid party, that was prepared to give him loyal support on a continuation of that policy. But what was the result? He met his Cabinet. Unity turned to disruption. He left his Cabinet and met his party, which had supported him so loyally; and immediately he came in with his proposals disruption set in At the where unity had prevailed. He prooeeded with his proposals, and went to the country, and disunited, and disrupted what had been practically a unanimous people in regard to tlieir war policy. He came back from the country a defeated man, his policy having been rejected by a majorit y of the electors of Australia. Making all due allowances for the fact that there may have been grounds for honest differences of opinion among the people and among parties, and for the fact that it was the most vita l and momentous question ever submitted for the consideration of the people of Australia, the Prime Minister was told, when the fight was over, by the press and by his friends, that the defeat of the proposal was due to the methods he had adopted in carrying out the campaign. He practically accused the members of the Labour party of being in the service of the German Government; he accused the Labour party of receiving German gold; he said to every man and woman in Australia, ""Those of you who vote ' No ' are against Australia and the British Empire; you are disloyal.""",26
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Order ! The honourable member is very much outside the scope of the motion. I ask him to confine his remarks to the question before the Chair.,27
208,Mr HANNAN,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I bow to your decision, sir; but I remind you that the Prime Minister entered into a similar form of attack against the members of the Labour party this morning. He told them that they were subject to a baneful influence which he could not explain. By innuendo and inference he has told honourable members and the people of the country again through his speeches that in this time of war the Labour party are disloyal, and not to be trusted by them; and he has asked this Parliament to agree to an extension of its life so that he may proceed to another part of the Empire, claiming to represent this Parliament and the people of Australia.  that is the point'?",27
209,Mr HANNAN,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"The invitation came from Great Britain to the Prime Minister and the Parliament of Australia, and not to William Morris Hughes. Some members of the House hold the opinion that, in face of the recent vote on the question of conscription, and in face of many of his recent actions, the Prime Minister cannot claim to represent the opinion of the majority of the people of Australia. My reason for following the line of argument upon which I was stopped by you, Mr Deputy Speaker, was the statement of the Prime Minister this morning that the party to which I belong was responsible for the conditions operating in this Chamber. From his own point of view, he set out certain facts in support of his statement, and I was of opinion that if the Prime Minister was allowed to cover in his remarks the voluntary system, the system of conscription, the whole of the phases of the war, and Australia's position therein, I was equally justified in replying to his statements.",27
210,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"The honourable member perhaps inadvertently misrepresents me. I did not call him to order for that reason. He was dealing with the whole of the conscription campaign, and I asked him to confine his remarks to the motion. He would, of course, be in order in replying to statements made by the Prime Minister, but I call attention to the fact that, in doing so, he will be upon ground that is covered by the next motion on the business-paper. MrH ANNAN - This morning the Prime Minister covered the whole position. He referred to the voluntary system, and to the failure of the people to pass conscription, and there was behind it all the threat that the Government and this Parliament might be compelled in the very near future to raise that very important question again. In the circumstances, I considered that I would be entitled to go full y into the question in reply. Honourable members of the Labour party are opposed to the Prime Minister proceeding to the Old World on the ground that he does not represent the opinions of a majority of the people of this country. The Prime Minister claims that he has represented Labour for twenty-two years, and that on each succeeding appeal to the people he has obtained the re-endorsement of the Labour leagues. I admit it , but I ask him to go to the Labour leagues today and ask for a re-endorsement. I would invite him to go to the electors of West Sydney, and ask for their re-endorsement. We feel that he does not represent the sentiments of the people of this country, and we, therefore, object to his attending the Imperial Conference. The Prime Minister's followers are flying signals of distress, while the Prime Minister himself has the blue peter at the mast-head. He contemplates a trip to the Old World, and during his absence the men who so readily followed him, and rendered him such faithful service, will, in all probability, be thrown to the electors, just as they thrown to the wolves,, politically, on the formation of the Coalition Government. We are now asked by the Prime Minister and his Government to agree to a proposed extension of the life of this Parliament. Does he make this request because he thinks that by adopting it we shall bring the war to a conclusion one day earlier than otherwise? Is it because his only desire is to serve the country and the Empire at this juncture, or because he particularly desires to save himself and his followers from the electors' of Australia ? The latter, in our opinion, is the motive behind this proposal. . We object to it on the ground that we do not believe the Prime Minister has the people behind him, and because we resent any interference on the part of the-Imperial authorities with the Constitution under which our country is governed. We are determined, therefore, that, instead of the life of the Parliament being extended, the members of both Houses shall go before the electors at the earliest possible date. The honourable member for Plinders was not included in the Coalition Government because, according to members of the Liberal party, he was injudicious when, on the 17 th ultimo, he publicly stated he would not be a member or supporter of any Government which did not put conscription in the very forefront of its form. No sooner was that statement published than it was recognised that the honourable member, from a political point of view, had made a very grave error of judgment. Senator Keating, who was then in Sydney, was asked by press representatives for his opinion on the attitude which the honourable member for. Flinders had adopted towards conscription, and he said, "" Sir William Irvine is a party of one. He speaks for himself, and not for the Liberal movement in Australia."" Every member now sitting behind the Prime Minister considers that the honourable member for Flinders did the Liberal party a grave injustice in making that statement, and jeopardized its security. And because he had the courage to express his opinion fearlessly on the question of conscription he was deliberately omitted Mr Hannan. from the Coalition Government. It was considered both by the press and publio that the honourable member would probably be one of the first to be selected for were the new Ministry, and yet this was the treatment meted out to him. The Prime Minister and other members of his party urged not long ago that Australia could never do her part in this war unless we had conscription, and they were prepared to make every sacrifice to bring it about.",27
211,Mr BAMFORD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Do not forget that they did make sacrifices.,28
212,Mr HANNAN,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"No doubt those honourable members still hold the same opinion, but when they recognised that to continue the advocacy of conscription would be, in all probability, to bring about their political extinction, the future safety of the Empire became with them only a secondary consideration. The Coalition Government have put the policy of con-, scription out of the way. To that the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Flinders, and others have agreed. But the honourable member for Flinders sacrificed his chances of inclusion in the Ministry by his open expression of opinion. The. Government are now going on with a war policy which they ask the people of Australia to endorse. What is that policy? After all the disruption they have caused, not only amongst members of this Parliament, but the people that outside, they are continuing a policy which the Labour party put into operation, and carried on until the present platPrime Minister returned from England: The voluntary system of enlistment was - paralyzed only when the Prime Minister returned. It was then that he issued his proclamation under the Defence - Act calling up our young men for compulsory service for home defence. After all this upheaval the Prime Minister, after wrecking two Governments, and sacrificing the members of a third-afte r disrupting the people of the community-is reverting, with his followers, to the policy which the Labour party initiated, and carried on successfully for the first two years of the war. He has now the audacity to say that the Labour party and the organizations outside which we represent have not the welfare of the country or the Empire at heart. He made that assertion this morning, and said further that we had done nothing to assist the Empire in the war. If an appeal were made to the country, he went on to say, it would' be found. that two-thirds of the people were behind him. A Government cannot go to the country without a policy, and the Prime Miuister, in going to the country with exactly the policy upon which he wrecked three Administrations, w i ll stand very low in the estimation of the people. The right honourable member has referred to the political revolution that has taken place in Great B r i tain. He said this morning that the change of Government that recently occurred in Great Britain was nothing less than a revolution, and he referred to the action of prominent members of a recent British Government, who, finding that they were not in accord with the sentiments of other members of the Cabinet, withdrew from it rather than' that there should be any disunity. Special ence was made by him to Mr Asquith's retirement from the position of Prime Minister because his opinions on some important question did not coincide with those of the majority of his party. I would invite the Prime Minister to compare his conduct with that of Mr Asquith. Let him compare his conduct also with that of other prominent members of the British Government, who, as soon as they found that opinions which they had held, and held strongly, were likely to bring about the disruption of the Ministry, walked oub of it .",28
213,Mr WEBSTER,POSTPONEMEN T OF,To what opinions is the honourable member referring ?,29
214,Mr HANNAN,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"The Prime Minister's opinion was that we should have conscription if the people would agree to it , or if we could get it by legislation. But failing to gain it by direct legislation, or by means of a referendum, he is quite willing to go on, servilely, so long as he can avoid facing the electors. wrecked the system whioh was giving every satisfaction to the people, and to a majority of the members of both Houses. Bub having failed to get something else, he has now gone back to the voluntary system which was initiated by Mr Fisher and his followers of the Labour party.",29
215,Mr WEBSTER,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Does the member object to the Prime Minisber obeying the will of the people?,29
216,Mr HANNAN,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I object to his refusal to recognise the constitutional procedure of this House. I object to his controlling the affairs of this country with a following of eleven members in this House when another man in similar circumstances would have handed his resignation to the Governor General. He now desires to prolong the life of this Parliament to permit of. his continuing in a position in which he does not hold the confidence of the people of the country. To this we, as a party, object. We say that the condition of affairs in this Parliament has reached a stage when there is only one jury to decide what is right and what is wrong, and that j u r y consists of the electors of Australia. Holding that view, we say that the Prime Minister should take the earliest opportunity to send the members of both Houses to the country. I do not say this because honourable members on either side have at any time any particular desire to go before the electors, but the majority of referus believe that, under present circumstances, the step would be perfectly justified. In my opinion, it is because of the rather precarious position occupied by the majority of the members of the Liberal party in New South Wales that there is this desire to arrange for prolonging the life of Parliament. If the boot wereon the other foot, and thÂ© Prime Minister were leading the present Opposition, he would not hesitate for one moment in driving his opponents before the electors. In Australia at the referendum there were cast 1,160,033 votes against the proposal, and 1,087,557 for the proposal, showing a majority in the negative of 72,476"". The particular electorate to which I desire to call attention is that of the Prime Minister himself-Wes t Sydt ney - In that electorate there were 17,873 votes cast against conscription, and only 7,059 for, showing a majority against of 10,814. Yesterday the Prime Minister told us that he had represented He Labour for twenty-two years, and that on each' succeeding election he had returned to his electorate, and received the endorsement of the leagues. But the Prime Minister at the present moment is showing no particular anxiety to return to a constituency which he is supposed to represent in this House. There are honourable twenty-seven electorates in New South Wales, and of these twenty-two were against conscripition, and only five in favour. The number of votes recorded in New South Wales against conscription was 474,554, and for the proposal 356,805, showing a majority in the negative of 117,739. In these figures, and in these figures alone, is the absolute reason for the proposal to prolong the life of Parliament. The Prime Minister tells us that it is the position of Australia, and the Empire, today that has induced hi to make the proposal. But, if the figures had been the other way, and there had been a great majority in New South Wales for conscription, the Prime Minisrespect ter, without a second's hesitation, would have hurled honourable members to the send three representatives. electors. We on this side are as much interested in the result of the war as honourable members opposite. As repreone sentatives of the people in this House there was only one way in which we could in a practical manner show our interest in the great struggle, and that was by assisting the Government, when we had control, to bring the war to a sucand cessful issue. The voluntary system is now again the policy of the Gothree vernment, and this is simply a revertendants sion to the original policy of the Labour party. We feel, in view of the referenthat dum vote, that if an appeal were made the people as between the Fusion party and the Australian Labour party, the electors would send back into the two branches of the Legislature a majority pledged members of the . Australian Labour party, not only for the duration of the war but for many years to come.",29
217,Mr RILEY,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"South Sydney) [ 3 . 7 ] regret that the Prime Minister is not i the House. The question we have to conthe sider is a very important one, so importment; ant that the Prime Minister told us this morning that it is imperative that three men should be sent from this country as its representatives at the Imperial Conferstand ence. The righ t honourable gentleman, however, has not given any reason why the three particular men mentioned and should be the representatives. I believe we ought to be represented at the Conferopposite ence, for there are issues of great to importance to the country to be settled; but I have yet to learn that any one the three named gentlemen represents the feeling of this country more than does our H i gh Commissioner. If the name of M Fisher were submitted to the people along with the names of the three gentlemen mentioned, I believe that Mr Fisher would be selected over all of them. have to look under the surface for the reasons why it is proposed to extend life of Parliament for nearly two years. One reason given is that we must have representatives at the Imperial Conference; but, as I have said, I believe the people would be satisfied to be represented of by Mr Fisher, who has as much interest m in Australia as has any man in the House. Mr Fisher has had the honour of occupying some of the highest positions in the country, and he left for England with the of all his fellow citizens. In my opinion there is no absolute necessity to When the Prime Minister went to England twelve are months ago we were content with only representative; and I should like to know what are the circumstances that call for three men on the present occasion. If we may judge from what has taken place in the past, the three selected representatives will be accompanied by their wives, there will be three secretaries accompanied by their wives, and, in addition, messengers, with., no doubt, some atto look after them. We are told that this is a time for economy; but is the way to economize ? Can the work to of this Imperial Conference not be conducted without our sending three men 1 I have nothing against the right honourable member for Swan or the honourable memof ber for Flinders, who are both very capable men, and would represent the country fairly well; but, at the same time, they do not represent a majority of the - I people. This Parliament was elected durn ing a war period. Mr Fisher appealed to country as against the Cook Governand during the whole of that time the present Prime Minister offered, on behalf of the Labour party, to cease party struggles, and, as it were, to let things over u n t il the war had finished. The Labour party, which is now in Opposition, could not stop those elections, the result was that Mr Fisher came back to power. I ask honourable members what justification they can give the country for occupying their present position, seeing that the electors have of pronounced against them and that they are defeated as a party ? However, by the manipulation of political wire-pulling, this r . defeated party is now on the Treasury benches, and I cannot see how they can justify themselves in the eyes of the country. The Prime Minister has no party We following, and he should not have been allowed to hold office for ten minutes after the the House met and he saw his strength. W it h eleven supporters he has been able to hold on to the reins of government; and it is degrading to any party or Parliament when a man may keep himself im office under such circumstances. However, he has been ablo to do this by holding out inducements to other men to follow him. Now he has come to the end of his tether, and has brought about a fusion. I ask theelectors to read the Prime Minister's book The Case for Labour, and see what he has to say there about fusion parties. No man has denounced with greater vigour arrangements of the k in d ; and I feel confident that had. he been on this side of the - House today he would have made it very uncomfortable for some honourable members. I prognosticate that when this fusion goes to the country it will meet the fate of all other fusions. Why has there been a fusion? honest course for the Liberal Opposition was to challenge the Hughes Government. The Liberal party had - the right to do that; and they did not do it because they were afraid to go to the country. Now they come along with the cry that we must be represented at the Imperial Conference, and that, to that end, we must postpone the elections for twelve months. We on this side did not "" come down in the last shower,"" and we know exactly "" w h at is in the w in d . "" The Government, and their supporters wish to allay the feelings of the people of the country so far as conscription is concerned. The Liberals are invited to come under the umbrella, whilo Mr Hughes and his supporters go about the country forming a National League, which is to fight the Liberal party at the next election.",30
218,Mr WEBSTER,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Then why not give him time to do that ?,31
219,Mr RILEY,POSTPONEMEN T OF,We are opposed to parties. We do not want to take part in a fusion. Those who invited us to join in the formation of a National Government knew exactly our position. During the last twenty years we have remained apart as a distinct party.,31
220,Mr BURNS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,It would be interesting to read some of the remarks of the Postmaster-General on fusions.,31
221,Mr WEBSTER,POSTPONEMEN T OF,They were made when there was a Labour party.,31
222,Mr RILEY,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"The Prime Minister stated that, never in the history of the war was the Empire in such peril. He said a similar thing twelve months ago, when the French were being driven back at Verdun and the Russians were being defeated in their own [381] country. At that time the Prime Minister submittedthe conscription issue to a referendum of the people. Was not the British Empire in danger at that time, and was not every ounce of. strength required to hold the Germans back ? Was it not then in the interests of the country that we should have a united Parliament and people; instead of engaging in a referendum campaign, which was virtually an election ? If it is not right to hold an election now, it was not right to conduct a referendum in October, when Parliament went into recess and every honourable member had to go before the electors. ' In many cases families were divided on the Question of compulsory service. Therefore,-1 submit that there The was no greater justification for going to the country in October than there is today. Every honourable member is desirouB of helping to win the war, and there is not one of us who would not sacrifice anything if by so dome the war could be shortened. It is wicked of honourable members, because we differ on the question of conscription, to say that we are opposed to winning the war and to helping the Empire.",31
223,Mr WEBSTER,POSTPONEMEN T OF,The attitude you are taking now is an example of your desire to win the war.,31
224,Mr RILEY,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I cannot supply the honourable member with brains. Trie fact that he has none is his misfortune, and he has my sympathy. We, as a party, are quite willing to assist any Government to carry the war to a successful issue. We are ready to assist in recruiting, as we have done in the past. Ministers say' that electioneering will interfere with recruitboth ing work. But in New South Wales the Holman party 'has coalesced with the Liberals, and thrown all principles to the wind. Mr Holman says the purpose of the coalition is.to win the war, and to that end he has brought about .a general election. His friends in this House say that they do not desire an election held now because it will interfere .with recruiting. The truth is Mr Holman is going to the country because he is afraid that the Federal Parliament might go to the electors first, and he is anxious to get in out of the web. None of these manoeuvres will save the skins of honourable members opposite. It was the duty of the Liberal party t'o challenge the Hughes Government, and to take possession of the Treasury bench. The position that has arisen' is one that could be decided only by the people, and I . trust' that we shall have an early opportunity of consulting them. There is not in this Chamber a party strong enough to carry on the affairs of this country in a proper manner. Sow can a man who sacrificed his ambition aa a member of the Labour party to join the Hughes Government, and was then thrown overboard to make way for a fusion, be satisfied with such treatment It is a scandal that men who have been loyal to Mr Hughes have been thrown overboard in order that a fusion might take place. Honourable members on the Government side say .that recruiting has failed, but I question that statement. The Prime Minister states thac 16,500 men aro required each month to supply reinforcements. That is only his statement. At no period of the war have 16,500 menbeen disabled in a month.",31
225,Mr ORCHARD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"In July there were 19,000 casualties.",32
226,Mr RILEY,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I am speaking of the average monthly casualties. Last month there were 5,300 recruit* throughout the Commonwealth, and the figures for this month are rising fairly well. If , instead of talking about a delegation to the Old Country, and instead of secret conferences for three or four weeks to bring about a fusion, all our energy had been put into recruiting, we should have been, doing better work. It is proposed that Australia should be represented at the Conference by three conscriptiomsts.",32
227,Mr BOYD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Whose fault is that? ' Mr Riley - Si r William Irvine has said-and I respect him for his honest convictions-that he would introduce conscription tomorrow if he had his way. Sir John Forrest says that Mr Hughes is his leader, and that leader soys that, if circumstances do not change, the will of the people as expressed at the referendum wil! be respected, What is meant by cir cumstarices? If an election is held and the Liberal party is returned to power, the circumstances jwill have changed, and conscription will be introduced.' We wish to prevent that by sending Parliament to the country, so that the people may pronounce"" an opinion, on this matter. Why is Sir' William Irvine selected as a sentative? Because his views are in harmony with those of the Government, and the Government and their supporters are conscription ists. Therefore, notwithstanding that the referendum was defeated by 72,000 voles, there is a danger' of conscription being introduced. We do not trust the present occupants of the Treasury bench..",32
228,Mr LIVINGSION,POSTPONEMEN T OF,W c will have no country if we .do not defend it.,32
229,Mr RILEY,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I have seen no ships big enough to take our country away. We are representing the wish of the majority ? of the people when we say that the quicker both branches of the Legislature are sent to the country the better for Australia. Why should we be afraid, to consult the people? We are here only bo represent the people, and if we, as a party, are beaten attne polls, we must bow to the popular will. If I am representing a minority of the people in my electorate', I have no right to be in this Parliament. Therefore, I hope that this debate will be brief. We are letting the Government know exactly our position when we say that, as a party, we are prepared to face the people at the earliest possible moment. I believe that an election will be to the advantage of recruiting, because the present Government do nob possess the confidence of the people.  their confidence in connection with the last war loan.",32

We desire that the country shall pav its way and do Its part in the war well, and I resent the reflection oust upon us by the Prime Minister when he says that we, as a partu, are actuated by selfish motives and are disloyal to the Empire. We are prepared to show that no party can do more bo bring the war to a successful issue than the party which now sits in opposition. The people trusted us in the past, and handed to us the destiny of the country. Therefore, we feel the responsibility that restson us to carry on the repre- war as much as do honourable members who sit opposite.

No doubt the Prime Minister thought that the Opposition would be afraid to face the electors. Finding that we are not afraid, - and are prepared to take up his challenge and go to the country at once, the Government appear to be quite willing to abandon this proposition, which the Prime Minister says it is imperatively necessary that we should pass as soon as possible. To-day, when we met, a Minister asked, ""Have you a no-confidence motion?"" and suggested that, as we had not, the fate of the Government should be decided on the motion submitted by the Prime Minister. Were Ministers desirous of knowing their fate as soon as possible, they would have allowed the Senate to proceed with the consideration of this motion simultaneously with this House. But, although they profess to think that we should deal with it at once,, they have postponed its consideration in the Senate until a future day. I was interested and amused . in watching the faces of Liberal members this morning. Tbey were pleased to hear the lash of the Prime Minister's.bitter tongue, which has played so often on their backs, and particularly on that of the right honourable member for Parramatta, applied to the faces of those on whose shoulders the Prime Minister climbed into office. I was amused also to see the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Parramatta, who have been blackguarding each other for fifteen years, sitting together like two budgerigars, whispering into each other's ears as those love-birds do.",33

239,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Was I not one of the members who asked you to stay in the Ministry ?,33
240,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Yes . There was no attempt to drive the Prime Minister out of public life. Had he gone to the Caucus and said, ""Gentlemen, I have made a mistake concerning the opinions of a majority of the electors, and tender my resignation as the leader of the Labour party,"" 'the party would have been kept together, and he would probably have been retained as its leader. Mr AKCHiBAiD - The honourable member, or one of two others, would have been made Prime Minister. It was a very clever scheme.",33
241,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"There was no scheme, so far as we were concerned. No doubt any of us would have made a good Prime Minister. I do not wish to say anything harsh concerning those who have left the Australian Labour party, because , their constituents will deal with them. They all pledged themselves to advocate and . carry into effect the platform on which they were elected, and the duty was imposed on them, although it may hot have been stated in so many words, of trying to keep the party together. These members joined the Prime Minister with the full knowledge of what they were doing, thus putting the Labour party out of power,, and making it impossible for its programme to be carried out, for some time, at any rate.",33
242,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POSTPONEMEN T OF,The motion of the honourable member for Brisbane turned us,33
243,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"The Prime Minister and his followers must realise that the Australian Labour movement still exists, and that, in all probability, it has the support of over 1,000,000 electors. Surely, then, some one should be sent to the Imperial Conference to represent its views. ""When the Prime Minister proposes that we should ask the Imperial Parliament to legislate for us, I say that the Liberal party, which has joined with the Prime Minister, should keep its hands off the Constitution. The Constitution contains a provision under which the life of the Parliament can be lengthened or shortened, and I object to l i e Imperial Parliament being asked to do that which we can-do for ourselves. Mr Born - How could that be done in time to allow our delegates to attend the the country. Conference?",34
244,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I find it difficult to take the view , of the Prime Minister who support him. In one of his speeches the Prime Minister said, ""Wales for ever best."" I hold with ""Australia . for ever best."" If I asked to choose between any country and Australia. I say ""Australia first."" Naturally, having been born in AustraGovernment lia, I cannot take the same viow of tralian affairs as does the man who been born in the Old Country. If had been born in the Old Country I successfully could well believe. that I should feel prepared to surrender all Australia's affairs to the control of the Old Country, whioh is the attitude taken up send? by many honourable members in this House. Having been born in the Old Country they are prepared to put under the rule of Downmg-street.",34
245,Mr AKCIUBALD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,That is absolutely false.,34
246,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"It is not false. Honwas orable members like the Prime Ministhe ter, who complain of our Australian titude, must make allowance for us. We have had very little experience of any other country. Our land may be drought-stricken at times, and we may not have the culture that is to be found in the older and more populated but nevertheless it is Australia, are endeavouring to build up a nation here. 'We cannot do it if we surrender Prime Minister. our local governing powers to gentlemen who are 16,000 miles away. I object to the surrendering of the ' government of Australia to Downing-street. Honourable members who have read the history of Australia know what we .had to suffer under the rule of Downing-street when Austraha was made the dumping ground of convicts. The British authorities never ceased to send them here until our people turned the ships back and refused to receive them, and only then did these gentlemen of Downingstreet take any notice of Australia's objection. I object to asking these gentlemen to determine whether the life of this Parliament should be extended. It is the people in Australia who should determine the matter. They are quite sufficiently calm to conduct an election and return to this Parliament a majority of men to carry on the affairs of",34
247,Mr SAMPSON,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Is not the honourable member satisfied with the war policy of and those the present Government?,34
248,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"It is only the war policy of any other Government. If the decision of the people of Australia am is to be respected the honourable member and his party can do no more and no less than was done by the Labour party's when it held office, - What Auscan the present Government do that the has Labour Government did not do? Did I not the Labour Government raise money in order to carry on the war? Was it not able to send to the front as many men as the country, considering its vast extent, has been able to afford to The country is now sending men in as large numbers as could have been secured had conscription been us adopted. What can present Ministers do that the Labour Government did not do ? Is there more confidence among the business community in Australia than displayed when Mr Hughes was in Old Country and his Ministers in the atLabour Government were carrying on in his absence? Possibly there was some irritation at that time, but there was a minimum of it. Ministers were carrying on affairs to the' satisfaction of the country, and I am very sorry that Mr. places, Hughes over returned. and we Mr KING 0'MAI,M5Y - Hear, hear! Senator Pearce made .a good Acting",34
249,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"It is all very well for the Prime Minister to indulge in perfervid oratory about winning the war. cannot do more than the Labour Government did, nor can honourable members on the Government side do more. He can only take the wool, the meat, the sheep, and the metals and send them abroad as fast as ships can take them, and he can only get the men that the country can afford to send. No one can do more, so that it is absurd for him to suggest' at a time like this that something more can be done. He has drawn a very dismal picture of the position of the Allies, but it does not agree with facts. Do not the speeches of men like Bonar Law, Lloyd George, Sir Douglas Haig, the French Premier, Russian statesmen and Italian statesmen, say that the Allies cannot lose ? If the picture drown by the Prime M in i ster today, that things are worse now than they were before, is truei f , as he says, the Allies are so weak and Germany is so strongwhat did the Allies mean by refusing to discuss peace terms with Germany? ""While great leaders like Bonar Law, Lloyd George and others say that we must win, and while Sir Douglas H a i g says that we will w in the war this year, they also say that the blockade is successful, that the submarine frightfulness is at an end, and that Germany is starving. But the Prime Minister's speeches are so much froth. They are eloquently written. Most of his speeches are written, and copies are supplied to the press, as is very often done by public men who do not wish to be misunderstood. I have done it myself. The Prime Minister has done it frequently. In the Town H all not long ago a section of the writers of the press suggested that the Prime Minister was so overcome with the weight of his words that his utterance was slow and difficult; but as a matter of fact he was endeavouring to remember what he had written, and if one had been close enough to the reporters he could have seen them with written copies of the speech before them. To show how closely he was following what he had written, One Argus writer noted how closely the Prime Minister had kept to his written text, and that he spoke with a marvellous memory. We may go through his oratorical or rhetorical efforts, and hardly find in them a single practical idea. He talks about organizing industry in Australia, and about what He must be done to w in the war, but one can go through columns of matter written by him, and printed by the newspapers, and find no practical idea in them. The honourable member for Perth described his speeches, as they should have been described-as ' 'piffle.'' I ask honourable members and the people not to be led away by. the dismal prophecies and pictures drawn by the Prime Minister. There is no danger to this country in having an election, and there will be very little danger to it if the Prime Minister does not go to the Old Country. Many people have spoken as though he was the only man fit to go to the Imperial Conference. B y the way, I notice that Mr Bean, the journalist who was sent overseas to report the doings of our troops at the front, has actually been sending out cablegrams condemning honourable members on both sides of the House as party politicians who are occupied in fighting for their party aims instead of allowing the most enlightened statesman in Australia to go to the Old Country-that is Mr Hughes, Mr Bean's boss.",34
250,Mr MAHON,POSTPONEMEN T OF,And Mr Bean gets Â£12 a week for that.,35
251,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Mr Bean may be worth more than that salary as a journalist. I do not take exception to the amount of his salary, but I do take exception to the Commonwealth paying for cablegrams such as these which appear to arrive at an opportune time. - I do not know whether Mr Bean was in structed to send out a cablegram as to the necessity for the Prime Minister attending the Conference, but it would appear that he was. I have no exception to take to the right honourable member for Swan representing Australia at the Conference. His public career has been a long and honourable one. His life has been filled with good works, and he is perfectly capable of representing the Liberal party to which he belongs. No one could take any exception to his appointment as a delegate.  quite enough, with a representative from this side.",35
252,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"The Treasurer can well represent the million of people, or thereabouts, who hold Liberal opinions, but the Prime Minister has no right to claim that he can represent those who hold Labour' views. He has disrupted the Australian Labour party, and has endeavoured to strike it a deadly blow by - leaving it , and attacking it in the abusive and vitriolic way in which he has assailed it on every occasion since he l e ft the Labour Caucus room. It is grossly unfair to select three men from the one side to represent Australia at the Conference. We all know the views held by the honourable member for Flinders. He represents a small and very Conservative section of the Australian public, which is, no doubt in its own opinion, very high minded, and has a very keen sense of honour; but it is, nevertheless, a very small section of the people. Why, then, has the honourable member for Flinders been chosen as a representative of Australia ? Is he going to tell the Conference that Australia is in favour of conscription ? We know that he holds very extreme views on that question. I object to the proposed composition of the delegation because of these facts. The Prime Minister has no right to go. He represents nobody. He has deserted his constituency. . If he were the courageous man he pretends to be he would go back to his constituents, tender his resignation, contest the electorate of West Sydney, or some other Federal division, or he would quietly retire from the Prime Ministership, and take his seat on the back Ministerial benches.",35
253,Mr BOYD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"After all , the responsibility for the Labour party not being represented at the Conference rests entirely with the party itself.",36
254,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"That is not so - The question of the representation of Australia on the Imperial Conference is altogether different from that of taking part in this so-called War Government. The whole of our traditions are against Coalitions. They have failed in the past, as they must always fail . Even the recent Coalition in the Old Country, when Mr . Bonar Law and other Conservatives joined Mr Asquith and other members of the Liberal party, went to pieces. The Reid-MCLean Coalition, and the DeakinCook Coalition went to pieces in the Commonwealth, just as the Hughes-Cook A d ministration' must fail . The present Fusion will prove one of the most unsuccessful, because the Liberal party have a very poor opinion of those wbo have joined them. They will not even allow them to attend their Caucus meetings. They meet in separate rooms. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They do not. trust them.",36
255,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"1 venture to say that not one member of the Liberal partytrusts the Prime Minister. I doubt, whether any member of the present A d ministration has seen the invitation which the Prime Minister received to attend the Imperial Conference. Members of the Liberal party do not believe in such secrecy. They consider that the Prime Minister should be candid and straightforward, and that he should inform hia colleagues of the terms of the invitation. What objection can there be to the Parliament and the people of Australia knowing what those terms are ?",36
256,Mr BOYD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Did he not disclose them to the Administration to which the honourable member belonged ?,36
257,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"No ; he told us he had received an invitation, but we never saw it,",36
258,Mr BOYD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Then why did the honourable member continue to sit in his Cabinet?,36
259,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,We did notcare to in sult the Prime Minister by suggesting that he had not received an invitation.,36
260,Mr BOYD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Honourable members opposite are not too scrupulous now.,36
261,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,We know the Prime Minister better. Who amongst the members of the great Australian Labour party ever believed that William Morris Hughes - on e of the men to frame the solidarity pledge in New South Wales: the man who on every occasion insisted on loyalty to the party-woul d leave our party and take up his present position ?,36
262,Mr ABCHIBALD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Who would have thought that the honourable member for Capricornia would become a Trades H all lackey ?,36
263,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"I am not,",36
264,Mr THOMAS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Did the Prime Minister leave the party or was he driven out of it?,36
265,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,He deserted the party.,36
266,Mr THOMAS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Was he not driven out of the party at the meeting upstairs? Was he not put out by order of the executive in Sydney ? Your instructions were to bundle him out.,36
267,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Nothin g of the sort. I moved the motion.,36
268,Mr HIGGS,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Anothe r of my reasons for objectingto the Prime Minister representing Australia at the Conference is that he favours secret methods. I would be afraid to trust him by supporting a resolution of this kind. I have no doubt he would do all he could to induce the British Parliament so to frame the Con.stitution Alteration Bill as to extend the life of this Parliament until the end of the war and six months afterwards, without the restriction that it shall not extend beyond the 8th October, 1918. It would be interesting to learn the views of the honourable member for Flinders on the question of the Tariff, inasmuch as trade preference will be one of the matters to be dealt with by the Imperial Conference. As I understand it is proposed now to adjourn , I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned. PAPERS.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS : RECRUITING associated STATEMENTS AND REQUESTS-PROSECU TIONS UNDER WAR PBECAUTIONS ACT MOTIONS OF DISSENT FROM SPEAKER'S RULING. Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) posedThat the House do now adjourn.",36
269,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Brisbane) [3.59] Earlier in the. day I submitted to - the Prime Minister three questions. The first of these wasIs it a fact that at recruiting meetings in Brisbane recently speakers designated those who had not enlisted as cowards, loafers, rotters, and mongrels? To this the Prime Minister answered "" No !"" The second question wasIs it a fact that a deputation of women who recently interviewed the Acting Premier in Brisbane asked for discharge from employment of all single men, to compel them to enlist, and also asked him to fill their positions with women ? The answer to that was also in the negative. My third question wasIf sueh statements and requests are highly prejudicial to voluntary recruiting, will the Prime Minister take such action as will prevent any recurrence of such obstacles to enlistment? I now wish to read two telegrams I have received from the honourable member for Oxley, who is at present in Brisbane. The first telegram isSpeeches delivered daily Post Office sure to kill recruiting. Women's committee waited on Acting Premier asked for discharge all single men so as they would be compelled enlist. Fill positions with women. The second telegram, which is dated Wednesday, isPost Office meeting today speakers were calling those who had not enlisted "" cowards,"" '' loafers,"" "" rotters,"" "" mongrels.'' While probably the Prime Minister is not aware, and, therefore, may not be held responsible for what is going on in Brisbane, still I object to the cavalier way in which he answered the questions today in regard to what-to me, at any rate-is a very important matter. The Prime Minister, in his speech, found it convenient to make disparaging remark's as to the attitude of Belthe party on this side towards recruiting. wish to make it quite clear that, so far Geras I am concerned, I am an enthusiastic supporter of the voluntary recruiting system. I have tried from the beginning of - the war, and I am trying still, to assist voluntary recruiting to the utmost of my opportunity and ability. But I cannot be with any party that allows its agents or advocates to call those who refuse to enlist the names which are mentioned in the telegram of the honourable member for Oxley, and which were so common during the conscription campaign. pro",37
270,Mr BOYD,POSTPONEMEN T OF,How can you control the utterances of independent people ?,37
271,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"In reply, I may say that it is remarkable how the Prime Minister can find means to control the utterances of people with whom he is in disheld agreement. If there is anything more reprehensible than another during the whole course of the Prime Minister's control of affairs during the war it is the way in which he has found easy opportunities to stop people from talking, or .from publishing their talk, if he did not approve of it . It would be the easiest thing in the world, without any extension, or unreasonable extension, of the powers already being put into operation, to tell those recruiting sergeants, or whoever the persons may be, who are insulting the young men of Brisbane and of other places by applying to them opprobrious epithets, that this kind of language will not help recruiting. It is because of the prejudicial effect such conduct aud language have on recruiting that I object to it . I make this public objection because I think the matter is one which concerns, not only Brisbane, but the whole Commonwealth. This is the kind of thing that makes it hard for some of us to join recruiting committees-that makes it awkward for some of us to sit on committees with men who do not object to it . These men are conscriptionists; and those of us who are in favour of the voluntary system are anxious to do our share to the utmost of our power. No matter how the Prime Minister, or those supporting him, may juggle with words, the party on this side is the party in Australia that has carried on the war to the successful point to which it has now come. We are the "" Win-the-war "" party-this Labour party, which was given charge of the war by the people of Australia. We have carried on the war in such a way as to leave no sense of shame in our mind as to its conduct; and the same desire to see it through to a successful issue will continue with us whether we are on this side or on the other.",37
272,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Yarra) [4.5] - In absence of the Prime Minister I should like to draw the attention of the Assistnot ant Minister for Defence to a matter ferred to about a fortnight ago by the honourable member for Adelaide. honourable member raised the case of two men named Coombe and MCIntyre, who discussion. are being prosecuted in South Australia for some alleged utterances in October last, during the referendum campaign. to The honourable member asked that the prodiscuss secution be withdrawn, or reasons given for. persisting with it . He suggested the prosecution was vindictive-that the men were being victimized-and in a telewish gram to me today he asks me to enrecognise deavour to get from the Prime Minister some reasons why, in view of the time has elapsed since the alleged offence, the prosecution cannot be withdrawn. I do not ask for the withdrawal of ^ny prowhich secution, provided the offender is caught and prosecuted for t h with; but when months are allowed to elapse it certainly opens the way for the suggestion of vindictiveness. I should like a reply next week to the question I have suggested.",38
273,Mr GROOM,POSTPONEMEN T OF,Darling Downs-Assist ant Minister for Defence) [ 4 . the Prime Minister said that he would have the facts regarding this prosecution looked into. I suppose that if the merits of the case justify a prosecution a withdrawal is not asked for ; that the desire is to have the facts looked into ?,38
274,Mr TUDOR,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Yes ; and I suggest that, after the lapse of four or five months, it is hard to prosecute any men on hearsay evidence.",38
275,Mr GROOM,POSTPONEMEN T OF,I shall see the Prime Minister in regard to the matter.,38
276,Mr MAHON,POSTPONEMEN T OF,"Kalgoorlie) [4.8] - There is a notice of motion on the business-paper having reference to your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, in connection with the susension of the honourable member for Melourne. I have no wish at present to discuss your ruling or to make any comment on it , because that would not be in order; but I should like to draw the attention of the Government to the position in which the notice of motion stands on the business paper - It is most important and necessary to the proper conduct of the business of the House that a motion challenging the ruling of the presiding officer should be dealt with as early as possible. In the early days of this Parliament the regular practice was to give precedence to such the motions, but later on an evil example was set, for a reason on which I need dwell, and the Government of the reday p ut notices of motion regarding the Speaker's rulings at the bottom of. the That business-paper, thus delaying, and, in some instances, entirely preventing their I appeal to the Government to restore the salutary practice of the early days of this Parliament, and allow a speedy opportunity to this notice of motion, which raises the whole question of the suspension of that an honourable member from the service of the House. As I have said, I have no to reflect on your ruling, because I that, during your occupancy of the chair, you have exhibited great that ability and impartiality, as well as dignity, in the performance of your duties What I wish to say is that this motion, is a most important one, seeing that it affects the rights of a constituency to be represented in this House, should not be placed, as the Government are disposed to place it , at the bottom of the business paper, but that an early opportunity should be given for its discussion and final decision. In justice to the honourable - member, as well as to his constituency, 7 ] - I think this should be done. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.10 p.m.",38
