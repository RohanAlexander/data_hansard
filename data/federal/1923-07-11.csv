1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt) took the chair at 2,30 p.m., and read prayers. CANADA. TRADE RECIPROCITY.",13
2,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"I am president of the Empire Development Union, an organization which is greatly interested to learn that the Canadian Government is prepared to enter into trade arrangements with the Gommonwealth Government, and particularly with regard to dried fruits. It has been hinted that the settlement of the matter may be left over until after the Economic Conference has been held. I therefore ask the Prime Minister, in view of the urgency of the matter, whether steps will be taken to enter into trade arrangements with Canada at once and without waiting for the Economic Conference?",13
3,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I agree with the honourable member as to the importance and urgency of this inatter. In the latter part of last year the Canadian Government sent Mr Robb, the Canadian Minister for Customs, to Australia with a view to arranging a reciprocal trade treaty between Canada and Australia. When Mr. Robb was here schedules of the concessions which Australia and Canada were mutually prepared to extend to each other were drawn up and considered. But as the Canadian Government was not prepared to accept them, negotiations were continued by cable af ter Mr Kobb's return, in ' the nope that the Canadian Government would be prepared to bring the schedules before its Parliament. The Canadian Government did not see its way to do that, and from that tiime on we have been continuing the cabled negotiations in an endeavour to finalize the treaty, because we believed it would be 'very advantageous to both Canada and Australia. Unfortunately, we have been unable to arrive at a basis of agreement with respeot to dried fruits. That is, of course, the. most important item under consideration, and involves the major concession which Canada is in a position to offer to Australia. I assure the honourable gentleman that the Government is just as desirous as he, or the organization he represents, can be to reach finality! I should like to make one aspect of the matter very clear, because I have noted the suggestion that the dried f r u it arrangement might be settled separately from the general trade treaty which we hope to enter into. Unfortunately, that is impossible, because the Canadian Government will not grant a preference to Australian dried f r u it unless the whole of the requests it has submitted are agreed to. At the present moment the Commonwealth Government does not see its way to accede to all the requests the Canadian Government is putting forward, and unless we can find some basis of compromise I am afraid it will be impossible to deal with the dried f r u it question separately. The following paper was presented: Northern Territory Election-Allege d Irregularities-Kepor t by Chief Electoral Officer. NEW GUINEA. ADMINJ STRATION-EXPROPRIATIO N BOARD.",13
4,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs ) [2.34]-(B y leave) - The administration of New Guinea has been brought very prominently under the notice of the public of Australia during the last few weeks. Several questions have been asked in this House with regard to certain newspaper articles which have been published, and I have promised to make a full statement about the ^present position in ' New Guinea, covering both the Administration and the Expropriation Board. The charges which have been made are of a most serious character. Australia is a mandated power administering New Guinea, and as such is responsible, not merely to the people of this Commonwealth, but also to the League of Nations, and to the nations of the world. By our administration of this mandated Territory we shall be judged 'by 'the world. I would impress upon honourable members of all parties in this House that there is no matter in which Australia's good name is more involved than its administration of the mandated Territories, including New Guinea. I may remind honourable members very briefly how we received the mandate for these Territories. Prior to the war they belonged to Germany. Almost immediately after hostilities broke out Australia sent an Expeditionary Force, which took possession of the New Guinea territory of Germany. These possessions were under military occupation throughout the war. At the Peace Conference of Versailles the then Prime Minister (Mr W . M . Hughes) made the strongest representations in favour of giving Australia control of this Territory. He contended that it was necessary for our safety that it should not pass into the hands of any Power which in any circumstances could become hostile to this country. The result of his very brilliant efforts at Versailles was that Australia obtained the mandate for the Territory. When the administration of a mandated Territory was placed in the PAPER. hands of a Government, the League of Nations was made the authority to whom reports upon it were to be submitted. The League was really given the task of policing the operation of mandates by the powers intrusted with them. Australia was given the New Guinea mandate, but this Government has to submit an annual report to the League of Nations showing how it is administering the trust which has been placed in its hands. What is known as a Mandates Commission assists the Council of the League of Nations in considering these reports. . The Commission consists of the representatives of nine nations, most of whom have no mandate themselves. The Mandates Commission will meet again on the 20th of the present month, and the report by Australia upon her administration of her mandated territory during the past twelve months will then be submitted. The report of the Commission upon Australia's administration of the Territory will subsequently be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations. Honora'ble members will agree with me that from the point of . v i e w of Australia there could be no more unfortunate time than the present for making charges of this character. It is interesting to recall that similar articles to those which are now appearing were published twelve months ago, just prior to the last meeting of the Mandates Commission. Those articles - were signed by a Sydney business man, but on investigation it was found that be bad spent only two days at Rabaul, and had obtained his information from various sources,' all of which scathingly condemned the administration. Those and other articles were forwarded anonymously to the President of the Mandates Commission, and it was proposed to circulate them amongst the members' of the Commission. Fortunately for Australia the whole of the charges were refuted to the satisfaction of the Commission, and no serious results to Australia ensued, although for a time there was an atmosphere of very grave suspicion.",14
5,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Do not the Prime Minister's remarks more particularly apply to Nauru?,15
6,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"No . Last year, when the Australian delegates went to the League of Nations Assembly, which was held in September, they found that pamphlets making charges against Australia's administration had been broadcasted. All the representatives of the nations assembled at Geneva, except the Australian representatives, received copies of them. The pamphlets were printed in very large numbers, and of one of them as many as 30,000 copies were issued. They were signed by the "" League of German Patriots,"" and contained extracts from Australian newspapers. In examining any statement made at such a time as the present, this Parliament, as a responsible body, should - make a judicial survey of the facts before accepting it as accurate. I do not suggest, that the articles that have appeared recently have been inspired, or that the gentleman who wrote them may not have been quite sincere, but I do suggest that much of the information obtained by bim undoubtedly came from people who were deliberately assisting German propaganda. The charges have unfortunately been ' made, and it is imperative, in view of the forthcoming, sitting of the Mandates Commission, that a reply should be given to them immediately. I propose to take the various charges and inform honourable members exactly of the position relating to them. I would* prefer, if it were possible, to make a full statement regarding the whole administration and the position of expropriated properties. I told the House recently that the Government had appointed a firm of accountants in New South Wales-Messrs . Yarwood and Co - to investigate the transactions of the Expropriation Board, and that it was proposed to send to New Guinea their representative and a tropical expert, who would also report to the Government upon 'the physical condition of all the properties under the control of the Expropriation Board. That investigation has not yet taken place, and I am, therefore, unfortunately not in a position to place its results before honourable members. The Government is taking every action in its power to place the administration of the Territory on the best possible basis, and to insure that the Territory shall have not merely good, but the very best, government that it is possible to give it. In administering .this Territory Australia is very much upon her trial, and it is necessary that we should show that we have inherited some of the traditions of which Great Britain has been proud for so many centuries, and which make her unrivalled in administering a native population and contributing to its welfare and advancement. Members of the Government in no way resent criticism of anything that has taken place in New Guinea, but, on the contrary, welcome it, provided that it is based on well authenticated facts which can assist us in discharging more efficiently the duty that lies to our hands. I shall put all the facts of the case before honourable members, so that they may realise .what has been done, and may appreciate the grave difficulties with which the Government has been faced. During the military administration of the Territory, the German citizens, other than officials, remained there, and business generally was carried on by them with the assistance of a certain number of Australians, just as it had been prior .to 191-1. 'The only people who left the Territory immediately were the German officials, who, undier the terms of the capitulation, were guaranteed a safe conduct to Germany. In the Peace Treaty power was given to expropriate the properties of German nationals in New Guinea, and also to deport such persons from the Territory. The Commonwealth Government, when its mandate was received from the League of Nations-and I remind honourable members that this was not received u n t i l May, 1921, notwithstanding that the war had ceased in November, 1918-established , a civil administration, and action, was taken i u regard to expropriated German properties. TheExpropriation Board has administered the properties sincei t was established. Action having been taken to secure the mandate for Australia, it became imperative that the Government should find the personnel necessary to carry on the management and control of expropriated properties, and also that it should find an efficient Civil Service to administer the Territory, and in particular to safeguard the welfare of the natives, which was our primary obligation under the mandate. It is not; ' I think, surprising that Australia experienced very great difficulty in finding a suitable personnel for the administration of a tropical country with a large native population. W)e 'have never had a similar task placed ou our shoulders. We were also faced with a similar difficulty in regard to the management of tropical plantations. We had very few people in Australia with the experience and qualifications necessary to really efficiently handle the situation. The Government of the clay had a most difficult task, and I think, - generally speaking, the people of Australia will endorse their actions in dealing with it . The administrative staff for - carrying on the work in connection with the expropriated properties was chosen mainly from the personnel of the Australian Imperial Force, and particularly i r o m those who had been sent to New 'Guinea. They were, practically without - exception, returned soldiers who had - taken part in the war. I propose to - deal at some length with the administration of the expropriated properties, and I would ask honourable members to bear in mind that we were faced with a very big task in taking control. suggested that there were not mistakes made, and I .am not prepared to suggest that there is not room for improvement now, but I most certainly say that in view of the enormous handicaps imposed on us when we took - over the Territory the Board has done reasonably well, and the position is certainl y much more satisfactory than the criticisms which have been made would mandate- lead the people of Australia to believe it to be. I shall deal seriatim with the statements which have been made, and I think the House will agree that it is necessary for me to do so. One of the most serious statements is thisTlie Administrator states that he is "" a mere trustee, powerless, except in matters of routine, by reason of the failure of the Federal Government and the League to establish a definite policy. in regard to the important questions of the Territory."" Thefirst .fact to be noted is that the Administrator himself denies that he ever said anything of the sort. Thesecond fact is that the statement itself is untrue. There has been no fail ure to lay down a definite policy for the Territory. W it h the exception of two matters to which I shall refer presently, the whole policy has been laid down, and the whole system of government has been, established. Eighty-eight Ordinances have been passed since the C i v i l Administration took control. There are only two important matters outstanding. One of these relates to land transfers, and it presents extraordinary difficulties. I want the House to know what some of those difficulties are. Under the German law, titles to property were l-egistered in what was called. a ground-book, but no record was made in that register of any native rights that might exist with regard to the land registered. There were innumerable rights which the natives had acquired from time to time, and there were reservations on the titles of which no record had been kept. One of the most i m portant duties of the Administration is to preserve the rights of the natives, and it was found, with respect to an enormous number of registered titles that appeared at first sight to present not the slightest difficulty so far as ordinary transfers were concerned, that a large number of questions had to be settled beI t is not fore anything could be done. Action had to be taken to insure that the native rights in properties were preserved when a transfer was made. That is the reason why there has been considerable delay and very great difficulty in laying down the basis on which transfers would be effected. We had to get the position clarified before we could act. The other matter in which there has been delay is in the making of an Ordinance regulating the searching for oil. That requires an amendment of the Mines Ordinance. This matter has been held up for the reason that the Government, as honourable members know, had the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's experts endeavouring to 'locate oil in the Territory. It was only on 30th June of this year that the Government decided that, save in one particular area, they would throw the land open and issue licences to search for oil. This Ordinance is now practically ready and should be proclaimed shortly. Save in those two instances, there has been no serious delay in finalizing matters. The next criticism isTliere is no policy, ancl the Administrator has no power. The Administrator cannot have power to legislate, nor could he have power even if he had a Council. The Territory can be administered only within the terms of the mandate, and those terms can be altered only by the League of Nations. As the mandate exists today, no authority can legislate for the Territory of New Guinea other than the - Parliament of Australia. All the powers that could be given to the Administrator under the mandate have been given to him. There are twenty different subjects dealt with under the A d ministrator's Powers Ordinance of 1921, and in regard to them the. Administrator has full power to act on his own initiatrator tive and judgment. The next charge isThe Administrator "" cannot even compel the acceptance of his advice on the qualirications tioned of the public servants who are to work under raised him."" He had the greatest difficulty in havexamination, ing a medical standard of fitness established. silenced by factbut That is not so. The advice of the AdAustralian ministrator as to the qualifications of the public servants to be sent to New Guinea tion. has been taken on every occasion, and when the Administrator himself has in Melbourne he has had an opporsent tunity to interview the for ' the various positions. sonnel cui the administrative been recruited from all the States of Australia, and the work has been done through the Public Service Commissioner. select ons have been made by one of his : officers. It would be impossible for the purpose. Administrator to choose his staff in way which it has been suggested, Mr Bruce. either he stayed permanently in Australia, or we sent all the applicants for positions in New Guinea to the Territory for the Administrator to make his selections. When one reads the charge quickly something' seems wrong, but the least examination shows that there is really nothing wrong at all. I assure the House that the Administrator's advice and that of his > officers has been taken, and there has been no attempt to send to New Guinea public servants of a class not suited for the work they will be called upon to perform. We have experienced the greatest difficulty in getting men with the qualifications and experience necessary for a tropical service dealing with a large native population, and the Government appreciates the necessity, if Australia is to continue to be the mandatory power of this Territory and to live up to the traditions of administration laid down by Great Britain in connection with all her colonies, of having some method of training a suitable personnel for this service. We have under consideration proposals for giving those desirous of qualifying for tEis service an opportunity of gaining the education and experience necessary to f it them for the work they will have to carry out. The other half of this charge isThe medical standard of fitness which the Administrator desired has not been adhered to by the Government. The facts are stated by the Adminisi n this cabled message to the GovernmentAs regards medical standard merely menin conversation that objections were first by doctors and individuals in Australia to comprehensive nature our form for medical these objections were that our form merely copy of Mutual Provident Society form. Government created no difficulty this matter of control, promptly adopted form on my explanaHonorable members will see that that beeu charge has no basis of fact.

The next charge isBabaul is governed from Melbourne with The whatsoever flotsam and jetsam in the way of humanity Melbourne cares to send up for the the To many of these statements I object only unless because they are inaccurate, and because, I think the author of them may have been misled; but to this one I take the gravest possible exception. It is a phrase that might have been framed merely to create an effect; but it is a gross libel on the men sent to the Territory, is most unfair, and has no justification in fact. The New Guinea service has been recruited from returned soldiers in Australia, and the Government have done everything possible to see that the men sent there are of a type suited to the work that has to be performed. conduct of these men since they have been in the Mandated Territories is such as to prove this criticism most unfair, and T personally regret very much that it has been made. It must discount to a great extent the whole of the criticism that has been offered, for it appears to have been written to create an impression, and with a reckless disregard' of the facts of the case. Another charge isDrinking ancl gambling was excessive, and there was much gambling between officials Chinese at Rabaul. We have communicated with the Adminisand trator with regard to that statement, he denies it . He saysThere is no more gambling amongst the white residents than is usual in any munity, and the police emphatically state there is practically no gambling among white date. officials and Chinese. The Administrator's statement couched in language which must commend itself to honourable members. He and might simply have cabled that nobody tory. gambles in the ' Territory under his administration, but such a denial would not That is not true. carry conviction to the average mind. He has stated his case frankly and fairly. He says that the position is quite normal and that the police declare that there is no gambling between officials and Chinese. A further charge isThe number in the employ of the Governhospital, ment is excessive. The facts are that the present adminisa trativeestablishment comprises officers, plus 36 who are not subject the Public Service Ordinance. staff was reported upon by a Public Serments, vice Inspector who proceeded to the duplication. Territory in 1922, and the present staff is based upon his recommendations. The German administration in 1913 included a staff of 135 officials, but it must be remembered that many functions are carried out by the administration today that were not considered by the Germans when they were administering the Terri tory. Having regard to our primary obligation under the mandate to care for the well-being of the natives we are taking all steps possible to educate and instruct them. We provide for their technical education and general training, and particular care is being given to their health. The Those services require a larger staff than would be necessary if the Government did not realise a serious obligation towards the native in his own territory. I do not suggest that there are not more civil servants in New Guinea than are necessary, but was there ever a State in which there was not probably an excessive number of civil servants? That charge is always made; it may be true in regard to New Guinea, but it is one of the functions of the Government to ascertain the facts of the case, and if the Territory is and over-staffed to take action accordingly. In view of all the ascertained facts, particularly having regard to the and fact that a Public Service Inspector went to New Guinea last year and investigated this matter, there is certainly no comground for a serious charge against Austhat tralia's administration under the manis Another charge isHospitals are run by the Government, and quite near were others controlled by the Board, this condition obtains all over the TerriI n fifteen places hospitals are conducted by the Administration, but in only three of those, namely, Rabaul, Kaewiegi and Lorungan, is there duplication, in that at each there is also a hospital conducted by the Expropriation Board. It is obligatory upon every employer in the Territory who has 100 or more employees to provide a and, if he has 500 employees, a medical officer also. For that reason large number of hospitals is conducted 185 in different parts of the Territory by the to Expropriation Board, but the AdminisThe tration has only fifteen such establishand at only three places is there Consideration was given to the question whether it would be advisable to close the Board's hospitals, but it was thought desirable to keep them open, because if they have their own hospitals the authorities can better control the natives. But the position is being re-examined. We have - ascertained, however, that the charge of - duplication applies in only three in stances, and there are grave doubts whether there should not be duplication in those .places. As I have just stated, there is an obligation on planters employing 100 or more natives to .maintain a hospital, and if the expropriated properties are dis.posed of, the same obligation will rest .upon the new owners. The next charge isThe Botanical Gardens at Babaul are riddled with diseases. We cabled the Administrator on this .point, and his reply is as follows: Ellis did not see either the director of the gardens .or the gardener when he was in the gardens. Am informed he was seen in the gardens in company with a German, who probably was responsible for exaggerated statement. Only cocoa trees are slightly affected. 'No other disease in garden. Another charge made by Mr Ellis wasThe catalogue of the museum - was defective. The Administrator replies that there is no catalogue at all. What Mr Ellis saw was a number of rough books, used merely to record articles as received. The catalogue is now in course of preparation. Still another charge made by Mr Ellis wasThe telephone system at Rabaul is defective. Mr E . RILEY - Why waste the time of - the House with these matters?",15
7,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I quite agree with the honourable member for South Sydney, but I have nearly finished. I merely wish to add a word or two, and then summarize the position. Replying to the charge against the telephone system at Rabaul, the Administrator statesSystem worked on earth circuit. quently not so good as metallic circuit. It is, however, quite. reasonably effective, and would cost £4,000 to convert. Probably few similar communities have a telephone system at all. I propose to convert when I can spare the money. Many more important things .needed. There are a number of other charges, but I do not wish to weary honourable members with a further recital of them. emphasize, however, that we have taken the trouble to examine them all, and have been furnished with statements as to the - exact position.",19
8,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Who is Ellis?,19
9,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"He lives in Sydney, and wrote a series of articles for the Daily Telegraph. 'These articles have been reprinted in many newspapers in .Australia. I understand that Mr Ellis went round the islands on a .vessel, and >was there for about a fortnight or three weeks. Two - of the charges made by him are very .grave indeed, and in view of our position under the mandate, the Government propose to take .certain action with .regard to them. These charges areForced Government labour has been the order of .the day for a long .time. In some cases those who have been forced to labour receive no pay, and at other times an amount less than that prescribed in the Native LabourOrdinance. The police boys and plantation owners .have been in the habit of flogging the natives. These.charges are very serious. Throughout the period of administration the :Government have laid it down that there must be no forced labour, and that the natives must not be flogged. The .Administrator, in his annual report, issued dast January, said that there was no forced labour except for clearing purposes, for which the Native Labour Ordinances make provision. We have been absolutely unable to get evidence supporting these charges, but the Government take such a grave view of the allegations that we propose immediately to send an independent person - to make an in quiry to ascertain if there is the slightest foundation for these statements. I am unable, at the moment, tb give the name of 'the gentleman who has been in vited to carry out this inquiry, as I have not yet received his definite reply, but I may say that he is an ex-police magistrate of the very highest reputation, and thoroughly competent to weigh evidence. That is the position. I venture to say that the charges contained in the articles Conse- referred to cannot be substantiated, and that Australia need not be apprehensive of her good name in the eyes of the world - when all the facts are known. There are also many charges concerning the expropriated properties, and - I would like to recapitulate briefly"" the circumstances leading up to the creation of the I Expropriation Board. The Board was established when the plantations were taken over from the civil administration, and, of course, after the Mandate had been received. In the terms of 'the Peace Treaty, we had power to expropriate the property of German nationals and to deport them. The Government of the day decided that the German nationals should be deported. It is now suggested that that policy was wrong, and that the Germans should have been allowed to remain in New Guinea. I ask honourable members to get the facts before they express an opinion definitely upon that matter. Under the Mandate the righ t is reserved to the native population to appeal against the Mandatory Power. If the Germans had stayed to manage the plantations^ is it not likely that they, with all their powers of insidious propaganda, would have fomented such trouble amongst the native population that we should have found ourselves in a most serious position? I am not arguing that the expropriation of these properties, and the sending of the Germans out of the country was right or wrong; I am merely mentioning some matters that honourable members should consider before coming to the conclusion that it was wrong: The duty of the Board was to maintain the plantations, to attend the matured trees, and rear the immature trees to the bearing stage. It was not their duty to administer the plantations indefinitely, but to maintain their physical' condition and to dispose of them. That is the work the Board has been endeavouring to carry' out. An attempt was made some little time ago to dispose of properties. great many were advertised, but the response was very poor indeed, and practically no sales were effected. There is hope, however, that the position may 'improve in the not far distant future. Several charges have been made with regard to the present condition of the properties, and one specific charge refers to the treatment of certain individuals. I do not propose to deal with the charges in detail, but merely say that they are open to the gravest suspicion. The whole of the information appears to have come from German nationals who are s t ill in the Territory, and whose claims to retain their properties are at present under consideration. In these circumstances, the Germans affected naturally take any but an impartial view of ""the position. Complaints are made about the treatment of some of the Germans who have appealed against expropriation, and are now awaiting the determination of their cases. One complaint is that the Commonwealth Government is not giving these people reasonable sustenance, and it was alleged that a man named Schwartz, who had been dispossessed of his plantation by the Board, has since December been l i v in g . in the most squalid surroundings. When this person was dispossessed of his plantation, a returned soldier was placed in charge of it , and the expropriation is now the subject of appeal. As a matter of f act, the Government is allowing this man 15s. a day, which, on the evidence we have, is ample to enable a man to live in reasonable and decent comfort in Rabaul. If he is living in squalid circumstances, there is absolutely no reason for the fact, so far as the Government is concerned. Another charge is that the allowance of 15s. a day is debited to the expropriated properties. That is quite untrue. This sustenance expenditure is a charge against the reyenue of the Commonwealth, and not against the properties. Australia has treated German Nationals not only fair l y , but generously. In addition to an ample sustenance allowance, every precaution has been taken by means of a special Appeal Board to prevent any injustice or hardship. In view of our .actions, therefore, these . are charges under which Australia cannot remain silent. A As to the condition of these properties, their production and so forth , there are some, interesting facts that should be laid before the Bouse, so that honourable members may form some idea of the position pending the full statement which the Government will be able to present as a result of the special investigation we are' making into the activities of the Expropriation Board. Copra, of course, is the chief product of the Territory, and in 1913 14,000 tons were exported, and in the twelve months, 1921-22, 25,894 tons. The Expropriation Board' controls the major portion of the properties, and it is clear that there must be some reasonable production, or there could not be such will quantities of copra available for export. In 1914 the area under cultivation was84,000 acres, and in 1921 -22 it was 168,000, or exactly twice as much. The Government, as I have said, is having, a special investigation made of the - whole conduct and 'management of the plantations by the Board. I cannot anticipate the result of the i quiry, but I say, without hesitation, to £ 1 8 10s. that a number of the statements that are being made at the present time are obviously and grossly exaggerated. have here a letter written by Mr George Pulton, manager of Levers' Pacific PlanI tations. The Lever Company has a great number of coconut areas throughout the Islands, and Mr Fulton, who was in Rathen baul late last year, wrote the following : During my visit to the Territory of the late German New Guinea, I inspected a large numtrees. ber of plantations under the control of the propriation Board in New Britain, New Guinea, Witu Islands, and New Ireland, from the stand-point of the practical planter these, with few exceptions, were being well cared for as regards pests and diseases, were being maintained in good order and tion as regards weeds and grass. Any exception to this general condition was usually to lack of labour to do the work, and neglected condition of the property when handed over to the Board by their former German owners. I saw no change in the manner which these plantations are being maintained day compared with eight years ago, when I visited the Territory with Lord Leverhulme. I have another letter written by Mr Staniforth Smith, Director of AgriculCommission ture in Papua, who recently visited the TerritoryI saw a considerable number of plantations controlled by the Expropriation Board, congratulate you on their appearance. The management seemed to be quite satisfactory, and, considering the new material you had handle, the results are surprisingly good. also compared the plantations along the north road with their condition when I was there eighteen months ago, and noticed a great provement. I am not trying to prejudice information we may receive in the future when the whole situation is examined. sending a tropical expert to New Guinea to examine the physical condition of properties, and when his report is availThis able we shall know the facts with exactiscends tude, and not only as presented by the amongst ourselves in Australia. Board, which might be said to have an interest in conveying the idea that thing is right. But there is sufficient dence now to show that the position canand not be anything like what it is represense sented in many quarters. It is only to point out that the Board has met great difficulties in its attempts to administer these properties and maintain them sound financial basis. In September, Mr Bruce. 1920, just before the properties were taken over, copra was £ 4 0 a ton, but n - by A p r i l , 1921, the price had dropped There is a slight revival now, and some indications that the position, as regards price, will improve, I and the output will certainly substantially increase as the trees come into bearing. t is important to remember in dealing with this question, .that after the cessation of hostilities the German planters on the properties, in anticipation of certain events which they thought would happen, planted a great number of young These have not yet come into' Exbearing, but have had to be attended to, and this has been a great financial strain and upon the Expropriation Board. I wish to remind honourable members and that the very greatest caution should be condiobserved in accepting any criticisms of due the position in the Mandated Territories. the The Germans held these Territories, and are determined, if by any possible means that can be achieved, to get them back. in In opening my remarks, I indicated toclearly that last year there certainly was a deliberate effort made by the Germans to prejudice the position of Australia, . not merely in the eyes of the Mandate to whom reports of the administration have to be made, or of the Council of the League, but of every nation that is a member of the League of and I Nations, by a propaganda which they carried out just prior to the meeting of the Assembly of the League last year. to The evidence I have given should make I honourable members very careful about the statements they will accept, unless they imhave the fullest evidence that those statements are absolutely correct. I wish to make it perfectly clear that the Government have no objection to the We are fullest investigation of every phase of its administration in New Guinea. If there the is anything wrong itmust be put right. is a matter which completely tranany differences we may have A matter which affects the ordinary adminiseverytration of the Commonwealth may inevivolve merely the fate of a Government its good name, which in a relative may not matter very much, but fair this particular question involves the reputation and good name of Australia. We must see if we cannot insure that in this on a Mandated Territory we do not merely provide good government, but the very best government that is possible. The Government today is taking steps to find out everything possible with regard to the present state of the administration, the position of the plantations, and every circumstance affecting the welfare of New Guinea. It is proposed that, as soon as the House rises, a Minister shall visit the Territory and investigate the whole position on the spot, on behalf of the Government. In addition, the Government desires that this House should have the fullest information about what is its own territory and its own responsibility. In order that it may have that information, the Government proposes that a delegation from this House, comprising members of every party in it , should take advantage of the recess that is before us to go to New Guinea, when every possible opportunity will afforded to investigate any matter affecting the administration. The Government is hopeful that this delegation, after visiting New Guinea, will draw up a report, and submit any suggestions it is desired to make as to the means by which the carrying out of our Mandate may be improved. I have put the position in this way because I realise that it is the responsibility of the Government to see that this Territory is properly administered. We do not wish to put any part of that responsibility on to a Committee of this House, a Royal Commission, or any one else, but we invite honourable members to become members of the proposed delegation to the Territory, see it for themselves, and make any representations they please to the Government. The responsibility will then rest with the Government to carry out those recommendations, or, if they do not, to bear the burden of having failed to give effect to them. I have outlined the position at present, and I appeal to honourable members on both sides to realise the paramount importance of. this question to Australia, to recognise that our good name is at stake, and to be very chary about accepting statements made as to the position in New Guinea. Above all, I appeal to them to do nothing by their own actions or speeches to aid the Germans in what is undoubtedly an insidious propaganda to blacken Australia's good name, and to have the Mandate for the administration of New Guinea taken away from us.",19
10,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown," I shall not trespass upon the indulgence of the House further than to say that this is a very important question indeed. The Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce) was careful to preface his remarks by stating that it is a matter which gravely concerns, not only the Commonwealth, but also other nations. He has asserted that the statements that have appeared from time to time from the pen of a Mr Ellis are really without foundation. May I say that gentlemen of repute, in no way connected with the Germans, have corroborated much of what Mr Ellis has written.",22
11,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,And very many others say the very opposite.,22
12,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That may be, and be they may be right for anything I know, but this is a matter of vital concern to Australia as a nation, and we have a right to probe the charges made to the very bottom. The fair name of Australia is at stake. The Prime Minister rightly stated that last year, when the Assembly of the League of Nations met, this matter was brought very prominently before it .",22
13,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,And it needed to be.,22
14,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Yes , and it will be brought very prominently before the next meeting of the Assembly, because the criticism is much more severe now than it was twelve months ago. In view of this, I am doubtful whether the position as outlined by the Prime Minister will be satisfactory to the representatives of the nations who will assemble for the next Conference. The right honourable gentleman's statement is a categorical denial of the charges that have been made, but it must not be forgotten that the in formation furnished to him comes from persons directly interested. For this reason, the Prime Minister would be acting wisely if he despatched four members of this House, two from each side, to New Guinea immediately in order to in vestigate the position thoroughly, so that by the time the Assembly of the League of Nations meets we shall be in possession of unbiased information concerning these charges. The arrangements which the Government have made cannot be considered entirely satisfactory. It may be all very well to send an expert in tropical matters to look into certain things, but he will not be in a position to investigate the whole of the ramifications of government.",22
15,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,He will not have anything to do with the administrative side of the question.,23
16,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That would not be expected. Another proposal is to send an ex-police magistrate to* deal with some of the charges that have been made. What should be done to clear our name, and put ourselves right in the eyes of the people of the world, is to send members to New Guinea immediately, to investigate the charges', so that our representatives, when they go to the meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations, will be in a position to put before it the facts supplied by a Committee of this House. I ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the importance of this matter, he will give the House an opportunity to discuss it at a later stage in the session ?",23
17,Mr BHUCE,Unknown,There will be many opportunities. I will discuss it with the honourable gentleman.,23
18,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I accept that promise. I hope that some opportunity will be given to the House to discuss the matter. If the Prime Minister will agree to send a Committee of two honourable members fro m each side to in vestigate the charges that have been made, I think the House will await with confidence their report. I repeat with all the emphasis I can view of the statements that have been made, the fact that the Prime Minister has submitted statements in reply from interested parties will not satisfy the public conscience in regard to this matter. The charges should be probed to the very bottom in order that we may preserve the good name and fame of this country in the eyes of other nations. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",23
19,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation with regard to a paragraph which appeared in Smith's Weekly of 11th July, wherein it is alleged that I stated that my Leader, last session, was continually blackening the character of the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W. M . Hughes), and that this session he was blackening his boots. We are aocustomed to the misrepresentation of the press, which is nothing new, but the statement to which I take exception is absolutely without foundation. I did not interject at any time whilst my Leader was speaking on the censure motion in such a. way as the paragraph I have referred to suggests. In this case the bounds of decency.have been overstepped by the correspondent sending the statement to the newspaper, and doubly overstepped by the proprietors of the newspaper in printing such malicious rot.

21,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"The amount of profit derived from the provision store business in connection with the Trans-Australian railway varies from year to year. The object of establishing these stores , was not for the purpose of making a profit, but so .that the men employed might obtain necessities at as low a cost as practicable, and it was agreed with the representatives of the employees that the ratescharged should be in accordance with the prices in the newspaper, The Grocer. that, in published monthly in Adelaide. The operation of the stores has been such that the employees throughout the whole length of the line purchase their' commodities at Adelaide prices or lower. SENIOR SICK BERTH RATINGS.",23

Is it a fact that application was recently made for senior sick .berth ratings to be sentout from England for temporary service in the Royal Australian Navy ? 2. If so, was this necessary when a rating of the equivalent rank whose age for retirement had not been reached has been recently discharged from the service?",23
23,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes. 2. Yes. I am informed .that the ratings' of equivalent rank recently retired had reached the retiring age. FRUIT POOL.,23
24,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon noticeWill he explain re the fruit ""pool"" what is the explanation re my charges made on Friday, the 29th June!",24
25,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I have Lad this matter looked into, and find that on the 14th June"" last the honourable member asked, "" What position in .the - Commonwealth Service or the - Commonwealth F r u it Pool .does Mr Ennis occupy? "" The answer given was that Mr Ennis occupies no position in the Commonwealth Service. This statement is true in fact, as Mr Ennis is - not on the permanent or .temporary staff of the Commonwealth Service. It was further stated in answer to the question that Mr Ennis was at present assisting the selling organization in London in disposing of the stocksof canned f r u it s held there. 27 tb June it was stated, in answer to a furthe r question by the honourable member, that Mr Ennis is at present employed by the - Comononwealth, and is assisting the selling organization don. This answer has evidently led to some slight misunderstanding. Mr Ennis is.being paid from the commission gained by the selling organization from the sale upon noticeof Commonwealth canned fruits. under the control and direction of the High Commissioner in London as long as his services are required there by the selling organization. The allowance of £100 per month which is paid to Mr Ennis is a charge against the sellingcommission of 2 per cent, payable to the organization selling the f r u it , - and the other expenditure in connection with Mr Ennis is a charge against the F r u it Pool. much regret if any misunderstanding has arisen on the matter, and can assure the honourable member that the information furnished is accurate.

If so, what are such provisions? 3. Will the Government take steps to establish a regular Civil Service of qualified persons in all the tropical Territories of the Commonwealth.",24
27,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. and 2. Other than the requirement that appointees must be natural-born British subjects, and must be of good character and sound health, there are no provisions specifically defining the qualifications required of Commonwealth employees in the Territory of New Guinea. When, however, a vacancy arises, applications there for are invited by advertisement, and the special qualifications required of the appointee are set out in the advertisement. Appointments are - probationary in .the first instance, except in special .cases where the Governor General otherwise directs. Before appointments to ..the First and Second Divisions are confirmed, the proposed appointee may be required to undergo a prescribed special course of training for the Public Service at a University or elsewhere. 3.

Mr WEST .asked the Prime Minister, He is 1. Is it a fact that(a) Early in 1920 an arrangement was made by the Commonwealth Government whereby the Colonial Combing, - Spinning, and Weaving Co. Ltd. wore enabled to secure large quantities of wool at the appraised' prices under the Imperial purchase scheme? (6) The Graziers Federal Council of Australia, at its meeting in March, 1920, strongly protested against the company mentioned being placed in a I very more favourable position than other similar .companies, and demanded that Australian wool growers should be put in the position of receiving their share of the profits which might reasonably be anticipated to accrue had such wool been shipped to London instead of being taken over for the local manufacture of tops? (c) The reasonableness of the contentions put forward by the Graziers Federal Council was admitted by the Commonwealth Government^, and the then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr Hughes) announced in Parliament, in reply to a question by Mr A"". S. Rodgers, that the Government was prepared to allow the Australian wool growers, in respect of the wool supplied to the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, under contract for the manufacture of - wool tops, the same share of profits in such wool as if it had formed part of the wool sold to the Imperial Government? 2. If so, will he state the reason why such payment, amounting to £398,000, plus accrued interest, has not been made?",24

38,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is a soldier who has served in the Naval or Militar y Forces of any part of the King's Dominions, other than the Commonwealth, entitled to benefits under the Repatriation Act? 2. What rulings have been ""given by the Commissioners for Repatriation on this matter?",26
39,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:- ' 1. Yes, under certain conditions.:(a) W it h respect to war pensions, section 45 of the Act provides that the provisions of Part III . of the Act shall extend to any person who is serving or has served during the present war in the Naval or Military Forces of any part of the King's Dominions other than the Commonwealth on active service outside that Dominion, on proof to* the satisfaction of the Commission that he was, immediately before being called up or before his enlistment, as the case may be, domiciled in the Commonwealth. Provided that a pension shall not be payable under this section to any person who is not bond fide resident in Australia. (6) W it h respect to general repatriation benefits, section 46 provides that any person who has served during the Great War in the Naval or Militar y Forces of any part of the. King's Dominions, other than the Commonwealth, on active service outside that Dominion, on proof to the satisfaction of the Commission that he had, before his enlistment or appointment [35] for service, resided in the Commonwealth, shall be deemed to be an Australian soldier within the meaning of Parts 4 and 5 of the Act. . Section 46 also provides for the eligibility of the Army Medical Corps Nursing Service under similar conditions. 2. (a) In regard to section 45, ruling 21 was issued on the Sth August, 1916. This ruling reads as follows:B.m.isa No. 21. Subject: British Heservists, dtic. Section 45. (8th August, 1916.) 1. Section 45 of the Act applies, not only to the soldiers mentioned therein, but also to their dependants. 2. Careful inquiries should in all such cases be made, in order to see that the soldier concerned was, "" immediately before being called up, or before his enlistment, as the case may be, domiciled in the .Commonwealth "". All cases under section 45 must be referred to the Commission, with full particulars and a recommendation from the Board. The proofs as to domicile required by the Commission will be similar to those required by Ruling 31, paragraph 3. 3. The amount of Commonwealth war pension in such cases will be governed by clause (c) of the proviso to seition 23. In such cases the amount of Commonwealth war pension will be subject to a reduction by the amount received under any Imperial or State Act in respect of the death or incapacity of the soldier concerned. , 4. For the purpose of this ruling, war pen' sions paid under any Dominion Act (as well as any Imperial Act) will be deducted from the amount of Commonwealth war pension. . 5. Pensions under thissection are only payable to bond fide residents of Australia; the Crown Solicitor is ofopinion that a person who is a bond fide resident in Australia would not cease to be a bond fide resident merely because ho or she temporarily left Australia to pay a visit to some other country, and the Commonwealth war pension would be payable during such temporary absence. The case would be different if he or she left Australia without intending to return. The opinion is also expressed that such a pensioner who ceases to be a bond fide resident of Australia could have his or her pension resumed if he or she again became a bond fide resident of Australia. (6) In regard to the part of section 46 referred to, ruling 31, dated 25th July, 1918, reads as follows:- ""Subject: Proof of Domicile im Australia-Sectio n - 46 (2) (c) and (d) of Act. The Commission has decided that the words ""before his enlistment or appointment for service resided in the Commonwealth "", or similar words as used in section 46 (2) (c) and {d) of the Act shall be deemed to mean that the soldier must have had a home or fixed place of abode in the Commonwealth at least wit'uiri twelve months before the war. < The spirit of the section of the Act is to provide for those Australians who, at the outbreak of war, found themselves away from Australia, and consequently enlisted in the British or nearest Dominion Forces. A person, merely visiting Australia at some time previous to the war for business or health reasons, and who had a temporary residence in Australia, would not be considered eligible, neither would a person who left Australia some years before the war with the express intention of permanently settling abroad. A Deputy Commissioner may, in the light of these directions, determine eligibility of applicants for assistance in Australia without referring the case to the Commission. The proofs required by a Deputy Commissioner in support of applications shall be a statutory declaration by applicant as to the date and period of residence in Australia, supported by a birth certificate or a declaration by some reliable person in the Commonwealth. Where a Deputy Commissioner considers that there are special circumstances relating to a case which prevent its being ,dealt with under a strict reading of this ruling, the case may he remitted to the Commission for consideration as a special case, but it is to be understood that the mere fact that any particular case docs not appear to he provided for would not in itself justify the forwarding, of such a case to the Commission for special consideration, as it is the Commission's intention to treat only those cases which come within the spirit of this ruling as special cases. MANUFACTUR E OF MACHINERY .",26
40,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"On 6 th July the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) asked the following questions, upon noticeIn view of the statements made by the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Massy' Greene) in the Tariff debate 1922, Mansard No. 74, pages 9061 and 9062, will the Minister supply the following information:1. The total .number of men actually employed in the manufacture of reapers and binders and mowers in Australia ? 2. How many of these men iare returned . soldiers? 3.

NA BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed' from 10th July, vide page 871): Clauses 2 to 4 agreed to. Clause 5The head office of the Line shall be at such place as the Governor General, by notice in the Gazette, directs.",27
41,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter ) [ 3 . 5 4 ] - I move That all the words after "" be"" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :- "" situated in Australia, and th.5 Chairman of the Board shall reside in Australia during the period of his appointment. "" 2. All snips held or acquired by the Board shall be registered in Australia."" The object of the amendment is to give the Committee an opportunity of deciding where the head office of the Line shall be. The question was full y debated on the motion for the second reading of the Bill , and I think it was generally admitted by honourable members that it would be advantageous to have the head office of the Line in Australia. In the past the head office has been situated in Great Britain. As we are eliminating political influence from the management - of the t in e , it becomes all the more important that the head office should be in this country. Primary producers and manufacturers who are interested in the export of produce or manufactured goods would then be able to place their views directly before the Board. As the clause stands the Governor General might, on the advice of the Government, decide that, the - head office should be in one of the States of Australia, but, on the other hand, he might decide that it should be abroad. It would not be in the best interests of the Line to have the office abroad. So far as is humanly possible the Line should be made an Australian shipping line. The head office should be.in this country; only Australian seamen, or seamen domiciled in Australia, should be employed on the ships; and the Chairman of the Board should reside in Australia, and should know ' something of Australian conditions. Well qualified men might be obtained from abroad, but men of equal qualifications might be available in Australia. If a man could be found i u Australia 'fully .qualified to carry the great responsibility of managing the Line, why should he not be given au opportunity? Other things being equal, the appointment of an Australian would be of advantage to the people of this country and to the Line. want the ships to be registered in Australia, and the conditions set out in Australian industrial awards to be observed on them. We should aim at creating an Australian sentiment concerning the Ljne> and we can do that only by having the head office in this country, by compelling the Chairman of the Board to reside here, by registering the ships here, and by stipulating that all work in connection with the Line shall be carried out, as far as possible, country. It is necessary to make provision to that effect in the Bill . Let the .Parliament decide where the head office is to be. Otherwise this. Government may locate it in Australia, but another Government might shift it elsewhere. It is far better that the location of the head office should be under the control of the Parliament. the consent of Parliament should be obtained before the office is shifted. This is <a matter which does not require very much argument. I hope the Prime Minister will accept the amendment, and also that he will agree to the chairman of the Board residing in Australia, and to the registration of all the tonnage in Australia. It is a reasonable amendment, and will make for the future success of the Line - In regard to this and other amendments, which may be moved from this side of the Chamber, I assure the Prime Minister that our only object » is to improve the measure. We have already given him credit for continuing the Line, and now we want to make it both an Australian and a paying concern. We have no desire whatever to injure the measure. ,. We want the Line to succeed.",27
42,Mr BEUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime M in ister and Minister for External A f fair s ) [ 4 . 1 ] - I quite understand what is in the mind of the honourable gentleman in moving this amendment, but there are one or two facts that I - must mention. I am prepared to accept the proposal that the head office of the Line toshall be in the Commonwealth. It is, and always has been, the intention Government to establish the head office in Australia, and we want the Line to be. managed and controlled from Australia. I cannot accept the second part of the amendment, however. The chairman of the B'oard obviously will have to I also reside,in Australia. If the head office is here the greater part of his time will have to be spent here.",28
43,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is all I desire. - Mr Bruce - The reason why I can.not accept the latter part of the amendment is because the words "" reside in Australia"" may cause some legal difficulty. If the head office of the L in e is in Australia the principal duties of the chairman of the Board will be here, but he in this will certainly have to make frequent visits to Great Britain .",28
44,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I admit lhat.,28
45,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"There is not the slightest objection on our part to having the head office here. But the chairman of the Board will not be able to spend the whole of his time here. As to the registration in Australia of all the tonCertainly nage, the position today is that all the vessels, with the exception of the "" exenemy "" boats, are registered here. There are legal difficulties in connection with, the "" ex-enemy "" vessels. I do not want to go into the whole position, but the hard fact is that we cannot register them in Australia. They are on the British register, and they must stay there. The intention of the Government is that the Commonwealth Line shall be Australian. When we have' no longer an Australian overseas mercantile marine the Line will cease to exist. If the conditions which prevail in Australia are such that the Line cannot be carried on, then it must discontinue. We desire to establish this Line on the best possible basis. It is to be an Australian Line, manned by Australian sailors, and worked under Australian conditions. If that cannot. be done, it will be the end of the Line. I accept the first part of the amendment, and if it will meet the wishes of the honourable members opposite, will insert the words "" in the Commonwealth."" Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr BRUOE) agreed That after the word "" place "" the words "".in of the the Commonwealth "" be inserted.",28
46,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) [ 4 . 7 ] - I want an assurance that it is absolutely impossible to register the ex-eneray ships in the Commonwealth. I can understand that there may be technical difficulties, but I can hardly believe that when the ownership of a vessel changes it cannot be registered in another country.",29
47,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime M in ister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.8] - We cannot register - these vessels in Australia. I do not want to worry the Committee with details. There has been > trouble in connection with these ex-enemy vessels during a. number of years. There was a Disposals Board appointed in Great Britain to get r i d of them. There are grave doubts even now as to the exact procedure 'to be followed, but in Australia we put the proceeds of any sale into a trust account for whoever may be concerned. The enemy vessels are on the British register, and they must stay there. The technical difficulty in the way of transfer is insuperable. ' Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 6(1) For the purposes of this Aet there shall be a Board of Directors consisting of not less than three nor more than five members. .",29
48,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) [4.11] - Will the Prime Minister have the word "" commissioners "" inserted instead of "" directors ""? If we use the term "" directors,"" the gentlemen appointed may consider that they have to act primarily as directors, whereas if we use the word "" commissioners "" it will be understood better, perhaps, that they are placed in charge, and will be looked upon to discharge duties additional to those usually discharged by directors, and that they will have the control of the various departments. It is merely a question of terms, but "" commissioners "" would be more appropriate.",29
49,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"If the honourable member proposed ""managing directors"" that would make the title quite clear.",29
50,Mr SCTJLLIN,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) "" [ 4 . 1 2 ] move That after the word *' members,"" line 3, the words "" and shall include a representative of the industrial unions whose members are engaged on the ships held or acquired by the Board "" .be inserted. Three members are, I think, necessary for this Board or Commission, but I hope the proposal that a representative of the workers shall be added to the number will be agreed to. I stated last night my reasons for proposing this. We desire that the Line shall be a success, and that it shall work smoothly. We believe success and smooth working will largely depend upon the men. Seamen, as is well known, ha.ye a very hazardous and daring occupation. It is equally well known that big disputes often arise from small matters, and that they are due frequently to a lack of understanding between the men and the management. We also had a very fine tribute from the righ t honourable member for Nort h Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes) to the work of the shipbuilding yards and the smoothness with which the operations have been carried on. One of the great factors of the success of the shipbuilding industry has been the co-operation between the management and the unions. They had a representative of their own on the Shipbuilding Tribunal. During the whole of that period there was not one stoppage of work at Williamstown Dockyard, and if there was any elsewhere it was very brief. Y e t many questions arose which might have led to a big strike but for the understanding that prevailed between the men and the management. Such an understanding is most important in an industry like the Commonwealth Shipping Line, which is on its trial. I notice that the Government contemplate the representation of different interests on the Land - Board in the Northern Territory. Although I cannot see a very strong reason why the pastoralists should be represented on the Land Board, the fact that such representation is proposed shows that the Go-\ernment recognises the principle that I am advocating. My amendment is submitted in the sincere hope that the Government will adopt it , and that we shall . not be compelled to force the Committee to a division. Honourable members on this side hope that the Commonwealth Shipping Line will be a success, and I accept the assurance of the Prime Minis- I ter that the Government also is animated by the same desire. Without being egotistical, we on this side can claim to understand the psychology of the workman better than does the Prime Minister, although he probably understands the viewpoint of the employer better than we do. The right honourable gentleman certainly realizes that the sucoess of the Shipping Line will be dependent upon the preservation of good feeling between the management and all those who man the boats. It is for that reason that we ask tLat the organizations of which the employees of the Line are members should have the right to elect a representative on the Board of Directors. And he must be a man chosen by the workers themselves, because they would have less faith in a nominee of the Government. I do not suggest that the Government should be bound to accept one particular man nominated by the unions; they might be given the right to choose from a number of men so nominated. This request is reasonable, and the granting of it will make for.the success of the Line.",29
51,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Minders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.18] - I appreciate very clearly the view which the honourable member' for Yarra (Mr Scullin) has stated. His amendment is designed to insure the smooth working of the Line, and the avoidance of stoppages of work for no real cause, but simply because of mutual lack of trust between the parties. I agree with the principle of giving representation to the employees on Boards controlling large in dustrial concerns, so that the workers may have some confidence in the management and feel assured of a fair deal. If the Shipping Directorate were a Board of thai character there would be no insuperable obstacle to the appointment of a representative of the workers; but it is not a Board such as those upon which the unions have been given representation from time to time. This Bill is creating three managing directors or commissioners, whose respective spheres of activity will be clearly defined. They will be f u time officers^ each controlling his own department of the industry; therefore, representation of the workers on such a Board would not be at all analogous to representation on other industrial bodies that meet once a week or once a fortnight and exercise merely general advisory or supervisory control. I am quite as anxious as are honourable members opposite to arrive at some understanding which will insure that industrial disputes shall be avoided. The matter has been already discussed by the Government, and we have decided that after the members of the Board' are appointed, and before the ships are actually transferred to their control they, and representatives of the unions interested in the industry, shall be invited to confer-with me with a view to discovering, if possible, a basis upon which disputes in connection with the Line can be adjusted internally through representatives of the Board and the workers in the industry. We might be able to arrive at a definite basis upon which all disputes can be referred to such a tribunal before they reach the stage of a stoppage of work or open turmoil. So far as an internal arrangement of that kind can be made, the Government will offer no objection to equitable representation being given to the employees in the industry, but, having regard to the peculiar character of the Commission or Directorate, direct representation of the workers upon that body is not an appropriate means of trying to insure industria l peace in connection with the Line.",30
52,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Dalley) [ 4 . 2 2 ] - I am - sorry that the Prime Minister has not excepted the amendment; because the success of the Line will depend very largely upon the relations that are maintained between the management and the employees. In the past most of the stoppages of work have been due to very minor disputes. Some of them were mere pin-pricks, but the nature of their occupation makes seamen very ready to resent anything that appears to them to be unjust. A representative on the Board who understood the industrial conditions of the men, and had worked amongst them, would be able to do much to clear away misunderstandings. A prolific cause of industrial unrest is the fact that the management do not understand in t i mately the conditions obtaining in the in l l - dustry, and the personal view-point of the men. The Prime Minister is mistaken in thinking that it will be sufficient to appoint a representative of the employees to a Disputes Board. Puch a Board can operate only after a dispute has arisen. What is required is a means of preventing disputes rather than of settling them. There should be on the directorate a man who understands the workers, and how to talk to them, and offers to them some guarantee of a fair deal. I hope honourable members will not vote on this amendment upon purely party lines. The ""proposal is in the interests of the Shipping Line, and it will certainly be to the .advantage of the primary producers, whose goods the ships v ill carry, that the Line shall operate without friction between the management and the workers.",30
53,Mr WATSON,Unknown,This proposal will help a little.,31
54,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"There is no doubt about that. Having had many years' experience of industrial unionism, I know tow troubles have arisen, and how easily they might h-.ve been avoided. 8 serious dispute is brought about by tactlessness on the part of some officer or manager who is out of sympathy with the Ken. Give the seamen a representative who will understand the industry from their point of view. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Yarra is rather too restricted, because the lepresentation for which he asks w i confined to those who are engaged on the ships. The industry covers, not merely tLe running of the ships, but shipbuilding and kindred occupations, and I suggest to the honourable member that the amendment should be altered to provide for a representative of ""industrial unions engaged in the industry.""",31
55,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,Would the honourable member's suggestion include the wharf labourers ?,31
56,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Probably it would, but at any rate it would insure a wider field of selection. There may not bb amongst one class of unions a man with the necessary qualifications to represent the workers, on the Board, but in Borne kindred unions there may be a man eminently fitted for the post, and it is of vital importance to the industry that the best possible man for the position should be appointed - I support the amendment. As a one-time",31
57,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [4.31] I believe the adoption of the amendment will make for the smooth working of the industry and prevent many of those in dustrial disputes which, as we have learned from experience,' are due largely to misunderstandings between those engaged in an industry and those controlling it . We have to remember that men engaged in the shipping industry are exposed to many hardships, and therefore they are entitled to have a representative on the Board of management. The feeling of security which they would then enjoy would mean much for the success of the Line. The amendment should commend itself to our intelligence as being both practicable and sensible. reasons advanced by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) against its acceptance were lamentably weak. He told us that members of the Board were in much the same position as permanent Commissioners engaged in managing a great public utility. The fact that the Board will be appointed permanently is the very reason why we desire to have a representative ot Many the men on it to place before the other members the view-point of the men. This would be a very much more satisfactory arrangement than for the Board, in the event of industrial disputes, to meet representatives of the men and consult with them. The industrial history of this country, and, indeed, of every other country in the world, is remarkable for l l be the number' of consultations of this nature. Our experience in the management of our railways by Commissioners should be a sufficient warrant for the adoption of the amendment. The Board will be in .absolute control, and will be able to disregard even recommendations of the Government. Members on this side of the House are entitled to speak with more authority from the point of view. of the working man and the psychology of the working-class people, than honourable members supporting the Government, and I assure them that the acceptance of the amendment will go a long way towards insuring peace in the industry. All students of industrial conditions are agreed that the workers should have representation in the management of any industry in which they are engaged. I hope, therefore, that the amendment will be carried. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [4.37]. representative of employees in arbitration matters, I can assure honourable members that a proper understanding of the position by those miost vitally interested is half the battle in restoring harmonious relations between management ' and employees. If the marine engineers or seamen had a representative on the Board, it is possible that, if a dispute arose, he would be able to explain to the men that the enforcement of their claim might, handicap the Line in competition with other vessels. I believe that, . as sensible and reasonable men', the unionists would respond to such an appeal from their own representative and modify their attitude. I do not favour the suggestion The that the proposed representative should be selected from any of the unions en-. gaged in the industry, because that would include coal-miners and those engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel, as well as wharf labourers, shipwrights, and many other unionists working on shore jobs. The right of representation should be confined to those actually engaged in the working of the ships. I trust, therefore, that the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) will stand by his amendment as originally presented. .",31
58,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Denison) [ 4 . 4 0 ] - I trust that the silence on the part of M i nisterial supporters does not indicate that they are out of sympathy with the amendment. I take it that all honourable members who supported the second reading desire to make the Board as workable as possible, and to insure the success of the Line. I have not the slightest doubt that the Prime Minister wishes it to be successful. Therefore, I hope that those honourable members representing, especially, the primary producing interests will give the amendment their favourable consideration. The State which I represent is more deeply interested in the success of the Line than, perhaps, any other State in the Commonwealth, because we are dependent upon the continuity of our shipping services. On three occasions, at least, at a time when very large numbers of people usually travel to Tasmania, our shipping services have been cut ofi at a moment's notice as a result of some industrial dispute. As I am hoping that Commonwealth vessels will trade between Tasmania and the mainland, I am anxious that the vessels of the Line should not be hampered by industrial disputes. On one occasion when, in consequence of a shipping dispute, Tasmania was practically severed from the mainland, a ship captain, who had been engaged in the trade with that State for a number of years, told me that that particular trouble would never have occurred if the directors of the shipping company had thoroughly understood what the men desired - that all was the result of a misunderstanding. That strike once started lasted for several weeks, resulting in the greatest inconvenience to the primary producers of Tasmania and to the community generally. This ship captain freely expressed that opinion, although we may take it that he would sympathize with his directors rather than with the employees. Let us hope that the Board will appreciate the fact that ""prevention is better than cure,"" for if this business is conducted in that spirit, we shall see very few disputes with the men. I appeal to the Prime Minister and his supporters to pause before they oppose the amendment, even to the extent of postponing the clause for further consideration. We on this side have been in much closer touch with the industrial world than has the Prime Minister. That, I think, will be admitted by the right honourable gentleman, and he ought to accept our assurance that if he consents to have a representative of the men on the Board, much will be done t© prevent industrial disputes in connection with the Line.",32
59,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong ) [4.50]. - The honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe) hits the nail on the head when he reminds us of the old ' saying, "" prevention is better than cure,"" the truth of which is keenly appreciated by honourable members who have been associated with industrial unions here and elsewhere. For many years I was on the board of management, of the Typographical - Union, now known as the Printing Industries Union of Australia, and I can say that for over forty years there was neither strike nor lock-out in the printing trade in Victoria. This was the result of a wise policy of nipping in the bud any threatened trouble; and that is a policy which we desire to see associated with the management of the Commonwealth Line. There would be no possibility of the one representative of the workers dominating the other members of the Board. Every question will be decided by a majority, so that the members nominated by the Government must, have control, but the amendment, if carried, would secure an adviser with a practical knowledge of those employed on the in dustrial side of the business. Such a representative would prove invaluable, because it is certain that he would be able to give timely information and advice. I appeal to the primary producers in the Committee to support this amendment, and I ask them whether they would not prefer their export business to be carried cn interruptedly without the' i r r it at in g disputes and delays experienced in the past. I do not wish to attach blame to any one, but I believe that if there had 940 Commonwealth [REPRESENTATIVES.] been a more amicable spirit between the management and the men, and if there had been a conference to discuss troubles, the business of the Line would have run more smoothly. The Prime (Mr Bruce) indicated that he had some other method of attaining the sought by this amendment. The right honourable gentleman did not say exactly what his method was, but I infer that in some way he intends the sympathy and support unions. If I am right, better plan could the honourable gentleman adopt than a workers' representative to the Board? Some months ago the manager of one of the largest meat businesses m my constituency told me that he paid one of the leading union officials to be always about the premises, his duty being to report any likely dispute, with a view to its immediate settlement. In similar works, elsewhere, there has been no end of trouble, but all has gone well in the works to which I refer, with continuity of employment, larger and, what is more, better financial returns to the proprietors. Similar have been taken in more than one instance, and large employers tell us that one of the main reasons of their success is the creation and maintenance of amicable relations with the employees. such relations and such results that we desire to see in the case of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. Many strikes are caused by small misunderstandings, sometimes become of such magnitude as to disorganize the whole trade and commerce of the country. Under the Superannuation Act, wnich we passed last session, the Government nominated to the Board of three, a man who had practically been selected by the public servants themselves; and on the occasion we are asking for only one representative out of four. We, on this side, desire the Line to work smoothly in the interests of , not only the Board and the employees, but the whole people of Australia. We are now for the first timo placing the Line on a statutory which will be lasting, and I appeal to the Prime Minister to give the Board a good send. of f . With the writing of values indicated by the Prime Minister, the Board will start on fair lines. Does the Prime Minister propose to. estabMr Fenton. Shipping Bill. lish a tribunal as in the shipbuilding industry ?",32

61,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Shipbuildin g was a Minister Government business, and in connection with it , the Government established a objects tribunal for the prompt settlement of disputes. It was composed of two members of unions and Mr Connington, a gentleman who is perhaps as conversant with to enlist trade union principles and tactics of the as any man in Australia. Perhaps, the what Prime Minister has something of the kind right in mind, but why make such provision appoint when it is possible to give the employees of the Line direct representation on the Board? I hope it will not be suggested that honourable members on this side submit this proposal in order merely to put themselves right with the unions outside. It is done because, as taxpayers, in common with honourable members opposite, we desire that the Line shall be conducted properly and without friction. Honourable members are aware that very resultant big business firms have taken the advice, output, and availed themselves of the assistance of labour unions in the conduct of their steps businesses, and have found that it has resulted in less friction and greater profits. Similar results may be looked for from the operations of the Commonwealth Shipping Line if the Prime Minister will It is accept the suggestion that has been made from this side;",33
62,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"Lilley) [5.2] - At which first sight the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) seems rather attractive; but, on consideration, I doubt very much whether the appointment of a fourth director to represent the employees would achieve all that honourable members opposite claim for-it. We know from painful experience present that most of the disputes that have arisen in connection with the Commonwealth ships have occurred between men on individual vessels, and have had to be decided by the masters. It seems to me that the industry will be generally regulated by awards of the Arbitration Court, and the basis, appointment of a fourth director as representative of the employees would have little influence in the settlement of disdown putes. I think that the adoption of the suggestion offered by the Prime Minister would be more effective in preventing disputes than would the amendment proposed from the other side.",33
63,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [5.4] I trust that the Prime Minister will accept the amendment. I believe that he is well disposed towards the Gommonwealth Shipping Line. The right honors able gentleman and his party claim to desire to legislate on behalf of all classes, and from that point of view the amendment under consideration might be regarded as a test of the sincerity of that claim. It is for the Prime Minister to show that he has in mind not only the interests of those who control the Line, but of Ihe workers who will be engaged in the industry. The amendment would afford them an opportunity of placing any - grievances they might have before the Board. The proposal is not new, and the Prime Minister could not be accused by his supporters of adopting revolutionary methods if he accepted the amendment. I think that even the newspaper editors would take to the suggestion kindly if it were adopted by so well balanced a man as the Prime Minister. A similar provision has been adopted in Western Australia by a Government' that is considered to have very Liberal views. A man has been appointed on the Board of the Harbor Trust at Fremantle to represent the workers. The experience of the Trust has been that when difficulties have arisen with the employees this representative of the workers has been able to advise the other members of the Board in dealing with matters in dispute, and there has consequently very seldom been any serious trouble. I cannot see what objection can be urged to the amendment. It will not be contended that the proposed fourth director will be so powerfully persuasive a man as to be able to induce the other three members of the Board to do something which would not be in the interests' of the Line. The Prime Minister has an excellent opportunity, by accepting the amendment, to show the workers of the country that the Government is prepared to consider their in terests as well as the interests of those engaged in commercial and farming in dustries. If the right honourable gentleman cannot see his way to accept the amendment for the moment, he might consent to the postponement of the clause in order that the matter might be further considered, and some amicable arrangement arrived at which will be satisfactory to honourable members on this side.",34
64,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"Richmond) [5.7] - J have listened with interest to the arguments put forward by honourable members opposite to show why a fourth member should be appointed to the Board to represent the various industrial unions concerned in the operation of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. It appears to me that they desire that a man should be appointed to the Board for a number of years at a very high salary to do one thing only, and that is to prevent industrial trouble on the boats.",34
65,Mr YATES,Unknown,Does the honourable member not think that the money would be well spent?,34
66,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Yes , if the amendment achieved its object.",34
67,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"It appears to me to be a travesty upon industrial life in Australia to suggest that it is necessary to ' employ a man at a big salary to act merely as a peacemaker. There will be no guarantee that the unions concerned will behave themselves any better because they have a representative on the Board. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) proposes that the Board shall consist of three members^-on e to deal with finance, another with shipping, and the thir d with construction. These men will hold very important positions and will need to be experts in the work which they are called upon to perform. There is nothing to show that the fourth member proposed to be appointed to the Board would know anything of the work which the other three members would be specially concerned about. The Board will be up against the competition of international brains devoted to the destruction of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. We should not have a drag upon it in the person of a-fourth member, who could be of no assistance in the consideration of points of policy which the Board will be called upon to determine - I was prepared to be convinced by honourable members opposite, but their arguments in support of the amendment have lef t me stone cold. MT . F. MCDONALD (Barton ) T5.10]. 1 - The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) has said that the arguments of honourable members on this side have left him stone cold with regard to the claim of the men employed by the - Commonwealth Shipping Line to representation on the Board. I am surprised to hear that ; but in my view the honourable member has altogether missed the point of the amendment. Some honourable members on the other side, and to a certain extent even the Prime have missed the real purpose of the amendment. In speaking on the second reading of the Bill the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) gave very fully, his reasons why the men should have some representation on the Board. It was not only that disputes might not occur or that, if they occur, might be readily Honourable members' on this side might eon tend, and unbiased honourable opposite miglit agree, that the representation of the men on the Board would have a great influence for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. that was by no means the chief reason assigned by the honourable member for Yarra for his amendment. It is not easy to express that reason, but we believe that in connection .with a national of this kind the Australian nation would do well to follow the example set by splendid employers in other parts of the world, who have recognised the worth of their employees as men, and their rights, and have given them some voice' in the control of the industries in which are engaged. Some of the writers and philosophers of the present day, detached from politics, and even industry, and in a position to express an unbiased view of such matters, have recorded that the next important be taken in the evolution, of the economic and industrial system under which we are living must be the conceding of some voice in the management of industries by those who are engaged in them. honourable member for Yarra has shown that his proposal is quite practicable. We should be prepared to make recognition of the claims of human worth and rights. These claims have recognised in many cases with very great success. During the years of the war, when all were forced to recognise the' great services rendered to eyery by those' who constituted its brawn and muscle, we were promised all these things in the democratization of industry. Are those on this side, of the Chamber the only members who are prepared to honour that promise 1 I do not think so. - I believe that the Prime Minister, ing by the speech he made this afternoon,"" is prepared to go a certain distance in honouring' the promise, or in what he reMr F. MCDonald. gards as honouring the promise. If honourable members and the men employed in the industry will examine his speech, Minister, they will come to the conclusion that there is not much in his undertaking to fulfil that promise. He has said that he will make provision for the Board to receive certain representations from the men. He has said that he is in agreement with the principle advocated by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Sculsettled. lin), but, although he recognises, its virtue in application, he is not prepared members to apply it . He will , however, go a certain distance, and we are sorry that, in this national enterprise, he will not go the whole way. I am sorry, because the But test has been applied to the Government. It has been charged with being a reactionary Government, but its action in connection with the Shipping Line, taken in spite of the opposition of the enterprise press and politicians, has not displayed any reactionary tendencies. So far it has emerged well from that test. But another test is now being applied to it . . It is embarking upon a national enterprise, and surely in such an undertaking it should recognise the claims of the men it they' employs. I hope it does not think that greatest the promises made were rash. I hope it does not think that those philosophers who say that the next step in industrial and economic evolution must be in the direction of giving some voice in the step to control of businesses to employees, are entirely Wrong. I hope it does not take the. view that we have arrived at the highest point attainable in industrial development. If it does, it justifies the The actions of those people who preach revolution in Australia, and who say, "" Away with political methods, for we can this do no more by those means. The only thing thab will do us any been good is a revolutionary change of the whole system."" Let it remember that if it maintains that we. have arrived at the summum bonum of industrial pronation gress, it preaches a policy of despair which must drive people to advocate revolution. When it talks of Communists and revolutionists, let it remember that its actions create Communists and revolutionists, whom members on this side of the Housa have to spend many hours in judg- converting. I ask the Prime Minister to look upon this matter in the sympathetic way in which he has approached the whole question, of the Shipping Line. I ask bim to remember that it is not only a . matter of pounds, shillings, and pence, or of preventing or curing industrial disputes. It is much more spiritual than the mere material view put forward by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green). If the honourable member would exercise his mind on this aspect of ihe question, he will come to a conclusion more worthy of himself than the views expressed by him this afternoon. practicability of the proposal has been shown, and if the Prime Minister will accept the amendment, or incorporate the principle in the Bill , he will avail himself of an opportunity which few Prime Ministers of Australia have had. He has already- I was going to say-covere d himself with glory, but at least he has removed the'charge of being a reactionary by giving the Commonwealth Shipping Line a chance to make good. he will incorporate in the Bill a provision for appointing a representative of the employees upon the Board of management, he will associate his name with the greatest and most progressive action which has ever been taken in Australia. Not only that, but he will have a justifiable pride in seeing his name associated with a national act which recognises in a national way the claims of the workmen in an industry-claim s which have been too long denied, and should be accepted and recognised by the people of this country.  - I am in full sympathy with anything which will promote a better understanding between those employed on the Commonwealth ships and the management of the Line, but I do not think that the appointment of a representative of the in dustrial unions as a fourth member of the Board of management will bring about such a result. If any one, in addition to those who directly manage the Line, has a right to representation on the Board, it is the man who pays the freights - I mean the primary producer. primary producers do not, however, regard it as reasonable that they should have such representation on the manage^ ment, although they expect to pay most of the freights earned by the Line. have heard, in this debate, muGh of the phrase "" stone cold."" If the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce) had received the suggestion put Forward by members of the Opposition with "" stone cold,""- conservative disdain, I would not - have been satisfied, but I was satisfied with his alternative proposal, which would meet the case. He suggested the appointment of representatives of the seamen to meet the directors from time to time to deal with the in dustrial aspect of the business. This would prevent trouble, and nip it in the bud as effectively as if the men had The a direct representative on the Board of management.",34
68,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter ) [5.25] I had not the privilege of hearing the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) reply to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), but I have learned that he is not prepared to accept it . I am profoundly sorry that he has taken that attitude. I disagree entirely with If the remarks of the honourable member for  ment upon the Board of a representative of the maritime workers would make for the smooth management, of the Line. It is essential in these days that the employees should have representation on the Board. The honourable member for Gippsland will see that there is a great difference between the position of primary producers and that of the men who work the ships. While I would go a long way with him in asking for representation for the primary producers, I still hold that the primary producer does not stand in the same relative position as the employees. Although the primary producer is concerned in getting his produce sent abroad at reasonable rates of freight, the importer has a similar interest. He has to pay freights, and wants his imports brought to Australia at as low a rate as possible. The people of Australia are the shareholders of this Line, and it is essential that industrial peace should be secured. The Disputes Committee suggested by the Prime Minister will not meet the position. We have had Disputes Committees in connection The with various industries for a considerable time past, but there have been stoppages of work nevertheless. A dispute must first occur before a Disputes Committee can act. That was the position in the We coal-mining industry, and, as a result, Australia today is suffering from a shortage of coal. The tribunal in the coal mining industry is powerless and inactive. I say nothing against Disputes Committees as such, but it is better to remove the cause of a dispute than to deal with it after it have a voice. has occurred. What injury could it do to any one to appoint a representative of the unions to act on the Board? I ask honourable members to cast aside prejudices, and to deal with the matter from a common-sense point of view. The proposed appointment can result in nothing but good. The Board, in the absence of representation of the employees, might do something which it thought was in the best interests of the Line, but which would come into conflict with the views of the men employed on the ships. This would not occur if a representative of the men sat on the Board. When work ceases because of the absence of a representative of the unions from the Board' the ships may be held up for two, three, or four days. The holding up of one of these large steamers means a loss of a very large sum of money to the people; therefore, we should endeavour to' remove as far as possible the causes which bring about stoppages. The only effective way to deal with the matter is to give the men a representative on the Board. If you do that you at once create a spirit of co-operation in the running of the Line. If anything comes along - that the seamen do not understand, they will say, ""Well, we have a representative on the Board. Ho will know why this has happened. We will hear him,"" and they will not cause a cessation of work. Their representative will be able to put the case to them, and if there are merits in' the innovation the men will accept it. The trouble in the past has been that there has been no link between the management and the workers. This has been the weak spot. Surely we have had experience now which will induce us to alter the position.",36
69,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Do you propose that the men engaged in the work shall be represented?,37
70,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I think the men who are engaged in the industry should be represented.,37
71,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"You do not mean all the seamen, but only those engaged on the Commonwealth Line?",37
72,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I think the ameHdment is clear. Of course, others than seamen are interested. There are the men at Cockatoo Dock. They should . Mr WATSON - The - men directly interested should have representation, but not everybody in the shipping industry! Mr Charlton:- I do not think there is much difference between us. The honourable member wants to limit the selection of * the representative to the men who are actually concerned.",37
73,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I think it would be wise.,37
74,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The amendment is that of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), but personally I have no objection to what the honourable member is suggesting. I mentioned it in my second-reading speech. I urge that if we wish to make a success of this business we will do well to give the workers a voice in the management. My experience, and I am sure the experience of other honourable members, is that if men have some say in the control of the concern that employs them, it makes for smooth working. Most of our troubles will disappear if there is a sympathetic link of the kind proposed. The difficulties of the past have been caused because the persons employed have not known exactly what was in the mind of the employers. If the workers have a representative on the Board in this shipping business they will certainly feel that they are not justified in holding up the ships until they have heard their representative. The representative will generally be able to explain their difficulty, and the work will go ahead. The same principle applies to coal-mining. I had the opportunity of speaking on one occasion to a man holding a high position in the Howard Smith Company. He asked me what I thought of a certain man. I said, "" If you employ that man you will have a good man, and it will save you thousands of pounds a year."" He asked me how, and I replied, "" Wh^n other mines are having trouble yours will be working, because this man will work in with the employees."" I also told him that because of this understanding his mine would be working while others were idle. That is what actually happened. The same thing will occur in connection with ithe shipping business. It has been discovered, in consequence of inquiry made in different countries, and in Great B r it a in particularly, that the appointment of a representative of the workers on boards of management has 'been a good thing, and in order to safeguard industries it is regarded as desirable to give the working men a voice their general management. Yet here we, as the representatives of the people whose Line this is, are considering whether or not we shall do what is being very largely done in other parts of the world. workers themselves are shareholders in this Line. It is in their interests that the business should succeed, and I am certain that it will make for success if the Committee will agree to the amendment. If you were to ask the manager of the Line for an estimate of the losses in curred in consequence of little disputes, I think the figures would 'astound you. While I do not argue that you will stop all interruptions by carrying this amendment, I am sure youwill minimize them very considerably. If half the troubles were stopped, it would be a big thing. I am sorry the Prime. Minister has taken the stand he has. This is not a party question, and I ask the Committee to exercise their own common sense on it . If the amendment will be advantageous to the Line, why not accept it ? It will not interfere with the Government if - the Committee accept the amendment, but it will be an expression of opinion by the House. Nothing but good can come from a decision in favour of the amendment. It will 'assist the future running of the Line, and therefore, in my opinion, it is our bounden duty to adopt it . The House should realise that the Prime M i nister has told us that if the Line is not successful under the new conditions it will go out of existence. Surely Parliament will not strike a blow at it just now. There should be no prejudice in our minds in a matter of this kind. We have lived long enough to see the justice of giving workers a measure of control in the management of industry, and we have got past the stage when we think the employers only can manage industries. This is not a case of asking for a majorit y on the Board. only one representative, and there will be three others representing different interests. It means everything, to the primary producers of this country for the Line to be successful, and I hope the members on this side as well as those on the other side who are representing country districts will consider this matter as vital to the welfare of their constituents. It is essential that we should be able to carry our produce and also our manufactured in articles to wherever the markets are. We can do that only with the thorough cooperation of the Shipping Line. A great deal depends on this amendment, and I ask members to support it . Our sole The object in bringing it forward is to benefit the Line.",37

My experience is that the honourable member generally gives good reasons for any attitude he adopts. ' I would support the amendment without the slightest hesitation if I thought it would attain the objects which the mover has in view, namely, insure the smoother and more successful working of the Line. I understand that the honourable member claims that the representation for which he asks would obviate friction between employer and employee, and that an employee appointed to the Board would be a sort of personal nexus between the employer and the employees. The whole trend of modern industrial legislation has been to destroy the personal nexus between employer and employee, and to substitute the cold nexus of the law. The relations between the two parties are determined by legal enactment; the old personal relation between the good employer and the good employee has been abolished. I do not see how the appointment to the Board of a representative of the industrial unions interested in the running of the Line would lead to a decrease in friction between employer and' employee, for the simple reason that no matter what the business policy of the Board may be, its relations with the employee have been already determined by law.",38

96,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Ballarat) [ 6 . 3 ] - I do not desire to labour this question; but I feel it necessary to say a few words in reply to the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell). I know he is opI f the posed' to nationalization in any shape or form. He owes his presence in this House to his denunciation of that political doctrine, and he has been quite consistent in his attitude towards this Bill . But he has stated that, although he is opposed to the principle of Government-owned ships, if we are to continue the Line, he is anxious that it should be a success. As one who believes in nationalization, I realise that if we are ever to reach our objective, we shall have to prove that a venture like this can be made a success. That is one reason why I am supporting the amendment. I direct the attention of the honourable member to the fact that this principle was adopted in Great Britain during the war. There came a time when the workmen on the Clyde were very dissatisfied with their working conditions. They were then engaged in building submarines and battleships, and. so grave was the outlook, that unless indusu i a l peace had been restored there would liave been a chance of Great B r it a in losing the war. It was realized then that the men's point had to be taken into account. Eventually they were admitted into some form of partnership. Men designated as - shop stewards were appointed, and were consulted by employers upon all questions affecting working conditions As a result industrial peace was restored in all the shipbuilding yards, and unity among British workmen was made possible."" - Mr MAXWELL - Unde r that arrangepresence, ment is it not a fact that the shop stewards and the management merely conappointments ferred in regard to industrial matters?",40

103,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"If the honourable I apmember for Parkes (Mr Marr) knows anything about Mr Walsh, he can give a reference as to character himself. Personally, I would rather have Mr Walsh on the Board than General Anderson. The producers of the Commonwealth ought to have representation on the Board. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) declared, in the second-reading debate, that recently the producers could not obtain wheat charters from the Commonwealth Line. If they had a representative on the Board it is very probable that, as a result of cooperation, they would be able to secure the services of the Commonwealth ships. A ll representatives of the producing interests ought to vote for the amendment, Otherwise they will acquiesce in a course of action that will "" kill "" the Line and play right into the hands of the private shipping companies. I have not spent much, time at sea, my only experience of seafaring being gained during the voyage to Great Britain and back and over to France, but I made up my mind then that I would never accept any position associated with the sea, from that of captain downwards. It is impossible for those unacquainted with the seafaring life to realise the conditions under which the seamen have to labour. It is no wonder that, after six or eight weeks upon the water, seamen occasionally get quarrelsome when ashore. They are entitled to every consideration. The 'amendment affords a good opportunity of making the Line a sucoess. We want to"" be able to demonstrate that Commonwealth steam-ships, owned by the people, can, in open competition with privately owned steam-ships, give as good a service and show a profit. We want to get the men personally interested in the concern. The personal nexus to which the honourable member for Fawkner referred would be'secured by the adoption of the amendment.",41
104,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,But the honourable member for Fawkner will not vote for it.,42
105,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I still hope, judging by his concluding remarks, that, if we can prove that we are only submitting the amendment from a business point of view, and with the idea of making the Line a success., the honourable .' member for Fawkner may vote for it. I am sure I speak for those connected with unions, both outside and inside this Chamber, when I express the wish that the Commonwealth Line may be a financial success. We realise that, even if only a small profit be made, the Line will be a success if it has theeffect of preventing private ship-owners charging exorbitant freights and fares. The association of the men wbo work the ships with those Who are responsible for their management, will prevent such disputes as have occurred during the last few years in the case of privately-owned shipping. . 'The Govern-, ment Whip (Mr Marr)., who was in Great Britain during the war, will remember how the British workmen threatened to drop tools if they were to be sweated while other people made great fortunes out of the war, and how'it was only by the adoption of a proposal similar to that now before - the Committee that unity was ' secured. The Government has seen many troubles amongst the seamen, and has made no proposal to obviate them; but now the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) offers a practical and feasible solution, which is well worth a trial. If the Government fears the influence of the men's representative over the other members of the Board, it has the remedy in its own hands, inasmuch as that represen1 tative may be appointed for a term of five cr ten years, and thus be made absolutely independent of union influence. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [6.17] - I rise .to support the amendment of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin). We are all anxious to see the Commonwealth Shipping Line established on firm foundations and made a success. If we are able to secure harmony between management and workers by the appointment of a representative of the latter to the Board, a great deal will have been done towards securing the smooth working of the Line, for we may then rely on the co-operation of those employed not only on the shipping, but in the shipbuilding industry. Surely it is worthwhile, with such results in view, to give the working interests some representation. Certainly the honourable member for Yarra does not ask too much by his amendment. I do not speak of a representative of the sea-faring men only, but a representative of the whole of the employees con-.' nected with shipping, in the dockyards, and elsewhere. During the war between 3,000 and 4,000 men were employed at Cockatoo Island, and if the shipbuilding is placed on a proper footing it is quite likely that in a year or so we shall see that yard giving employment to a similar number, thus using - its valuable, plant to its fullest capacity. It is for this reason that I urge the creation of a desirable and necessary link by the appointment of a member of the Board to represent all who earn their living in the shipping in dustry. In the past most of the industrial troubles connected with Common' wealth undertakings have been due to lack of sympathy between the men and those responsible for the management. If it is necessary to have the whole-hearted support and co-operation of the employees, ib is worthwhile giving, the men a representative, not only to sympathetically present their views, but also to accept a share of the responsibilities of ""manage-. - ment. A few years ago the Government appointed a representative of returned sailors and soldiers to the Repatriation Commission, realizing thab repatriation would prove a huge work. It was felt that the desires and intentions of the framers of the law would be best carried out, by having on the Commission some one to specially represent the returned men; and as a resvilb of the appointment the working of the Repatriation Commission has been much more satisfactory and sympathetic than it otherwise would have been. We have not only that example, but also the example of several largo firms throughout the Commonwealth, which have established welfare and advisory committees, consisting of representatives from every department of their establishments. Those committees meet the departmental heads, or representatives of the management, ancl the result is a thorough understanding amongst all concerned. If the employeesi n the shipping industry are given a representative on the Board, the plan will prove much more satisfactory than that of selecting men from amongst the workers to present grievances and anomalies as they arise, for then there is always a danger of victimization. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Mackay) seemed inclined to support the amendment, but apparently quite sure whether the appointment an employees' representative would present industrial disputes. Surely it is much better to confer before arises than afterwards. An representative would be able to present Mr O. JtUey. the views of the men, and possibly secure a sympathetic decision. The honourable, member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) is unable to .see the necessity for an employees' representative with the object of settling industrial disputes, (because he says the conditions of la'bour are laid down by the. Arbitration Court. But, - while most callings are governed by awards, there are a number which are not. In 1913, I happened to be the representative of the clerks employed at Cockatoo Island during a dispute which they had with the management. Those clerks were not governed by any arbitration award, and for eighteen months they had been endeavouring without success to secure from the Naval Board a remedy for their grievances. At last they were forced to cause a stoppage of work at the dockyard. H a d there been a representative of those men to lay their case before the Naval Board, that trouble might have been averted. I hope that the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) will seriouslyconsider the representations that have been made this afternoon by honourable members on this sjLdc. If we .can bring about industrial harmony by the step now proposed, it will be a great step towards the successful working . of the Commonwealth Line and of our dockyards. I hope the amendment will be accepted, because I am sure it must, if ""carried, result in sane and reasonable management.",42

107,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Capricornia) [8.Q] - I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment to provide that the men engaged in the industry shall have representation on the Board controlling the Commonwealth Shipping L in e . . Although the proposal may be new to Australia, it is not new in other parts of the world. It has been tried in America, Canada, .England, France and Germany, and has proved a great success. It stands to . reason that it should be a success, because if you place responsibility upon those working in an industry, and show was .not that you have confidence in them, of they will reciprocate your confidence. The' degree of loyalty and satisfactory work which men will give in an industry trouble depends largely upon the way in which employees' they are treated by their employers. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) may rest assured that when honourable members on this side make suggestions as to how the Commonwealth Shipping Line should be run, they are keenly anxious that the Line should be successful. The Labour party stands for the nationalization of such services as the Commonwealth Shipping Line . It was instituted by a Labour Government, and it has been proved that it can be run satisfactorily by the Commonwealth Government. The amendment is submitted in the beat interests of the Line, which, in the words' of the Prime Minister himself, proved to be a great' boon to Australia during the last six or seven years. It is necessary for the success of the Line that we should have, first, efficiency ; secondly, continuity of service; and thirdly, minimum freight charges, affording a sufficient return to pay interest, redemption, depreciation and other charges, with a small profit.. The Line should not be run for the purpose of making great profits, but should serve a lar purpose to that which our railway / systems serve throughout Australia. It was established primaril y in_the interests of the producers of Australia, who have goods to ship to the other side of the world. It should guarantee the carriage of those goods at reasonable freights. It is essential that there should be continuity of service, and that can be secured only by harmonious relations between the employees and their employer, the Board. How are we to secure these harmonious relations ? Is it by mistrusting and refusing to recognise the men, or by admitting that they are deeply, interested in the efficient working of the Line and treating them as men ? Decidedly not the former. If we are to get the best out of the men and secure continuity of service for the Line, we must trust those employed by the Board. The Chairman of Committees (Mr Bamford), who represents a northern constituency of Queensland, knows well what continuity of a shipping service means to the people - in that part of the Commonwealth. He is aware that, because of the disputes in the. shipping iudustry, the people of the north of Queensland bave been cut off for weeks and months from southern portions of the Commonwealth, and have sometimes been on the verge of starvation. These disputes in the shipping industry might have been prevented if the consideration which so large a body of workmen deserves had been .shown to it . These men rightly deserve such consideration, because they spend the great part of their lives on board ship. The life of a seaman is not one to be envied. Seamen risk all kinds of dangers, and frequently lose their lives at sea. Those who "" go down to the Sea in ships,"" as our Australian seamen do, deserve great consideration from the Government. The request that they should be represented on the Board of the Commonwealth Shipping Line is a reasonable one. If there are frequent stoppages of the Line, due to industrial disputes, the Line cannot render efficient service, and cannot give that assistance to the producers of Australia, that it should give. I ask honourable members opposite to put themselves in the position of the men who are engaged on these boats. What would be their feeling if they were in the position of seamen working in a nationalized in simi- dustry? Would they not be keenly desirous of making that industry a greatsuccess? We know that they would, and if in such circumstances they would look for representation on the Board, they should the prepared to concede it to the men employed in - connection with the operations of the Commonwealth Shipping Line today. If the seamen were represented on the Board, they would know that when they had a grievance they' could put their case before their representative, ancl thus the possibility of strikes would be greatly minimized. It is frequently found that those who control nationalized industries are out of sympathy with those who are employed in them. Their lot often has been cast in luxurious surroundings, and they know nothing of the conditions of the men working in the industry. Consequently there is not that harmonious relationship between them and the workers that' should exist if the industry is to be successful. In nearly every case in which a nationalized industry has been a failure that has happened because harmonious relations have not existed between the men and the management of the industry. If our seamen who believe in a national shipping line are given representation on the Board of Management, they will endeavour to make the Line a success. If things are not going right according to their view, 952: Commonwealth instead of creating an industrial ance by striking, they will appeal to their representative to use his influence his fellow members of the Board. honourable members have said that the workers' representative on the could not be trusted to use his own judgment. That objection to the is not supported by my experience of men who have represented unions. In Queens. land industrial disputes have been prevented by representatives of the Labour party who, before entering were engaged in the industries which trouble has arisen. workers have had no representation the management of an industry, a parliamentary representative of Labour' has negotiated with the employers for them. * He has known them, lived amongst them, and understood them. They have had confidence in him, and have been prepared to accept his advice. cases, if he thought their demands not justified, he has told them so, and they have been prepared to give way. If he thought their demands were justified, hefought for their rights, and 'eventually they invariably got them. If there were a representative of the men on the Board of the Commonwealth Shipping Line he would understand them, and they would trust him and would believe that he would see that they received a fair deal. If their grievance were not justified, he could put the case of the Board before them, and thus exercise an upon them that no member Board,, constituted as the propose, could have. Therefore, in the best interests of the Commonwealth ping Line, we urge honourable opposite to give the seamen a representative on the Board, who can act as an intermediary to see that they get fair play, and so that they may take an interest in the industry and strive to make it a success. We know that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) is strongly opposed to the nationalization of industries. He is strongly opposed to the retention of this shipping Line by the Commonwealth vernment. He believes that enterprise should control all these concerns. His opinion on this matter cannot be accepted as that of one who is desirous of making the Line a greatsuccess. Men who stand for the abolition Mr Vorde.

Some We, on the other hand, believe that such industries as the Commonwealth Shipping Board Line can be run better in the interests of the people by the Commonwealth Goamendment vernment than by a private firm, - whose only object would be to earn the greatest possible profit. This was proved by the conduct of private shipping line^ during the war, when the producers of AusParliament, tralia were mulct in millions of pounds in sterling by the imposition of excessive ""Where the freights., The honourable member for in Fawkner is absolutely wrong in his contention that it would not be wise to give those employed by the Commonwealth Shipping Line a representative on the Board, on the ground that such a representative would not be free to express In some his own opinions-. Experience has proved that men in such positions can be trusted. The. representative proposed would be elected by all the men engaged in the industry and would possess their confidence. The great majority of these men are keenly desirous of doing the right thing by the Line, and the Government may rest assured that their selection of a representative would be a good one. They would be concerned in proving that this experiment was justified. Certain honourable members supporting the Government have said that they are influence inclined, to give the suggestion a' trial. of the I plead with them to cast their votes for Government- the amendment. Anything which is done for the first, time is. an experiment. If Ship- Australia had stood still because other members countries had not established such institutions as the Commonwealth Bank and a State insurance department, it would never have progressed. The adoption of the amendment would be a very big experiment in Australia, but in other countries it has been proved' that, to get efliciency, mutual confidence between employers and employees must be promoted. The statement of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr MaxGo- well), that the. representative of the private workers could not be relied upon to use his own judgment, is not true. The workers' representative would be elected for not less than three, and not more than five, years, and I believe that any stand he took would be endorsed by the great majority of the men engaged in the industry, provided he was honest and sincere, and had due regard to the interests of the men and the Line. T appeal to the Prime Minister, even at this late hour, to show that he is not callous to the interests of the thousands of men engaged in the industry. I appeal to him to take them into his confidence, and to trust them hy giving them representation qn the Board. They will then have the responsibility placed upon their shoulders of insuring continuity of service, and proviug that the nationalization of shipping is an improvement upon private ownership. They will realise that they can redress their grievances by other means . than long strikes, which no workers welcome, with the consequent holding up of shipping and destruction of roduce. Seamen and others employed y the Commonwealth Line desire continuity of employment. Let the Commonwealth Government prove that it is a model employer, and if it does so the men will respond. Those honourable members who are employers know that if they give their employees a fair deal, instead of treating them as slaves, 98 per cent, of them will respond by rendering the very best service they can. A new system of management is necessary to get rid of the industrial chaos that has afflicted the world hitherto. Many industrial disputes have arisen because the harmonious relationship that should exist between the workers and their employers has been absent. The Government have an opportunity to try something which has not previously been tested in Australia. If they would take the initiative, their example would be followed by many private employers.",43

I entirely agree with him, but, unfortunately, the great bulk of the workers, who won a fine reputation for the Labour party of Australia, have retired in disgust and have left the field of union management to the dangerous revolutionists who are now running the Labour party of this country. If the statements made by members of the Opposition represented the opinions of most of the workers of Australia, there would not be much difference of opinion in this Committee regarding the matter under consideration.",46
109,Mr FORDE,Unknown,Why keep repeating those statements?,46
110,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I never miss an opportunity of repeating them, and I never shall. I shall repeat them to the dismay of my young friend, who talks, almost without end, in a way which does not represent the true position. We have to take present-day conditions and dangers into consideration, and if Parliament does its duty it must adopt safeguards against the destructive influences of the leaders of the Labour movement. Because of that, I am "" red-hot"" against this amendment. It is just as well to get hot sometimes, but I assure my honourable friends that I am in the best of humour,- and that I have the greatest pity in the world for those who cannot represent things as they are. The honourable member for Capricornia referred to the policy of his party ixs a policy of nationalization. It is a policy, not of nationalization, but of socialization. Misleading statements of that character will not deceive the people of Australia, because they know too much about the situation. Members of the Opposition would have served their own interests better than they have done if they had accepted the Bill as presented by the Government. I am not an enthusiastic supporter of the Bill, and I have never been a whole-hearted supporter ef the principle contained in it .",46

When this subject was before the House about two> years ago, I said that I had' no sympathy with the continuation of any part of the Commonwealth Fleet except the "" Bay "" liners. I said that every part of the world was feverishly building cargo tonnage, but insulated tonnage was limited. I thought we would be justified, for the protection of our perishable products, in continuing the "" Bay "" liners and increasing their number as occasion demanded.",46

115,Mr GABB,Unknown,He does.,47
116,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"He twists on those occasions, and makes his views appear quite different from what they are. 1 Members of the Opposition ought to be thoroughly satisfied. They have spoken of the hardships and troubles of the in dustrialists who work for the Line, but there is not a shipping line on earth in which the workers enjoy the same conditions and receive the same pay as the men on the Commonwealth Line.

118,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,Does the member say they are loafers?,47
119,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I do not. My objection is to the men who are tricky, like the honourable member for Denison (Mr . O'Keefe), in their presentation of this question to the people. That kin d of thing is regarded with suspicion by audiences in every part of Australia. In spite of the excellent conditions under which the employees of the Line work, what has been the attitude, not of the great body of workers on the ships, but of men like Mr Walsh and those under his immediate influence? They have caused the ships to be tied up on the slightest pretext. I say to the Prime Minister, we are sacrificing the interests of the producers of this country by this want of discipline. I am certain there is no chance of the Line being continued if the past is to be repeated. I should have thought honourable members on the other side would be delighted at the chance to continue the Line, and that the seamen of Australia will still - have the possibility of AustraEan wages and. conditions when travelling 'in other parts of the world. I will give another reason why there will be great danger if this amendment is in serted. Honourable members talk about nationalization. Why do they not talk about socialization?

131,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Will the honourable member deal with the amendment ?,48
132,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I know it is very painf u l for the honourable member, for once he was nearly a communist himself. I sympathize deeply with him, but I must leply to the matter so thab we may consider the amendment in its true perspective. I desire the amendment to be seen clearly and in proper balance, so that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell) may have his solar plexus at the right angle. In the artillery during the war we used to call that "" levelling your bubble."" Mr Maxwell will find his bubble levelled before we have done with him. I do not wish to go into the arguments that have been used in favour of this amendment because, to my mind, they are irrefutable, but I do not want the decision prejudiced by this communist talk by members 'who have very littl e care for those with whom they are out of touch. I have no fear that communism will interfere with Bill. From its earliest days the Labour party have served the people of this country well, and its most protective legislation has come from them. I can recall the day when I was quite ayoung fellow, and I saw Gregor MCGregor go out in his bowyangs from St. K i l d a to stand on a trolly on Montefiore Hill and preach the Same, ideals that we are preaching today. Later he and "" Bob "" Guthrie, who was a sailor, and helped to ru n the great maritime strike of 1892 * which resulted in - I the birth of the Labour party,' were maligned by the honourable member for 'Wakefield (Mr Foster), who was then a member of the South Australian Parliament, just as he would malign us.",48
133,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Does the honourable member' intend to connect this with the amendment?,48
134,Mr YATES,Unknown,"The object of the amendment is to appoint an industrial representative on the Shipping Board. The argument used by the honourable member for Wakefield was to show that that would not have the effect suggested by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin). I am endeavoiiring to prove that it will , and I mention MCGregor and Guthrie to show how representatives of the workers more than make good. Guthrie was a seaman, and from the day he entered this Parliament u n t i l he fell away from the ideals which he helped to create, he made good. I said in my second-reading speech that he was honoured in his demise for the work that he did for the seafaring community of this land. Mr O ' KEEFE - He was the general of navigation.",48
135,Mr YATES,Unknown,"He was, and he was a sailor.' I do not propose to deal further with the communist aspect of this debate,. except to say that in the thirty, years in which the Labour party have been in public life in Australia they have accomplished a great deal. They have been responsible for passing our best legislation, and I challenge any man in the House to say that the Labour party ever did anything inimical to the best interests of the community. I do not say they haye made no mistakes, but they have accomplished more for the people of Australia than any party before o r . since. Will it be suggested that, if the amendment of the honourable member for Yarra is accepted, there is no seaman the or no member of the working class in Australia today who can efficiently fill the position of representative on the Shipping Board? Who will say that there is not another "" B o b "" Guthrie? To say such a thing would be most insulting to a large section of the community upon whom this country depends for its development. If it were not for the in herent Conservatism of members on the other side this suggestion would be accepted in the interests of the and it would go a great way towards proper and efficient running of the I expect' the representatives of the rural producers to vote for the and to subsequently move that the Board shall include a representative primary producers. If honourable bers in the corner are as alive to the terests of those whom they represent are to those' of our constituents, they not allow this Bill to pass without ing for representation of the primary ducers on the Board, so that they may not be bled in respect of freights on their produce. They will not say that there is sponsibility of management. no man in their ranks qualified to take seat on the Board. The honourable ber for Echuca (Mr Hill) last night showed his acquaintance with the problem of freights on produce, and his general fitness to represent the producers in administration of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. And he is not the member of the Country party who is qualified for that work. Therefore hope that members of that party will see that the third member of the Board is a representative of the primary ducers. We require at the head of the hampered. enterprise a man with a shrewd business head. His two colleagues should be tion representatives of the principal concerned. The primary producers provide more freights for the Line than will any other section of the comtween munity, although in respect coming cargo the general will pay indirectly a big amount freights. I take it, however, that the representative of the primary while protecting the interest of his constituents, would also insure that general community was not fleeced. So, too, would the representative ' of the amendment. workers. The representation of different interests in the control of industry not an innovation.

Members on both sides of the House have deof the clared their desire that the Commonmemwealth Shipping Line shall operate sucincessfully, and if they are sincere in that as we profession they must be prepared to will adopt means by which their wishes can providbe realized. It is essential to the success proof any industry that the employees in it should enjoy good conditions, and be entrusted with a certain amount of the reAs one a honourable member has already pointed memout, the evolution of industry is in the direction of giving to employees a share in the management, and wherever that policy has been put into operation it has the proved successful beyond any question.

If the Board in will cluded a representative of the employees, more cordial relations would exist be the workers in 'the industry and of in the management, and that good feeling community would be an important contribution toin wards the success of the venture. The Prime Minister stated that he believed in producers, the principle of giving to those engaged own in an industry a share in the responthe sibility of management, but I am surprised that he. is not prepared 'to put his . belief into practice by accepting the The Commonwealth Shipp in g Line is on a par with any other in is dustry in the community, and those honourable members who profess to realise the importance of harmonious relations beThat tween employer and employee, and who say that they believe in giving workers a in the control of industry, could have no better opportunity of putting professions into practice than by and the granting representation on the Board to will the employees of the Commonwealth to Shipping Line. The honourable member The for Fremantle (Mr Watson) is not far from conversion to this principle, and It Shipping am hopeful that he - will support the amendment. "" While the lamp holds out to burn, the vilest, sinner may return.""",49
137,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member is wasting his breath. I believe in this proposal.,50
138,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"I am glad to reeeive that assurance, and I hope the honourable member will use his influence with the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell), who said he was almost persuaded i o support the amendment. ask the honourable member for Fawkner to realise that the amendment is moved with a sincere desire to obviate many of the industrial difficulties that have beset the Commonwealth Shipping Line in the past.",50
139,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,I believe that is the intention.,50
140,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"And the amendment provides - that the representative to be appointed shall be an employee of the Board'. This surely should remove any fear entertained by certain. honourable members supporting the Government that the policy may be fraught with danger. The honourable member for Wakefield is hopeless, but I think the honourable member for Fawkner may be induced to accept the amendment which will result in continuity of operations and give a greater sense of contentment to the employees of the Line. No other member of the Board is likely to have a more intimate knowledge of the actual difficulties of those directly engaged in it . . The honourable member for Eichmond told us that he could see no redeeming feature in the proposal, and that all the arguments in its favour left him "" stone cold."" From an industrial stand-point, the honourable member comes from the stone age, and therefore we need not be surprised at his attitude. I amsorry, because he should view this problem from the Australian stand-point. The adoption of the amendment will do much to remove any causes of industrial unrest among the employees of the Line. I hope that even at this late hour the Prime Minister will accept the. principle that a representative of Labour should be appointed to the * Board and so overcome many of those difficulties that have confronted the management hitherto.",50
141,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Angas) [ 9 . 5 ] - I hope that the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) will accept the amendment. It cannot be urged as an objection that it is an attempt to obtain job control, though I have been expecting to hear this advanced as a reason why the amendment should be rejected. Job control will not be possible by the appointment of one representative of the men to a Board of four. I believe, however, that representation of the industrial unions on the Board will appeal to the best in our workmen,, and thus do much to insure the success of the I Line. The workers' representative would be able to place before the other directors the views of the men, and, in turn , would be in a position to explain the business view-point of the Board to the industrial unions. The honourable member for Fawkner suggested that the in dustrial representative, whoever he might be, would not have the courage tostand up before fellow-unionists and explain the business side of a request that might be objected to by the management. I have had some experience with the Waterside Workers Union, and I know that, although they are a rough and i eady body of men, they are, like the average unionist, reasonable and quite ready to hear the other side of a case stated. There are, of course, a number of single young men who, on occasion, will tell others to go to an unhealthy climate, but they are in a minority. Only good can result from the adoption of the amendment. The honourable member' for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) made much of the fact that very often Labour representatives spoke against "" big business."" Surely he differentiates between Government "" big business,"" as repre- Q sented in this shipping enterprise, and ""big business"" of private concerns! We do. It is the duty of Labour members to urge men employed by "" big business"" - to give a fair return for wages received, and it is our duty likewise to urge men engaged in Government "" big business,"" from the highest to the lowest, to do their very best to insure its success because it is a national concern, and it is along these lines that we expect ultimately to work out the social salvation of the people. On more than one occasion I have done this, and I am prepared to do so again. Labour members have the courage of their convictions. It is their duty to lead the working classes. They should be strong enough to go to the unions, and, if necessary, tell the men that a course of action which, perhaps, they favour is not in the best interests of the working classes. Unless a Labour man is strong enough to do this he is unfit for leadership. The honourable member for Wakefield has been taunting us continually about socialization. He said that I would not be prepared to go into my own electorate and advocate socialization of industries. I can assure him that I did so on nearly every occasion during the last campaign, though I did not state the case as it has been explained today; for the simple reason, as the honourable member himself very well knows, that an objective is not' something which can be attained today or tomorrow. It is the ideal for which we are aiming. We hope to achieve our objective, namely, the socialization of industries, along the line of nation ali zation, by proving the efficiency of such an undertaking as the Commonwealth Shipping Line, and gradually working on and upwards to our high and lofty ideal. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) also said that the workiug people were not behind the Labour party. In reply, I'should like him to explain how it was that, at the last Federal elections in South Australia, we . contested each of the ten seats, and secured the return of seven Labour members. If the working people did not vote for our candidates, who did ?",50
142,Mr SCTJLLIN,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [9.11] - When I submitted my amendment today I refrained from making anything in the nature of a speech, contenting myself with remarks which I ' had made on the o second reading last night. I felt, however, during the course of the debate, that it would be necessary for me to give my reasons, and perhaps some of the considerations that lie behind the amendment. I hope honourable members will not accuse me of indulging in anything like an academic lecture if I place one or two of the aspects of the position before them. I trust I shall be pardoned if I say that those who are opposed to the amendment appear to have missed our. intention. They seem to regard my,proposal as one simply to settle disputes. The Prime Minister himself was under . this misconception, I believe, because he offered as a substitute the appointment of a committee for the settlement of disputes. That was not the objective so much as to prevent disputes taking place. We believe there will still be ^he constituted tribunals for the settlement of disputes as to wages, labour, and working conditions. The amendment seeks to take the position a little further. I am afraid honourable members have not been studying the industrial movement in other parts of the world. I hope they have. I do not pretend to know all that is taking place, but I have given a considerable amount of study to international industrial affairs, and I have not been to a biased source for my information. I have been reading diligently, but perhaps not as full y as I might, the reports of the International Labour Office established in connection with the League of Nations. Consideration has been given by that body to industrial problems, and a number of official reports have been issued. All of these reports do not by auy means favour our side. Both viewpoints are stated, and, therefore, the conclusions arrived at are absolutely unbiased. The Prime Minister said today that he would not accept the principle of appointing a representative of the workers Vto a business Board to manage the Line. I emphasize that that is exactly the reason why we want a representative of the workers there. There is a good deal in the contention of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell). I believe that, if he can be brought to see our point of view, he will vote for the amendment. I am afraid, however, that he has not seen it yet. The honourable member said, and I heartily agree with him , that in industry and the methods of production today we have lost the personal nexus, and that there is now only the legal nexus, meaning that we have lost the personal touch between employers and employed. It is true that we have lost that touch.",51
143,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Prais e the Lord !,51
144,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I do not praise the Lord, but regret the fact. It was a more humane system when employer and employee worked side by side, but modern methods have swept that away. Most 'great businesses now are carried on by stock companies, with dividenddrawing shareholders, who know not the men and women who earn the dividends, and care nothing about their personal welfare. This' is not because the shareholders are soulless, but because our present system is soulless. Under every reconstruction scheme in every advanced country-in America, England, France, Germany, and Italy-grea t strides have been made in the last few years in the direction of giving the workers an in terest in the management of the business with which they are connected. That is being done by private employers under the system of private enterprise. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell) emphasized the fact today that Labour believes in abolishing "" big business,"" that Labour stands for socialization, which means the abolition of private enterprise. That is perfectly true, and the .honourable member in no way misrepresented us; but where the analogy is between my proposition and his argument, I fail to see. Even allowing that all he says is true, it does not mean that the workers and the Labour party are not in favour of business principles being applied to nationalized industries. How could we make nationalization a success if it were not conducted on sound business principles?",51
145,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,E x a c t l y ; it is because those principles have not been applied that so far it has not been a success.,52
146,Mr SCTJLLIN,Unknown,"It has succeeded in many more cases than it has failed, as all the history of the movement proves. Even in the case of the Commonwealth Shipping Line, which is said to have lost over £2,000,000 , one illustration wil l show how enormously the enterprise has succeeded. .During last year freights were reduced by the Commonwealth Line by 10 per cent., and as a result the freights charged by other lines of shipping were forced down to the same extent. Taking the shipping masters' estimate of tonnage, affected, the Line has saved this country £5,000,000 this year. Where nationalization has failed to bring the workers into a proper appreciation of their responsibility in the work they are doing, is where there has been a failure to give them a personal Nationalization has failed where it has failed to take the workers into the confidence of the management by adopting the course which my amendment proposes in the case of the Shipping Line. As a matter of fact, we are behind the times in Austraha if we are not prepared to adopt that course. The honourable member for Fawkner and other honourable members opposite, including, I think, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr . Latham), have spoken at outside gatherings in favour of the system of co-partnership. Those honourable members have f a it h in private enterprise, and believe that the capitalistic system' can be made humane. Many of them realise that the system is not humane today, but, on the contrary, is most cruel, and they are sincerely desirous of making it humane feeling, that if that is not done the system will come to an end-that it will come to chaos. The system can only be preserved, even for a time, by adopting the principles of intelligent employers all over the world, and placing the workers on boards of directors. I do not believe that the capitalistic system can be made humane; that is why I am a Socialist. Private greed and monopoly should be replaced with public con-, t r o l ; but I am prepared to support any proposal made by honourable members opposite that will ameliorate the condition of the workers, even under the capitalistic system."" In the case of the Shipping Line we have national control, and the profits are made directly and indirectly on behalf of the people of Australia. We on this side are anxious that the Line should be a success and, that being so, we are observing what intelligent employers of labour are doing to make their private business successful. Surely that is a sound course to pursue? The Shipping Line is not "" big business "" in the ordinary sense of the term, but it represents a bignational undertaking, and, therefore, if we desire success we must copy the methods adopted by the intelligent employers referred to. Let me give honourable members a few illustrations. In 1919 there was a Reconstruction Conference at Atlantic City, in the United States of America, and the representatives of the American Chamber of Commerce declared in favour of the very interest. principle that is embodied in my amendment of today. The great steel king, Charles Schwab, said that in opposing proposals for the democratization of industry, and for giving workers representation,not on committees to settle disputes, but on boards to control business, they had been committing a psychological error, or an error in principle. Then in 1918, after the revolution in Germany, when the German Government saw the necessity for reconstruction, it provided in the Constitution for the establishment of workers' councils, and giving the. workers a voice in management. There has been a similar movement in It a l y , particularly amongst the metal workers. As I said last night, there are in England today sixty industries working under workshop committees and joint councils, on which workers and employers have equal representation, and those in dustries control 3,500,000 workers. will be seen, as I said before, that we in ' Australia are behind the times.",52
147,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Labou r in England and America stands on a different footing from labour in Australia.,53
148,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"The objective of the British Labour party is identical with the objective of the Australian Labour party. In America the Federation of Labour is non-political, and, therefore, different in that respect from the Australian industrial unions, but there is extending a movement in America, with ideals identical with those of Labour all over the world.",53
149,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that in those cases cited the workers have a voice in the management?,53
150,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"In many cases, yes.",53
151,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Can the honourable member cite those cases?,53
152,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I cannot cite indivi- out dual cases, - because my authority gives only the total numbers.",53
153,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member referred to workshop committees.,53
154,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yes , and joint indust r i a l councils.",53
155,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"But the honourable member said .that the workers were represented on the directorate, and shared in the management.",53
156,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"The workers are presented on the directorates of some in dustries, and that tendency is growing. Sixteen years ago a prominent firm in Boston set out to increase their profits, and their first step was to place four employees on the directorate of eleven members, and to allow a general meeting of 'the employees to elect a committee which iitself settled all disputes that arose, fixed working hours, and so for t h . In Germany the workers' councils have a voice in the business control; and I invite honourable members to read an article which appeared within the last few months in the Industrial and Mining Standard on this subject. Germany .recognised that it had a serious task in meeting the competition of the world, and, though private employers did not like the idea, workers' councils have been accepted by them as the only efficient way in which to meet that competition.",53
157,Mr MARR,Unknown,Would the honourable member support the adoption of co-partnership? It,53
158,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"The r e is a vast difference between the acceptation of that and other methods under private enterprise, and their acceptation under national enterprise. One great objection unionists have to any scheme of copartnership and of works committees is that the sole idea of the employer who adopts them is to increase his own profits, although in many cases the system does improve the 'lot of the workers. This is the same objection that the unionists have to the piece-work system, which also has in many cases improved the condition of the workers financially. But under a competitive capitalistic system the piece-work is frequently used merely as a weapon to speed up the workers, with no idea of giving any advantage to the latter. In the case of the Shipping Line, we, on behalf of the people, are the employers, and we may take a leaf of the book of the intelligent private employer. It must be remembered that We are in Parliament as the representatives of the people, who are the owners of the Line, and we must look on it , if we wish for success, as proprietors and employers. It is from that standpoint that I have submitted this amendment. I have' not introduced it as applicable to every industry; that is for honourable members opposite to do, for it re- is they who desire success for private enterprise. The amendment is intended for a public enterprise, and those intelligent employers who have used the method in order to make great profits set a good example to us.",53
159,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Where the employer has brought his people into co-operation with himself is when the workers are free to treat with him, uninfluenced by any outside organization.",53
160,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"In reply to the honourable member, I shall read a quotation that will prove very interesting, but before doing so I desire to say that in every case where co-operation with the workers has succeeded, the employers have initiated it with a-sincere desire-to improve their lot, as well as improve the business'; - and cases in which it has failed are those where it . has been introduced by sweaters who wish to take the last ounce out of their men. I have seen examples of co-partnership in the mining industry. I worked in the industry at Ballarat myself, and under a tributing system earned 8s. a week for three months. There were 1,000 men who averaged 15s. per week for two years. In those cases where employers have been animated by a sincere desire to* improve the lot of their workers, this principle has proved a success, and I have not been able to discover a case in which the employees have failed to respond. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) asked whether it was not a fact that in these cases the workers were free from outside influences. I think the honourable member will admit that Mr Cadbury has done something more than experiment in this direction. Here is what he says: The test of any scheme is the extent to which it creates and fostersa spirit will without lessening the loyalty of the worker to his class and his organization.",53
161,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Does not Mr Cadbury in the same book draw a distinction between management and workshop committees ?,54
162,Mr SCTJLLIN,Unknown,"At any rate, the objection raised by the honourable, member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) is well answered by the quotation I have made. Mr Cadbury insists that the test of a scheme is that it should foster a spirit of goodwill withoutalienating the workers from their class or their unions.",54
163,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"I admit that; but it all depends on the object of the co-operation, and whether it includes management.",54
164,Mr SCTJLLIN,Unknown,"The honourable member said that business principles might make it necessary for the Board of Management to refuse a request of their men. He said that the representative of the men would be a partisan, and oil the Board as a special pleader for them. That I deny. I . admit that, if it were a question of an appointment to a disputes committee, the representative of the men would be a special pleader and partisan, and so would the representative of the employers. That would be their job, but in such cases they would have an independent chairman to decide between them. The amendment deals with a different principle. I ask honourable members opposite to take the men into the management of the Line. The workers will trust their representative, - and will listen to his representations where they have made certain demands. Where he has been able to show them that, to satisfy their demands would lead to the industry being closed down, the demands have been withdrawn. I can point to numerous other cases where employees - have asked for certain conditions and the employers have replied that if their demands were granted they would be forced to close down. They have proceeded with their demands, and forced them upon the employers, and the industry has ,gone along flourishingly. That has happened again and again, until the workers have regarded such statements as merely a cry of "" wolf,"" and have pressed their demands until they have been acceded to. 1 believe that, if the workers are given representation in of goodthe business management of the Line, their representative will go fearlessly to them, if he is satisfied that their demands are against the interests of the Line, and - will tell them the truth. That would be a good thing for all concerned, and would bring about harmony. If I believed that the representative of the men, knowing that, in view of the business aspect of the matter, demands they made were wrong, would not have the courage to go to the employees and tell them so, I would withdraw the amendment. Of course the success of any of these schemes must always depend, to a great extent, on the men who are to carry them out.",54
165,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"If the men's delegate went back to them and told them that, from a business point of view, their demands could not be conceded, would he not lay himself open to the charge so often made, "" Y o u have been 'got at ' by your fellow directors?""",54
166,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"My experience of workmen is that where a man has been chosen by themselves they place the greatest confidence in him. We have amongst the members of this House men who have been able to steer great bodies of men through great industrial crises. A notable example is the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), who has guided men in serious crises. I say that if the Government selected their own nominee for appointment to the Board, regardless of the opinions of the workers, they would probably say that such a man was ' ' got at "" before he was appointed, and they would have no trust in him. But if the men appoint their own representative and he tells them that the Line cannot stand their demands, I venture the opinion that his representations will have a good eifect We are dealing with this matter as employers, and we should not fear to follow the example of the"" most intelligent employers in different parts of the world today. There is a growing tendency to give workers a voice in the management of the industry in which they are engaged. We are interested in the success of the Commonwealth Shipping Line, and I urge the Government, even at this stage, to accept the amendment and give the proposal a trial. I believe it will be found to be in the best interests of the Line 'and of this country.",54
167,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [ 9 . 3 5 ] feel that the Government have been given the best advice, but that they fear their friends in dealing with the amendment. The Commonwealth shipping industry should stand alongside the Post and Telegraph Department, the Railway Department, and other Departments of public u t i l it y, and should hold a most important place in the progress of Australia. success will add materially to the wealth of the Commonwealth - Every honourable member who is not wedded to a particular company should give the Line his hearty support. I believe that the clause Tinder consideration is the most i m portant clause in the Bill . The sentative of the men appointed to the Board under the amendment-if it be carried- could do more for the progress of the Line than any other' member of the Board - Eighty per cent, of the expenditure of the Board would bo directly his concern. Are we not going to make some move to improve the conditions of the workers ? Has not every writer in the world acknowledged that the capitalistic system as carried on prior to the war must be altered ? Is there any man who can claim to have any knowledge of the world's progress who does uot admit that changes must take place? Why should not the change proposed by the amendment be made ? I realise that some honourable members are well advanced in years, and my experience has taught me that it is impossible to alter the views of such men. I therefore urge the younger members of the House on b o t h ' sides to exercise their judgment, and to remember that the past can show us nothing of which we can be proud so far as the employment of labour is concerned. It is to the f u t u r e that we must look for help in this direction. I can remember the time - when I had to stand on the platform and advocate early closing. The spirit displayed in opposition to the amendment is the same 'as that which was displayed against early closing, and against demands made for the improvement of conditions in factories and workshops. But we succeeded in having factories made sanitary and f it for human beings to work in. The amendment is intended to improve the conduct and management of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. We have been told that about sixty awards of the Court apply to employees in the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and twenty awards to - I those employed in connection - with the Commonwealth Shipping Line. Would it not be of great assistance to the management if one of the members of the Board were acquainted with these various awards, seeing that they must be observed in the operation of the Line? I am surprised that the Government have not accepted the amendment. The honIts orable member for Pawkner (Mr Maxwell) made a speech which reminded me of a speech made by an opponent of mine some years ago in Sydney. He spoke for an hour and a half, and when he had concluded his friends asked him, "" Which side are you on?"" He said, "" I made repre- a No-Yes speech."" The honourable member for Pawkner (Mr Maxwell) is in very much the same position. He has had a legal education, and I presume he went to a university. Some members of this House have had a university education and n o . knowledge, and others have knowledge but have had no"" university education. I venture to say that . honourable members who have knowledge are prepared to improve the conditions of those they represent. All the improvements that have taken place in the world have been due to men of knowledge. Members of the Opposition have broughttheir knowledge to bear on the amendment. The adoption of the amendment is necessary to make the workers contented, for without contentment there can be no progress. would satisfy the employees, and give them respect for the Board. The workers have very Jittle confidence in the directors who control most public companies, for they know that these men are o u t ' to serve their own selfish interests., A representative of the maritime unions on the Shipping Board would be anxious to serve the Government as well' as the workers. He would do his best in the position, because he would want to retain his job. The probability is that he would watch with keen interest the progress of the Line, and try to make it a success, and, like members of the Opposition, would give his soul and carcass in the service of those he represents. debate today has been a credit to members on this side. They are absorbed in their task of improving the social and moral welfare of the workers. There was no necessity for the zeal that they put into their speeches, for they could have done as honourable members on the other side did, and acted like a regiment of sealed "" oysters."" If the carrying of the amendment would have serious consequences, why do not supporters of the Government demonstrate the fact? Why do they worry about what the newspapers will say tomorrow morning ? I ask them to be men, and, like those who sit i u Opposition, tell the truth and fear no one. An y honourable member who votes against the amendment ought to have more solid grounds for doing so than have been disclosed in the.puerile speeches delivered outside this Parliament. honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Yates) asked whether the Labour party had done anything in public life that had caused fear in the minds of Nationalists. I have been associated with the Labour party in Australia since its birth , and , from that day to this its ideals have been humanitarian. The foundation of the zeal which Labour members put into their speeches is humanitarianism. Christ was the first, Socialist. I hope honourable members on the other side will try to be larger minded. We, on this side, are proud when the newspapers write something unpleasant about us, for we then know that we have achieved some good. The Conservatives of Great Britain now fear the Labour party, the rise of which has been one of the best movements that have taken place in my lifetime in the British Parliament. There is someIt activity and zeal in the British Labour party similar to that shown towardsthe amendment by members of the Opposition. We feel that we are layingthe foundation of Australia's f u t u r e greatness. The Prime Minister is in theawkward company of those who cannot see eye to eye with any progressive proposal. They fear the alteration of even, a line, syllable, or comma of the present system, especially if they think it will benefit their opponents. I believe the Prime Minister has misunderstood the position. He, of course, is the Leader of the Government. Members of the Opposition have said some unpleasant things about the ex-Prime Minister (Mr W . M . The Hughes), but I have watched the present Prime Minister, and have observed telecontrol which he has over his following. When his hand goes up they are silent. He has a fine body of men to lead, because they do nothing while he leads. I hoped that Nationalist members would' have realized the wisdom of making a change. In the past six years Australiahas lost millions of pounds because of the actions of business men who were appointed to important positions. A man who would look after the interests of Labour would be an acquisition to theBoard, and would prevent many disputes. I assume that he would be a man of clean character, in whom the workers would have confidence. I am certain that success would attend any change in this direction. Even if the amendment is not carried I hope the Government will ap-_ The point some one whose qualifications will be in keeping with what we desire. I am satisfied that the result of the vote is already well-known, and that nothing I can say or do will make any difference. At the next election, however, when the speeches delivered from this side of the. House will have been read by the intelli. gent electors of Australia, the effect will be seen.

168,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Angas) [ 1 0 . 7 ] - I m o That after the word "" members "" in line 2, - the words, "" and shall include a direct representative of the primary producers of the Commonwealth "" be inserted. I do not intend to debate the matter at great length. It has often been said of the members on this side of the House that we represent only the industrialists who live in the metropolitan areas. have always taken exception to such statements. I have listened throughout today to the debate that has just concluded, and I must admit that I have wondered why the representatives who claim to have the needs of the primary producers specially in their minds have not asked for a representative of those interests to be put on the Board. I remember that in the last Parliament the member for Frank-, lin (Mr MCWilliams), and other members in that corner, frequently criticised this ATES. Line from the point of view of the primary producers. If that is not so X ask members to deny it . There is no denial. Why has there been an alteration ? I do. not think the members of the Country party will regard me ' as - specially hostile to them. Divisions in the past have clearly shown that I am not distinctly hostile to them. I have a very friendly feeling towards them. I remind them that many of us on this side come from districts in which the population is engaged mainly in primary production. NOES. Therefore, I trust to be allowed reasonable time to put the case for the primary producers. I have no seaport in my. district, but I have many .primary producers, and it is in their interests that I speak. It may be said by some that I am trying to make political capital. If that is not said some members of the other side, will say, ''' You are only looking after the industrial section. The Labour party has no care-for the primary producers."" I do not mind which way you come at me, I intend to make my battle for the primary producing interests-. No one will deny that our primary production means a great deal to Australia. We are a priPAIRS. mary producing country. Our main exports are wool, wheat, meat, f r u it , fresh and dried, and other things which - I need not mention. A large proportion of our products must be exported to oversea markets, and we have a choice only between the Commonwealth Line and the Shipping Combine. The three members who are to be appointed on the Board in acv e - cordance with the Prime Minister's statement will give their attention to finance, repairs, and general shipping matters. If they are the only men to be appointed the primary producer will not receive the consideration that should be given to him. That Board will lay itself out to make the Line pay irrespective of everything else. A representative of the primary proI ducers would also desire to make the Line profitable, but he would look at something more than the balance-sheet. There is always a tendency with these nationalized industries to judge them by the balance-sheet only, but they should also be judged by their usefulness and the service they render to.the community. A representative of the primary producers would give more .attention to this aspect than the other members of the Board. His decisions would not be. governed only by the financial situation. I heard the member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) speak of the freight on apples, and he did not appear to regard the Line very kindly. The member for Echuca (Mr Hill) had something to say about wheat freights, and he also seemed to be dissatisfied with the Line. The ex-member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) was always attacking the Line because of the position in regard to apples.",57
169,Mr HILL,Unknown,He would have voted' it right out.,58
170,Mr GABB,Unknown,"I believe that. When the representatives in this House of the primary producing interests are kept out of touch with the inside affairs of the Commonwealth Line they do not understand the situation, and they voice their disapproval. That means that their supporters outside of the House also disapprove. I believe if a representative of the primary producers could come into close touch with the business side of the shipping line he would be a great help to the management. That will have a tendency to restore the confidence of the primary producers. There are in each of the three parties in this Chamber men who claim to represent the primary producers. They may express their opinion on this amendment, but let it not be said that there is only one party in the Chamber that attends to the interests of the primary producers. One of the evils resulting from the formation of a composite Ministry is that the members of the Country party have to sacrifice some of their principles. I make bold to say that if they had not enteredinto an arrangement with another political party to support the composite Government, I would not have had a chance of moving my amendment; it would have been moved by one of the honourable members in the corner.",58
171,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [10.17] - I am quite sure that the primary producers will realise that this Parliament has, in the honourable member for Angas, a very accommodating man indeed. I am equally sure that they will not appreciate his action in making a farce of the advocacy of their interests. If I understand the views of the producers, they will be satisfied to have, the brainiest and most experienced men appointed to the Board in order to insure by efficient manage[36] ment cheap freights, while they continue the work of growing wheat and supplying freights for the ships. That is the job they understand.",58
172,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong) [10.18] - It is impossible to remain unmoved by the fervent, sincere, and impassioned appeal made by the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) on behalf of the primary producers. I am unable to rest longer under the imputation of being an "" oyster"" which is not only "" sealed,"" but also "" small-minded."" Like the honourable member for Angas, I have no seaport in my constituency, and therefore I , like him, can, perhaps, regard myself as specially qualified to deal with the subject of the amendment. If the Prime Minister were actuated merely by political considerations he would have accepted both the last amendment and that now before the Chair,' because if the Line failed it would be so easy to say that the failure was on account of the nature of the directorate that had been foisted upon the Government by this Committee, whilst if it succeeded no apology would be required. Accordingly I suggest to the Committee that the fact that the Prime Minister has refused to accept either amendment is some proof that he is sincere in his desire to give the Line a fair run according to what he regards as proper principles. What are proper principles? We are asked .to give representation on the Board to the primary producers. Why the primary producers rather than the secondary producers? Are not we all interested in the Linel Why should not there be representation of the manufacturers whose goods will be carried by the vessels? Why should there not be representatives of the passengers and of the learned professions?",58
173,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Lawyers particulaily.,58
174,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Lawyer s and doctors, as citizens, are interested in the success of the Line equally with the primary pro^ ducers, and as they do not export any goods they will not have the occasion for making direct representations to the management as the primary producers will. It is reducing this debate to an absurdity to suggest that upon a business Board such as is proposed there should be placed representatives of special interests in the community. The Board is to be appointed for the purpose of managing a big shipping enterprise, and the important consideration is that the appointees shall possess the qualifications essential to the proper management of such an undertaking. Under the clause as drafted, the Government will have full power to appoint the persons best fitted to sit upon the Board, and for that reason I votedagainst the last amendment, and shall vote against that now before us. If there were a person possessing the qualifications referred to by various honourable members opposite when speaking on the last amendment, a person who possessed not only the confidence of the workers, but also the business ability which would enable him to make an efficient contribution towards the problems of management, I would not oppose his appointment; more than that, I would consider it to be the duty of the Government to appoint such a man to the Board under the power given by the clause as it now stands.",58
175,Mr GABM,Unknown,Docs ' the honourable member say that there are no such men ?,59
176,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"No ; but if there be such a man, it will be the duty of the Government to appoint him to the Board, and I sincerely hope it will do so. The clause provides that the Board shall con-, sist of not less than three and not more than five members, and if there be a primary producer who could defi'nitely assist the Board in ' the performance of its functions, and: a member of an industrial union who would be a useful member of the directorate in the way indicated by honourable members opposite, I hope that such persons will be appointed. The clause gives the Go- vernment authority to appoint the best man they can find for the work to becarried out, and I support it in that",59
177,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [10.20]. - The charge cannot be laid against me that there is no seaport in my electorate, for it comprises one-third of the sea coast of Australia. As a Labour man, I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment. My constituency includes two farming electorates of the State Parliament, and I would be lacking in my duty if I did not try to secure representation of the primary producers on the proposed Board. Western Australia has had remarkable experience in regard to shipping. Some years ago the small pastoralists in the Kimberleys were unable to get space on the boats to send their stock to the southern market. At that time two ships were chartered to run to the ports of Wyndham and Derby, but the whole of the space on them was controlled by the large squatters. Consequently the small men who wished to send their ""fats"" to market had to drive them to either Wyndham or Derby-in many instances, a distance of hundreds of miles. At times when cattle were bringing a high price in the south the prices paid to the small squatters by the two firms - that had a monopoly of the shipping were such that it was impossible for them to make a living. It' was only when the Government instituted a - State shipping service and laid down the principle that small growers should receive prior consideration, that the cattle industry was able to progress. No ring should be allowed to control the space in the Commonwealth ships, but I fear that, unless men are appointed to the Board to look after the interests of - the primary producers, that will occur. No member of the Chamber would so reflect on the primary producers as to suggest that there is not one of their number who has sufficient capacity to qualify him for a seat on the Board. I hold the same view in regard to the representation of industrialists, but as certain influences behind the Government, policy prevent us getting justice for them, I do appeal for representation of the primary producers, so that the Commonwealth Shipping Line may fulfil one of the principal purposes for which ;t was instituted.",59
178,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"Wannon) [10.27] I do not know why this amendment should be received with derision by honform. orable members opposite. If the Commonwealth Shipping Line is to succeed, the B'oard controlling it must be representative of other than the commercial classes. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) inferred that there are no brains amongst those who represent the primary producers. Some of the brightest intellects in this> and every other country have come from the working classes and the rural producers. - I regret very much that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) was not carried. I , as an Australian, desire this Line of steamers to succeed, and I am sure that if representation, is given to the primary producers they will be able to select from amongst their number one who will in sure, amongst other things, that the Line is not dominated by the Shipping Combine as it has been in the past. That is one of the reasons that induces me to support the amendment. If the Line be lef t to the control of three men chosen from the commercial class it will meet with little success. There must be representation of the men engaged in the industries of the Commonwealth - the producers and the workersi f a big enterprise of this character is to yield satisfactory results. When the Wheat Board was established, the primary producers were without representation, and it was not a success. u n t i l there were on the Board men who understood the job. It is fair, therefore, that the primary producers should have representation on the Shipping Board. As Australians, we desire to see the right thing done by the - people, and realizing the powerful commercial interests are at work all the time to ' ' k ill "" any Commonwealth or State enterprise, we should see to it that the interests of the people are adequately safeguarded.  [10.32] - If the amendment is going to be defeated, it will not be on account of reasons given by those who are opposed to it . The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) advanced an astounding objection. I do not know how far he claims to speak for the primary producers, but it is just as well we should know exactly where he stands. He has told us that the primary producers would be quite satisfied with the appointment of the brainiest men available, the inference being, of course, that there were no brainy men amongst the primary producers. Therefore,"" his admission was tantamount to a serious reflection' upon the intelligence of the people he is supposed to represent in this House. And , surprising though it be, the honourable member's suggestion was received enthusiastically by all the members of the Corner party. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham), as a Collinsstreet primary producer, may be excused for his view-point. His remarks this evening were just what we might have expected from a gentleman carrying on the interesting occupation of farming the farmer. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) the other day, when we sought to get an increase of Is. a bushel for the farmers' wheat by way of a Commonwealth guarantee, could not see his way to lend us support because he and other members of the late Country party have been completely "" nobbled "" by this composite Ministry. All they can do is to indulge in loud guffaws and jibes at everything which honourable members on this side of the House seek to do for the primary producers. The honourable member will in the future find himself in awkward situations because of his utterances during the past few days. He practically declared that the primary producer did not want another Is. per bushel for their wheat.",59
179,Mr HILL,Unknown,"I did nothing of the kind.  when we made a claim for another Is. a bushel guarantee, he failed to support us. He told us that we did not speak for the primary producers, and, as lie failed to support the .motion, the inference is that, as he claimed to speak for the primary producers, they were demanding Is. less per bushel. To-night, getting more timi d as time goes on, he is not prepared to say anything, but suggests that honourable members on this side are not serious. He has declared that the primary producers, or at ali events the wheat-growing section of them, have been seriously handicapped at every turn through inability to charter some of the Commonwealth vessels for wheat cargoes. Surely that is another excellent reason why they should have representation on the Board. The honourable mem this afternoon that the primary producers were responsible for. the greater, part of the freights carried by the Commonwealth Line. Is that not another excellent reason why the amendment now before the Committee should be adopted? Unless the Line has the backing of the primary producers, it will be a failure. But those on the other side who claim to be representatives of the primary producers have been completely "" nobbled "" by the other section of the Ministerial party, and particularly by the right honourable gentleman at its headanother Flinders-lane farmer. entered this House claiming to have been sent here to fight Flinders-lane influences. Indeed, the Postmaster-General (Mr . Gibson) on one occasion said something about being able to shoot the profiteers of Flinders-lane with a short-range gun from one of the windows of this building ; but instead of doing that, we find that this gentleman, and other members of his party, have gone over holusbolus to those people. The primary producers will need no divining rod to find their friends in this House. They need only look at the division lists to see-how votes have been recorded when their in terests have been at stake. I venture to say that had the' Labour party been in control of the Treasury bench today, and been responsible for the introduction of this Bill , the honourable member for Echuca would have been one of the first to rise in his place and submit an amendment in terms similar to that moved by the honourable member for Angas. But, bound as he is now to this composite Government, he is unable to exercise his independent judgment, and therefore will vote against it .",60
180,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Hav e the producers asked for representation on the Board!  not expect them to be waiting on the door-step to make known their demands. They send representatives here and expect them to watch their interests. The primary producers cannot leave their work every day in order to keep their representatives up to the "" collar."" They expect their representatives in this House to watch and fight for their interests. Members of the late Country party will be judged on their attitude to the fourteen points which they submitted to the electors during the last campaign. There : was not bad material in those points, because, with one or two exceptions, they were, I think, purloined fro m the platform of our party.",61
181,Mr HILL,Unknown,"Then why find f a u them?  only finding f a u l t with honourable members of the Corner party for running away from them. The primary producers, judging tlieir representatives by this platform, will naturally expect their interests to be safeguarded, so it is only They fair to remind them of the real position. If members of the Corner party intend to vote against the amendment I can only leave them to their fateMr . PATERSON (Gippsland) [10.44]. - Referenc e was made by the mover of this amendment, the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), to some remarks which I made this afternoon with regard to the representation of the primary producer on the Board. What I did say was that the primary producers, as the largest providers of freight, might be regarded as having an equal right to representation on the Board with the employees of the Line, but that, nevertheless, we regard it as an absolutely unfit place to ask for representation upon. It is true that the platform of the Victorian Farmers Union .contains a plank to the eflect that we believe we should have representation on all Boards dealing with the sale of primary products. But we do not ask for representation in the management of the shipping, any more than we do for representation on the management of the railways, which also carry our goods. I am told that today there was formed primary what is known as the Country Labour party, and I take it that this amendment is its first off-spring, though I am afraid it will be still-born. At the time of the last Parliament, as an outside observer, and as President of the Victorian Farmers Union, I , with other members of that body, waited patiently for some evidence of a sincere desire on the part of our friends opposite to do something for the man on the land. But what did we find ? Those gentlemen, who are now so solicitous for the man on the land, assisted to their utmost in heaping heavy Tariff burdens on the staple necessaries of the primary producers. Those honourable members will have an opportunity later of showing 'their sincerity by helping, to some extent, to remove the intolerable burdens then created, and to assist us later on to secure representation on the T a r if f Board. We on this side l t with are anxious to see this Commonwealth Line a success. We do not desire to risk failure by placing on that Board men not specially trained in the management of such a business. This is an age when specialization enters into almost every calling, and, in my opinion, the three members of the Board should consist of a man with very complete knowledge of at shipping, another with a knowledge of fact shipbuilding, and a third a financial expert. I should like to convey some idea of my astonishment when I heard the have amendment proposed, by telling a little on wheat. It is responsible for an increase story. It is said that an old whose cow had triplet calves, named the first one "" Expectation,"" the second to "" Surprise,"" and the third. "" Amazejgentleman was ment."" My state of mind on hearing the truth . amendment was precisely that of the old Scotchman when he first set his eyes that thir d calf.",61
182,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Capricornia) [10.48] We were told by honourable members opposite that they could not support amendment to appoint a representative of the workers to the Shipping Board beliament cause communistic tendencies might be displayed by the man selected. honourable members are now opposing the appointment of a representative of the primary producers. Surely they do not contend that the primary producers should be debarred from having represenhaving tation because of their socialistic tenproducers dencies? If the members of the alleged Country party tell the truth , they must admit that they have been ""brought to heel "" by the Nationalists, and are free to speak their minds.  mine 1",62
183,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"But the . honourable member had his tongue in his cheek; he was speaking the words the Leader of the Government (Mr Bruce) desired him speak. What was the attitude of the Country party in the last .Parliament What will the Postmaster-General (M Gibson), in view of the speeches he then about the control of the Shipping L in e , ' and the necessity for the farmers - having a fair deal in the matter of freights, do now that he is asked to vote keenly and fair l y . on an amendment for appointing a representative of the primary producers to Board? On the 13th July, 1922, the he saidhonorable gentleman, speaking on the Commonwealth Shipping Line, saidThe Victorian Wheat Corporation, which done its best to get charters from the CommonCombine. wealth Line, has succeeded in getting only three charters from it, because in respect nearly every application, the price quoted 5s. to 7s. 6d. more than was quoted by private firms. Whenever the Victorian Wheat Corouite poration approached the Commonwealth Line for charters, it was told that it could not carry the price quoted by private firms, and that was used as a lever by the private firms to keep up .freights. The Commonwealth Line instead of saving the Victorian wheat producers 2d. per bushel, as some of the Ministers claimed, has actually kept up the freights v Scotchman, rather .than a reduction. I have not before me the figures needed ascertain whether the honourable then speaking thfl What is the best way tVu give the farmers the opportunity to ge* on redress , for the grievances they h a w against the management of the Line ? Is it not to appoint a representative on the Board? The ' Postmaster-General, the who has "" managed "" himself into a capital position, declared in the last Parthat the farmers were not getting a fair deal-that freights were a great Those deal too high-and that instead of being in competition with the Combine, the Line was working in unison with it . The mo3t effective way to reduce freights on wheat, wool, cotton, and other produce is by a representative of the primary on the Board who is directly interested in the reduction. It is of no use trusting to highly-paid officials in the city. We know from experience that if the not farmers are to get redress they must have some voice raised on their behalf, and this they could have in the person of a representative on the Board capable of adequately expressing their views. During the last Parliament the then Deputy Leader of the Country party (Mr . to MCWilliams), ex-member for Franklin, spoke very clearly on this subject. Mr . ? MCWilliams was an ex-Leader of the r . Country party as then constituted, and made was known as "" Fighting Mac."" He it was who put up the fight for the farmers, and who was deposed as Leader of the party because he fought the Nationalists He could not be "" "" brought to heel,"" and on the 12th Octothe ber, 1922, when speaking on the subject, For some time past I have complained that the Commonwealth Government Line of has Steamers has practically joined the Shipping Instead of assisting in reducing rates of freight between Australia and Engof land, the Commonwealth steamers have been was rather the means of preventing any reduction from being broucht ahout. A statement. I got recently from the Wheat Board shows that,, although they shipped last year's wheat by some seventy-five bottoms, only three vessels of the Commonwealth Line could be engaged, owing to the fact that our vessels were charging 5s. per ton more than was being charged by any other line, although at the same time our boats were running practically empty, and some of them were even lying idle in Australian ports. That is what the Country party thought during the last Parliament. Conditions have not changed; in fact, today there - is ' more necessity for the primary producers to have some one to represent their views, seeing that they are no longer voiced by the members of the alleged Country party. As the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes) has pointed out, those members are silent to-daythere is not one word of protest from them. Why this silence? Those honourable members won their seats by condemning the Nationalists. Now they are joined up with them. The farmers of Australia, many of whom work from sunrise to sunset, thousands of miles, perhaps, distant from this Parliament, cannot be expected to keep in touch with all our doings and make requests before we take action. They ought to be able to trust the elected representatives of the people to see that they get a fair deal; and to-night we have had an amendment proposed from this side in their interests. The members of the Coun-. try party got their seats by telling .the farmers that they would put up a greater fight for them than any Nationalist or Labour members could. The position now is that Labour members are the true friends of the farmers. Honourable members on this'side do not find it necessary, before taking action, to wait u n t i l they are reminded by the farmers outside that they desire representation on the Board. At a later date, Mr MCWilliams spoke as follows:Wie cannot allow .the high freights to continue. The black flag with the skull and cross bones is what the Shipping Combine should be flying. The only hope we have is the competition of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and if that Line is allowed to work by arrangement with the Combine, the primary producers will be at the mercy of Tiberius. It must be conceded that Mr MCWilliams was an honest and sincere representative of country interests, who could not be induced to support a Government in which he did not believe. He was not controlled by the "" farmers "" of Flinders-lane and Collins-street. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) has said that he is Mr Forde. personally opposed to the farmers having representation on this Board, but - he speaks as a city representative; and if the farmers of Australia depend on the great commercial interests for the consideration they deserve, they will be in a sorry plight. They can no longerdepend on middlemen; they feel that they must have fair and impartial representation, - and if honourable members fail in their duty, then we on this side ' will see that the farmers do not suffer. An honourable member opposite has suggested that the division lists of the last Parliament will show who the farmers' representatives really are. Do honourable members forget the fight over the Commonwealth Bank Bill , when a proposal was made by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) that rural credits should be established for rural interests in order to release the producers from the grip of the money lender ? On that occasion the Country party voted with the Nationalists against the establishment of any such system, and to-night they are adopting a similar attitude. Those honourable members of the alleged Country party have been swallowed by the Nationalists, and there is really no Country party today. The members of the alleged Country party are at one with the Nationalist forces, and doubtless they will be secretly financed at the next election by - that mysterious National Union. Just as I voted in favour of the workers having representation on the Board, so shall I vote for representation for the primary producers. It is a gross injustice to the farmers of Australia to suggest that they, who provide 75 per cent, of^ the goods shipped, cannot elect one man from among themselves qualified to sit on the Board and represent their views. I ask the Prime Minister to accept the amendment as a f a ir and reasonable one, which, if carried, will result in the better and more efficient working of the Line' with the sympathy and co-operation of the great mass of the primary producers.",62
184,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Angas) [ 1 1 . 0 ] - I am rather surprised that we have not had some statement from the other side, and yet why should I be surprised, seeing that this - Government stands for big business interests. Honourable members who comprise the Prime Minister's majority remain silent, and I suppose we cannot blame the Prime Minister if he takes his "" cue "" from them. I remind honourable members in the Corner that they were not elected pledged to support the Nationalists, and when they range themselves behind "" b i g business,"" they are betraying the trust of the people who sent them here. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) said.it was ridiculous to ask for the amendment. A f t e r his election, the honourable member went into the Country party's room, although he represents a city constituency, and, no doubt, he helped to organize the negotiations between the Country and Nationalist parties. In South Australia, the Farmers' party would not admit a lawyer to membership; they insisted on every member being a farmer or land worker. From the honourable member's speech I can see that he is doing his work well as the ambassador of "" b i g business.""",63
185,Mr HILL,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. Are the remarks of the honourable member relevant? 1,64
186,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, I ask the honourable member for Angas to keep his remarks relevant to the matter before the Chair.,64
187,Mr GABB,Unknown,"I merely wish to show that honourable members who are supposed to represent the primary producers are prepared to stand behind the M in istry and oppose an amendment that is in. the direct interests of the producers. There are actually only three Country party members in the Ministry, although that party is supposed to have five members there. The Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mr Atkinson) was always a Nationalist, and the Honorary Minister (Senator ""Wilson), as soon as he was elected, left the Farmers and Settlers' party.",64
188,Mr HILL,Unknown,What has that to do with the Commonwealth Shipping Line?,64
189,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Not h in g ; but it has a lot to do with the neglect of the interests of the primary producers by honourable members who were specially sent here to look after those interests. I invite the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr . Paterson) to look at my votes on the Tariff. There is no direct representative of the primary producers on the T a r if f Board, and the members of the Corner party have had something to say about it , and rightly so. The amendment before the Chair affords an opportunity to do something for the primary producers to compensate for that blunder, and those honourable members in the Corner who professed that they were prepared: to move Heaven and earth to alter the Tariff in the interests-, of the men on the land shouldreadily avail themselves of the opportunity now afforded to assist the agricultural community. If the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) had been on a Board. controlling the Commonwealth Shipping Line, the primary producers would not have had trouble in the shipment of their wheat. Those producers are entitled to first consideration; and, if the amendment is carried, it w i ll operate in the interests of the Shipping Line and of its best customers. . Mr CUNNINGHAM (Gwydir) [11.8]. - I regret that the Government are determined to inconvenience honourable member's by continuing the sitting at this late hour, but I am pleased to have an opportunity to record a. vote in favour of the excellent suggestion of the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb). The amendment is . entirely in accord with the policy of the Labour party. The outward tonnage of the Commonwealth Shipping Lino will for a long time consist mainly of the primary produce of Australia; but, owing to the higher wages and the better labour conditions generally enjoyed here, compared with older countries, Australia will probably never be a very large exporter of manufactured goods, and I should be sorry if an.export trade could only be built up by the sacrifice of those labour conditions. I should not like to see our industrial conditions f all to the level of those of many other parts of the world. Methods are provided under the Constitution for safeguarding our fields of industry. The history of the world proves that countries pass through, first, the grazing, then the. agricultural, and, thirdly,"" the manufacturing stage, and it wil l be many years before Australia will have exploited the whole of its opportunities in regard to primary production. For that reason, if for no other, our primary producers should have direct representation on the Board. It has been possible for certain export agents to monopolize the cold' storage space available for the export of perishable produce, such as f r u it , with the result that many primary producers have been deprived of the opportunity of sending their products overseas. Representation on the Board would enable the producers to have a reasonable proportion of the available space reserved for them. It requires a considerable stretch of the imagination to regard the honourable member, for Kooyong (Mr Latham) u> a Country party member. The holdings in his electorate would, in very few instances, exceed blocks measuring 40 feet by 150 feet. May be, he has been taken into the Country party as adviser to the Prime Minister. An uninformed member might be surprised at the attitude of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) and the honourable member  of us who have had experience of the Country party are but mildly surprised. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) has been charged with taking action for political reasons. What is wrong with lining up the supporters of the Government .to vote on this question ? I welcome an opportunity to register my vote, and if they do not believe in the principle contained in the amendment, why should they object to registering: their vote against it?",64
190,Mr KILLEN,Unknown,We are opposed to primary producers interfering in a business of which they know nothing.,65
191,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,I remind my honourable friend that the primary producers are taxpayers.,65
192,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Will the honourable member say how the presence of a farmer on the Board would help the primary producer ?,65
193,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"The honourable member might as well ask how an advocate appearing before a court could help his client,",65
194,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"The honourable member contends, then, that the proposed additional member on the Board should - represent a particular interest.",65
195,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Since greater proportion of the tonnage carried in these ships will be primary produce, it is logical that Parliament should give the primary producers representation on the Board. If the manufacturers could show that they were supplying a reasonable amount of the tonnage, and if they thought they were not getting a fair deal, I would favour giving them representation on the Board. One of the reasons why Government enterprises do not give satisfaction is that the interests concerned are often not represented.",65
196,Mr FORDE,Unknown,Freight s are too high at present.,65
197,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"P e o p l e do not like to pay more than they think is fair. The rates of freights to be charged must be determined by the management of the Line, and the Government should overlook the scale of charges very carefully, for it is responsible for seeing that undue profits are not made out of the people of the country. Some honourable members have spoken about non-political control. In the end, however, the Government is responsible. If the shipping Line makes a loss, the Government, in power at the time must answer for it to the electors. I ' believe we should have access to the Board through a responsible Minister. There are many much needed railway reforms which cannot be obtained because the Railways Commissioners are in an independent position. A Minister should have a position on the Board. Parliament, instead of having to suffer long-standing grievances, should be able to get at the people responsible. While the control of many of the Boards is outwardly and ostensibly non-political, the persons in charge have strong political opinions, and make them felt to the disadvantage of the people of the country. The Labour party has always been prepared to accept its share of 1, responsibility in the administration of Departments and Boards. If the control of the Board was non-political, and if the primary producers were unrepresented upon it and could not get a fair deal, how would they proceed to redress there grievances? When they appealed to the Board they would be told to go to the devil, and the Board would add, "" The control of this Board is non-political. We do not recognise the Government, and our positions are secure for. five or seven years."" They would the snap .their fingers at the primary producers. W it h the' office of the Board in one of the large cities, and the members of ..the Board living in a city and moving among city interests, it would be more than likely that the Board's vision of country interests - would be somewbat obscured. It would lose sight of the fact that its business was to carry primary products. No valid arguments have been advanced against the amendment. The arguments put forward by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham), the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson), and the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , collapse when they are analyzed. Those honourable members appear to be concerned solely because they do not want to be lined up to vote for or against the amendment. have been reminded by the honourable member for Angas, they complained because no representative of the primary producers was appointed on the Tariff Board. The Board was appointed when Parliament was not sitting, and consequently nothing could be done in the matter. Parliament is now sitting, and they have an opportunity to place a representative of the primary producers upon the Shipping Board. I remember the speeches made hy the Leader and other members of the Country party at. the last election. What was their slogan? It was that the primary producer should be adequately represented in the Commonwealth Parliament. His interests were to be paramount. The Leader of the Country party (Mr MCWilliams). in announcing his manifesto in the first session of the last Parliament, said, "" We are a party which is going forward to a definite goal. We are looking neither to right nor left, and are giving support to measures, only, and not to men or Governments: We do not support members of the Ministry, but we supp'ort measures that are for the ga>d of men in the country."" Representatives of the Country - party now have an opportunity to choose between the Government and the primary producer. What will they do? I would remind them that they owe a duty to their constituents, who sent them to Parliament expecting them to voice the opinions of men in the country. If the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Echuca were not members of Parliament, but were slaving in the country to produce wool and wheat for a living, they would welcome an opportunity to vote in favour of putting one of their representatives upon the Shipping Board. I assume that they aspired to come into Parliament to voice the opinions of the primary producers, who, they believe, want representation. Surely they will he consistent, and give the primary producers an opportunity of placing a representative upon the Board. In all probability the appointee will not be a Labour man, but a primary producer of their own political party. Although they refuse to place such a representative upon the Board, they will not hesitate to complain of the high As I freightscharged by the Line. They have, placed themselves in a ridiculous position by ignoring the interests of the rank and file of the primary producers in order t©>. keep the Government in power. They are. supporting a Government led by the champion, of Plinders-lane. Nationalist membars, and members of the Country party, have entered into an agreement. They hold their separate meetings, and couriers pass to and fro between the two armies with war messages. These men run great risks when they charge up. and down the stairs past the lines of the Opposition. I believe that decorations will be handed' ""out to these despatch riders in the near future. It is reported on very good authority that the Leader of the Country party used all his inftuence-which , I . admit, is not miuch-wit h the Prime Minister to induce him to> grant representation to the primary producers-, but he failed miserably. Having overthrown principles for expediency, they have now reached the miserable position in which they find themselves. The Opposition cannot get from the Country party the support that it has a right to expect. During the negotiations which preceded the formation of the Government, managers were appointed who "" pulled "" the Country party. A meeting was to be held in the afternoon to throw down .the gauntlet, but the managers would not have that. Cars were procured and members of the Country party were rushed to the Governor General, who obligingly swore them in. Members of the Country, party, instead of refusing to support their managers, fell, .in meekly behind them, and have had to apologize ever since for their attitude. These men have always said that Parliament must have a vote regards ing every penny of Government expenditure, but a recent Supply Bill for millions of pounds was rushed through the House without a word of discussion being allowed to take place. members of the Country party, who have been swallowed by the Nationalists, have sacrificed all the principles for which they fought at the last election. Government are retaining the Commonwealth Line only as a matter of expediency. They do not believe in its continuance, and the Prime Minister has very l it f l e faith in its ultimate success. The members of the Country party will be compelled to return to their farmer constituents and say that they did not make a noise over the sale of the Geelong Woollen M ill s; but they would be afraid to inform their supporters that they allowed the Government to sacrifice the Commonwealth Shipping Line, and throw them at the mercy of the Shipping Combine. When it is expedient for the Government to dispose of an important public utilit y the members of the Country party support them, but they will scrap their principles in order to support a Government Shipping Line. bers of the Country party believe in State enterprises- I do not think they dothey should be consistent. The members of the Country party who promised to 6upport country interests will prove true to tradition, and will vote with the Go. vernment against the interests of the p r imary producer. That is only to be expected. Honourable members on this side have done their duty, and I trust that the primary producers generally will peruse - the division list on this occasion to see how the men who are supposed to safeguard their interests have thrown them - at the mercy of Flinders-lane merchants and those associated with them.

Honourable members representing country constituencies have said that the Commonwealth Line has been of immense benefit, to primary producers, and I believe it has; but Tasmania has not received any benefits commensurate with its importance from the Commonwealth shipping service. If the previous Government had done their duty, a regular service would to. have been established between the mainland and, those parts of Tasmania which Committee at present are not served by private shipping companies. A Shipping Committee has been formed in Hobart in an endea... 25 vour to establish a better shipping service to the south of Tasmania'. Captain Evans, the Speaker in the State House, who is the local representative of HudAYES. Moloney, Parker dart Parker and Company, and the honourable member ""for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) are members of the committee, and at a recent meeting of that body atYates, G. E. tention was directed to the unfortunate position of those in the southern portion of Tasmania who are in the grip of the private shipping companies. D. C. The Combine known as the Tasmanian Steam-ship Proprietary Company really comprises the Huddart Parker Company and the Union Steam-ship Company. At the meeting referred to I was the only person present who held Labour views. was not a member of the Committee, but was asked to attend as the representative of Denison, together with other Federal members. On returning to Melbourne noticed at Williamstown six or eight idle Commonwealth vessels. I am told that there are also several Commonwealth steamers in Sydney. Harbor. Under the management of Mr Larkin, the Commonshould wealth steamers have been allowed to rust in Australian ports, while the State of manian trade. Tasmania has been unable to secure shipshould ping to carry the produce of its primary producers. The constituencies of the orable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) are dependent upon to primary products. The honourable member for Franklin's predecessor (Mr MCWilous liams) knew from bitter experience that the primary producers of Tasmania, esmania pecially in the southern fruit-growing the past. country, have suffered through the absence of reasonable shipping facilities. Tasmania is a portion of the Commonwealth, and has to pay its share of the heavy pense incurred by the Gommonwealth Gowording vernment to provide adequate shipping facilities and means of communication be_ tween the various ports of the Commonvested wealth. If the late Government had ried out its duty to Tasmania, CommonTreasurer. wealth steamers would have been running where necessary. It may be held by the new Board that the ships to be retained will not include suitable vessels for Tasmanian trade. I do not know whether that will be so or not, because I am not shipping expert; but clause 10 within the power of the Board the right to purchase ships and to dispose of surplus tonnage. The Board will also have power to act as a trading company. The Government should impress upon the Board the fact that the trade of Tasmania is peculiarly suitable for Commonwealth steamers. Unfortunately, the transport of the proment duce of that State to the mainland pends entirely upon shipping facilities. I am not using extravagant - language when I say that during the last three four years many of the producers of Tasinserted mania were on the verge of starvation owing to - their. inability to market their produce in the mainland. The Commonwealth vessels were not at their disposal; consequently they were entirely at the I mercy of the Shipping Combine. For reasons best known to themselves, the Combine have not catered adequately for this trade. I ask the Government to imI press upon the new Board the fact that Tasmania is a part of the Commonwealth, and is entitled to an up-to-date shipping service. If they have not boats capable of dealing with the trade, suitable vessels be purchased. I have reason to believe that the vessels to be retained will include some suitable for the TasThe shipping service not be regarded entirely from a pounds, shillings, and pence point of honview, but should receive the same consideration as was shown to such services as the transcontinental railway in order provide reasonable transport facilities for passengers and cargo between the variports of the Commonwealth.

If the Government of the day really intended to dispose of the Linewhile I have no doubt that they could do it under paragraph d-the y would still have that power even if the paragraph were not there. But no Government would dispose of the Shipping Line unless it had considered the facts knowing that it had toface Parliament. That is exactly the position today. Paragraph d was not framed to deal with that situation at all.

The principle of preference to unionists should be established at the commencement of the Commonwealth Shipping Line under the direction of the Board. ""While it may be contended that there is absolutely no necessity to embody this principle in the Bill, inasmuch as it is invariably incorporated in industrial agreements, yet in the years to come some enthusiasts on the Board, perhaps in carrying out the policy of a future Government, may attempt to run this Line with non-union labour. It would not be the first Commission or Board of Control which had attempted this experiment, and failed miserably. From time to time there have been industrial disturbances in the mercantile marine, but in the history of Australian industrial unionism I have yet to learn that any company has succeeded in maintaining non-union labour on their vessels. This amendment provides, not only for preference to unionists so far as seamen, firemen, stewards, engineers, and officers are concorned, but also for painters and dockers, and all those employed in and about a shipyard, who will be under the control of the Board. The"" principle of preference to unionists is a dear one to the workers of Australia, and it should be acceptable to the Government.

203,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [12.30 a.m.] - I quite understand the views of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) on preference to unionists, which has been one of the most prominent industrial questions in this country for many years. A long and well sustained fight has been fought by the Labour party of Australia for the maintenance con- of the policy, and I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that that party has succeeded in having it established, as a general rule, in the industrial matters here. I suggest, however, that preference to unionists comes more within the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court, with those other principles which really govern the relations between employer and employed. Preference to unionists is generally imposed by the Court, but it certainly does not appear to me to be a subject for inclusion in a Bill. If this amendment be accepted , there are other 1 amendments which obviously would have to be considered at once. For instance, it is the declared policy of the Commonwealth Government to give preference'to returned soldiers, and a natural suggestion would be that it should be followed in the case of the Commonwealth Ship-, ping Line - To my mind, neither the proposed amendment, nor a proposal to give preference to returned soldiers, is proper in this Bill. I naturally sympathize with the view of the Leader of the Opposition, but I do not regard the amendment as at all necessary, seeing that it deals with a subject for determination by the ordinary industrial tribunals created for the purpose of regulating the relations between employers and employed.

I move That the following sub-clause be added:"" (2) All ships held or acquired by the Board shall, where practicable, be manned by Australians or persons permanently domiciled in Australia Signed on under Australian articles, and the Board shall pay its employees a rate of wages not less than ithe rate prescribed by the Common\ Wealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for the class of work upon which they are engaged."" It will be seen that the first part of the proposed sub-clause provides that "" where practicable"" the vessels shall be manned by Australians, signed Committee on under Australian articles. The words ""where practicable"" are used .. 17 because there may be cases in which it is necessary to engage such labour outside Australia. One reason for the amend9 ment is that men have signed on abroad, and under such articles their wages are AYES. less than those paid to the Australian seamen with whom they work. That differentiation we desire to avoid as far as possible. We have agreed that the Board shall be located in Australia, and we all desire to make the Shipping 'Line Australian as far as possible; and in the circumstances the amendment I have proposed seems fair and reasonable. If there are NOES. Arbitration Courts to decide the wages of seafaring pe'ople and other workers, Parliament should see that the awards - are observed, and to that end honourable members on this side desire to have this provision embodied in the Bill . Mr Bruce .(Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [12.43 a.m.] - I said earlier in the evening that the intention is to have this Commonwealth Line manned by Australian crews, and conducted as an Australian PAIBS. shipping enterprise, with the objectof furthering the establishment of an Australian overseas mercantile marine. I have every sympathy with the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), but the amendments appear to me to deal with matters which are part and parcel of the general administration of the Line. It has beeni made clear what the views of this Parliament are. We stand in the same relation to the Board that shareholders do to directors whom they appoint to conduct their business. All the operations of the Board will be subject to review by Parliament, year by year, when its balance sheet is presented, in exactly the same way as the operations and conduct of the directors of any private company are reviewed by the shareholders. Matters of this nature ought not to be inserted in an Act of Parliament. If we insert them we shall be suggesting that we have no assurance that the Line will be conducted in accordance with our views on the subject, and think it necessary to guard the position. If that is to be the 'basis on which the Line is to commence its career, there cannot be very much hope for its future. I take a more optimistic view. I am certain that when the Board is appointed it will carry out the desire and the tention of Parliament. Por that reason, coolie crews. I cannot accept the amendment. I want it to be clearly understood that I am unsympathetic towards the ideas conpeople tained in the amendment. I stress fact that the rates of wages are fixed the Arbitration Court,. and the Board will be bound to observe the that Court in operating the Line. I said, at an earlier stage in this bate, that it - is the intention of Government, before the Line is handed over to the Board, that the members the Board and representatives of the ployees shall be called together and, under my presidency, endeavour to estabment lish a basis for the settlement of disputes that may arise in the future, as well to define a method for handling matters before a stoppage actually takes place. Boththese subjects appear to me 'Board's discretion. to be peculiarly suitable for discussion by a conference of that character. They are questions of vital moment to those who are to be employed by the Line those who are to be in charge of it There can be no hope of real success unmade less the Board understands that it to enlist the co-operation of those whom it is going to employ.",70

I realise that there are times when ships must be repaired overseas, but, generally speaking, there is no reason why the major repairs should not be made in the Commonwealth.

I do not think the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) need feel at all anxious in regard to the dockClause 14ing of vessels in Australia. Under the proposals embodied in the B i l too Island Dockyard will be brought under the same management as the Commonwealth Shipping Line, and obviously the Board would see that the work necessary for the Line was done in establishments under its control.

The men who have been employed at Williamstown have a real grievance against the Commonwealth Government. If honourable members look up .the proceedings, at the conference between the AYES. unions, the shipbuilding trades, and the ex-Prime Minister (Mr W . M . Hughes), they will be convinced that there has been a great breach.of faith . A f t e r a long conference Mr Hughes succeeded in persuading the unions to scrap many of their important rules-for example, the rules against piece-work and the dilution of labour, and in return for that the exNOES. Prime Minister guaranteed the men permanent employment.",73
219,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,A * similar assurance was given in the other States.,73
220,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I expect the honourable gentleman to put up a fight for his State, just as I am doing for Victoria. I understand that the negotiations with the Harbor Trust have not reached finality, and that it is not too late for the Government to retrace its steps. It is obvious to me that the sale of the shipyards to the Harbor Trust will throw the present staff out of employment. The men accepted an undertaking in good f a it h , and there has not been a stoppage of work at the yards since. It is admitted on all sides that the work done at the yards could nob have been excelled, and the ex-Prime Minister (Mr W . M . Hughes) said that it was not excelled in any part of the world. The reward now given to these men is to throw them on the indust r i a l scrap heap. I say in all sincerity that such treatment will not encourage men to relax their union rules and enter into similar agreements. ""Why do I say that these men will be thrown out of employment? The Harbor Trust has its own staff, and will, I suppose, scrap the work done almost alongside the yard, and bring in its own staff to replace the Commonwealth staff. There is considerable unemployment in the shipping trade already. Even if the Government could not continue to build ships, the yard could be used for repairs, and would form the nucleus of a shipbuilding establishment if the need for one should again arise. A number of returned soldiers are employed at the yard, and they will be thrown out of work with the rest. There has been a great breach of faith with these workers. Although guarantees were not given by the present Government, they were given by a Government of which many of the present Ministers were members. bave heard much talk at different time? about the honouring of obligations entered into by ]Dast Governments. I think this obligation was handed down by the previous Government to the present one.",73
221,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [1.19 a.m.] - The Williamstown Dockyard has been a subject of consideration in Parliament. The Government's position has been outlined, but I propose very briefly to state it again. It became neoesthe day. sary for the Government, when it assumed office, to survey the position of the Shipping Line, and the relation thereto of the shipyards at Cockatoo Island and Williamstown. We had to arrive at a decision regarding the two shipyards. After ful l consideration, the Government came to the conclusion that it was imperative, in the interests of Australia and of naval defence, that the Cockatoo Island works, and particularly the dockyard, should be retained. Ministers have clearly expressed the opinion that it is no part of the functions of government to conduct ordinary commercial ventures which have no national importance. The Cockatoo Dockyard and the Commonwealth Shipping Line possess such importance. Accordingly, we were faced with the regrettable necessity of disposing of the Williamsto'wn yard. Undertakings were given at a time of great stress that if the unions would agree to certain conditions the shipbuilding industry would be carried on. They cannot, however, be regarded as creating for all time, irrespective of circumstances, the understanding that the taxpayers would carry on the particular industry at that place. Such a guarantee no Government would be justified in giving to any section of the community. While I have every sympathy with the men who may be faced with dismissal, I do not think that Ministers can be held blameworthy, except to the extent that their policy in these matters may be blamed. As the matter has reached a point where the Government has declared its intentions and its policy, and has made arrangements to concentrate on Cockatoo Island, I regret that it is too late to alter the decision. Consequently, I cannot accept the amendment. We Mr Foster (Wakefield) [1.22 a.m.]. - The honourable member who submitted the amendment (Mr Scullin) hardly stated the position fairly. No undertaking was given to carry on the dockyard permanently. The conditions laid down and the concessions obtained from the industrialists related to the construction of certain ships which were then being built. It was stated very distinctly that unless those concessions were made the ships would not be built. That was the promise made by the Government of",74
222,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,The Government of the day did not carry out its promise to the South Australian shipbuilding yard.,74
223,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,I believe it gave to the South Australian yard the construction of all the ships promised to it.,74
224,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [1.23 a.m.] - I understand that a recommendation was made to spend £200,000 in im- proving the dockyard at Williamstown. I do not know whether the proposal has been carried out. If it has, the dock should now be fairly up-to-date. I join with the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) in protesting, not only against Victoria being left out of the scheme, but also against this dock not being permitted to participate in the repairs to the Commonwealth ships. ' The dock will need to be used in some way for repairing Commonwealth ships. The records prove that the men there have been kept well employed, and I believe the financial returns have been exceptionally good. I agree that Cockatoo Island Dockyard should he retained, but if it is right to retain a dock in Sydney Harbor, why should one not be retained in Hobson's Bay? The minutes of the conference with the representatives of the men employed at the yard state that the os-Prime Minister (Mr W . M . Hughes) said I am sure this will be, not only a great industry, but a permanent one. The welfare of industry in general is so closely interwoven with the success of this industry that if you make good the Government will be entitled to say, "" We are justified now in giving encouragement to an industry that will enable us to compete in the markets of the world."" That was a very distinct .pledge. Harbor Trust should cqme into ppssession, a large number of men will be thrown ' out of employment, and among them a number of returned soldiers. no objection to the Government a dock in Victoria when it is retaining one in New South ""Wales. I do not wish to make invidious distinctions, but what is wrong in one case is wrong in the other, and vice versa.

The clause also provides the manner in which capital shall be raised or the basis upon which the issue of debentures shall be determined subject to the consent of the Government.

I move That the words "" Consolidated Revenue"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""National Debt Sinking"". It seems to be an altogether wrong procedure to place the profits into Consolidated Revenue when we have written down a large amount which must necessarily have been taken out of Loan Account. The proper thing to do, after having complied with the requirements of the other sub-clauses, would be to reduce the national debt, which has been in creased to carry on this Line, instead of placing the money into Consolidated Revenue.",76
237,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Plinders-Prime M in ister and Minister for External Affairs) [1.41 a.m.] - When the Line is under the control of the Board, it is to be carried on with the money earned year by year, and the profits are to be employed in creating a reserve f u n d until' the amount at the credit of that f u n d has reached a sum equivalent to 25 per cent, of the issue capital. A f t e r that not more than 50 per cent, of the profits ""will gb to the reserve fund and 50 per cent, will be handed to the Government of the day, which will have power to employ it in redeeming debentures or may pay it into' Consolidated Revenue. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) suggests that the money should be placed to the credit of the National Debt Sinking Fund. B ut we should not under this Bill tie the hands of any future Government in this matter, because the Line is being conducted, not for the purpose of tryin g to redeem the national debt, but as a governmental shipping and trade development venture. A f t e r the Line has been built up upon a proper financial basis, and has reasonable resources behind it , it will be a matter for the Government of the day to say what shall be done with any surplus profits realized. It might happen that a future Government might extend the operations of the Line, and conduct it as a straight-out trading venture. The Government of the day might be looking to the Line for some of its revenue. While I do not agree with such a policy, it might be one that would be endorsed by the people of Australia. I do not, however, feel justified in dictating to a future Government possessing the confidence of a majorit y of the people. I think the clause is framed in a fair and proper manner for dealing with the position. I cannot accept the ' amendment.",76
238,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Angas) [1.46 a.m.] - I hare listened to the Prime Minister's statement concerning the allocation of the profits of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. He takes the stand that any Government may seize the profits of a trading venture for the purpose of showing a surplus. That would be quite feasible if the amount written down and met out of loan had been refunded, but that is not the case. Until that amount is repaid, I submit that the profits should be placed in the national debt sinking fund. Any business concern would adopt that course.",77
