Mr .GREGORY - In view of the large number of Bills on the notice-paper, some of which arc of a very important nature, I ask the Prime Minister - whether an endeavour will be made to have the Bills introduced and the second readings moved as early as possible in order that honourable .members may have a little time for their consideration before they are proceeded with? . Mr BETJCE - It is the intention, of the Government to adopt the course suggested' by the honourable member. The Bills referred to have been put on the notice-paper so that the first readings may be moved as early as possible, and copies' distributed.' In this 'way, honourable members will be given an opportunity to study the measures before the second? reading stage is reached. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). PROPOSED DEPORTATION or IRISH ENVOYS.",13
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt. Hon. W . A. W at t ) . - I have received from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment' of the House to discuss ""a definite matter of uTgent public""importance, viz., "" The action of the Government in arresting Rev. Father Michael O'Flannagan and Mr John O'Kelly for the purpose of deportation without first allowing them the right of trial by j u r y . "" Five honourable members having risen to the in thtir places-, Question proposed. MT . CHARLTON (Hunter ) [ 3 . 7 ] - In taking this course, I desire it to' be clearly understood that honourable members on this side are concerned not about particu- ' lar individuals, but for the maintenance of .the great principle of trial by jury , which has governed British justice for centuries past. We dissociate ourselves from happenings abroad and from expressions of opinion on I r is h affairs. The r Fedehope of the. party on this ' side is that the people of Ireland may be and able, with their new form of .government, to work out their own destiny along, lines which - will bring contentment and happiness to the people of that island. Having made that clear, I want to say that this is the first occasion upon which - action has been taken under certain legislation passed by this Parliament in 1920. Honourable members will recall the fact that we on this side opposed that legislation. ""We pointed out at the time very clearly that in our opinion every individual against whom a charge was made should have the right of t r i a l by jury . Later on, this Parliament also passed an A ct dealing, with passports. Honourable members on this side opposed that measure, too. recollect that the Minister in charge of  it was necessary in order to facilitate the travelling of persons who might go abroad from Australia. We objected that the legislation proposed was a relic of the war period, and claimed that as we had got back to normal conditions the people should not be hampered - by passport legislation submitted. ever, the House passed the measure referred to. The two gentlemen mentioned in my intimation to Mr Speaker, .who are to be deported from Australia, came here furnished with British passports, not with passports issued by the authorities of another country. passports were endorsed by the Australian authorities, and they were allowed to land. They held meetings in Victoria, but no action affecting them was taken. They then went to 'New South Wales, and held meetings there. A certain section of the community objected to their speeches, and criticised the action of the Commonwealth Government in permitting these gentlemen to land in Australia. They claimed that they should be deported. As a result of that criticism, the New' South Wales Government took action against these gentlemen for sedition under a law under which the Commonwealth Government might have taken action had they so desired before the State Government intervened. The law under which the New South Wales Government acted assure to these gentlemen trial by a jury . the State Government had taken action the Commonwealth instituted proceedings against them under the following provision of the Immigration Act 1920 8A. Where the Minister is satisfied that, within three years after the arrival in tralia of a person who was not born in Australia, that person(a) .has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer;. (6) is living on the prostitution of others; (c) has become an inmate of an insane asylum or public charitable institution ; or (d) is a person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the' established government of the Commonwealth or of any State, or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law, or who advocates the abolition of organized government, or who advocates the I assassination of public officials, or « who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a member of, or affiliated with, any organization which teaches any of the doctrines and practicesspecified in this paragraph, he may, by notice in writing, summon the person to appear before a Board within the time and in the manner prescribed, to show cause why he should not be deported from the the Commonwealth. ^ How- To this provision the Opposition took strong exception when the Bill containing it was being debated in this Chamber. We feared that when some burning question was exciting popular feeling men might be appointed to these Boards who were biased; possibly unconsciously. Their Mr MAHONY - There is no doubt about the bias of the Board appointed in this case as the records of its members show.",13
3,Mr CHARLTONJ,Unknown,"They may not be aware that they are biased. In a community like this such a pernicious procedure should not be permitted. In this particular case a Board was appointed by the Commonwealth Government, and the envoys were summoned to appear before it in order to show cause why they should not be deported. Their counsel appealed to the High Court to declare that the ""provision of the Immigration Act under which the Board had been appointed was unconstitutional. However, the Court held that the Act was valid. Meanwhile 1 the hearing of the charge of sedition levelled by. 'the State' Government was stopped. The Immigration In -' A fte r quiry Board resumed its sittings after the decision of the High Court had been given, and recommended that these two gentlemen be deported., The next step in the chain of events was the appearance of the envoys in the State Court to answer the adjourned, charge of sedition, Ausand the police magistrate, before whom they appeared, is reported to have criti cised the Commonwealth authorities severely for, having practically held a State Court in contempt by delaying proceedings. I should say that there was justification for that criticism.",14
4,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"If the honourable meni -\ ber is referring to the action for sedition, that was a State affair.",15
5,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,But the State proceedings were delayed by the action taken by the Commonwealth Government.,15
6,Mr GROOM,Unknown,No .,15
7,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am glad to hear the Minister's denial. In company with Senator Gardiner and Mr Dunn, I waited on Mr Bavin, the State Attorney-General, and he told us that the State Government were not responsible for the'delay, but that the faul t lay with the Commonwealth Government for having taken proceedings under the Immigration Act after the State Government initiated' a prosecution for sedition. He said that obviously the State could not proceed with its prosecution when the Commonwealth stepped in . if , under the charge of sedition, the envoys would have the right to t r i a l by a jury , and he replied that there was no question of the accused losing the right to a trial by a j u r y under the charge the State had laid against these gentlemen, and, further, that the proceedings had been initiated under a Commonwealth Act. If .the State Government could proceed under a Commonwealth Act, which gave the accused the right to a trial by a jury , how was it that the Commonwealth did not proceed in the same way? was it that they allowed these gentlemen to address meetings in Victoria and also in New South Wales, and that they took action only after the State Government had done so? I hope that there will be no effort to make it appear that honourable members on this side, are holding a brief for the persons concerned. I do not know these gentlemen. I have never met them. I a.m no more concerned with them than I would be with any other person ordered to he deported by a Board appointed under the Immigration Act. - When section 8A was discussed in this House we pointed out the clanger that might be incurred by persons expressing their opinion of the existing system of government in Australia. W it h in three years after his arrival in this country a' man who may have been a good citizen for over two years may happen to say .something during industrial trouble which may be held to be' in contravention of this section of the Act, and a Board may be appointed to deport him. No one can tell where this sort of thing will end, and for that reason we cannot allow these two gentlemen to be deported without raising our voice in protest. If we do not do so we shall be regarded as giving tacit consent to the action of the Government. ' Mr ANSTEY - And we would have no right to challenge a similar action in the future.",15
8,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It is a very serious position. Whatever may have happened during the war, when every one was in a state of excitement, we are not justified in perpetuating the procedure of that had period. If the Government think they are justified in putting into operation a measure of this kind in the circumstances I have outlined, what may not happen to I asked our liberty of speech or to the right to trial by a jury? I am ventilating this' matter - solely because I am anxious that nothing, should be done .to abolish liberty of speech or t r i a l by j u r y . H a d the Government taken a course of action which would have allowed the ""envoys to be tried by a jury , no one could have found fault. But that was not done. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth Government intervened, and so delayed the State proceedings that the police magistrate who was dealing with How the case felt called upon to comment on the Commonwealth's action. To me the action taken by the Commonwealth is beyond understanding.",15
9,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,The Commonwealth Ministers would have looked very foolish if these men had been acquitted. They had to stop other proceedings in order to save their own faces.,15
10,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The r e may be something in that view of the matter. It seems to me that the Commonwealth Government must have taken f r i g h t when a certain agitation commenced in New South Wales. Probably they thought that the proceedings instituted by the State Government were, in a way, a reflection upon themselves, and, of course, as 1ihe/State (Government had already (preferred .a charge of sedition against the envoys 'under a Commonwealth Statute, they were obliged to lodk for eomeiother means of taking action, and accordingly commenced proceedings under the Immigration Act. I would like to hear the : Attorney-General explain - why the Commonwealth did this when the gentlemen in Question [were already answering a charge of sedition, which would have ""to be decided by a jury, and not by a Board appointed by the 'Government. I-do not know 'the members of the Board, and I make no reflection upon their personal ,probity when I say that it is possible for men to be unconsciously biased by public clamour in connection with a proposed - deportation.. Therefore, .the community having again - settled down to peace conditions, we should rever,t - to our pre-war procedure, which gave 'every man the right to trial by a (jury of his fellow countrymen. That right is the bulwark of British justice. We have upheld it for hundreds of years as a pattern to be followed »by 'Other nations in framing their judd'ciall systems. Yet in this enlightened age, after 'trial 'by jury has been in operation for hundreds of years, and has proved to be - an - effective safeguard of the liberties of the individual, and the safety of the community, the Government are attempting 'to deny it to two persons who have arrived in the Commonwealth. Do not forget that they arrived as British subjects, with British passports. Honourable members opposite talk a lot .about .the Empire, and the necessity for iEinpire solidarity, and for meting out even-handed justice ;to every man who is protected by the British - flag. In this instance, .that .principle has been lost to sight; the usual method .of administering British justice has been set aside. Not only every Britisher^ but every person of .any .nationality who comes - to Australia, ^s <erititled :to trial by - jury. The men who are about to be deported arrived with a passport which w,as equivalent ,to a icertificate by the British iGovernment of the exemplary character of the bearers. No other view can be taken of ,a passport issued by British .officials. They have no right to issue passports to undesirables, and it may be assumed that tfhey would not do so. These Irish .enxioys iwere hall-marked as reput[14] able 'oitizens >of 'the Empire; yet the <.Commoirwea'lth proposes :to depout ithem without 'according them <trial by jury, i m mediately after - the New :South Wales . magistrate had expressed 'his disgust 'with the action .of 'the'©ommonwealth Law Department in 'delaying ' ito take action against these .men; immediately after ""he had declined to further .remand 'ithem on the sedition charge brought .by the State Government, and had released them, they were - re-arrested. Probably ,they will be deported in 4he near future, but it is not ^yet too late Jor the Commonwealth Government to retrace their steps, and have these anen .tried .by a .jury, a procedure to which they, like everybody else in this country, - are entitled. Mr .GROOM (Darling Downs-Attor ney-^General,) '[3.24]. --The Leader of the Opposition has based his .case mainly upon the contention that (these Irish envoys are entitled-to trial :by. jury - I;ask the House to consider .first .of .all the law under which the ""Commonwealth ,are' acting, and the purpose of .that ^law. I remind honourable .members that the Immigration Act of 1920 was not - a .war-time imeasure.; it was passed after the excitement of the - w.ar had - died down. It .was a law deliberately made .by .this Parliament for the purpose of regulating - the admission of immigrants .to Australia, and excluding undesirables. That Act increased the. inumber of persons who' were deemed ' to .be prohibited immigrantSj and therefore not eligible to land in Australia, and .'included, amongst othersAny person who advocates the .overthrow 'by force or violence of the established Government of the Commonwealth or of any State or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law, or who advocates the abolition >of organized government, <or .who .advocates .the assassination of public officials, or who - advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a member o'for affiliated w.ith any organisation which entertains and .teaches any .of the doctrines and practices specified in this paragraph. The deliberate decision of the House was (that such persons should be prohibited from entering-the Commonwealth. Immigration laws must, by their very nature, be administered promptly, and, usually, at the time 'when.'the person applies for entrance into the Commonwealth. This prohibition stands at the T!ery portals :of the Commonwealth. The Leader of the Opposition, in-effect, suggests that trial .by j u r y should be conceded to every person who conies under the definition of a prohibited immigrant. Do honourable members conceive that it would be possible to administer an Immigration Act for , inter alia, the exclusion of undesirables, if every person who knocked at the door and asked for admission had to be tried by a j u r y before his application could be refused^?",15
11,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,That is not the point.,17
12,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am showing that the basis of the Act is administration by the executive authority, which is entitled, by the law itself, to exclude prohibited i m migrants if they are known to be such at the time of their arrival. This Parliament deliberately adopted that law as the settled and determined policy of the country, and I submit that it was right in so doing.. A person who advocates the overthrow of any established Government in the King's Dominions is by the law of the land a prohibited immigrant. It is obvious that in the' specification of undesirable immigrants,, it is the character of the individuals which is aimed at. It is not always possible to discover at the moment.of an immigrant's arrival in the Commonwealth whether he is or is not disqualified on the grounds set out in the paragraph I have quoted. realizing the possibility of undesirables evading the law, and thereby getting a footing an. the Commonwealth before their characters are discovered, wisely enacted that if within a period of three years after aai - immigrant's arrival he proves himself or is found to be within the category of prohibited i m migrants he can .be deported. order that he should not be treated unf a i r l y , a clause was inserted providing that the Minister could not deport a man charged with being a prohibited i m m i grant u n t i l he had appointed a Board to adjudicate on the case, and the person charged had failed to appear before such Board and show cause, or the Board had recommended that he should be deported. In this case those conditions were f u l filled. The honourable member (Mr . Charlton) said that it is an unheard of . proceeding to have a law administered in this way; he said that it is a violation of the right to trial by jury . May I remind the honourable member exactly what that right is? It is conceded to a man who has committed an offence against the laws of the country in which he resides.",17
13,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Who is charged with having committed an offence.,17
14,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I accept the honourable member's correction. This is not such a case.,17
15,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,E v e n such a man has not always the right to t r i a l by jury .,17
16,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"No ; there are other methods of procedure in regard to even the more serious charges of breaches ' against the law of the land. We did not charge these persons with having committed an offence rendering them liable to be deprived of their property, or to suffer imprisonment for a term, or any extreme penalty.",17
17,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The State charged them with the commission of an offence, but you intervened and stopped those proceedings.",17
18,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Commonwealth did not stop the proceedings. I am dealing with the law under which we took action. I say that that law considers only the question whether a person is a desirable or an undesirable immigrant. If he is thought to be an undesirable immigrant, it is a matter for the Executive Authorit y to determine that fact, and deport him from Parliament, Australia. This law is not unknown to British communities or to countries in heriting British traditions. Canada passed an Immigration law in 1910. That was well before the outbreak of the war, so that it cannot be contended that that law was the result of war conditions. It provides that whenever any person other than a Canadian citizen, But in within three years of landing, has been convicted of a criminal offence in Canada, or enters or remains in Canada contrary to the Act, he shall be reported by the Immigration Officer to the Minister. Section 41 providesWhenever any person other than a Canadian citizen advocates in Canada the overthrow, by force or violence, of the Government of Great Britain or Canada, or other British Dominions, or the overthrow, by force or violence, of constituted law and authority, or the assassination of public officials, or shall by word or act create a riot or public disorder in Canada, or shall by common repute belong to or be suspected of belonging to any secret society which extorts money from or in any way attempts to control any resident of Canada' by force or threat of bodily harm, or by blackmail; such person shall be classed as an undesirable immigrant, and notice thereof be given to the Minister. - Section 42 provides that the . Minister may order any person alleged to be a prohibited or undesirable immigrant to be detained, and may order a - Board of Inquiry to investigate the complaint. If the Board is satisfied that the person is a prohibited or undesirable immigrant he may be deported forthwith, subject to an appeal to the Minister. The Board of Inquiry consists of three or more immigration officers, of whom the Immigration Officer in charge must be one. There is a further provision which reads as follows: Where any person has, within three years of landing, become an inmate of a gaol, the Minister for the Interior may issue a warrant authorizing him to be detained with a view to his deportation. Canada is a British community corresponding to our own which, prior to the war, acted in exactly the same way as we acted in 1920. Nobody can say that the Dominion of Canada is less British than Australia in its institutions and - in its care for the liberty of the subject. Executive provision relating to deportation may be found in the Undesirable Immigrants Exclusion Act of New Zealand. Under that Act, the Attorney General of New Zealand may order any person to leave the Commonwealth if that person is disaffected, disloyal, or liable to be a source of danger to the peace, order and good government of New Zealand. The South African Act also has provisions dealing with exclusion. The United States of America has a law exactly similar to the Australian Act, and in it provision is made, in addition, for the examination of immigrants by a Special Board of In quiry consisting of three immigration officers. Honourable members will see, therefore, that there is nothing novel in our law; it is similar to laws which have been passed by other British communities and by the United States of America. These laws are not deemed by those countries to be a violation of the liberty of the subject. The passage of our Act was perfectly justified. Act is brought into force by the Minister on the advice of a Board, in order that action may be taken promptly to exclude from Australia persons found here who are deemed to be undesirable. There is no necessity to discuss the ceedings that took place before the Board. A copy of the Board's finding has been laid upon the table of this House. The Board found that these men had advocated the overthrow by' force and violence of the established Government of a civilized country, to wit, the Irish Free State. Exception is taken to our intervention. The responsibility is thrown upon the Department of Home and Territories to administer this Act. The New South Wales Government, on its own initiative, took action under the Crimes Act, and charged these persons with sedition. The action of the State Government did not remove from the Commonwealth the obligation to take whatever action they felt wa3 necessary for the removal from Australia of undesirable immigrants.",17
19,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,It would have been decent to wait for the verdict of the ' State Court.,18
20,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Not necessarily. The object of our Act is to exclude undesirable persons from Australia. Immediately the Commonwealth Government are in a position to do ithis, it is their duty to take action. >So soon as we were in possession of evidence which showed that these men were undesirable under the provisions of the law, we deeme.d it to be our duty to take action. Action was taken independently of - the State. The men were charged before a perfectly impartial Board. Immediately - that Board was constituted, objection was taken to its constitutional authority. The constitutional issues were carried to the High Court of Australia. The attitude of the Commonwealth all through has been not to take any technical advantage, but to have the constitutional issue and the merits of the case decided according to law. The High Court of Australia affirmed the constitutional validity of the Act which we passed in 1920. The Board having made a rccom- mendation certifying to all the facts essential for the deportation of the persons concerned, it is the duty of the GoThe vernment to comply with the law.",18
21,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Why did you not send their cases before a Judge of the High Court?,18
22,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Because the High pro- Court has its own particular functions, and this was not one of them. The Board constituted to' deal with, the question' consisted of three persona, one being' an ex-magistrate} and the other two gentlemen' qualified, and experienced lawyers'. ^Extension of time granted.'] Mr MANN? - If the charge' of sedition had been sustained, would the Government have' had' authority to deport these men?",18
23,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"In the circumstances mentioned by the honourable member, the Government would have had' authority to act. A charge of sedition-, if proved, would not necessarily relieve the Government of theobligation to take action under the law which I have quoted against persons known to be undesirable immigrants. The Leader of the Opposition took the stand that because these men had been supplied wdiUhi passports"" by the. British Government, no action should haw© been taken against, themhere. Thepassports gave them authority to move within, the British Empire, but containedthe conditions that they were issued subject to the immigration regulations, of allparts of the Empire. ' Therefore, there was nothing to prevent the Government from pnoceeding in accordance with the Commonwealth immigration-, law. Mr Charlton. - That condition) is in. all. passports.",19
24,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It has been inserted for the purpose, of preserving the. rightsof* theDominions. I submit that our legislation is in accordance with precedent, and that our. action has been, dictated, by sound reason.. Australia. should, not be a. sanctuary for men. who advocate the overthrow o£ the Empires or of the established government of. any of itsDominions. We do not want in) the Commonwealth men, who do not believe in constituted authority' and who-, are prepared to go to any extreme to overthrow all forms of government. Mr BRENNAN.;-That is not so in this case.",19
25,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am not saying that it is; but the facts pitove conclusively that these men did come to Australia to advocate the overthrow of a society established by law in the Irish Pree . State. In the circumstances, the duty is upon the Government toadminister the law and to see that its provisions are carried) out:",19
26,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Darling) [8.4S.LThe speech made by the: Attorney General (Mr Groom.) is the essence of futility, and I amsatisfied that if the> numbers dividing the parties in thisHousewere closer the motion submitted 1 by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) would be carried this afternoon. The Attorney-General has not said anything to justify the action of the Government with regard to the gentlemen concerned. It is one of the most mysterious and sinister happenings in the Commonwealth during the past eight years, including' the wajr years, when heaven only knows-, we had enough hys<teria and' jingoism to satisfy everybody.",19
27,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Well , let us have no more of it. Mr BLAKELEY: - - Heaven forbid that we should continue to act in this extraordinary way.. These gentlemen came to Australia to delivera message tev the people of Australia. I ' am not concerned' in any way with their message. It would be presumption, on my part,, to attempt todogmatize on the Irish questionwhen the Irish people themselves are so much divided over it. What I amconcerned about is that this Government, should out-jingo the jingoes of Britain in their determination to keep this an. utterly loyal country. The Irish envoys were quite well-known in Great Britain, buttfh'eygpt their passports for Australia without the slightest trouble. Members of the British Government,, whatever their faults may be, are not, as a rul'e,, as* hysterical' as this* Government.. They recognised!,, no doubt, that the position of. affairsin Ireland' could not be altered!, and so passports were? issued fo these men, who' came to Australia.",19
28,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Perhaps ' they were glad to get' rid' of them.,19
29,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"They made, speeches' containing gross reflections on the British Parliament, and they were in Australia for a month orsix weeks before' any action was taken. I am not concerned at all with the nature, of their views, but I protest that persons who come here on passports issued by the British Government, should not be liable to be incarcerated, or' deported as undesirables. If this course cam. be upheld, it is quite possible that in due time, when some of my colleagues: from the British Labour, party come to Australia, the Commonwealth Government may deport them in the same manner. On the other side of the House there are honourable members who have committed enough sedition to justify their deportation a dozen times over, and I am: certain that, on this side, there is not one member who has not made seditious speeches. I defy any man to fight effectively on behalf of the working classes without being guilty of seditious utterances. The absurd Act ""under which the Irish envoys are to 'be deported was mot, as the Minister has said, passed in time of war, bub because the War Precautions Act was being repealed, and it was thought necessary to keep the jingoistic spirit in existence, so as to be ready for those who might come to this country, and by their speeches, attempt to disrupt the great British Empire. Section 8A of the Immigration Act of 1920 reads(1) Where the. Minister is satisfied, that, within three years after the arrival in Australia of a person who was not born in Australia, that person[a) has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable for prisonment for one y§ar or longerThesegentlemen have not been convicted of a criminal offence(6) isliving on the prostitution of othersThey are not in that category(c) has become an inmate of an insane asylum or public charitable institution. They cannot be punished under that paragraph. But so that no one might come to Australia who the Government think might undermine the might of the British Empire, this all-embracing provision was passed(d) If a person who advocates the throw by force, or violence of the established Government of the Commonwealth of of any State, . . . he may by notice in writing, summon the person to appear before a Board within the time and in the manner prescribed, to show cause why he should not be deported from the Commonwealth.. That isfoolish and ridiculous enough, Heaven only knows, but the section, goes further. It does not refer only to the Governments of the Commonwealth, New Zealand, Canada, or Great Britain-that iswide enough, but apDao-ently the Government think it too circumscribed-bu t it. covers iiny person who preaches the overthrow of any Government.",19
30,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,B y force.,20
31,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Yes , by force. The Commonwealth Government says, ""We are the protectors of a l i e n a tions, and if any personadvocates the overthrow of a capitalistic Government in, say, Japan, this Government under this law can deport such a person.""",20
32,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I think we might get into trouble if we did not act.,20
33,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The honourable member, no 'doubt, would act if he had the opportunity. If there were an insurrection in China, for instance,, and a delegation representing the workers of China came to Australia to lay their case before the people in the Commonwealth, he could under this law be deported. The whole Act is characteristic of those hysterical people who have been governingthe Commonwealth during the past six years. The accused persons, who have made twenty or t h i r t y speeches in Australia, have not caused a greater ripple in public opinion than would be caused by a pebble thrown into the sea at St. K i l d a ; but Governments aided, abetted im- and incited by certain organizations in this community have been led to believe that not only the British Empire and her Dominions, but the wholeof the civilized world is endangered. These organiza- ' tions-, have, therefore, used their force and influence to compel the Government to take action.",20
34,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Surely the New South Wales Government considered the position serious or they would not have taken action.,20
35,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The r e by hangs a tale, and I would like the Attorney General (Mr Groom) to state whether representations were made by the New over- South Wales Government to the Com- monwealth Government asking them to take action under the Immigration Act, and, if so, what those representations were. No sooner had the State Government taken action under their sedition law than the Commonwealth Government instituted proceedings under their I m m i gration Act. There are sufficient Commonwealth and State laws under which a person may' be tried for sedition. But these were thought insufficient to deal with these particular gentlemen, and the Commonwealth is therefore acting under the drag-net section which I have quoted, and is about to deport them from the Commonwealth. In a report in the Argus today of an application by the State Government for a further remand Mr Gale, the stipendiary magistrate, is made to say that he could understand, with other proceedings pending, why the remand had been asked for in previous in stances, but he considered the present request unreasonable. The report continues- ' Mr Kidston said that those other proceedings were still pending. The Commonwealth Ministry had coine to a conclusion which had been reported in the public press. Mr Windeyer denied that the proceedings were still pending. Mr Gale (heatedly) - Why should they use our State Court and procedure to give them time? I do not feel disposed to remand any 'longer. I have gone the limit. It is unreasonable to keep these defendants in custody any longer. I think it is for the Federal authorities to take action, and not for us to delay any longer. Even the stipendiary magistrate heated. These gentlemen were discharged into the hands of a policeman, who took them to a penitentiary. ing the trial by a biased Board, one of the accused-I am informed by an onlooker, not through the press-was assaulted, and when he asked for protection he did not receive the courtesy he was entitled to. It is a further flection upon the Commonwealth vernment if men charged with are allowed to be assaulted as this man was. The Attorney-General (Mr Groom) said that an impartial Board was appointed. God save us from impartiality of this kind! Of all the tive, biased, and prejudiced the community, I doubt whether it would be possible to secure three more conservative, biased, and prejudiced men than Mr Stinson, Mr Macfarlane, and Mr Manning. When one knows the beliefs of these men it is easy to realise that they had formed their opinions as soon as they were appointed. I followed the trial closely, and came to the conclusion that, irrespective of the defence that would be put up, the accused would be deported. That was the order. It is useless the Minister informing us that it was an impartial trial, because the whole thing was ""rigged"" and ""faked"" the two Governments concerned. earnestly pray that honourable on this side of the House, liberties are at stake, may never have to appear before such an Board. British justice! There is no Mr Blakeley. such thing under such a Board. I can only lodge my protest as I did when that hysterical, jingoistic piece of legislation was placed on our statute-book, and I always regret that such an Act remains, particularly when it is misused,'as it has been in this instance. The Government has not used it in the interests of the British Empire. The British Governmentshould at least be given some consideration, for it would not foolishly and hysterically endanger the peace of Great Britain and Ireland by taking such ridiculous action as the Commonwealth Government has taken. Mr F. FRANCIS (He n t y) [ 4 . 1 ] - I desire to congratulate the Government upon the action it has taken in connection with the deportation of men whose sole purpose and desire, it has been proved, was to overthrow all constitubecame tional forms of Government. I am sur4 eventually prised that any member of this House should blame the Government for trying Dur- to keep the pure air of Australia free from pollution by men whose sentiments lead them to desire the destruction not merely of Australia, but of the British Empire. They have had a fair and rea-, sonable trial, according to the forms of re- British justice. I regret that the powers Go- of the Commonwealth Government are sedition not even greater than they are. If the Government desired me to do it , I would .support action to compel every person to subscribe to the oath of allegiance before landing in Australia. I know that we conserva- have power to compel individuals to take men in that oath, but in some cases, such as the one under notice, disloyal people have partial, slipped into this country without the knowledge of the authorities. Some honourable members have - endeavoured to make capital of - the fact that these men were admitted to the Commonwealth on a British passport, but if after entering Australia men behave in a manner which undoubtedly proves that they are nob fit to continue as residents, the people ought not to be compelled to harbour them, either temporarily or permanently, merely because they hold a British passport. I congratulate the New South Wales Goby vernment on what it has done, and reI gret that action was not taken earlier. members The mass of the people of the Commonif their wealth have come to the conclusion that if the Commonwealth Government had impartial not acted' as it did, it would have violated the trust reposed in it . Both the hearts and the minds of the people have been impressed, and they are determined not to tolerate any Government that will sympathize with and assist the disastrous propaganda of rebels. I would not give support for one instant to a Government which would condone the action of memments bers of the Opposition in defending people who are not worthy subjects of the Empire.",20
36,Mr GABB,Unknown,"We are demanding trial by jury . Mr F . FRANCIS - The rebels have had trial by jury . The honourable memthe ber who has just spoken (Mr Blakeley) has charged the Government with being one-sided, but it is not one-sided. It is, however, determined to dispense justice and to stand for the unity of the Empire. It will not harbour in our midst men who are traitors and rebels to the country. Those-who were appointed to investigate the case were men of a high calibre, who had filled other responsible tions, and they came to the unanimous conclusion that these men were rebels traitors to the Empire. Australia, thereoccasion. fore, cannot retain them in this country. Members of the Opposition interjectme, ingMr F . FRANCIS - It is all very for members of the Opposition to say "" Hear, hear,"" and to talk of"" forming Republic in this country. They will not get very far with that kind, of paganda. The people of Australia are not within the bonds of the British E m pire, and that Empire, no matter what may be said by honourable members oppovote site, is the greatest Empire the world has ever seen. No Government that is true to its trust can permit Australia to be necessary. polluted with Sinn Feiners, rebels, traitors. I congratulate the Government, and I hope it will take steps to r i d AusWales. tralia of many more men of the calibre of these Irish envoys, who should be deported as soon as it is possible to make the sary arrangements. The people desire it , sible. and are behind the Government in the action taken, not because the Government envoys. is one-sided, but because it is national. The Government represents not any ticular section, sect, or colour in the munity, but the people as a whole. Other Governments, if they get the chance, do otherwise, but this Government must keep Australia free from the contaminamen tion of rebels and traitors! The people, of Australia will learn from this debate that there are men even in the Commonwealth Parliament who would harbour and foster in this country people who are not fit to live here. I hope the present Government will long continue to control the. affairs of the country, for its loyal sentihave found expression in the de^portation of men who are not fit to polluter, British the pure air of Australia.",22
37,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Angas) >[4.9] - Before the question is put I should like to make it clear that in voting against the Government I do not, in any way, father cause of the I r i sh Free State, or that of the opposing forces in Ireland. Thfe vote which I intend to give will be a vote in favour of t r i a l by jury . On many occasions in the last Parliament, wheu the war hysteria affected the people, I endeavoured to obtain justice for men who had been in Australia, not merely for a few weeks, but for many years, and posiwho had been deported without a trial by jury . I took that stand then and I am and in duty bound to adhere to it on this Whether a person who .wishes* to enter this country, is of Irish, German, English, or other origin is of no matter to providing he is of the white race. The Irish envoys should have been given a trial well by jury , upon which is based the whole edifice of the British system of justice. a The honourable member for Henty (Mr . F.

An y - honourable member who has been returned to this House largely on a sectarian must, at all costs, cultivate that vote in order to retain it . Such action, despicable though it be, is absolutely These gentlemen spoke inand Victoria, and very little comment was made.

If one can gauge the honourable member's mentality by his remarks, the electors of the Henty district must feel dissatisfied with their selection .of him in preference to men of the calibre of Mr Boyd and Mr Gullett, who are both - capable men. This honourable merriber, in one ""breath, congratulates the Government for a - eertairn action, and, in hjis ""next) ""breath, congratulates another Government for doing 'practically the opposite.

REL3EY (Got*) £4.14] - I renter my protest >against - the proposed action of the 'Commonwealth Government to deport .the Irish .envoys.' These men, no matter from what country ithey .come, should have t r i al by jury before being deponted. The Attorney-General pointed out that in .South A f r i ca and Canada, provision .was - made under the .immigration laws for .the creation of a ispeeial Board consisting of three immi-gration officers. The Commonwealth Government are now acting on the finding of-.a Board consisting,, not of three Government officials or three gration .officials, - but of three .distinct partisans. The Board comprised Mr . MCFarlane, a magistrate who has received from the Government quite a number of commissions to proceed on fishing excursions, to try to ferret out evidence of the alleged maladministration of the late Labour Government; Stdnson, who is actively connected with the K in g and Empire Alliance; and Mr Manning, who is a prominent Tory. How could any one expect these three - men to arrive at a fair and impartial finding, knowing their past activities and associations with the Government? the - Government had created a Board consisting of three members of the judiciary, one might have expected a fair and honourable finding fro m them. from the creation and the - personnel of the Board, these Irish envoys should have been a/forded the opportunity of trial by j u r y . I raise my voice at all times in protest against any person being deprived of liberty. I have been actively associated with a movement to bring about the amendment of the law of New South Wales- - concerning lunacy laws. many cases persons have been incarcerated in asylums without being given the protection .of .a proper ioaquiry. The cases have been submitted to a magistrate, and on his finding, together with the certificates <of two medical practitioneus or two justices of the peace, persons have been committed to mental hospitals tEor life. I am opposed to the present practice in New South Wales of oonsigning persons to mental asylums without trial by j u r y , and I am also opposed to the decision of the Government to deport these - two Irish envoys without affording them at r i a l or by jury . They were charged with being connected with seditious .enterprises,, and, before being deported from the Commonwealth, their case should be submitted to a jury to ascertain - whether they were actually engaged in a seditious enterprise or not. It is said that it is a matter for the Commonwealth 'Government to see that the laws of the country are put into effect; but to illustrate to honourable'members how easy it would be for one of these gentlemen to fee found guilty of being engaged in a seditious - enterprise, I refer, them to a section of the War Precautions Repeal Act, which contains a number of provisions quite as hysterical as those of the Commonwealth Immigration Act immi- passed in 1920. According to that section , it is a seditious action to promote ill-will and hostility between Hi s Majesty's subjects so as to endanger the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth. I submit that every honourable member of this House has committed sedition at one time or another. Mr Mr Stinson, a member"" of the Board, is associated with the K i ng and Empire All i ance, which organization undoubtedly .creates strife and dissension among His Majesty's subjects. No honourable member could put forward his views on the platform without bringing himself within the If provisions of this reactionary law. I hope the - Government will reconsider their decision and give these men an opportunity of appearing before a jury to show that Apart they are not engaged in a seditious enterprise.",22

If these statistics are of any value in £140,382 csffimating future'costs and the possibilities of expanding our export trade, What does he estimate our added cost - per lb. will be five years hence? 5. Is he satisfied with the efforts - of his to promote this export trade; if not, in view of the large - areas recently planted and the great number of returned soldiers in duced to embark - in the fruit-growing in dustry, what does - he propose to do in order to enable this industry to be made remunerative to the grower? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information:1. Yes; but the. added value by manufacturing (as quoted) includes the cost of manufacturing pickles, .sauces, and vinegar. 2. The increase in added values of jams and canned fruit s is due to great increases in the cost of t in plate, sugar, cases, labels, and other materials; also to' the - higher wages paid pursuant to the awards made by the industrial tribunals. 3. 1916 - Approximately , 1.6d. per lb. 1917 - Approximately , 1.7d. per lb. 191819 - Approximately , 1.8d. per lb. 191920 - Approximatel y 2.4d. per lb. 192021 - Approximately , 3.4d. per lb. 192122 - Approximately , 3.1d. per lb. 4. The costs of manufacture have fallen since 1921-22 oiwing to the lower prices now prevailing for the materials already referred to. Tho Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration is at present dealing with a claim made by fruit-growers for a decrease in the wages at present paid. It is reasonable to conclude that costs will further decrease during the next five years. 5. Having regard to the circumstances of the jam and preserved fruits industry, the Department of Trade and Customs is doing everything possible to promote this export trade by exercising - a rigid supervision over manufacturing operations, and by insisting on improved methods of grading and packing in connection with all jams and preserved fruits exported. The Australian Fruit Council and the State Advisory Fruit Boards are endeavouring to bring about a. reduction in the cost of manufacture, with a view to enabling comJ ietition to be met in overseas markets without oss to the fruit-grower. WAR GRATUITIES. - Dr EARLE PAGE - On the 21st June the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E . Riley) asked the following questions:1. What is the number of war gratuities still uncashed by the Commonwealth Government, and what is the total amount of same? 2. What was the amount of interest paid last year in connection with the above war gratuities ? 3. How many officers are employed in connection with ' the administration of war gratuities, and what were the total salaries paid to them? 4. What is the total rental being paid for premises occupied by the above staff throughout the Commonwealth? I said that this information was being obtained, and would be supplied as soon as possible, and am now able to supply the information required, which is as follows :1. At 31st MAV, 1923, the number of war gratuity bonds uncashed was 125,587, totalling £13,656,004. Of these, 92,306 bonds of the value of £0,505,482, were owned by ex-members of the Forces and by relatives and. dependants, whilst 33,281 bonds ""of the value of £7,060,522, were owned by banks, life assurance companies, employers, traders, and others, who cashed the bonds for the original owners 2. £906,514. 3.

65,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.40] -{B y leave) - Severa l questions have been asked in this House recently as to whether the Government propose to take any action with regard , to the coming wheat crop in Australia. To these questions I have replied that the Government were giving the matter consideration. A f t e r the very fullest investigation of the position, the Government have decided to participate again this year in the financial arrangements connected with the forthcoming wheat harvest. The assistance will be by way of guarantee through the Commonwealth Bank in the manner employed last year. The basis of the guarantee will be the same also as that of last year, namely, -3s. per bushel at the siding and 8d. per bushel to cover freight and handling charges. The Government have given a great deal of consideration to this question, because they are certain that it is not in the best interests of the primary producers, or indeed of any class in this country, that they should look to the Government for financial assistance in the marketing and handling of their products - But, bearing in mind the adverse climatic conditions to which many parts of Australia, and particularly New South Wales, have been subjected for some considerable time past, we have fel t that we should give those engaged in the wheat industry a further opportunity to make arrangements for the handling and marketing of their harvest without governmental assistance. For that reason, we propose to continue the wheat guarantee for another year, but in doing so we wish to make it very clear to those engaged in this industry that we are giving them an opportunity to make their own arrangements, and we hope that before the next harvest they will have put their industry on a basis - which will enable that to be done. The Commonwealth Bank will take the necessary action, and the Government will stand behind the Bank and guarantee an amount of 3s. 8d. per bushel. We have asked the Commonwealth B'ank to take steps to get into touch with the States, and ascertain whether they desire to participate in the guarantee. As soon as replies have been received, an agreement will be prepared giving effect to the proposed guarantee. That agreement will be submitted to this House, when honourable members will have an ample opportunity of expressing their opinions in regard to it . DEFENCE BILL. Motion (by Mr BOWDEN) proposed - That he have leave to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the Defence Act 1903-1918.",29
66,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Dalley) [4.4.8] - I do not like to interfere with Ministers who are asking leave to introduce Bills, but I think the Minister for Defence (Mr . Bowden) should give the House some in formation in regard to the Bill which he desires to introduce. Bills are being in troduced without any explanation whatever.",30
67,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"This is being done in order thab the Bills may be distributed to honourable members, so that they may. have time to consider them.",30
68,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"The Minister for Defence has just moved for leave to in troduce a measure dealing with the defence of Australia. I consider this such a very serious and vital question that the Minister should take advantage of the earliest opportunity to explain to the House in some way how he proposes to amend the existing Act. He should give us some broad outline, at least, of what the Government's proposals are. I have it in mind that it is the intention of the Government to make some very drastic alterations of the Defence Act. I fear that they are endeavouring to introduce conscription into Australia again, and I wish to take advantage of every opportunity to oppose anything of the kind.",30

COLEMAN (Reid) [ 4 . 5 3 ] - I am at a loss to understand why the Government have not seen f it to introduce at this stage, as a matter , of urgency, a measure to amend the Invali d and Old-age Pensions Act.",30
72,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The introduction of an Invali d and Old-age Pensions Bill cannot be discussed at this stage.,30
73,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Dalley) [4.53] - The Government are evidently asking for leave to bring in a B i U to remit the Excise duty on beer. It is lamentable if they should seek to do this at a time when there are many evils in our midst crying out for redress. iSurely beer could stand over for a little while. As the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) has just said, the Minister would have been better employed in asking for leave to bring in a Bill to increase invalid and old-age pensions. I hope the Government will accept what honourable members are saying as an intimation that they are expected to come down tomorrow with' a Bill having that purpose in view. Mv. BLAKELEY (Darling) [ 4 . 5 4 ] - The Government are asking leave to in troduce Bills dealing with the Beer Excise Act, the Customs Act, the Distillation Act, the Spirits Act, and last, but not least, with the protection of the Boy Scouts' Association-wit h everything under the sun but one matter upon which we cannot get information. Questions submitted in regard to the increasing of invalid and old-age pensions are met with supercilious smiles, and the unsatisfactory reply, "" W a it a while."" Before proceeding to afford protection to the Boy Scouts' Association, or looking after the wines, beers, and spirits of this country, we should have some declaration from the Minister that he will bring in. be a measure that will give the House an opportunity of increasing the pensions for the aged people of Australia! already Mr ANSTEY (Bourke) [4.55] - If honourable members regard some other question as being more important"" than beer and spirits-if , for instance, they think that the matter of increasing in valid and) old-age pensionsshould take precedence over the - Excise duty onbeer and spirits-it should be quite in order for some one to move an amendment to that effect.

78,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper-Trea surer) [ 5 . 9 ] - I move That there be granted to HisMajesty for or towards defraying the services for the year endingshe 30th June, 1924, a sum not exceeding £4,154,085. The. A u d it Act provides that all grants made, by Parliament for ordinary services, bub not including' grants made in respect of special or loan appropriations or' trust ' "" funds,, such as old-age* pensions and war pensions, shall' lapse at. the. end' of the financial year; but as it is essential that the ordinary services shall 1 continue^ ib is necessary that Parliament shall, vote moneytowards defraying their cost* This measureprovides for two months' Supply for those services. Before that period has expired I hope to afford the Committee the opportunity ofdiscussiug the Budget for the ensuing year.. hope to bring down the. Budget before the encl of July, first of all' in order to give honourable, members the most ample opportunity for discussing it during the remain1 ing part of thesession, and secondly, to give the public the earliest possible opport u n it y of knowing what is the financial position of the Commonwealth, and' what are the financial proposals of the Government The sum for which we are asking under this Bill is £4,154,085 . Included in that amount is a provision of £300,000 for refunds of revenue, and £1,000,000 for advance to the Treasurer; leaving for ordinary departmental expenditure and war services payable out of revenue a sum of £2,854,085. Those figures have been AND GERMAN based upon the Estimates for the current year, which were approved by. Parliament; they do not contain any new items. The estimated departmental expenditure and War Services payable from revenue for 1922-23 amounted to £17,967,000. 1 One-sixth of that sum would be LAND £2„994,000 ; but we are asking the ComIM- mittee to approve of the expenditure of only £2,854j000, despite the fact that during the next two months five pay days will occur, and there really is necessity for greater provision than one-sixth of the annual appropriation. The sum of £300,000 is being set apart for refunds of direct taxes which have to be made by INTRODUCTION OF the Taxation Office. The provision in cludes considerable arrears which will be carried forward to 30th June, 1923. Regarding the advance to the Treasurer of £1,000,000, it has been customary to provide for all works actually in progress at 30th June"" as well as to meet expenditure of - a recurring nature on new works pending the passage of a Works Bill , which will be brought down immediately the Budget speech has been delivered. In following this practice we are asking for a lesser amount than is usually asked for , judging by the monthly statements of previous years. TheCommittee will not be consenting to any new commitments, because none are contemplated in that provision of £1,000,000. Until the Treasury books have been closed, at the end of the year, it will be impossible to give - a statement setting out the exact position of the Commonwealth. I hope to I lay before Parliament, on 4th July, a statement showing the approximate revenue and expenditure for the present year. All I am able to do at present is to indicate, from the figures that are available, that the surplus of £6,408,000 which was carried forward into the year 1922-23 not only will remain untouched, but will be substantially augmented' by the excess of revenue over expenditure during the current year.",32
79,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [5.15] It is pleasing to hear from the new Treasurer that he anticipates bringing down his Budget by the end of July. I hope that his expectation will be fulfilled , as it is absolutely necessary that - we should have that Budget before us as early as possible, in view of the declaration of the Government that this House shall rise early in August. It is obvious that, if we are to give full consideration to the Budget, we must have some time in which to discuss it . There should be an interval of at least one week, after the statement has been made by the Treasurer, before wo are called upon to deal with it . That will bring us to within a week or a fortnight of the closing of this House. I am at a loss to understand how we shall be able, in a couple of weeks, to deal intelligently with the Budget and the Estimates, quite apart from other legislation.",33
80,Mr COOK,Unknown,"If we maintain the speed we set this afternoon, we shall do it .",33
81,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I quite agree with the honourable member, if he refers to the speed at which Bills were introduced. If the Government xise the closure to put through those measures in an ill-digested form, theirs will be the responsibility; we on this side will not worry, because our consciences will be clear when we have to answer to the people for our actions. I wish to draw the attention of the Treasurer to the loan which was issued recently for the purpose of giving depositors the right to convert £38,700,000.",33
82,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Has it succeeded?,33
83,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I . do not know. Will the Treasurer make a statement in forming lis of the amount which has been converted ?,33
84,Dr EABLEPAGE,Unknown,I hope to be in a position to make a statement this week.,33
85,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It is evident that, investor. the whole amount will not be »converted. The Treasurer must anticipate a similar reception for other such loans. During the war, very many people invested in subscribed ? the loans, because they thought it was their duty to assist their country at a time. Many of them could ill afford do it .",33
86,Mr GABB,Unknown,"They were afraid of comnow pulsion, too.",33
87,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"In many cases the contribution was compulsory, because persons were told by their employers that they had to take up a certain amount. Assistance was rendered them to enable them to do so. That class of depositor ft requires his or her money, and conversion will not take place in such cases, so that a considerable sum will have to be raised in some other manner. My objection to the loan is that it is not short-dated. I cannot understand why the honourable gentleman and his Government decided upon a period of twenty-five years; I be- . lieve, too, without the option of paying it off earlier. They made it'a long-dated loan in face of the fact that the interest rate is falling in every part of the world ; and if we are to be guided by expert opinion, it is likely to fall considerably within the next two or three years. I believe that the honourable gentleman himself is credited in some papers with having made the statement that in three years the interest rate will be about 4-J per cent. Another statement, which he was credited with having niade, is that in about seven years the rate will be 4 per cent. How, then, can - the Government justify the issuing of this loan at 5 per ceut. free of State income tax, and carrying a bonus of £ 1 for every £ 1 0 0 converted ? It does not bear out their contention that they are exercising the strictest economy. It is evident that this country is going to be made pay considerably more than it should. If it were possible to convert the whole of the £38,700,000, by giving a bonus of £ 1 for every £ 1 0 0 we would lose about £387,000. A little while back I read that New Zealand had converted, in England, a loan amounting to some millions, at 4 per cent. Surely, then, the ' Commonwealth can convert at a cheaper rate than 5 per cent. ! Not only has the rcte of interest for the conversion' loan been fixed at 5 per cent., but it is to be free of income tax as well, and this willmean, probably, an additional £ per cent, to the",33
88,Mr WHITSITT,Unknown,"If the loan is such a good investment, why is it not over",33
89,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Because , I presuch sume, many people who, during the war, to thought it their duty, from patriotic motives, to invest in loans, cannot afford to have their money tied up for another twenty-fiveyears. Therefore, the terms are likely to be attractive only to wealthy people who, in addition to getting a high rate of interest for another twenty-five years, will also get probably another £ 1 for every £100 converted, and this will represent a large sum of money.",33
90,Mr WHITSITT,Unknown,"But may not holders of stock dispose of it? Mr Charlton"" - They are doing that every day through the stock exchanges.",34
91,Mr MANN,Unknown,"That being so, it cannot be said (hat small investors would have their money .locked up for another twenty-five years.",34
92,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"There . is nothing to prevent holders from selling on the open market; but my point is that if the rate of interest is likely to fall in the future we have no right to offer such anattractive investment for such a . long period. It is claimed by stock exchange authorities that if the rate of interest drops to 4-^ per cent, this conversion loan stock will sell for £107, and that if it drops to 4 per cent, the stock will command £115 in the open market, so it will bo possible for "" jobbers"" to make considerable sums of money out of these transactions. Interest rates have fallen i:i Great Britain and America already, and it is being urged in respect of this conversion loan that investors would be well advised to convert, because, in the near future, interest rates Avill be lower than at present. I submit, that, in view of the probabilities, the terms are not wise, and that we should use every endeavour to get our money as cheaply as possible.",34
93,Mr COSSEB,Unknown,"Can you say if many investors have availed themselves of the terms for conversion ? Mr ""WEST - U p to the present only £21,000,000 has been taken up; over £11,000,000 has not been converted.",34
94,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"-At present no one can say what amount has been converted. We shall not know until the Treasurer has made his statement. If money is likely to be cheaper within the next six or seven years, those investors who convert their stock will be on a very good wicket indeed. The terms are not in the best interests of the Commonwealth. During the war no loans were issued for a period extending beyond ten years. Why have the Government, at this late hour, and when interest rates are likely to fall, issued such a long-dated loan? should we be asked to pay away £387,000 of the Commonwealth money to induce people to convert their holding in a war loan ? .. We cannot afford to pay away large sums of money in this way simply because our revenue is buoyant. Every one knows that it is not likely to bo buoyant in the future, because our principal source of income is the Customs duties, and it is the business of this Parliament to see that exorbitant revenue is not derived from that source. There is no justification whatever for this long-dated loan. It should have been short dated, so that we could take advantage of any favourable trend in market rates of near interest, and. in that way save a considerable amount of money. We are paying interest on about £416,000,000, so we should be as careful as possible to get the capital sums as cheaply as possible. Another matter to which I desire to refer is the action taken by Mr. Deputy President Webb in the Arbitration Court recently. I am reluctant to mention it, but I believe it is only right that I should do so especially as I have been appealed to by very many trade unionists on the subject. It will be remembered that in January last an award was given in connection with an action taken by the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners against the Victorian Government, Anthony, and others. The essential principle of arbitration is that the parties to it shall observe the award, otherwise they will be in contempt. That is the position in which the Victorian Government stands in connection with the award I mention, but, notwithstanding this, Mr Deputy President Webb permitted them; to approach the Court. In this way there was unfair discrimination, because recently the Australian Workers Union, which failedto give effect to an award, were not permitted to be heard, and certain officers of the union were fined heavily. It is not fair for the Judge in one case to",34
95,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Mr Bamford) Order! The honourable member must not reflect upon a Judge of the Arbitration Court.,34
96,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I submit, Mr. Chairman, that I am not reflecting on the Why Judge personally. What I say is, I believe, fair comment. I always endeavour to 'be as careful as possible when dealing with a matter like .this, and to avoid saying anything against those gentlemen who - comprise our Judiciary. But, if I may be permitted to say so, I think it is very unfair to discriminate between parties to an award. I do not want to say anything ' that can be regarded as a personal reflection upon a Judge. Mr Deputy President Webb may be a very able man,' but I protest that, especially in view of the attitude of the Court towards the Australian Workers Union, when State instrumentalities are involved and when the ""State Government as one of the parties to an award are defying the Court, they should not be permitted to approach it in respect of any phase of the award. - could quote exactly what took place, but I do not think it necessary to do so, and I do not wish to occupy the time of the Committee unduly. Discriminating action by any Court cannot be permitted without reference being made to it. Mr. Deputy President Webb may have been perfectly right in his view, and likewise I am right, if 1 think that what has been done is not in the best interests of Australia, to say so in this House. He may be able to explain - what guided him, in coming to his decision in a way which may be quite satisfactory; but on the facts available, it is necessary that the position should be ventilated here. In briefly referring to the question of immigration, I wish to quote statements which have - appeared in the press during Ihe last day or two. I hope that honourable members will not think that I am advocating immigration while there are - so many unemployed in Australia. I am not - doing 'anything of the kind. But if the Government intend to adhere to their policy of bringing large numbers of migrants to Australia, no exception should be made in regard to people residing in any part of the British Empire. Ma-. Edgar, M.L.C., of Victoria, has, during a visit to Great Britain, found that the position is very unsatisfactory. A newspaper report statesDuring his stay in Belfast, he had several interviews with members of the Northern Government with reference to the refusal of the Commonwealth to accept Irish migrants. The Ministry supplied him with copies of the - correspondence, from which it appeared that Ulster Jiad represented 'to the Colonial Office that the 3irish .were being rejected. The Colonial Office Mr Charlton-. replied that, under the Overseas Settlement Act, the .Irish were equally eligible with the British. Interviews followed with Sir William Windham and Mr J. T. Barnes, Commonwealth Migration Officer, who stated that the Coinmoniwealbh had .definitely instructed him to refuse Irish applicants owing to the disturbed conditions in Ireland. Ulster had' represented that Northern Ireland was .completely quiet and normal, and that, .unlike Southern Ireland, Ulster remained a part - of the United Kingdom.

I It is reported later in the same paragraph that the migration authorities have agreed to withdraw the circular hitherto in use, which stated that they were recruiting persons only from Great Britain. There is a clear statement that persons residing in Ireland were ineligible as .emigrants; but the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) denies this .most emphatically in these - wordsThere is absolutely no truth in the statement that we are refusing Irish migrants. I .thought that we - were collecting migrants in the British Isles. There haa been no discrimination, nothing of the sort having ever .been thought of. I shall certainly inquire into the statements contained in the cable message. The Prime Minister's statement was published in the Argus - of yesterday, but in the Melbourne Herald of the same day the report of an .interview with Mr. Edgar, M.L/C., iconcludes with this paragraphMr M. L. Shepherd, official secretary for the Commonwealth in London, .asserts that the inhabitants of - Northern Ireland are on exactly the same basis regarding emigration as any other Britons, though as yet there is no organized recruiting agency on the spot. Suitable applicants - are - considered on their merits. Emigrants from the south .of Ireland are still under an embargo. Notwithstanding the definite statement of the Prime Minister that there is absolutely .no restriction - on persons desiring to - migrate, the secretary to the High Commissioner in London says that emigrants from the south of Ireland are still under an embargo. Which statement is correct? I am not supporting emigration, for the reasons - mentioned, but if we are to adhere to our present policy we should mete out evenhanded justice >to every one, and in selectprinciple, ing emigrants for rural pursuits consideramonwealth tion should be .shown to suitable applithough cants from the southern portion of Ireyear's land, many of whom have spent all their effect, lives on the land. Why should an emof, bargo be placed on people coming f rom the south of Ireland? Apparently someremaining thing is wrong, and I trust the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) will give early attention to the facts I have brought before him.",34
97,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Is the Leader of Opposition sure that an embargo is placed upon these people? Mr Charlton ' - It is definitely stated in the report - of an interview with themselves. Mr Shepherd that emigrants from the south of Ireland are still under an b a r ^ although the Prime Minister stated that such is not the case.,36

Yet were we are told that legislation must be Goforced through, by means of the closure, of in seven weeks. That can only 'be done big by not giving proper consideration to the measures. Members of the Opposition will seize every opportunity to make their position clear to the people of Australia so that, if any wrong is done, the Government will have to take the full responsibility. The Opposition will not be to blame if unsatisfactory measures are forced through without proper discussion. There will be the Budget to consider in a month's time, and the Estimates, which will carry us on to J u ly of next year, to pass. It is time members of the House pub on their considering caps and asked themselves whether they ought toj allow legislation to be passed in this manner. Supporters of the Government should ask themselves whether they do not owe a duty to their constituents, as well as to the Government. It is their responsibility, just as it is ours, to inquire into these matters, and not to accept blindly whatever the Government puts forward. I hope honourable members will see .the wisdom of bringing pressure to bear upon the Government to induce it to give more time for the consideration of measures to be submitted.",36
104,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"Lilley) [5.43] - As a member of this National Parliament, I am pleased to see that the two sections forming the Government are working together in harmony, and I hope the continued association of Ministers will rapidly bring about a more complete amalgamation of the two parties on this side of the Chamber. A useful programme of legislation is to be found in the Governor General's Speech, and if the policy of the Government proves acceptable to the two sections of their supporters, a closer unity should clearly be possible. In my opinion, there is no room for more than two parties in the political life of Australia. As the Labour party has definitely embraced the Red objective, and while there remains the possibility of the workers being misled by the promise of a heaven upon earth, I think minor differences of opinion on this side of the House might easily be set aside in the endeavour to open the eyes of the electors to the true position. The proposal to abolish dual income taxation has been given much prominence in the newspapers of the different States. Personally, I have yet to be convinced that the proposals of the Government will result in the reduction of taxation. Representatives of the States appear to be under the impression that with the loss of the per capita payments, and the interest on transferred properties, in creased taxation will be necessary. Possibly the Treasurer may be able to tell the House why no mention has been made of certain loans which were issued free of taxation so far as the - States were concerned. Many investors are very anxious to learn whether the contract made with them will be kept, or whether the Commonwealth will make some arrangement with the States. I hope that on this and other important matters more information will be made available when the particular proposals are brought before the House. Like many other honourable members, I have received a number of letters from the employees of the Taxation Department. They suggest that some scheme of compensation similar to that arranged for the employees of the Defence Department should be applied to them. It is quite apparent that not more than one-third of the present employees of the Department will be taken over by the States, and, undoubtedly, many cases of hardship will result. This is one of the problems which the Government must take into consideration. Probably the most important problem with which the Government has to deal at the present moment is that of immigration. This question has been debated from many platforms, and in every Parliament, for many years past. We are all familiar with the arguments. We are told that Australia abounds in empty spaces, arfd that there are 1,000,000,000 coloured people near us crying out for elbow room. It is a fact that u n t i l recently the immigration policy of Australia consisted in collecting the city workers of London, dumping them down in the capital cities of Australia, and leaving them to shift for themselves.",37
105,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"That policy has not undergone much change. ' Mr MACKAY - I am inclined to think that some improvement has been made; but I hold that, in the future, the Government must make better arrangements in Australia than they have made hitherto. The time has arrived for doing big.things in Australia. The bringing of carefully-selected men, women, and children to this country will do much to solve the important problem of defence. I would rather spend' money in schemes of water conservation and land settlement than in the purchase of guns and the building of warships, which so soon become obsolete. It ought to be clear to all thinking people that we should aim at getting 20,000,000 people in this country before talking seriously of spending money on guns and ships for the purpose of defending long reaches of coastline, which at the present time have not a single inhabitant. Can we claim that our soldier land settlement has been successful ? painfully true that we have had a large number of very exj>ensive failures. Everybody will admit that the successful farmer can only be reared on the land, not J n the city. It is too much to expect men to become successful farmers who, before the war, were working in factories, behind counters, or in offices. Those who are being brought from overseas will bo handicapped to an even greater extent. From the experience gained in connection with soldier land settlement, we should endeavour to establish training farms, and expect every applicant for land to put in a period of training on one of them, so that his suitability can bo determined before we supply him with money or laud. Wo must improve our methods of farming. The general opinion is that the dairying industry has been successful, but the average yield per dairy cow in Australia is less than it is in New Zealand, and about half of that in Denmark. Our frui t industry is very indifferently carried on. Tho London cables recently notified the sale of 45,000 cases of tinned f r u it , and the rejection, of a similar number of cases because of inferior grading and packing. ' These matters require very careful investigation, so thab increased land settlement will not result in huge disappointment and very heavy financial loss. If the policy to promote production is to be successful, the industrial unions of Australia must assist in the scheme to bring migrants here to take part in the development of our secondary industries. Whilo the Labour party refuse to assist this branch of national development, it will be difficult to formulate a successful scheme. I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) for his promptitude officially visiting each of the States, I hope he will fulfil his promise to visit the coastal districts of Northern Queensland. He can then form an estimate of the possibilities of successful development of those splendid tracts of agricultural land. If it were possible for the people of the southern States to visit the sugar' districts of Queensland, the growers there would not need to ask a second time for effective protection for their industry. The visitors would see for themselves what sugar production has done for both the State of Queensland and the Commonwealth."" When in Queensland, the Prime Minister made the statement. It is that the Government would not discriminate between town and country or State and State. If the Prime Minister maintains that attitude, and is bold enough to brave the criticism of the southern States, he will give to the sugar industry the measure of protection to which it is justly entitled.",37
106,Mr FORDE,Unknown,What is the attitude of the honourable member to the proposals of the Government?,38
107,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"The proposals of the Government concerning the sugar industry are not worthy of a moment's consideration. The continuance of the existing embargo on black-grown sugar for a f u r ther period of two years is, at most, but an insurance to the Government against the loss of £280,000. Speaking in the Brisbane Exhibition H all recently, on the sugar question, the Prime Minister saidIn formulating its plans the Commonwealth Government have been faced with two important circumstances', which unavoidably dominated the situation: First, that there will be in Australia at the end of 30th June, 57,500 tons of Government sugar; second, that sugar alone of our primary industries has no outside market whereby this surplus could be sold by virtue of the fact that all com-, peting sugar is produced by black labour, which is paid wages far below the standard prevailing in Australia. This dilemma can be escaped by the Commonwealth Government selling its surplus abroad, but that course would involve a loss of probably £0 or £7 per ton on 49,000 tons (the excess carry-over), equivalent to from £240,000 to £280,000. A fte r stating that the surplus was a direct result of the greatly-increased acreage and production brought about by the sugar agreement, the Prime Minister addedUnder, the circumstances the Commonwealth in Government will continue the existing emand bargo on black-grown sugar for a period of two yoa<rs. sub-jfict tO' the following tions, u-It ' is to be distinctly understood under no circumstances will the embargo lie continued after 30th June, 1925. In view of those statements, what is the use of. pretending that the. sugar proposals of the Government are intended to assist the industry? To the cane-grower they mean simply nothing. Since the early iritearjeetion. days of Federation the sugar-growers have been asking for security of conditions. If the Government, were nitely decided against it . to increase the import duty, then the Government proposal of two years? embargo against, black-grown sugar might be immediutely scrapped. Mar.

There are Tpxosperous nasal communities an North Queensland, and a (number of - large towns, .and at is the clear duty of the Commonwealth to regard ihe sugar industry as .a national one, 'and to endeavour to retain the population there. Instead of doing that, it appears to me that the 'Government have .shaped their policy with a view io meeting the ""-wishes of those who «otctend ithat the industry has been pampered and spoon-fed. The honourable, member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) - stated a few evenings ago that concessions had been made to <Queensland. Considering what the sugar industry has done for Amstr-alia compared with what the Commonwealth has done foT the industry, lone is forced to the oonc'lusirjii that those engaged in it are entitled to much better treatment than they have so far received. It is not - often that I have the pleasure of quoting from - the daily - newspapers of Melbourne in favour of this industry, but I was particularly glad to notice the following comments &n .a leading column of the Melbourne Argus, of 7th June lastI t .is time that the sugar question was settled on some sure foundation. l i is politically - dangerous that it should remain as an issue which - cements a-ll the members from one State into a solid party regardless of all other political considerations'. For that reason, if for no (other, it would, have been advisable to fix a duty now, and to have done with it. I hope that even yet the Government may act on that adsdee. The view of the Argus is corroborated somewhat by the following statement in one of the leading columns - of the Melbourne Age of the same date:""The ""sugar industry is entitled to effective protection at the Customs-protectio n sufficient to enable the product of "" White Australia "" to compete in the home market with the product of black labour abroad. ' Critics in the southern States pretend to encourage the industry when sugar prices outside Australia are high, but the industry needs a duty that will give the growers sufficient protection - when prices - abroad are low, because when prices are high the growers can take care of fthemselyes. The Prime Minister { Mr Bruce) cannot think that Queensland has sufficient protection at present, of else he would not consider the proposed embargo for two years necessary to enable 'him to dispose of the stocks of sugar at present on hand. The people of Queensland sire anxious to know whether their two representatives in the Cabinet were consulted when the Government's proposals were recently announced. I cannot imagine that the Attorney-Creneral (Mr 'Groom) or Senator Crawford agreed to the suggested conditions, and the electors in my State are asking whether these. Ministers will - quietly submit to such an important matter being dealt with in the manner indicated. The industry does not - ask to be pampered, but it desires the settlement of conditions over a period of years. Owing to interferences in the past, the - mill proprietors have felt unableto make extensive alterations or add to their plant, because they have been quite at a loss to know what to expect in the course of twelve or eighteen months. The 'sugar crop takes at least eighteen months to mature, and the suggested embargo of two years is practically of no use to the industry. It is quite possible that the growers, realizing that they have little option in $ie matter, will accept the Government's proposal. Without an embargo or an increased import duty, the industry would soon become a thing of the past. People in the southern States should ""not ithink that the Queenslanders are 'only humbugging them when they talk of the importance of keeping Australia white by stabilizing the - sugar industry in North Queensland ",39
118,Mr BAWLEY,Unknown,The Minister for Customs has ashed ¥OT leave to introduce a Bill relaitiaag to Customs matters. Possibly it is his intention to have the duty on sugar - increased.,40
119,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"If that were so, it would be v«ry pleasing news. If the - Government increaseel the duty to £14 per ton the growers would be satisfied. I hope - that the Government will reconsider their proposals, and that the growers will receive better treatment than has been meted out to them in past years  am glad to have the assurance of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) that both parties on the Government side are now one. It is evident, in view of the proposals of the Government - on the sugar question - and on other questions appertaining to the welfare of the man on - the land, that the Country party has been swallowed completely. It has no ' ' punch "" in the present Cabinet. perusal of the policy on which many members of thp alleged Country party won their seats shows clearly that a great number of the electors who had very little 'sympathy for the Nationalists cajoled into voting for the Country party, believing that it was a separate party. .These electors .were inclined to vote on the Labour side, but certain candidates declared that they would have nothing whatever to do with the Nationalist party. They pointed out that, they were as strongly opposed to the Nationalists as were the Labour candidates, and that, if elected, they would be an independent group, prepared to fight for the interests of the men on the land. Owing to those representations numerous electors throughout Australia were cajoled into casting their votes in favour of the nominees of the so-called Country party. The fourteen points enunciated by it were no doubt drawn up with the authority and assistance of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), and they were published for the purpose of deceiving the farmers of Australia. We find that definite promises were made in those fourteen points. Here is one of themThe Assurance of stability of employment in the cities and towns is dependent upon pur-' chasing power created in the country. That purchasing power can best be secured by making primary production profitaible by the establishment of is Commonwealth Land Bank, with a system of co-operativo and rural credits, as an integral part of the Savings Bank Department. That was a definite promise made by the Country party to the people of Australia on the eve of the elections. Has any ference been made in the policy speeches, or by the Treasurer Earle Page) when speaking today, to the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank? In the Governor General's there is no indication of the widening the scope of the Commonwealth Bank, alare though we are told that the management of that institution is to be vested Board; indeed, it appears that the idea is to restrict the power of the Bank compete against private banking tions. When the establishment Commonwealth Bank was proposed by Labour Government, and a Bill to en'd was before Parliament, members then in Opposition bitterly posed the idea on the ground that the priwere, Mr Forde. A vate banking institutions were well able to carry on the banking business of the country. Personally, I believe that the scope of the Commonwealth Bank should be widened so as to provide for a rural were credit system. The Australian farmers have very good security to offer in their productive lands, and a scheme is required to enable them to procure capital on reasonable terms so that they may not, in a period of depression, be harassed as they are today by the many exacting private banking institutions. A rural credit system on the lines of similar systems in America amd Canada would perform a very useful function in this country. We have every right to expect the Government, which includes in its ranks men who call themselves Country party members, to bring such a scheme to f r u i tion. .Rural credits in. America and Canada have altogether changed the very life of those countries; they have created prosperity where previously there was adversity, keeping at bay the usurer and speculator, and enabling the genuine farmers to obtain loans on the best possible certain terms. Mr E i RILEY - That is what we want!",40
120,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"That is what the Labour party aims at, and I ask the present Government to introduce a scheme of the kind. We do not want this matter to be pub aside until Labour is in power; and if the Government introduces a scheme, I am certain honourable members on this side will support it , and further endeavour to improve any banking policy that will tend reto help the majority of the agriculturists. We recognise that the successful farmer Government of today has to be more of a business man (Dr than his rjredecessor; he must make i m provements, and have the most up-to-date Land implements. I .greatly deplore the fact Speech that the Governirient, although it proof mised, through certain candidates who now members of the Ministry, to in troduce a land bank or rural credit sysin a tem, has foreshadowed no proposal of the kind in the Governor General's Speech. to The Hughes Government some years ago instituwas urged by Labour members to widen of the the scope of the Commonwealth Bank, so a as to provide rural credits; but absolutely that nothing was then done, because behind honourable that Administration there were all the big opbanking institutions of Australia, which of course, averse to any competition. I now turn to point 13 (a) of the Country party's fourteen pointsThe encouragement of all industries essential to national development by(a) The formulation of comprehensive plans to secure the ready mobilization of our resources, the elimination of waste in primary and secondary production, the proper valuation of in workmanship and the encouragement of industrial standardization. I do not know whether that was meant to convey that the Country party stood for some rural organization for the men on the land. In Queensland the Labour Government has established such a scheme, and it is doing great work. that scheme is only in its infancy, it is confidently anticipated it will improve the status farmers generally, and help them to help themselves. Although there are country members in this composite M in istry they have done nothing whatever towards launching a rural organization scheme for the whole of Australia, or to assist the States in a work of the kind. Yet the effect of the promises made on the eve of the elections was that this would be done. One of our greatest problems is how to secure a large and virile population, and its solution, I believe, is to be found largely in the development of agriculture. It is recognised that all wealth springs fro m the land, and if we are to settle people in the remote parts of Australia we must be prepared to assist them, in the initial stages. It was found in Queensland, and, indeed, all over Australia,"" that there were party political organizations exploiting the men on the land. These organizations were controlled by men who could not secure selection, as candidates under the Liberal or Nationalist banner, and who saw an opportunity to get into Parliament by forming primary producers' organizations, and in working up some of the farmers into a frenzy against the Labour party and the existing Tory party. For a time in Queensland these men did exploit certain sections of the farmers by such Tory organizations, but their weakness was found in the fact that Labour farmers, and also certain Conservative farmers, were against them. Then the Labour Government in Queensland in troduced a rural organization scheme on non-party lines, embracing all sections of political thought every producer in the country. The scheme is a great up lift to the men on the land. It is recognised that it will encourage co-operation, and teach the farmer the great power he can wield by organizing on industrial lines. Primary producers inQueensland today realise that skill co-operation can reduce the difficulties arising from the fluctuation of markets, and keep down the charges which accumulate between the cow and the counter, between the field and the factory, and between the orchard and the dinner tabic. This is what the Labour party is aiming at in the northern State today. A unified Although organization of farmers is the first important step towards the establishment of a that rural credit system, and that is why of Labour supports such a scheme. An organization of the kind could be called the Australian Producers Association. The Queensland organization is called the Queensland Producers Association. In brief, the scheme I propose for the whole of Australia provides for the establishment of a branch of the Australian Producers Association in each State by-(1 ) the formation of local producers' associations in local centres and consisting of not fewer than fifteen primary producers; (2) the constitution of district councils by the' election of representatives from local producers' associations; (3) the constitution of a Council of Agriculture by the election of representatives from district councils. The association is to be open to every person engaged in the occupation of dairy farmer, wheat, maize, or cereal grower, sugar grower, cotton grower, f r u it grower, grazing farmer, and general and mixed farmer. These embrace practically all the men engaged in primary production. The objects of the association should be the development of rural industries, the in vestigation of and dealing with problems relating to rural industries, the advising of agriculturists with regard to matters which require scientific knowledge, research work, the securing of effective action for the controlling of diseases and pests, the question of markets, and improved means of transport and other matters appertaining to the welfare of the man on the land. I recognise that these schemes should, if possible, be taken up by the various State Governments, but and the Commonwealth Government could work in co-operation with them, assist .them in the initial I would be prepared to support placing upon the Estimates of money to enable the Commonwealth Government to assist such a scheme to the extent of one-half the cost during the initial stages. The Queensland ment are paying the whole of the cost of the local scheme, for the first twelve months. In that State, we have local producers' associations in each discussing the grievances of the farmers in fcheir respective' localities. local associations, have the right send a representative to the council', and the district council the right to send a representative to the Central Council of ture. In this way we have lished a veritable farmers' discussing the views and opinions of those engaged in primary industries the different localitiesj and im a position to put before the Queensland ment practical propositions for the benefit of the man on the land. scheme to be really effective* must be extended to every 1 Then, in addition to a Council of Agriculture in each State, we could have a Grand Couancil of Agriculture Melbourne, with access to the Prime Minister and Federal Departments. weresuch a grand' council sitting in Melbourne at the - present time,. representatives would be expressingtheir indignation at the treatment meted out to the sugar-growers of their State by the Commonwealth Government. organization scheme provides appointment of experts to assist themen on the; land, and in Queensland it is recognised by men engaged in rural industries who have been opposed to the present Government of that State-,, that the scheme enunciated by the Government represents the first constructive proposal ever put forward by any Government in the history of Australia to organize the men on the land along non-party lines, and furnish them with the machinery whereby they will be able to uplift themselves and securea larger share of profit from their labours. other countries in the world are interested in. the* Queensland rural schemes.

129,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The CommonwealthGovernment's proposals in regard to the sugar industry will give no real security nor, indeed, any prospect of stability to those who are engaged in growing sugar. The price which has been fixed is far below the world's parity, and will cause a loss of £1,000,000 to the growers, on the present season's crop. It is little, wonder that, recently the: Brisbane. Daily advocated commenting upon this condition of affairs, saidThe duty of Queensland members in! this connection is plainenough. They must consider Queensland first and party second. The sugar industry should be regarded, not from the point of view of Queensland only. It is a question of national irnportancej and it is just as well that the conditions which led to the making of the certainly first sugar agreement should berehonour viewed. It is closely bound upwith the White Australia policy. Previously the conditions under which theindustry was carried on were exceedingly bad. The growers were not making, a decent living, and they were not in a position to pay a: livin g wage to the workers. In 1907-8, field labourers were paid ;E1 2s. 6d.. a week and keep in the off season, and £ 1 5s. a, meek and keep in. the crushing season. These wageswere not sufficient to. enable a man to keep his w if e and family.. In 1911,, the cane cutters asked for a. wage of 30s. a-. ' week of forty-eight hours, and were -. forced, to declare a strike. On that, occasion the growers proved that they could not afford to pay a livin g wage to the workers. It was demonstrated that member the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had the growers, so much in their power that the latter w-ere obliged to sweat their employees. On the 9th August, 1911, in an article commenting on the sugar in dustry,, the Melbourne Age saidTihe Colonial Sugar Eefining. Company controls the price which the consumer must pav for sugar. Then, seeing that the company fixes the price for raw sugar, the sugar monopoly also regulates the price paid to the cane-grower for hia raw material. Every stage of the industry, from the growing of the cane to the bagging of the finished article, is ordered and' directed by the Colonial Sugar Kenning Company. Its vice-like hold upon one of the necessities of human life is amost striking to the example of commercial monopoly probably [Quorum without a parallel in any part of the world. And in a. leading article published a few days later, the A<7e saidThe Government should have long ago takes a hand io the matter .by the establishment, of a national refinery. Before a Labour Government tame into power in Queensland the canergrowers were absolutely at the mercy of the Colonial! Sugar RefiningCompany and the millers, aud were obliged to accept Mail, whatever price the millers offered. In many instances cane inspectors passed through the districts offering 10s. or 12s. a ton, or very little more, for the cane, and the growers had to take these prices or allow their cane to rot in the fields. When the Labour party came into power in Queensland it passed the Cane Prices Act Amendment Bill through the Queensland Parliament, under the provisions of which the growers and millers were represented on a Cane Prices Board, whose duty it was to see that there was paid to the grower a reasonable price which would enable him to pay a decent wage to his employees. However, recognising that even this was not sufficient, the Labour Government of Queensland took steps to bring about what is known as the first sugar agreement, and successfully sought the endorsement of the Commonwealth Government, led by Mr Andrew Fisher. That first agreement, thus brought into existence by the Federal Government, acting in conjunction with the Queensland Labour Government, fixed the price of sugar at £18 a ton-an increase of £3 4s. per ton-but, 191S, the growers were successful in having the agreement renewed with the price fixed at £21 a ton. However, the increased cost of production, machinery, and everything else during the next two years necessitated a corresponding increase in the price of sugar, and the growers were successful in getting the price set out in the 1920 agreement increased to £30 6s. 8d. a ton, due largely to the action of the Labour party in Queensland. The increase gave the industry a great fillip. It enabled the growers who, through bad seasons, had got behind, to recoup themselves to some extent. It caused a steady increase in the value of the crop which, last year, was £9,000,000 as compared with £1,500,000 in 1915, before Labour intervened on behalf of the growers. There are 25,000 people employed annually in sugar operations. It is one of the greatest means of giving employment In Australia. From the southern States at least 4,000 workers proceed to Queensland each year to, obtain 'employment during the cutting season. The amount of capital invested is £16,000,000. [Extension of time granted.] Machinery valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds is supplied by the southern States ' Mr Forde. to Queensland for operations connected with the sugar industry. Towns such as Bundaberg, Childers, Gin Gin, Mackay, Cairns, and many others depend almost solely on this industry. It is the bulwark of the White Australia policy. It would not be possible to populate the great north of Australia without it ; indeed, it would be necessary for the Commonwealth to maintain a standing army there for the purpose of keeping out the black races. It has enabled the north to be settled. For example, the number of electorsin the Herbert division has increased by about 13,000 within the last eleven years. Without the sugar-growing industry we could not induce many people to leave the southern parts of Australia and settle in those districts where cane can be grown successfully by Australians. The sugar cane-growers are thus blazing the track for Australian settlement. For many years the pioneering work was done with little return. If given the opportunity, this industry will do a great deal more for Australia thanin it has already done. I hope that supplies of raw sugar will be made available for the Millaquin Company at Bundaberg, which employs a large number of men. I regret to say that this refinery, through not getting a reasonable supply of raw sugar, has recently had to dismiss fifty or sixty hands. The Nationalist and Country party members have tricked the sugar farmers. The sugar cane-grbwers were led to believe, that if they voted for Nationalist and Country party candidates at the last election the Commonwealth Government would see that the sugar agreement was renewed, or, failing this, that there would be an embargo on the importation of black-grpwn sugar. The ex-Prime Minister (Mr W. M . Hughes) toured Queensland, and usedthe sugar industry as a. great electioneering "" stunt."" He was feted and entertained everywhere. Complimentary speeches were made in regard to him, but he was dexterous enough in his utterances to do everything but definitely promise the growers what they desired. He left them .hoping while he was hesitating. He said that the industry was ot great importance to Australia, and he would see that it received a fair deal. When the elections were held all the Nationalist candidates throughout Queensland made definite promises to the sugar growers. I quote the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) as an illustration. Mr W . B . Biggs, of Proserpine, writing to the Brisbane Telegraph, saidIn view, of the assertion that fit ful if Queensland favoured a continuation of the sugar agreement, and taking into consideration the result of the Queensland elections, I wish to 'make it quite clear that the Nationalist candidates of Queensland all pledged themselves to a continuance. of the agreement. „ . . The fallowing questions were put to Mr Bamford at his election t meeting at Proserpine hy me: Q. Are you in favour of the continuance of the sugar agreement? Mr BAMFORD: Yes, for a further term of five years. Q. In the event of your party, as a party, refusing to vote for same, will you cross the floov and vote against them? Mr BAMFORD: Yes, I will, and, further.. when I aim returned, I will pledge myself .to make it my business, at the first opportunity, to bring the extension of the agreement before the House, as fit will give me the opportunity to .put the acid on the Country' and Labour parties, and prove their sincerity to the sugar- What has happened ? growers, It will be admitted that, the honourable member for Herbert having made that definite promise, the growers have* a right to expect that it will be honoured. But equally definite promises were made by other honourable members opposite. I turn now to the attitude of my own leader. The Brisbane Daily Mai l of 28th October, 1922, reported Mr Charlton's speech at Maryborough as having included the following statement: Mr Charlton said the Labour party had used every endeavour to have a renewal of the agreement. A protective Tariff was inadequate, and if returned to power the Labour party would immediately take steps to bring about a sugar agreement. The same journal reported the honourable member for ""Wide Bay (Mr Corser) as having said at Namboiir on 28th ber, 1922If the Nationalist Government is returned power further sugar proposals will be mitted, and I feel confident that the existing sugar agreement will ,be renewed, probably a Islighitly modified form, Ibut nevertheless satisfactory to the industry as a whole. Hughes os most anxious that something should be done to maintain the sugar industry, which was mainly responsible for the carrying of the White Australia policy, and sugarthe growers can rest assured that their interestswill .be adequately preserved by the Nationalist Government, I do not know what attitude the honourable member adopts now, but if he is loyal to the sugar interests of Queensland he must be disgusted with the policy of the present Government. He has failed was doubtto get them to do their duty by the industry. . I am waiting to see if honourable members opposite will force their Government to adopt a policy thab was definitely promised to the sugar-growers. The Bundaberg Daily News of 16th November, 1922, thus reports a question asked of the Leader of the Country party and Treasurer in the present composite Ministry (Dr Earle Page)If your party are returned in sufficient numbers to constitute a controlling factor in the next Federal Government, will you insist on the retention of the control of the industry by the Federal Government as at present enacted, until such time as a system is evolved that will assure to the cane-grower a fair and reasonable return for the labour and capital he has invested. Dr Earle Page immediately returned an emphatic Yes. Having ' ' managed "" himself into a composite Ministry, the honourable member has forgotten all about the sugar-growers, and it is no wonder - that the farmers are losing confidence in him as is evidenced by the disgust expressed recently at Bendigo by men who have the interests of the farmers at heart. The Age o i 22nd June, 1923, contains the following paragraphs in its report of the meeting of the Bendigo Branch of the Farmers Union decision in the composite Government would lead to the eventual destruction of the party. He. did not favour the secrecy that accompanied the formation of the composite party. He did not think the farmers could hope for any relief from.the composite Ministry in regard to the Tariff. They did not know where they were today in connection with the disNovemposal of their surplus .produce.  to of motion, which will be dealt with at the subnext meeting of the branch:- "" That this branch views with concern the Prime' Minisin ter's intention to prorogue Parliament during his absence abroad. We consider the hoi dingMr up of publicbusiness in this way to be unnecessary and unwarranted, especially in view of the fact that in the formation of the comon posite Government Mr Bruce mentioned that country was to have an equal say and  Prime Minister at any time during Mr. Bruce's absence""  not expect anything from the present Government. Certainly the sugar-growers cannot. Both Nationalist and Country party candidates made all sorts of promises, and a Country party manifesto in cluded these wordsThe sugar industry to be safeguarded by legislation securing it against unfair competition; detrimental to the White Australia policy. Was there any business in that 1 No, decidedly not. Apparently, those statements were made merely for electioneering purposes, and the candidates who made them had no intention of carrying them into effect. Apparently, the National Federation, which is financed by great corporations like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, had brought honourable members opposite to heel, because, just after Mr Hughes made a tour of Queensland he was confronted with this resolution from the National FederationThat at the end of the present term, in June next, the sugar agreement be discontinued. The influential members of that Federation represent Flinders-lane and the big business interests of Australia. They have not at heart the interests of the struggling farmers. There .is nothing in common between them. They subscribe money to the funds of the National Federation, which financed the Nationalist candidates during the last election. the next election Nationalists Country party candidates will most likely go before the electors as one party, and all will draw their financial sustenance from the National Federation. Naturally, if the Federation pays the piper it will also call the tune. The Prime Minister is a Victorian; his - name is Stanley Melbourne Bruce; he is Melbourne in sympathies as well as in name. I believe the former Prime Minister (Mr W . M . Hughes) was more sympathetic to the sugar industry than is the gentleman who has succeeded him. A conference of growers discussed the position of the sugar industry January, 1922, and submitted lowing proposals to the Commonwealth Government. Firstly, that the sugar agreement be renewed, and, as an Mr Forde. alternative, the following:- A Commonwealth Sugar Pool to be established for five years. The second resolution was only a machinery one, by which the sugar would be acquired, and also, made provision to include New South Wales sugar in the Pool. Resolutions 3 and 4 directly affected the Commonwealth, and read as follows:While the Pool is in operation, the Commonwealth Government to prohibit the importation of black-grown sugar except so much as is required from time to time as determined by the Pool to make good any Australian shortage; this embargo to be applied subject to conditions stated in clause 4 relating to price to be charged to the consumers. Resolution No. 4'readDuring the currency of the Pool IA refined sugar to be sold at such a price as will insure that the retail price of refined sugar to the consumer shall not exceed 4jd. per lb. in capital cities. The growers asked for a continuance of the embargo on black-grown sugar for a period of five years, and guaranteed to supply consumers with sugar at 4 | d . per lb., a reduction of l j d . on the price which had ruled since 1920. A deputation was sent all the way from Queensland to wait on the Prime Minister in Melbourne. At first he said that no good purpose could be served by receiving them, but eventually he did so. The first request .was for a renewal of the agreement, which they had a right to expect, but it was turned down. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) said to-night that he personally was in favour of a renewal At of the sugar agreement, but the honour and able member and other Nationalist members had an opportunity in the last Parliament, when the Nationalist Government had a majority of only one over the combined numbers of the opposing parties, to force the Government to renew the sugar agreement. In failing to take action then the honourable member for Lilley, and every other Nationalist member from Queensland, betrayed the trust that had been reposed in them by their constituents. The fact must be borne in mind that there are in the present Cabinet two Queenslanders, in the persons of the Attorney-General (Mr Groom) and in Senator Crawford, and it is, therefore, the fol- no wonder that the honourable member for Lilley says that it would be interesting existing to know whether those Ministers endorsed the action of the Cabinet in rejecting the requests of the sugar-growers. they had been true to the trust reposed in them by the people of Queensland, the sugar agreement would have been renewed, or, failing that, the alternative proposals adopted. In reply to the second proposal submitted by the deputation, the Prime Minister promised to give consideration to the matter. Three months have elapsed, and that delay has caused stagnation in the industry. There was a feeling of uncertainty; the growers did not know what to expect for their sugar, and one result has been that the establishment of the Tully Eiver mill has been hindered. Settlement has been retarded. The foundry at Bundaberg has put off thirty men, because there was uncertainty as to what woTk would he offering; the mills were not renewing their machinery, and the outlook for the foundry was dull. Early in June the Prime Minister went to Queensland and mad* certain proposals, but by that time sugar in Java and Cuba had risen to £28 10s. and £30 per ton respectively. There was a shortage in the world's production of, approximately, 300,000 tons, due partly to the failure of the beet crop in Europe and partly fo speculation in the worid's markets. ' The world's supplies had decreased, and the world's parity had correspondingly increased. The proposals put before the sugar industry by the Prime Minister in Brisbane, no doubt after the city organ had pealed forth for an hour,' were for the continuation of the agreement for two years only(a) The industry to form a Pool free from the control of the Commonwealth Government, and to buy raw sugar for the 1923-24 season at not more than £27 per ton of 94 net titre f.o.b. mill. If Australia had to depend on the world's - market it would have to pay from £37 to £40 per ton for sugar, for if you add to the prices of £28 10s. and £30 per ton in Java and Cuba respectively the import duty of £9 6s. 8d. per ton, you have the landed cost in Australia, exclusive of freight and handling, charges. Therefore, the proposal submitted by the Prime Minister was not fair, and was put forward in the interests, not of the sugar growers, but of those people who dictated the policy of the Government. It was an offer of £27 for one year, when sugar brought from abroad would cost Australia If from £37 to £40 per ton. The Prime Minister further proposed,(b) The Pool to provide sugar for the purpose of manufactured goods for export' at a price equal .to the current' world's parity. The sugar-growers have always been pre- 1 pared to do that. (c) The price for raw sugar for the 1924-25 season to be determined after investigation by a tribunal, and to be based upon the cost of efficient production in reasonably good districts and under normal conditions; such price not to exceed £27 per ton. (d) The tribunal to have regard in ascertaining the cost of production to excessive wages (if any) paid in the sugar industry as compared with other primary industries. Let us examine the Prime Minister's offer to the sugar-growers. Raw sugar was £30 per ton in Cuba, equal to £39 6s. 8d. in Australia, exclusive of freight and handling charges. And the Prime Minister offered the Queensland growers £27 per ton for their product! Generosity; forsooth!",44
130,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,He is a friend of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.,48
131,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Yes . That offer was absolutely unfair. His offer to give the growers £27 for one year, and to then appoint a tribunal to fix the price for subsequent years, with a maximum of £27 per ton, was a ""heads I win, tails you - lose"" proposition. The attitude of the sugar-growers has been most fair and reasonable, and naturally they are very dissatisfied with the treatment they have received. As an alternative to the Prime Minister's scheme, they asked for £27 net at the mills for raw sugar, an agreement for two years instead of one, as offered by the Prime Minister, the embargo upon the importation of black-grown sugar to continue for three years instead of two years, and the appointment of a tribunal to determine the price for the third year. The representatives of the sugar-growers - consider that their request is reasonable in view of the fact that world's parity is greatly in excess of £30 6s. Sd. per ton, which price will obtain until the end of the present month. The opinion that the Commonwealth Government have not treated the sugar industry fairly is not the opinion of only those engaged in the industry. The Brisbane Daily Mail, of 6th June, 1923, said in its leading articleWith very great regret it must be stated that the sugar policy put forward by the Prime Minister last night is disappointing. Mr Bruce summed up his position correctly when he said that what the sugar producer principally needed was certainty as to his future. The Government's proposals are for two years., but that is not enough. If, at the - end of that period, the industry is again to the the sport of chance, or worse, of politics, .which may be defined from the sugar-grower""s viewpoint as-chance, with the dice loaded against the industry, then it .is certain that the prospects of the sugar districts will immediately be affected, and that expansion will definitely be checked. The inadequacy of the Government's proposals will best be appreciated by ooniipa-ring them with the reasonable demand of the industry. The Brisbane 'Telegraph, another Nationalist paper, said in a leading articleI t may bo said at once that the Federal Government's sugar policy, which was enunciated in Brisbane last aright* by the Prime Minister, is deeply .disappointing. It does not give in any considerable measure that security which the sugar industry demands, and which it must receive, if it is to survive and play its part, not only in supplying the present needs of the Australian sugar market, but also in developing the waste spaces of Australia. The Brisbane Courier, which is one of the greatest supporters of Nationalism in Queensland, said on 6th June, 1923I t would too futile to suggest that the policy as outlined last night by Mr Bruce give that measure of protection to the growers that the great national industry warrants. . . , The scheme cannot be regarded isfactory by the people of Queensland. . . . Mr Bruce recognised the special importance of the sugar industry as a factor in upholdwealth ing the White Australia policy, and its city to provide an effective garrison tropical north, but at the sarnie time to appreciate that such an industry was entitled to any greater, consideration given to minor industries in the south that merely of commercial importance to certain , business interests in Melbourne or Hobart. Obviously the Government's policy is in the nature of a. makeshift. Like all such halfthe agreement in 1915. measures it can please nobody. The growers are most emphatic in their condemnation of the Commonwealth vernment because they have in mind the fact that, during the period of Governindustry ment control, the sugar industry Australia £17,000,000. They know that way. during the last ten years the consumers Australia have been provided with sugar at an average price of 4d. per lb., and that the people of England and France Mr Forde. were compelled to pay as much as Is. 6d. per lb. In England today the people are paying 8Jdl per l b . for their sugar. I have received the following telegram from Mr J . Clayton, president of the Childers M ill Cane-growers' Association : My association urgently requests you urge Parliament to agree embargo on foreign sugar for four years at least. That request is a fair one, and I support it . In January, the period asked for was five years: the growers are prepared to modify that claim now to some extent, but they desire that they should have accorded to them a measure of support, which the Federal Government have not given them. It is no wonder that the Primary Producers' organization at Mackay on 13th June passed the following resolution: That we cannot reconcile the Federal Government's adhesion to the policy of a White Australia with the proposal to acquire our sugar, grown under Australian conditions as to labour and tools, at a price lower than the landed cost of black-grown sugar. We, the white settlers of Queensland, must look on it as an attempt to force on us black conditions of life. You, Mr Chairman, know the conditions existing in the sugar industry; you know that the industry has not been treated properly. The following telegram is sugar typical of scores of communications that will I . have received fro m sugar-growers and people who are interested in the sugar, in as satdustry during the last five weeks:Growers view with alarm the CommonGovernment's callousness towards the capasugar industry;. Position decidedly unsatisfor the factory from growers' point of view. he failed We know that the Colonial Sugar Rethan was fining Company does not want Governare ment control; it desires the same freedom to control the sugar industry as the Melbourne Age said it possessed prior to Just as the rack-renters, the profiteers, the speculators and the market-riggers do not want Government interference, so the Colonial GoSugar Refining Company and those who desire to filch great profits from the sugar do not favour restriction of their saved actions by Government, control in any I maintain that the growers' deof mand could have been acceded to without the consumers suffering any detriment.

' Minimum Amount Government must recover Trade Margin-Wholesal e 16s. and per cent, on turnover. Grocer now gets 12£ per cent. Retail Selling Price Therefore, it will be seen that I have not said something that I could not prove. Sugar should never have been sold at a higher price than 4Jd. per lb. if the Commonwealth Government had not bungled to the extent of importing 116,000 tons of sugar at prices ranging up to £ 8 0 per ton, and averaging £ 4 4 6s. 2d - whic h was world's parity. Instead of selling that sugar to the consumers at the price at which they imported it, they reduced the price with a view to catching votes at a general election, and sold at less than half the price at which they had bought. They thus incurred a loss of £4,000,000, which afterwards had to he made good by charging for local sugar the price of 6d; per lb. that led to all the opposition in the southern States. The price of sugar in Australia was 3d. per lb. up to 1915; it was 3|d. per lb. from January, 1916, to 26th January, 1920, and 6d. per lb. from that time until recently, when it was reduced to 5d. per lb., the price at which it stands today. The Government now propose into the figures and have found that it could be done in this way: per ton. per lb. £ s. d. 18 0 0 9 0 0 27 0 0 0 12 0 27 12 0 s. d. 5 3 3 0 0 11 1 I 19 4 0 9 6 0 17 0 18 0 0 7 0 10 0 4 10 0 19 3 34 12 1 0 15 0 0 8 0 13 0 .. .. 35 15 1 Retailer gets £5 8s. l i d . or 12'98 . 6 4 11 42 0 0. 4id. per ton. per lb. reducing it to 4£d. per l b . , a price at which it could have been sold since 1920, even though the Government had done the - fair thing and had acceded to the demands of the sugar-growers. Australian j a m manufacturers got their sugar for £26 12s., while British j a m manufacturers had to pay £48 10s. per ton. The sugar industry in Australia during the period of Government control saved the people of Australia £17,000,000. Foreign raws, purchased from 1915 to ,1922 inclusive, totalled 475,947 tons, and the average rate per ton gross was £37 19s. During the same period the Australian raws purchased totalled 1,412,000 tons, at an average price per ton gross of £25 17s. lid. Had the whole of Australia's requirements in sugar been purchased on the world's market at world's parity Australia's sugar bil l would have amounted to £71,000,000 instead of £54,000,000, inclusive of £5,000,000 worth of foreign raws. The present proposals of the Commonwealth Government do not afford' the \ measure of protection which, is warranted; hut the Queensland Premier and the officials of the Sugar Growers' Association have decided that it will be betterto have some measure of protection rather than have none at all. Even though the Commonwealth Government do not offer the protection which was really promised to the growers by,the Government candidates at the election, the growers take the view, "" Under duress we must accept what we are offered rather than throw ourselves on the mercy of the Colonial Sugar Refining monopoly."" In an interview which I gave to a representative of one of the Queensland newspapers, I said I thought it was better for the growers to accept the proposals with a view to liberalizing them later.",48
132,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown, The honourable member's time has expired.,51
133,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [8.38]. - I desire to bring before the notice of the Postmaster-General some matters which I think are worthy of his serious consideration. I have been requested by local municipal bodies to endeavour to obtain increased postal facilities for Hurlstone Park, portion of which has been added to my constituency. Apparently the Department is not prepared to consider favourably their suggestion that a post-office, which is very badly needed, should be erected in that populous suburb. A few years ago, when I passed through this neighbourhood, it consisted almost entirely of paddocks with habitations scattered here ancl there in what was then bush land. During the recent election campaign, when I had occasion frequently to travel through the district, I found that these paddocks were now covered with houses and handsome business premises; the trams had been extended, and several lines' of motor 'buses were running out. Notwithstanding the recognition by these activities of the necessity for meeting the convenience of residents of this wonderfully rapidly settled new suburban district, the Department has not increased its postal facilities. At the request of the municipal council, I addressed a communication on the subject to the Postmaster-General some days ago, but so far have not Had an acknowledgment. I understand that my friend, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr), who represents the adjoining constituency, which also impinges upon this particular locality, has been in communication with the Department, but his representations have met with an unfavorable reception. The opportunity exists for the Postmaster General to pursue a more progressive policy in regard to the extension of postal facilities, not only in suburban, but also in country districts. There is, I think, too much of a tendency to regard the Post Office as a commercial concern, that should be run on business lines in order to show a handsome profit. I do not regard the postal service in that light; it is a public utility which should assist the development of the country. So long as the Post Office can pay its way, I do not think it is necessary that' it should be managed in such a way as will enable it to show a profit. I hope that this matter will receive more favourable consideration from the Postmaster-General than apparently it has received from some of the officials in the Department. Another portion of my electorateMarrickville-is badly in need of increased postal „facilities. We have had there, for many years, a post-office, which proved adequate to the needs of the popution when it was built. At that time the population was only about one-third its present size. Notwithstanding the large increase which has taken place, and the fact that the districtnow; contains a population of something like 42,000, compared with 15,000 when the post office, was built, very little has been done towards increasing postal facilities. .There is need for a post-office in Addison-road, in the vicinity of Newell-street, a very thickly populated area of this important municipality. A matter which has been brought under my notice is a practice of the Department which requires business firms that receive large parcels of registered letters to sign a receipt for each individual letter. It appears to me to be a very cumbersome method. Mr GIBSOKT^-That matter has received attention.",51
134,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am very glad to know that. Another matter which has been brought under my notice is, the.necessity for reducing the rate of postage, if not over the whole of Australia, at any rate in metropolitan areas.",51
135,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,How about country areas; they are more deserving?,52
136,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,Unknown,"Actio n ought to be taken in connection with business letters. I do not know whether the Postmaster-General is aware of the fact that many business firms in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and other cities in Australia, which conduct a large quantity of local correspondence, have found it very much more profitable to engage a man to deliver their letters with in the city areas. That practice has resulted in a big loss to tihe postal revenue, and I do not think it should be encouraged. I would like the Postmaster-General to look into the matter, and see whether some other arrangement can be made. - I take this opportunity, before resuming my seat, of complimenting the Government on their decision to increase the invalid and old-age pensions, and I trust that, when dealing with this matter, they will also consider the advisability of amending the Act in several much-needed directions to remove a number of disabilities that at present hamper the administration of the Department to the detriment of the pensioners themselves.",52
137,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes) said the other day that he was opposed to any increase i u pensions. Sir ' ELLIOT JOHNSON - Well , that is a matter for the honourable member himself. The general feeling of the community, I am sure, is in favour of in creasing invalid and old-age pensions at s the earliest possible moment. I am sympathetically disposed towards any such proposal, and I hope that as little time as possible will be lost in bringing down a measure which will have the desired result.",52
138,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"Wannon) [ 8 . 4 7 ] desire, in the debate on this Supply Bill , which includes an item of expenditure in connection with the New Hebrides, to suggest that the Government take action to improve the administration in those islands. Recently there appeared in one of the Victorian provincial newspapers a letter, written by the Rev. F . J. Patonthe missionary maintained, by Andrew's K i r k , in the New Hebridesdealing with the condition of the natives under the administration of the Condominium. It is a matter of which the the Government should take cognisance, and for the information' of ""honourable members. I shall read portion of the letterA local Frenchman signed on a school woman against the wish of her husband for a year. This is allowedtoythe French under the Condominium. A decent Frenchman working for this man complained to me that he was not able to sleep because his master's labourers were hunting the woman all night. He said:. "" It is not good tor a school woman,"" and added: "" It may not be the woman's fault. Her master gave her to one of his employees, though her Teal husband is a school attender."" The latter asked me what he could do, and I could only say, ""Nothing."" You see, this Condominium allows it, and you in Australia allow the Condominium. The girl was then sent to another place along the coast, and this time a native fought a second Frenchman for her. This Frenchman, a drunken specimen, bolted, but last Sunday took her off as .she was ; coming to service. They crossed a river naked. Even the lowest cannibal would not have done that. And she is a school girl. Can you not denounce those in the Commonwealth Parliament iwho allow this Condominium? Another girl working for this Frenchman was recruited near midnight on Ambrim, as she and others were shell-fishing with torches on the reef. Site was recruited by a half-caste. - She alleges that she was rushed by the boat crew and kidnapped. In any case, she has .a husband on Ambrim, but the native that recruited her was rewarded witii her. She was beaten by her mistress and ran away. Natives with loaded muskets hunted her and brought her back. Later she ran away, this time to the French magistrate at Port Sandwich, and pending an inquiry into her ill-treatment, she is held there under the care of the ' French , sisters, I think. One of our church members, recruited on a cutter whose captain is a pureblooded native, a well-known scoundrel. How she got on board, no one knows. Her husband was not asked for eonsent. This is illegal. I reported the matter, and the woman is now dead. No notice was taken of the report. Another school attender ran away to work for a Frenchman. He put her on board a cutter. Her husband refused consent. Later the French Resident interviewed the husband, and there is not a, shadow of doubt about the illegality. The woman is not returned. A third woman was recruited by a half-caste. Her husband, - I not being able to get her back, went with her. But the recruiter has taken her for his wife pro tern, and she is round with him in the recruiting ship while the husband has to work on the plantation. These are about all the women who ha^e been .recruited here since the war, but multiply every other place where recruiting has been done, and you get a horrible result. And this is the Condominium you in Australia allow. In London they say it is purely a St. matter for Australia, as these islands, with their magnificent ports, are vital to her alone. A British subject can recruit only local women for three months without the consent of her husband and against his wishes. This happened lately, the woman having twins at the 'breast. These twins are returned to the husband. A Britisher lately 'recruited a woman, his excuse being that she wouldn't leave his ,ship. All that can be done is to withdraw his recruiting licence, but he can recruit without a licence if 'he likes. We, have a fine British Administrator. He is upright and generous, and does all he can for white and native. Australia is the deciding factor, and if you are indifferent the punishment is already begun. are settling. I passed one on Maleluka, working in shirt and lavalay, starting a plantation. They are settling in the group- a groupthat will support millions of them, and the White Australia policy will 'be a joke. They will simply own these islands .by settling in thousands, if you delay. We have' a definite responsibility with regard to the treatment of these natives, and it should certainly be the duty of this Government to take the necessary steps to prevent drunken Frenchmen, or any other persons, from molesting women in the manner described by the writer of the letter which I have quoted. I hope that the Government will take prompt action. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce)., in his reply to the statements made by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Scullin) concerning the sale of the Commonwealth Woollen M ill at Geelong, charged honourable members on this side with insincerity and hypocrisy. We are just as sincere as the Prime Minister himself, or any other member of the Ministerial following. Our earnest desire is to do the right thing by the people of Australia. When the Woollen M ill was established, I , for one, cherished the hope that one day we would have distributed throughout the Commonwealth similar mills engaged in the manufacture of our own raw material. We are in a better position to do this than are the people of any other country. The Prime Minister also suggested that the honourable member for Yarra was using poison gas. As a matter of fact, every statement which he made can be verified from the official files. From 1916 to 1922 the Nationalist party have been using, not only poison gas, but politically they have poisoned wells and used dum dum bullets. If a man dares to say anything against them he is sent out of the country without the privilege of trial by jury . charge, of using questionable methods is at their door, and not at the door of the Labour party. The Prime Minister has Mr JfWeill. declared that he does not believe in in terference with private enterprise. Would the right honourable gentleman, if he were Premier of Victoria, sell to private enterprise the great electricity works at Morwell, or the railway system, or the cool stores ? By no means. And would he, if he were Premier of Western Australia, sell to private enterprise the great Mundardng waterworks, carried The Japs out under Government direction at a cost of millions sterling, which gives to the people of Kalgoorlie and Menzies a plentifu l supply of splendid drinking water? If the Prime Minister does not believe in Government control of public utilities he should be straightforward enough to advocate the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and of every ship owned by the people of the Commonwealth. If he will not do that, he should refrain from charging honourable members on this side with in sincerity. During the last session of Parliament, a number of wealthy cattle owners in the Northern Territory and Queensland approached the Government for a subsidy on beef exported from the Commonwealth, which was willingl y granted. I have no objection to the payment of subsidies, because I believe every industry in the Commonwealth, and every individual, if necessary, should receive Government assistance, because poor men and women are as much entitled to relief as are the Avealthy beef barons in the Northern Territory or Queensland. Harbors are of national importance, but are, of course, under State control. Warrnambool, Portland, and Port Fairy are among the finest harbors in Victoria, and when a State Government, owing to lack of funds, will not improve such harbors and protect them by breakwaters, it should be the duty of the Commonwealth Government to assist by contributing at least one-half of the necessary expenditure. The members of the Labour party are wrongly charged with doing everything possible to retard immigration. The honourable member for ' Lilley (Mr . Mackay) said that he hoped, the day was not far distant when the trade union The organizations in Australia would support the policy of the various Governments in the matter of immigration. The Labour party of Australia does not oppose i m m i gratio.u in certain circumstances. There are thousands of starving people in Eng-' land, Scotland, Ireland, and elsewhere, and if this great young country can do anything to relieve their suffering and misery, it is our duty to assist them to come here. The Government, however, are not acting fairly to these,people. Our opposition to the present policy is based, on the ,fact that the Government are encouraging thousands of young men and women to come to Australia, and, twenty four hours after they land, are throwing them on their own resources to find work wherever they can when thousands of our own men and women are unable to find remunerative employment. It ported in the press of Saturday last that a number of returned soldiers were sleeping in the Sidney 'Domain, and were receiving some help from a hostel controlled by the Anglican Church. When the Government unlock large areas of country, afc present not available for settlement, and find employment for men and women seeking it , the members of . the Labour party will welcome settlers fro m overseas. A large number of German settlers in Australia are anxious to bring their relatives. and friends to the Commonwealth, but a National Government, in 1920, two years after the signing of the Armistice, passed an Act prohibiting Germans coming to Australia until 1925. Great B r it a in is trading Germany, and we are doing the same, notwithstanding that the ex-Prime M i nister (Mr Hughes) said that we would never again do so-. Prior to the war the Germans were good customers of ours, and as we are willing to dp business with them, is there any reason why they should not be admitted to the Commonwealth? Many of those who pioneered South Australia and the Wimmera District in Victoria were members of that cultured race,. and they have undoubtedly proved themselves to be good Australian citizens. Hundreds of young Germans who desire to migrate are going to Canada and America, and the Government should . seriously consider the desirableness * of allowing them to enter Australia. Germany was our principal enemy during the recent great conflict, but just as she has been on our side before, so she may assist us in the future. Scotland and England have opposed each other, but are friends » today. I trust that we have seen the last of great international conflicts, and that England and Germany will now be friends. I hope the policy of the Government to appoint a composite tribunal for the settlement of industrial disputes will not be pursued, because we are justly proud of having blazed the trail in the settlement of industrial disputes by compulsory arbitration. Prior to 1907 the great pastoral industry in Australia was always in a state of turmoil, but in consequence of compulsory arbitration, for which the Labour party was largely responsible, that great and important industry has since worked under peaceful conditions. I do not think was re- any country can produce the industrial results that we can. This happy position has been brought about inconsequence of our strict adherence to the principle of compulsory arbitration. No country has fewer strikes than Australia, and although America boasts of her freedom', the American people work longer hours than those of any other nation. The conditions here compare favourably, with those of any other country.",52
139,Mr GEEGOEY,Unknown,I suppose our industrial statistics are all wrong?,54
140,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"V e r y often they are; much of the information I have seen compiled by the statistical authorities is quite inaccurate. Notwithstanding the information which the honourable member with for Swan (Mr Gregory) may have in his possession, no other country, not even America, can show the good results that we can under compulsory arbitration.. The people of the Commonwealth have accepted and appreciate arbitration, and the Government's proposal to appoint some hybrid tribunal will result in creating, instead of preventing, industrial unrest. If there is congestion in the Court additional Judges can be appointed. I move That the proposed vote be reduced by £1. I do this as an intimation to the Government that it is the desire of this House that provision should be made in this vote for the payment of increased old-age and invalid pensions, and that such increased pensions be paid as from the 1st July, 1923. Instead of proceeding with the numerous Bills concerning which notice has been given, the Government should im- mediately introduce a measure to give effect to their promise to increase these pensions, because they must realise that a large number of people in Australia are j suffering in consequence of the meagre allowance they are now receiving. Hundreds of people do not know how to get their next meal. When poor people get an increase in wages, the rent-lords seize it as rents, and as soon as the poor old-ago pensioners receive an increase in (heir pensions, the rent-lords wil l thieve it , as they have done in the past. Something should be done to control those people who rent to old-age pensioners, at is., 5s., or 6s. a week, dirty hovels in which no one should be allowed to live. These poor old people, who have pioneered this country, ought not to have their money extracted from them in this way. They are entitled to all they are receiving, and. the action of the rentlords is an outrage and a disgrace. The principle is wrong, and I hope the Government will do something to clip the wings of these rapacious individuals who are robbing the poor.",54
141,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"Wide B a y) [9.18] - It is absurd for the. Opposition to propose an amendment providing for increased invalid and old-age pensions when the Government has already made a definite statement that it is the wish and intention of 'this party that an increase should be made in the old-age pensions. I intend to deal with three or four other matters which I consider important, and I hope the Ministry will take note of my remarks. The first relates to the sugar industry, which is very important to Queensland and the Commonwealth. When the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) was in my electorate I went into the matter very thoroughly him, and tried very hard to obtain something better than he has now notified the sugar-growers will be granted. understand that after the conversation I had with h im some improvement was made in the schemer, but I regret that it did not go fa r enough. I - should have dealt with this question earlier but for the fact that a conference of growers, manufacturers, and representatives of the Queensland Government was sitting in Brisbane, and today we were to be - informed whether the Prime, Minister's offer would be accepted. I have many telegrams from people in my electorate asking me to oppose the offer, and endeavour to secure an amendment of it in the direction already suggested by me to the Prime Minister when he was in Queensland. My request was that he should make the embargo for four, instead of two, crops. An agreement for two crops would apply to the crop now about to be harvested, and next year's crop. The price of sugar overseas will be greater than the price the growers will have to accept for these two crops. The world's parity today is higher than the price the Prime Minister is offering, and there is every prospect of that condition continuing for at least another twelve months. It is reasonable and equitable that the growers should be granted an extension of the «agreement for four years at the same rate as is proposed for two years. This important in dustry would, I think, have been sufficiently stabilized if Parliament had accepted the suggestion made by the Nationalist party for a protective duty of £14 per ton. The proposal was rejected, and a duty of £9 6s. 8d. imposed. A duty of £ 1 4 per ton would"" have stabilized the industry; in some circumstances a duty of £9 6s. 8d. cannot do it . The people of the Commonwealth are under an obligation to the sugar industry for settling a white population . along the immense coast-line of Queenslanda coast which could not be settled in any other way. It is absolutely essential, in view of our White Australia policy, that we should have sufficient white men on that coast to assist, at any rate, in protecting us from the importation of a coloured race. We should not lose sight of the fact that the League of Nations would not allow the Commonwealth of Australia to continue to hold the enormous territory it now occupies with a with mere handful of 6,000,000 people. The ' Commonwealth' is larger than the United States, where there are 112,000,000 people. I We know that strong appeals have been made to the League of Nations, urging that it is not fair that the Commonwealth of Australia should hold such, a vast territory, andyet not allow the enormous surplus populations of other countries to enter.",55
142,Mr YATES,Unknown,-Where did the honourable gentleman get hold of that?,55
143,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"Where the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) could have got hold of it if he had done his business properly. I read it in newspapers published in the country not far from the Australian coast. It is very difficult for the Government of the * British Empire, where there are so many hundreds of millions of coloured people, to .refuse to allow them to enter the Commonwealth, unless we do our' share towards trying to settle a white race here. We do not want to M i l an industry which is employing a large number of men and paying enormous amounts in wages. It should be encouraged, instead of being hampered. During the crushing season, no fewer than 4,000 or 5,000 men go from the southern States to work in the industry in Queensland. The Courts in that State recently decided that these men should be paid a higher wage than other workers, because they have to travel from and return to the southern , States, and have to wait a littl e time before the crushing commences. That extra cost is paid by the cane-growers. I do not think a four years' agreement would in flict any injustice upon the consumers. A f t er the Government has sold the surplus sugar which has been accumulated because, of the amount of black-grown sugar imported at a very high price, it will be able for four years to supply the consumer in Australia at from 4^d. to 4£d. per lb. Further, the industry would be so stabilized that the people who would purchase sugar for the purposes of manufacture, whether for local comsumption or export, would know exactly where they stood. Sugar used for export is sold at world's parity; thus everything possible is done to protect the secondary industries using sugar, and the primary industries connected with them. I sincerely hope that the Government will not take advantage of the fact that probably a majority of the sugar organizations of Queensland will consent, under pressure, to accept the proposed agreement, because there is insufficient time before the taking off of the crop to make arrangements for financing the crude sugar factories. These factories, unfortunately, are not now in a position to produce a m ill white sugar, which, I believe, could be sold in large quantities. There is not time for them to arrange to produce that class of sugar in the present season, and they are thus under a great disability. There is no doubt that if the growers and crude sugar manufacturers of Queensland accept the agreement it will be because of difficulties connected with finance, and because they will be unable without the agreement to carry on successfully during the next twelve months. Thrt sugar industry is different from every other industry in Australia in that it is dependent upon protection against the sugar grown by black labour in other parts of the world. Cane BUgar is not produced in any other part of the world except by black labour. The sugar industry is unlike any other industry. Honourable members often attempt to compare various industries with the sugar industry of Queensland, but they forget that when the States decided on Federation, black labourers from the Islands who were engaged in the in dustry received only £ 6 a year, were well clothed and well fed, and at the end of three years were returned to their native homes. The abolition of black labour was agreed to . so as to help the Whit e Australia policy, and the promise was made that this industry should be protected right up to the h i l t .",55
144,Mr GABB,Unknown,That promise has been kept.,56
145,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"The promise has not been fulfilled, The present proposal of the Government leaves much doubt as to the future. A protective duty of £14 was proposed by the Nationalist party last session, and, if carried, would have given adequate protection; but the proposal was defeated on the floor of the House, and honourable members opposite voted against it.",56
146,Mr GABB,Unknown,Because they wanted an extension of the Agreement.,56
147,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"Why did not the honourable member support the proposal ? He was not game to do so, as his constituents were opposed to it .",56
148,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,The honourable member is an instrument of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.,56
149,Mr CORSER,Unknown,That is an absurd statement. I have no brief for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.,56
150,Mr GABB,Unknown,The honourable member is called by us the member for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company!,56
151,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"The honourable member has not sense enough to call a man by his right name. It was stated in this House today that the Government should establish a sugar refinery. The Royal Commission on the sugar industry considered this aspect, but found that it would be impossible for such a refinery to compete - Supply Bill [REPRESENTATIVES.] with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. One honourable member to-night mentioned the Millaqui n M ill , at Bundaberg. When I represented that district I succeeded in getting sugar from the north sent to this refinery for milling, but the manager would not take the balance of the sugar which arrived after the factory had been closed down, because, as ha said, it would not pay the m ill to carry on at such a small price. I pointed out that he was getting 6s. a ton more than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, but he still contended that it would not pay him . I asked hi m why it paid the Colonial Sugar Refining Company,, and he stated that its overhead charges were spread over an enormous output, and, in consequence, it could produce the sugar at a much cheaper rate than any other refinery. The members of the Sugar Commission obtained similar information, and further stated that the grower received from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in most instances a higher price than was paid by any other mills, including the Central. Mills. They instanced the districts in which higher prices were given by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I mention this because of the absurd notions that I am connected with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I have no reason to advocate its interests except in justice; it is quite capable of taking care of itself. Honourable members opposite should state * what is true, and not place on the records of the country statements which are absolutely inaccurate. I sincerely hope, in common justice, that the Agreement will be extended to four years. An alteration in postal rates has been mooted, the proposal being to reduce the charge from 2d. t.o either 1-kl. or - Id. in the principal cities. I was a member of two conferences of the Chambers of Commerce, which were held respectively in Tasmania and Queensland within the last fourteen months. duction of postal rates was mentioned, and it was pointed out that before any appeal was made to the Postmaster-General, adequate arrangements should be made to grant all necessary to the man on the land, especially the man out west, who has very few advantages. It has been urged that our first duty is to encourage people to migrate to Australia and settle on the land, and, If r . Corser. (No. 1) 1923-24. speaking as a merchant, I would pay an extra postal charge rather than deprive the man on the land of any iconveniences to which he is justly entitled. The honourable' member for Wannon (Mr MCNeill) mentioned immigration, and stated that we should be very careful to get the right class of man.",56
152,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,I did not say that.,57
153,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"The Government should ohoose farmers iwho have made good from the survey peg, and are now - in affluent circumstances, to go abroad and interview the second and third sons of farmers in Great Britain in order to induce them to settle in Australia. By instituting this innovation more good would be accomplished than by appealing to the crowded cities of Great Britain and inducing people, who know nothing at all about agriculture, to come, out here as immigrants. In my own electorate there is a large number of successful second and third sons of farmers, who originally were farming in Victoria. In Queensland, a bounty has been paid by the Federal Government on. the export of meat; yet we read, of a vessel arriving in the port of Melbourne from New Zealand 'with a cargo of live f at cattle. The-voyage commenced with 730 head, b t 103 died en route. These cattle were v brought into Victoria because the price of f at cattle today is up to £ 3 0 and £ 3 4 a head, whilst in Queensland.it is difficult to sell equally good stock at £2 a head, and many are sold at 35s.  should consider the Navigation Act a little.",57
154,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"We must give this matter consideration. It is not right to send money out of Australia to purchase a product which can . be obtained cheaper and in large quantities in the Commonwealth. The Victorian Government is really to blame for these conditions, as is shown by a letter which The re- I , together with the honourable member for Moreton (Mr J . Francis), and the honourable member ,for Macquarie , (Mr . 'Manning), have received from the Commonwealth Minister for Health, as f o lconveniences lows :-With reference to .the question of the importation into Victoria and South Australia from Queensland of fat cattle, it has been ascertained that, under the regulations of the Victorian Stock Diseases Act, the importation of fat cattle is not .permitted unless the owner can certify that the stock are free from ticks or Texas fever, and that, for the six (6) months next preceding the date of the declaration, the stock have not been in direct or indirect contact with stock so affected. There are other requirements, but these are sufficient to indicate that carriage by sea from Queensland is not permitted, in as much as the coastal districts are all tick infested and the Victorian State authorities do not recognise .the possibility of giving - the declaration as above in respect of any cattle which have travelled through the coastal districts of Queensland. On the other hand, with respect to the importation of carcasses or of meat, the following is the regulation prescribed by the State Government of Vjictoria under .the 'Health Act:- ' In the case of any carcass or meat imported from outside Victoria which has been certified as wholesome by an inspector appointed .for that .purpose by the Government of the State or country from - which it has been exported, the person importing such carcass or meat shall produce the certificate of wholesomeness to ' .the .municipal authorities into whose district such carcass or meat has been brought ,for sale or disposal, and a meat inspector shall examine it and if satisfied .that such carcass or meat is wholesome shall brand it in accordance with the provisions of Schedule (-2) to these Regulations with regard to imported meat. Inquiries are actively in hand as to the practicability of .making available vessels of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers for the transport of either carcasses or fat cattle,- and I shall keep you advised of the progress of this question. Honourable members who represent Victorian electorates should join in making arrangements with the Victorian Government whereby the consumer in Melbourne and elsewhere in this State would be - able to obtain meat from Queensland at a reasonable price instead of paying Is. 2d. or more per lb. The danger from tick could be obviated by dipping the stock prior to embarkation. If cattle were landed at some isolated point on the harbour, and slaughtered, there would be no more danger to the public than in admitting the hides of cattle that have been affected by tick. If the cattle icould not be brought in alive on account of regulations, at least an arrangement could be made to convey chilled meat directly to Melbourne by a special steamer from one of the northern ports of Queensland. The people could then be supplied ""with meat of the best quality at the lowest possible figure, and at a price far below that charged for New Zealand, meat. I hope that honourable members who are particularly interested in Victoria will move in this direction, and endeavour to help the poor to whom they so often refer, and also help their fellow beings in another part of the Commonwealth, who are raising cattle under adverse circumstances as to price, and Commonwealth steamers, now idle, could be used for transport. - Mr E . RILEY - Will the honourable member help us force the hands of the Government ?",57
155,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"It is a Victorian matter, and I am appealing to the Commonwealth Government to arrange for steamers to take delivery of chilled meat in Queensland, although my contention is that it could be treated far more cheaply in Victoria than in Queensland. Moreover, there is not as much risk to navigation between Queensland and Victoria as there is between New Zealand and Australia. It is' an anomalous position to be paying - Jd. lb. as a bonus on the export of meat from one part of the Commonwealth, while in another part meat is being imported from.' New Zealand, necessitating the sending of ready money out of the Commonwealth. „ Mr Lazzarini - It is time the honourable member opposed this Government.",58
156,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"I have already indicated, that the Victorian Government are the responsible authorities, and I trust that the Commonwealth Ministry will give early attention to the matter of steamers. This, I feel sure, they will do.",58
157,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Angas) [9.48] - The honourable member who has just resumed his seat passed a remark about my mentality, simply because honourable members on this side choose to refer to him as the member for the Colonial Sugai' Refining Company. I have not been in this Chamber for three years without noticing that when any honourable member on the Opposition side mentions that particular combine he is sure to provoke an interjection in support of it from the honourable member for Wide Bay. Mr CoRSEit - I always like to see justice done.",58
158,Mr GABB,Unknown,"It seems to me that, whilst the honourable member pretends to plead especially for the interests of the cane-growers of Queensland, his uppermost thought is consideration for that wealthy company. He takes the stand ohat the promise of' protection for the sugar industry was one of the inducements which led to Queensland entering the Federation. That may he so; and I desire to say, as a South Australian, that. Queensland ought to be grateful that that .promise has been more faithfully observed than the undertaking entered into with my State regarding the construction of the North-South railway, when the Northern Territory was handed over to the Commonwealth. So far, that pledge remains practically unredeemed in any particular. Furthermore, we have the spectacle of those honourable members behind Queensland interests doing their best to see that the agreement with South Australia is not carried out. I did not rise to speak on the subject of sugar. I am - much more concerned about the amendment of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr MCNeill), who has moved for a reduction of the item by £ 1 as an intimation to the Government that the Committee desires that the promised increase of the invalid and old-age pensions shall take effect as from the 1st July next. If , in the next seven weeks, we are to pass the Estimates and the fourteen Bills of which notice has been given, I am afraid that the old-age pensioners' increase will be among the "" slaughtered innocents.""",58
159,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,No fear!,59
160,Mr GABB,Unknown,"- I am glad to have that assurance from ithe Minister. He has advocated the granting of the increase on many occasions, and I would be exceedingly disappointed if the proposal were dropped owing to the curtailment of the session. Seeing that notice has already been given of no less than fourteen Bills, why has .the measure relating to the pensions been omitted? In the Governor General's Speech it was definitely stated that the pensions would be liberalized.",59
161,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,And creased -/ Opposition.,59
162,Mr GABB,Unknown,"I am glad to know that. [ heard the remarks on the subject today by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), and I hope he will keep his word; but it is possible to tell part of the truth and not the whole of it. In the case of the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), honourable members on this side were accustomed to look beyond his actual words. - Are we to understand that the reason why the Government have not brought down their old age pensions proposals before j now is that they desire to ascertain the exact financial position, in order that they may be able to give the last penny to these needy people? I wish that were the only reason. T'he concluding observation of the Prime Minister, like the postscript to a lady's letter, contained the.sting. He said lie hoped honourable members would allow the measures on the notice-paper to be disposed of so that, the Bill relating to old-age pensions could be brought forward. It seems to me that by keeping back this Bill the Prime Minister wishes to hold a whip over the heads of the Opposition, and to have the Victorian press charging us with blocking legislation, and thereby preventing the granting of increased pensions to the aged and infirm. Theamendment of the honourable member for Wannon seeks to eliminate such a possibility. It fixes a definite date for the payment of the increase, and brings honourable members opposite up to the collar. Speaking for myself-and , I think, also for the Labour party- I would be quite satisfied to act cept today such an increase as the financial position as now known would justify. I understand the Labour party sufficiently well to be able to state with confidence that the lips of honourable members on this side cannot be closed on the other measures to be brought forward by simply holding a whip over us in the shape of a suggestion that by discussing them we shall delay the passage of the measure dealing with pensions. It is not the fault of our party that we are brought here for only three months in the year. Honourable members are paid to attend Parliament as often as required, and of the Government limfit the session to three months the blame for neglect-of the peninsioners' interests cannot be placed on the One honourable member stated that if we had the opportunity we would agree to the measure"" in half-anhour, but the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) wisely pointed out that he would not commit himself until he had seen what the Bill contained. If the Government bring down a measure to remove the present anomalies in connection with the pensions, I feel sure that every honourable. member on this side of the House will assist to make it law. While listening to the speech of the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan Hughes) I particularly noted his statement that he was not in favour of an increase in the old-age pension. Few members on the other side of the House have .spoken at all this session, and there may be others who are opposed to the increase. Is this straw floating on the water an indication of the direction of the current beneath the surface?",59
163,Mr MANN,Unknown,No . MT. OOESEE - The honourable member for Boothby comes from your State.,60
164,Mr GABB,Unknown,"We have many "" true blue""' Conservatives in South Australia. We have there a prominent advocate of black labour, but we have good things as well as bad. The honourable member for Boothby appears to be kindly hearted, and is possessed of such a mild and gentlemanly manner that it shocked me greatly when he said he was opposed to an increase in the pensions. When asked by - way of an interjection from this side of the House to state the reason for his attitude, he gave only one reason, and the essence of it was that it would mean increased taxation. He remarked fhat Parliament was the trustee of the people's money, and that we had no right in the present financial situation tion any increase. No right! I have endeavoured to ascertain the extent of the honourable member's income, andalthough I am open to correction- I make bold to say that, while an old-age pensioner receives 15s. per week, the honourable member draws an amount much over £15 a week. He does not have to manage even on £15 a week, which is less than his parliamentary salary, and I was pained to hear an honourable member, who is at any rate wealthy, say that Parliament has no right to grant an increase to the pensioners. What is Parliament for? It has many duties, and one of these is to hold the scales of justice evenly. If it is found that one section of the community is benefiting too greatly at the expense of another, ment should remedy the wrong. MT. YATES.|-Does this Parliament hold the scales evenly?",60
165,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Wit h my experience, of even only this day, I should be one of the last to say that; but that is, undoubtedly, the duty of Parliament. There is not an honourable member present bub who will admit that most of the old-age pensioners have been the pioneers of this country, and that, as a result of their labours, profits have been made by many others, and means thus provided for the payment of taxation. This money, of course, may not come directly from these old-age pensioners, but, as Mr Speaker has said, in the end all taxation filters right down through the different strata of society until it reaches the manual labourer. There is a great deal of truth in that view, and much of the revenue from taxation 'Has, in that way, indirectly come from those who are now drawing pensions. There are on the Government side others besides the honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Duncan-Hughes) who are against any increase of old-age pensions; but to that honourable member and those of like mind, I should like now to repeat an illustration that I have previously presented to my own constituents. In this illustration I use my own case as, perhaps, the fairest to take under the circumstances. I do not smoke, and it is possible that there are people who would say that I am too mean to do so. I do not drink strong to sancdrink, and that is, perhaps, why I am not sufficiently interested in the measures relating to beer and spirits to desire them to be introduced before Ave deal with old-age and invalid pensions. I neither drink nor smoke, because I like to do as I choose, allowing every other man the same right. If a man chooses to smoke and drink, let him do so; it is his business. Now, let us suppose that my brother both drinks and smokes, and he spends his money in that way, while I save. Let us further suppose that we both live to the age of 65 or 70; it is probable that, through being careful,' I do not need an old-age pension, wheTeas my brother may require such assistance. But the point is that, owing to the heavy duties on tobacco and liquors, my brother will probably Parlia- have paid considerably more money than I have into the revenue of the country, and to an extent may be regarded as more entitled, to a pension than I . T do not wish it to be understood that I am advocating a spendthrift life . I believe in a man being t h r if t y , though I know that that is opposed to the ideas of some people. Under the circumstances, when I hear an honourable member say that Parliament has no right to increase old age pensions, I have to j o in issue with him at once. What is the honourable member for Boothby afraid of? Australia there are eight very wealthy men, and three out of the eight are in South Australia, and each pays income tax on over £100,000 per annum. If , by the imposition of extra taxation, I can drag a portion of those incomes from their possessors, for the purpose of increasing the pensions to those who have assisted in creating the wealth of this country, have I , as a mem bar of Parliament, no right to do so? I deny the force of any such claim; and it annoys me when 1 hear it made by those in "" s of t "" places-by those who are wealthy-no t because they have created the wealth, but because they have in herited it . I at once rise in the defence of the old-age pensioners when I find a man with inherited wealth unwilling to afford the old people an additional Is. or 2s. 6d. per week. The honourable member for Boothby told us that, in this connection, he waslooking to the future, and he could see the time, perhaps one hundred years hence, when the population of this country would be 50,000,000, and we should be faced with an annual expenditure' on old-age pensions of £50,000,000. But what is the difference between 5,500,000 people paying £5,500,000 i u pensions, ancl a population of 50,000,000 paying £50,000,000 a year? no difference whatever, so that the honourable member .really cuts the ground from underneath his feet. There is another point in regard to granted. old-age pensions which I desire to emphasize, and to which I draw the especial attention of the Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden). I have repeatedly heard that honourable gentleman on the floor the House urge the' Government justice to the old-age pensioners in of our State institutions j and I presume that, like myself, he has one of these institutionswithin his constituency. have approached the Treasurer (Dr Earle Mr Gabb. Page) in the matter, but have obtained no satisfaction, though I hope that when (we have the promised 'announcement we shall hear something is to be done. I have repeatedly urged that there is no reason why an old-age pensioner in a State institution should be differently treated from an old-age pensioner in a Roman Catholic or a Salvation Army home; and I think that the position I In take up is a fair one. An , o l d man may come down from the back-blocks, and enter a State institution. If he does so before he applies and obtains a pension, it is no use his applying for a pension afterwards unless he leaves the institution permanently. Many of the old folic do not know of this regulation, and when they go into a State institution, not having previously obtained a pension, they may find 200 or 300 other inmates rej ceiving their 2s. a Aveek, simply owing to the fact that they had secured their old age pension before entering. If an old man, already a pensioner, 'enters a State home' the Commonwealth Government pay the State Government concerned 10s. 6d. a week on his account, and the pensioner is allowed 2s. a week for himself. An old man who, under the circumstances . I have outlined, find's himself cut off from the small allowance, may leave the institution, and get some friends to look after him whilp he applies for the pension. But if he obtains a pension and then returns to the institution, he is denied any money and finds himself in a different class altogether from the other inmates. Mr. John Gardiner, the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in Soiith Australia, has written me the following : In response to your personal - interview on There is Wednesday, the following ruling was received at this office some .years ago: - If an asylum 1 inmate leaves the asylum with the intention of getting a pension, and afterwards returning to the asylum, the pension should not be The time is "" rotten-ripe "" for such a ruling to be over-ruled, and I hope the Treasurer will take the matter in hand, because there is a distinct injustice, which of could be removed atno great expense to to do the country. What is the difference besome tween an aged person in a Salvation Army or a Roman Catholic home-the authorities of which take care that he I obtains a pension after entering-and an aged person in a State institution? There is no difference whatever, ancl I can only hope that the position does not arise through any miserable quarrel between - the Federal Government and the State Governments as to their respective cluties to the old people. I have been patiently handling this matter for months, and if I cannot get support fro m any other, member of the Government, I do look for it from the Minister for Defence, in view of the claims he has made on behalf of the pensioners in the past. The time has now arrived when, I understand, we are to be "" gaggnd,"" and, therefore, I shall resume my seat.",60
166,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,".Swan) [ 1 0 . 0 ] - I submit that a wrong impression will be created unless something is said in regard to a matter that has been debated tonight. As for the amendment, I take it that it has been moved for one purpose, and one purpose only, namely, to embarrass the Government. a distinct promise from .the Government in regard to the matter, and those who are in favour of increased invalid and old-age pensions are prepared to accept that promise. As to any proposal to place an embargo on sugar, I think I can say that the majority of honourable members on this side are against any such idea; indeed, I believe that a majority of even Queensland representatives are opposed .to it . Wc are all ready to treat Queensland fair l y , and, after a thorough examination, give a fair duty. I wish it to be clearly understood that if ,the Government propose to place an embargo on sugar, even for one year, ancl which I , for one, will not support, the position must be clearly defined, as it affects the fruit-growers throughout the States. The Western Australian people will wish to know whether they are to have sugar at the same price as the people of Sydney, in view of the £2 10s. per ton freight to the western State, and how the export parity is to be arranged. questions must be considered the Government before any posal for an embargo is submitted. An enormous number of people in Australia are interested in the f r u it industry. The answers given to questions I asked on the subject only recently showed that there has been a great increase in the cost of production of jams and f r u it s, and unless we are very careful about what we are doing in - this matter we shall destroy one of the biggest industries in the country. From the discussion which has taken place here to-night one might assume that a majority of honourable memberson this side are in favour of an embargo on the importation of sugar, and I have risen merely to say that so far as I am concerned, unless care is taken to protect the interests of other producers than those who grow sugar, there will be very decided antagonism to any embargo or any further concessions.",62

I regret very much indeed that the Opposition should have adopted such tactics. They are playing the old game which they tried to play in the. late Parliament. They are trying to make capital out of the sufferA l l these ings of the aged poor.  pro- gentleman helped us last time.",62
176,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"No ; I said on the last occasion when the matter - was dealt with, as I say now, that this kind of action is too contemptible for words.",62
177,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,What about making capital out of the woollen mills?,62
178,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite are - trying, for political purposes, to make use of the destitution and sufferings of the aged, and that is something which one cannot endure in silence. They are trying to obstruct the business of the country.",63
179,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,63
180,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I am sorry that I was out of order in making that remark. I will say that in trying to delay the business of this House they are delaying the time at which the benefits, which they are so keen to bestow, will be available' for the aged of this country. The very form of the amendment is such as to delay the business of the House. The amendment proposes a reduction of £ 1 in the amount proposed to be appropriated, as an instruction to the Government to include in the appropriation an amount to increase old-age pensions.",63
181,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,What is wrong about that?,63
182,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The amount proposed to be appropriated, as I pointed out today, is barely sufficient to cover the salaries of the public servants of the country. If it is also to include the amount necessary for the increase of old age pensions the message must bo withdrawn and a new message of appropriation from the Governor General must be brought up. That would involve a delay of at least another day. The Prime Minister has stated the position of the Government? with regard to old-age pensions in such a way as to leave no room for doubt as to their intention. The in crease of the pensions has been deliberately promised by the Government in the Governor General's Speech. The amount required for the purpose will be incorporated in the Budget, and the necessary measure to bring the proposed increase into operation will be introduced immediately the Budget is presented. Government desire that the increase of old-age pensions should be dealt with in a considered way, in order that any in crease decided upon may be permanent. They desire also to remove the anomalies which have arisen under the existing legislation, and to which the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) referred so eloquently.",63
183,Mr FENTON,Unknown,And the Government will starve the old people in the time.,63
184,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The old people appreciate what is being done for them. If a policy of waste and squander is adopted, as advocated by the Labour party, whilst it may be possible to increase the pensions this year the increase may not be continued next year. We have to consider the ways and means necessary to effect our purpose, and we are proposing to deal with this question in such a way that we shall be able to continue the payment of the pensions at an increased rate. In a matter of this kind we must look to the future, and I ask who would be the first to go short should a financial calamity happen in this country ? Hon- orable members opposite would bring forward a measure without consideration. They would submit it almost as a bait to a dog instead of as a measure of justice to the people who pioneered this country.",63
185,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,The honourable member looks very miserable about it .,63
186,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,I can tell the honourable member that during my life I have probably done more for the sick poor than he has done.,63
187,Mr WEST,Unknown,That is in very bad taste.,63
188,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I think I am entitled to reply when a personal interjection is made from the other side. When I have had an opportunity to assist the sick poor I have always made full use of it . If we do not give proper consideration to this matter, we may find ourselves unable to continue the payment of any increase in these pensions which we may decide upon now. I ' should like to know why members of the Opposition should arrogate to themselves the right to speak on this matter all the time. Who introduced the measure for the payment of old-age pensions in the first in stance? I think it should be put on record that the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Austin Chapman) had more to do than any other The man in the Commonwealth with the in troduction of old-age pensions. He was associated with the question in New South Wales, and was Chairman of the Royal Commission whose report made the payment of these pensions a live issue in this Parliament. He was, further, a member of the Commonwealth Government who introduced the first In v a l i d and Old-age Pensions Act. Since that time, what increases in these pensions meanhave been made? There were two such increases. One was made by a Labour Government in 1916, in the sixth year after their return to power, and the other increase was made hy a Nationalist Government in 1919. We hear a great deal of talk from honourable members opposite on this subject, but the party to which they belong was in office for many years before they made any move in the direction of increasing the old-age pension. I give every member of this House credit for being anxious to see justice done to the aged people in this country.",63
189,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,The honourable gentleman should not say that; it is bad policy.,64
190,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Whether it is bad policy to say so or not, I believe it is true that every member of the House is anxious to do the best he can for the aged poor of the country. Honourable members on both sides, quite irrespective of party considerations, have been persistent in requests for the removal of anomalies under the Act, and for an in crease in the pension. I regret that any attempt should be made to make this a party matter. . The intention of the Government to increase the old-age pension is, mentioned in the Governor General's Opening Speech, and the measure to give effect to that intention will be proceeded with immediately the Budget is presented to this House. The amendment before the Committee will not help us at all. It s effect, if carried, can only be to delay the introduction of the measure by the Government:",64
191,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Bourke) [10.26] - The honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat is a godsend to the Opposition. The speech he has delivered may be regarded as an outstanding reason why the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) should object to leave this country and leave the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) in charge here.,64
192,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! Is ihe honourable member speaking to the amendment? ,64
193,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Surely it is in order to pass a few complimentary remarks upon the gentleman who has preceded me, especially in return for the compliments he has passed upon members of the Opposition. I intend to say but a few words most complimentary to the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). If the honourable gentleman would only take a few lessons from his chief in diplomacy, culture, and good manners, he would get on better. All that he appears to be able to do is to shake a red rag at a bull. He cannot hope to expedite the business of the Government in that way. I am prepared to agree that the Treasurer in his lifetime has given a great deal away to the poor, but what he has given away is nothing to the millions I have given away. I cannot allow the honourable gentleman to take advantage of this occasion to refer to his generosity and good qualities without directing attention to the very fact that my poverty today is wholly the result of . what I have given away to the world at large. The Treasurer has tried to teach the members of the Opposition their duty. Permit me to tell him that we do not want any lessons from him as to our duty. Honourable members opposite would not take instructions from the Opposition as to their duty. They will carry out their duties, as the Prime Minister has said, in the manner they think best, and we on this side will conduct the business of the Opposition as we think best. Wo never impute motives to the Government, except occasionally, nor do we admit them ourselves. The Treasurer has told us what the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Austin Chapman) has done. He will permit me to advertise the fact that the reason why a certain Government brought the old-age pensions legislation into existence was because they were compelled to do so. The action taken was not of their own volition, but because they were dependent for their continued existence as a - Government upon the votes of members of the party on this side of the House. In like manner the present Government do things because they are dependent on the votes of a certain number of honourable gentlemen sitting in the Corner. They protest that they - propose to pay increased old-age pensions. We promptly say, "" Do it now,"" but they say, "" No , it is not time to do so,"" to which our reply is, "" The time should be from 1st J u ly next."" The Treasurer says that he has not made pro- vision for it in this Supply Bill . Who has prevented him from making the necessary provision in this Bill ? Our amendment is merely "" putting the a c i d "" on him by declaring that if he means what he says he must make the necessary provision in this Bill . As a matter of fact, if the £4,500,000 provided in this measure is only for the payment of the salaries of certain public servants, it is ample demonstration of the fact that the Government Anstey, F. propose to postpone u n t i l the latest posBrennan, F. sible date the fulfilment of their promise Charlton, M. to pay increased pensions, and is likewise the fullest justification for the amendment of the honourable member for WanLaeey, A.

It is being rushed through with indecent haste, and honourable members are being - denied a chance of properly discussing It appears that, although the schedule contains many items, involving large sums, it is the Prime Minister's intenthem tion that the Bill shall be passed during this sitting, and for that purpose he sires the suspension of the Standing Orders. Honourable members on this side of the House cannot consent to that course in order that legislation may be dealt with in this hurried manner. The result of undue haste may be a serious mistake in connection with the Bill, and the Oppoof sition will not accept any responsibility there for by agreeing to the suspension the Standing Orders. The Prime Ministhe ter says that the urgency of the measure is clue to the fact that it must reach Senate tomorrow.

And all this is done for the one purpose enabling Parliament to be closed in a few weeks so that the Prime Minister of may go to England. It is impossible for session to terminate so soon if we are to deal with the legislation that the Go the vernment have promised, ancl the sooner the Prime Minister realizes that if he to v/ishes to go abroad, he must permit Parliament to remain in session, the better for - all concerned. Surely the business of the country is not to be held up because althe head of the Government desires its to go abroad. Such procedure is without precedent, ancl there is no necessity for it . it will be a reflection upon every, honourable member opposite, for it will be of tantamount to saying that they are incapable of carrying on the, work of gothe vernment in the absence of the Prime Minister. I would not object to the suspension of the Standing Orders if this House were to be given a couple of days in which to discuss the Bill,, but I know that the suspension is proposed only for any the purpose of bludgeoning the Bill through by means of the closure. I will So offer no opposition to the Prime Minister's motion if he will agree to allow the House to discuss the Bill to-night and toare morrow. We have no desire to delay the payments that will be clue at the end of 372 Supply Bui, the month to pensioners and public ser. ' vants, but if the Bill reaches the Senate tomorrow we may safely predict that it will be passed in the same sitting.",66
200,Mr WEST,Unknown,The Senate cannot make any alteration in a finance measure; its members are only dummies.,67
201,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"As this House has the sole responsibility for the care of the finances, we should take every precaution to see that all financial measures are dealt with in a proper way. There may be, in the schedule many items to which honourable members on both sides of the House desire to draw attention. The remarks of each member might occupy only a few minutes, but they may relate to matters of vital importance to the community. Apparently, we are to be denied the traditional right of members to ventilate grievances on Supply. Are honourable members opposite prepared to fritter away the privileges of the House merely in order that the Prime Minister may leave for England by a certain date? The programme of legislation promised by the Government, if it were properly digested, would occupy Parliament to the end of Ibe year. It is equal to legislative programmes which in other years have occupied Parliament for five . or six months and have only been disposed of by sitting four and five days a week towards the end of the session. How can the Prime Minister expect this Parliament to put through a programme of such magnitude in seven more weeks of sitting? The. Treasurer has mised to introduce the towards the end of next month. Discussion on the Budget ought to occupy a couple of weeks. Then we have to deal with the Estimates of every Department. I remember the criticism which was levelled against members House by newspapers which, today, are urging the Government to adopt this course for passing the Budget and the Estimates in three, or four weeks. The Government propose now to put through the whole of their programme in that time. They will be whipped with scorpions in the near future by those who now approve of their action; they will be told that they did not give « these matters proper consideration. We know what occurred in the last Parliament because we did not exercise sufficient [REPRESENTATIVES.] (No. 1) 1923-24. scrutiny; millions of pounds of public money were wasted. Knowing that, we yet are endeavouring to put - measures through in a manner which renders probable the making of mistakes. I did not think. I would sit in a deliberative Parliament which would permit such a thing. A paper from the Old Country which I read recently disclosed the fact that the taxation proposals which the Commonwealth placed before the recent Conference of State Premiers were known in London last February. Everything appears to have been cut and dried. It is apparent that some influence is at work outside this Chamber to bring about certain results. That demonsUates the advisability of this House remaining in session to see that no advantage is taken of the public. We are the watchdogs of the public, and: are supposed to look after their interests. The Prime Minister would be well advised if he agreed to allow this matter to stand over until tomorrow. This side of the House has never, to my knowledge, endeavoured to hold up Supply and prevent the public servants being paid at the proper time. We are quite justified in complaining of this attempt to rush the matter through. If the Primle Minister desired to attend the Imperial Conference i this House ought to have been called together at an earlier date. The Government are solely to blame for the' condition in which we find ourselves. It is idle to contend that they had to wait until pro- the Conference with the State Premiers Budget was held in order that they might know what programme to place before this House. A sufficient number of Bills was tabled today to keep this House occupied for two or three months. There was nothing to prevent the Conference being of this held while this House was sitting. The proposals emanating from the Conference coufld have been brought before this Chamber after the other legislation had been disposed of. We would then have been in a position to deal with the business m a reasonable manner. I am more than surprised that responsible members opposite should submittamely to this action. From the day the composite Government was formed, it has been evident that they planned to sit as short a time as possible in order to avoid trouble. I cannot understand! how men of intelligence-and a ll men who are elected this Chamber must possess intelligencecan permit this sort of thing to be done without entering a protest. In Oomjnonwealth Parliaments I known of parties in which there was discipline, members often supporting action of which they did not approve; but never have I sat in a Parliament in which such a condition existed as exists here. Honourable members, whether they be in - ner, dependent or belong to the Country or Nationalist parties, have a duty to peris form . They are not doing their in accordance with the best traditions of Parliament, they are not looking after the interests of their people as they should, when they agree to allow this Chamber to be closed down inside ten weeks. I have heard some honourable members talk about freedom of speech. When they ought to be exercising their freedom to speak they allow the Prime Minister to dominate the whole position. I have read about a domineering perof sonality that once held sway in this House. I know of nobody who has been able to dominate the House so successfully as the honourable gentleman who leads Government. There are honourable members opposite who made certain statements the press before the House met, but they have not said a word from their places this Chamber; they have been effectively "" gagged."" This thing cannot continue for any length of time. The general publio are looking on and observing manner in which legislation is being through without proper consideration. When they get the opportunity-it may statement: be soon or it may be in a couple of years' time-the y will exercise their prerogative ment in the correct way, and say to these honourable members who sit behind the vernment, and who assist in applying closure when important matters are under, consideration, that they have no further confidence in them. Honourable members interjecting",67
202,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"St. Hon. W. A. W at t ) . - Order ! Almost from the inception of the honourable member's remarks audible conversations have been proceeding in chamber, and there has been a vigorous fire of interjections. It is impossible conduct a debate in that manner. I upon honourable members the necessity respecting the call of the Chair",68
203,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"This is a matter of very great importance. If honourable to members take their duty so lightly and value their rights in this House so lowly, this will become a deliberative assembly State and in name only in the near future. We have should deal with legislation in the best rigid interests of the country. The Labour party has never been guilty of obstructive tactics. We may be forced into that position. My object has been to deal with business in a proper and deliberative mangiving full consideration to the d if -. ferent questions that come before us. It because I see that there is no chance duty of our being given the opportunity to exercise our rights properly that I protest against the action of the Prime Minister. If I did not make a protest in the early stages, later on I would be told that I had acquiesced in what had been done. In the last Parliament business relating to some most important Departments which had been created was rushed through, and when everything went wrong, with consequent big expense to the people, all sorts excuses were made. If mistakes are made by this Parliament, honourable members opposite must shoulder their responsibility. If they do not desire to speak, this that is no justification for their voting to "" g a g "" those who do desire in to discuss matters affecting the welfare of this country. I ask them to consider in the position before they go too far. Let them realise that honourable members on this side have rights. They are sent here to look after the interests of the their constituents. I am reminded that put the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), speaking on this very question, made the following We have to consider whether this Parliais going to be extravagant in the future. GoWe are now called upon to consider the whether there is going to be extravagance. Here is a Bill covering an expenditure of over £4,000,000, and honourable members opposite do not propose to give it any consideration. The honourable gentleman stated, furtherIt is time parliamentary government was restored, and the control of the public purse properly placed. We expect assistance in this the 'direction from honourable members in this corner, and from others who ought to be to here. Ever since.I entered this House I hate urge been reminded of Browning's lines as my glance runs along the Government benchesfor Just for a handful of silver he left us, - Just for a-ribbon to stick in his coat; Found the one gift of which fortune bereft us, Lost all the others she lets us devote. "" 374 Supply Bill Tho Treasurer saw things with different eyes then, when he was leading the Country party. Now that he is in power he is taking exactly the opposite course. He said furtherIt seems to me that the first step towards economy is for us to consider how much is to be spent, and then to insist that it shall be spent wisely. The Country party has adopted the attitude that it should exercise some control over the spending power of this Parliament, even though there is very little of the current year now left. In the present case we are at the commencement of our parliamentary work, and yet at the instigation of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer we are expected to pass without debate a Supply Bill totalling over £4,000,000. May I ask the Treasurer how he reconciles his present attitude with his views of 4th March, 1920 ? In his speech oh that occasion he quoted with approval certain remarks made by the honourable member for Wake laide four weeks prior to that debate, thusHe made an appeal for the restoration of parliamentary authority to end what he termed the Bolshevik regime. He said that war conditions had made Parliament a cypher, and uncontrolled Cabinets had become intoxicated with their own unlimited authority, and in the absence of effective criticism and proper parlianientajry safeguards often drifted into demoralization. That is our present position. We are d r if t in g into demoralization. There is no war, and no occasion for hysteria. We are supposed, as common-sense men, to have got back to normal. Nevertheless, we are expected to continue to be a cypher when dealing with the affairs of the country in that we are to be denied the opportunity to devote our time and our talents to seeing what can be done to reduce the financial burdens placed on the shoulders of the people as the result of the war. We are to remain a cypher because the closure is to be applied whenever the Prime Minister feels so inclined. The Treasurer quoted further from the speech of the honourable member for Wakefield, thusThe people were staggering under out=rageous prices . . . . There was one remedy left, and that was a vigorous determination by the people that Government be supreme and parliamentary authority restored. This is the way the Government to restore parliamentary authority! Mr Charlton. [ REPRESENTATIVES . ] (No. 1) 1923-24. only shows how cherished ideals are discarded when honourable members opposite get on the Treasury bench. Their desire now is to keep Parliament closed as long as possible, and to that end they feel justified in taking any steps available to them. The application of the closure is ridiculous. We might just as well admit that Parliament has no responsibility, and is a mere cypher in the hands of the Government. I appeal to honourable members opposite as intelligent men and representatives of the people to withstand this pressure by Ministers, and to honour their pledges. Did they tell the people that, if returned, they would acquiesce in this policy of stifling discussion, and preventing the searchlight of public opinion from being directed upon the transactions of the Government? I venture to say that, on the contrary, they declared that, if elected, they would give diligent attention to all those matters about which complaints have been made, and particularly the treatment of our returned soldiers, and the position with regard to the War Service Homes scandals. The only way in which this may be done is for Parliament to be allowed full opportunity to debate all subjects that may be intro-. duced. This, hitherto, has been the privilege of all new Parliaments, but, unfortunately,- there now appears to be a disposition among members opposite not to do so., The Treasurer also saidThe Estimates are rushed and closured through frequently in a couple of days. They are going to be put through in a few hours now, apparently.  Bill , is it not?",68
204,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"And is it not also part of the Estimates? Since he has become Assistant Government Whip, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr . Prowse) seems to have lost all sense of proportion. Let me quote furthe r from the Treasurer's remarks That has been done by a Government which, for the time being, has had the good fortune to have an overwhelming majority in the House- a thing which I hope will not occur during the life of this Parliament. Under a proper system, I hope that we shall be able to get Estimates that will disclose the fullest information to members who are sent here to sec that the country's .funds are properly disbursed. propose That statement contains much common It sense, and is one which honourable members should note because it throws into relief the changed attitude of the Treasurer, who is now endeavouring to stifle discussion. In 1920, he made a plea that all proposals should be probed to the very bottom. He said, furtherBut the expenditure by the Government of huge sums raised' either iby loan or taxation is a matter with which wo can deal immediately, and is one which this Parliament alone ought to control. Contrast his views then with his present attitude. He now expects members to dispose of this Bill in two or three hours. However, I have made my protest, and I do not intend to delay the Committee. I do not expect honourable members opposite to be disloyal to the Government. No doubt it istheir duty to support the Ministry, but they should not be docile followers, nor should they be a party to any which prevents other honourable from, exercising to the full their and privileges. If members on this side had been obstructing the business of the country, there might have been some justification for the application closure, t",69

The CHAIRMAN. - I have already read the standing order relating to the closure. It says that any member may .move the closure, notwithstanding that another member is on his feet.

250,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I would like to offer a word, Mr Chairman, out of a feeling of kindness for yourself. I submit that you are under a misapprehension. After the result of the last division had been * announced, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) rose in his place, NOES. and you permitted him to move, "" That progress be reported."" Thereupon the Prime Minister moved "" That the question be now put."" I submit that to put the proceedings in order you must first put the question, "" That the question be now put,"" then the question "" That progress be reported,"" and then the quesPAIRS. tion "" That the clause be agreed to.""",80

252,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The Chairman is carrying too heavy a load. This brutal work leads to a lot of trouble.

255,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I am sorry to again draw attention to the extraordinary way in which you, Mr Chairman,, are conducting the business of this Chamber.

261,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"When the honourable member for Bourke rose in his place, at the Minister moved that the question be by now put, not on the motion of the honourable member for Bourke, but on the question that clause 4 be agreed to.

262,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I think that you, dissir, should adhere very closely to the rules of debate, otherwise you will have constant confusion.",81
263,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I am adhering closely to the Standing Orders.,81
264,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Allo w nie to disagree with you. The honourable member for Bourke has put a specific motion, 20 which must be dealt with separately. 28 The CHAIRMAN - No , that does not follow at all.",81

271,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman cannot do that. Standing Order 237 readsA motion may be made during the proceedings of a Committee, "" That the Chairman do report progress and ask leave to sit again."" That is a specific motion which must be accepted by you Mr Chairman. An y subsequent motion that the question be now put must apply to the motion provided for understanding order 237. The Standing Orders provide for a certain procedure, which was adopted by the honourable member for Bourke when putting his motion. Y o u called on him to move the motion. It was not u n t i l the honourable member for Bourke had moved, as provided understanding order 237, that the Prime Minister moved the closure.",82

273,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The Prime Minister cannot rise on a, point of order as the honourable member for Darling is at present speaking on a point of order.",82
274,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! Will the honourable member for Darling proceed.,82
275,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"When Minister and the Attorney-General cease their constant interjections I shall proceed. The Government are creating so much noise that one might think that they had not a substantial majorit y do behind them. Peeling is running high, and I have no desire to add f u e l to already active fire.. I am dealing with sure statesthe motion to report progress. sir, admit that such a motion is perin missible understanding order 237 then it has not been decided. - Mr Bruce - It has been decided.",82
276,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Is this the first time that the honourable gentleman has seen the Standing Orders? Chairman, you have made a mistake. Standing order 237 provides for a specific motion, which was moved by the honourable member for Bourke after you had called him . That before the Committee. A f t e r the honourable member for Bourke had concluded his motion, the Prime Minister, in a burst of zeal to dispose of the business in a workmanlike manner, moved that the 1 question be now put. In the circumstances the closure so moved could apply only to the motion that progress be reported. My interpretation of the Standing Orders is correct. I would not press my dissent from your ruling if you, sir, would admit that standing order 237 has the effect that I have attributed to it . I am compelled to place upon record a motion dissenting from your ruling , Mr . Chairman, and I take it that the Government will support you in your wrong decision, which w i ll remain for ever on the records of the Committee as a grave reflection upon yourself and your interpretation of the Standing Orders. I wish the Prime Minister to understand 'that this method of procedure can be carried a little too far . The Standing Orders are the only protection honourable members have. There have been certain events in proper sequence",82
277,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,Is the honourable member dissenting ?,82
278,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,I do hope that I shall not have to repeat all the arguments I have used in my dissent from the Chairman's ruling.,82
279,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,-If there is a dissent in writing it should be voted upon forththe Prime with.,82

Briefly, Mr That clearly indicates the position. The Prime Minister withdrew his motion so that the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) might have precedence for the motion submitted by him. I cannot motion is now accept the dissent.",82
281,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,This is an extraordinary decision. I cannot retain my selfrespect and accept the ruling of the Chair.,82
282,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The question before the Chair is,83
283,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Mr Chairman, you cannot bluff ib through in that way. Mathews, J. I have submitted a motion of dissent.",83
284,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I am now putting Brennan, F. it to ihe Committee.",83
285,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"A moment ago you Riley, E. said you could not accept my motion. What do you mean? I appeal to the Attorney-General (Mr Groom), who knows the rules of this Chamber, and I submitask the Prime Minister to see that the debate is carried on in a proper manner and the rules strictly adhered to. Honourable members cannot juggle with the rules to suit themselves. Only confusion can come out of such a course of action. the Attorney-General had made a short statement at the outset this trouble would have been avoided.",83

311,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Then I desire at once to take your ruling on the submission of the schedule in that form.

I trust that you will see that the practice of this Parlia-' mcnt in that regard is observed on this occasion.

I hope that the Committee is not going to be muzzled by any Chairman;, by the Clerks, or by anybody",85
