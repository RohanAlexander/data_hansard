1,Mr SPXAKBK,Unknown,"Hon. W. It . Nairn) took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. CITRUS INDUSTRY.",12
2,Mr SPOONER,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Supply and Development make a statement with respect to the citrus position, as it is affected by the requirements of citrus juices for the Army? Will the honourable gentleman explain the evident need for the promulgation of a freezing order, so that a quota system may be applied to thousands of growers? Will he indicate whether or not his department is prepared to release as quickly as possible sufficient citrus fruits the reasonable requirements of the public, having regard to the special situation caused this year by drought and Army nneds?",12
3,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"by leave-Contro l of the citrus fruit industry has been exercised for one purpose only, namely, to procure most urgent andessential snpplies of citrus juices in order to meet the requirements of the armed forces in the northern fighting areas. The health of the troops in the north is causing the greatest concern to the responsible authorities. In the absence of fresh green vegetables and other foodstuffs which provide the necessary vitamin C content, it bas been determined by the most competent authorities in Australia that large quantities of citrus juices are necessary to maintain the health of the troops. The whole question of control has been discussed most carefully with representatives of the citrus-growing industry. The determination to issue in New South Wales an order controlling the citrus fruit supply within that State was taken only Rfter full discussion, and with the full concurrence of the citrus-growing indus^ try. I wish to make it perfectly plain that there is no intention on the part of the Government to freeze the whole of the available stocks of citrus fruits. On the contrary, under the quota system that has been applied a percentage of the crop bas already been released, and additional stocks to meet the needs of the civilian population will be automatically released immediately the requirements of the processing firms have been met. Probably not more than 10 per cent, of the total citrus crop will be taken for defense needs. Whilst the percentage in regard to certain Valencia oranges reached as high as 30 per cent., the balance of the crop will be available for the public. Any absence of stocks of citrus fruits, therefore, will be due not to Government action but to the action of selfish individuals who consider only their own wants and ignore the needs of the children by purchasing large quantities of citrus fruits and holding them in store. If all will restrict their demands for oranges to what may reasonably be regarded as necessary, it will be found that the quota system that has been instituted will enable the essential needs of the civilian to meet population to be met.",12
4,Mr MARTENS,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Supply and Development aware that immediately after the announcement was made that supplies of citrus fruits were to be frozen, the price of oranges was increased hy 4s. a case, and the retail price, for oranges and apples by Is. a dozen? Will he see that, in future, before government announcements of the kind arc made, the interests of the consuming public will be properly protected ?",12
5,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"The statement. I kave just made indicates to the public that the percentage of citrus fruits to be taken for the forces is a comparatively small one compared with the total crop. If the public would play the game, there would be no need for price increases of the kind mentioned, nor would it be necessary to take action to control the situation.",13
6,Mr MABTENS,Unknown,What is the Prices Commissioner doing?,13
7,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"I am not here to criticize the Prices Commissioner. realise that the problem of fixing and controlling prices is a colossal one; but we have to face it. The Prices Commissioner is dealing with this matter at the present time. His branch is under the control of the Minister for Trade and Customs, to whom I shall refer the honourable member's question. In the meantime, we are doing all we can to stabilize prices. CIVIL AIRCRAFT.",13
8,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,Will the Minister for Air state what are the guiding principles in deciding the civil aircraft that shall be withdrawn from a long-established service in order to supply other essential requirements?,13
9,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"Whenever it becomes necessary to withdraw civil aircraft from an ordinary service, the principle is observed of causing as little turbance as possible to the existing services, and where the least service is provided to supply the best flow of air craft that may be available for those places which are restricted in respect of other forms of transport. NA INDUSTRIES.",13
10,Mr FRANCIS,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"As chairman, I present the fifth progress report of the Joint Committee on Rural Industries. In movingThat the paper be printed, I hand.to the Clerk of the House a jarcontaining mill-white sugar, in order that the recommendations made in the report may be the better appreciated by honourable members and senators. Question resolved in the affirmative. ACS FALSTEIN , S. M",13
11,Mr CALWELL,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"I ask the Minister for Air the following questions:1. Is it a fact that the honourable member for Watson, who is AC2 Falstein, S. M., has been sentenced by a Royal Australian Air Force court martial to 28 days detention in Holdsworthy Military Camp? 2. If so-(a ) Is the honourable gentleman satisfied that AC2 Falstein received a fair trial ? (Z>) Does he intend to take action against Squadron Leader A. R. I Gorrie, who abused AC2 Falstein by saying "" It is like your hide to make an illegal request. Just because you are a member of Parliament you can't do everything."" ? 3. Is it a fact that Squadron Leader Gorrie was removed from the command of Bradfield Park Station, and was subsequently reinstated by the exercise of pressure on the Air Board? 4. On the facts disclosed, does the honourable gentleman consider that Squadron Leader Gorrie is a fit and proper person to continue to hold his present rank and post? 5. Will the honourable gentleman move for the appointment of a select committee of this Parliament to review all the circumstances of the case and report thereon ? 6. Is Holdsworthy military gaol the filthy hole that it was when the present disMinister for Lahour and National Service, in this Parliament about eighteen months ago, attacked the conditions that he alleged existed there ?",13
12,Mr DRAKEFORD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"It is a fact that AC2 Falstein was tried by court martial and was awarded 28 days detention by a properly constituted tribunal. I cannot furnish the information sought in regard to the record of Squadron Leader Gorrie. But I can express the belief that the tribunal which tried AC2 Falstein dealt with his case in the manner laid down by Air Force law. I voice no opinion as to the merits of the sentence that it promulgated, because I do not consider that I am qualified to do so. Experts in sueh matters advise the officials as to whether or not a court has heen properly constituted, and the proper procedure followed. If AC2 Falstein is dissatisfied with the sentence promulgated against him, he may appeal to the Air Board, and, should he so desire, subsequently to the Governor General. That course is open to either him or any one who may advise him to take such action, if the punishment awarded be considered greater than is warranted.",13
13,Mr BRENNAN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"I ask the Minister for Air whether a record is taken of the proceedings of courts martial which sit to hear disciplinary charges against members of the Royal Australian Air Force? If so, is the Minister supplied with a copy of the proceedings? In that event, will the honourable gentleman make available, for perusal by honourable members of the House, the reports of proceedings in cases which may be of particular interest to them?",14
14,Mr DRAKEFORD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Record s of proceedings are kept. I believe that they are made available to the Minister if he desires to see them. In one case the records were made available to me. It is obvious, however, that a Minister who read the proceedings of every court martial would not be doing his job properly.",14
15,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"""What about when a member of this House is affected?",14
16,Mr DRAKEFORD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"I did not understand the question to relate to a '-ourt martial of a member of the House, r was asked whether reports of proceedings were made available to the Minister. One bas been made available to me. I suppose I would be the authority to decide whether such a report should be made available to any one else. I understand that records of serving members are regarded, as personal and secret, and that, therefore, they should not be made available to private members. MEAT INDUSTRY.",14
17,Mr MARWICK,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Will the Minister Board. for War Organization of Industry table the correspondence containing the request which he .said lie had received on the 29 th April from the Central Wool ing the workers. Committee and the Australian Meat .Board, to examine the wool and meat inin dustries?",14
18,Mr DEDMAN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"I undertook last investigators week to make inquiries and furnish reply as soon as possible. I am not able to lay the correspondence on the table of the House because I have not got it, but I shall do my utmost to get the information for him. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY.",14
19,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Can the Attorney-General say whether it is a fact that, at the Richmond Main Colliery, in the northern coal-fields district of New South Wales, the miners, after going down the mine only five minutes late on two successive days, and after having been at work producing coal for 35 minutes, were recalled to the surface by the management, which directed that the knock-off whistle be blown? If this be so, did not the action of the management constitute a breach of the recently issued regulation governing the coal-mining industry? What action does the Government propose to take sgainst the mine-owners for sending the men home, thus losing the production of thousands of tons of coal from the largest coal-mine in Australia?",14
20,Dr EVATT,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"The honourable member's question gives me an opportunity to slate the procedure which is followed in these cases. When a stoppage occurs in any mine, including the stoppages to which the honourable member has referred, an immediate investigation of the affair is made by officers of the Investigation Branch, whose report is sent to Sydney for consideration. In every case the investigating officers insist upon getting the. versions of both the employees and the employers. When that is done, counsel advises whether a prosecution shall take place or not. In some instances, where employees have been responsible for a stoppage, they have been fined by the lodge, and in, I think, two cases the lodge itself has been fined by the District",14
21,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,The procedure is very expeditious when it is a matter of punish,14
22,Dr EVATT,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"The difficulty always is finding the facts, and if the facts are as stated by the honourable member, the will report to that effect, a and a proper decision will be reached. AJ.J-. J AMES - I ask the Prime Minisler wJiethi:r it is a fact that the Government hfies deeded nor, to allow any further trans ter of former miners who are s now working in other industries back to :iie coaJ-mining industry. Many such men were cavilled out during the depression years, and they are now anxious to return in order to fill vacancies that bcun caused as the result of the provision in the New South Wales Miners Pensions Act for the compulsory retirement of miners at the age of 60 years. These retirements have caused an acute shortage of labour in the coal-mining industry. In view of this fact, will the Prime Minister give consideration to repealing the Government's decision so that the men may return to the coal-mining industry? The vacancies cannot be filled by ordinary labourers because experienced miners are needed.",14
23,Mr CURTIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,Many persons who left the coal-mining industry were transferred to otlher industries that are now of equal importance with coal-mining in the war effort.,15
24,Mr JAMKS,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"'They are only doing labouring work. ,",15
25,Mr CURTIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Thos e who are engaged in protected industries are under the control of the man-power authorities, and I am certain that, having regard to all of the circumstances, the decision that has been reached is the best possible. ABC. WEEKLY.  from one of my constituents the followthe ing telegram:Re austerity campaign: Why does Curtin allow £G00 a week loss on ABC. Weekly7 I should like to know from the Prime Minister why he does allow it?",15
26,Mr CURTIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"The ABC. Weekly published by the Australian Broadcasting still holds good. Commission in pursuance of powers vested in it by statute. The question of whether the Government should interfere with the publication has been before this administhe tration, and was before the previous one. It has also been considered by the Joint Parliamentary Committee which was set up to consider matters pertaining to broadcasting. The report of that commitand meat industries? tee was submitted to Parliament, and contained a recommendation that the publication of the journal should be continued. The Broadcasting Bill, which was passed by Parliament, made provision for the continuation of the publication. Therefore, the question is not associated with the campaign for an improved outlook on the subject of the war, but it could have a have bearing on the matter of newsprint supplies which may, in the months ahead of us, decide whether the ABC. Weekly, and other publications, also, shall be able to continue. The matter is now under consideration. NA INDUSTRY.",15
27,Mr COLLINS,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"Has the Minister for War Organization of Industry seen the statement in the Melbourne Age, of the 9th September, in which the Premier of Victoria, commenting on the plan for the rationalization of the wool industry, said that he trembled to think what would happen to this important industry once it came under the control of those who seemed intent on rationalizing everything they could think of? Having regard to this statement, and to the many protests that have followed the Minister's original announcement, will he postpone any further action until organizations directly interested have been consulted, and their opinions obtained ?",15
28,Mr DEDMAN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"I have not seen the statement referred to; but I point out that the statement which was made to press on this subject was of a general character. I said in this House last week that, before regulations were drafted to give effect to the basic principles of the plan, I would be willing to hear representations from any section of the is industry whatsoever, and that promise",15
29,Mr MARWICK,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"In view of the difficulty experienced by the Minister for War Organization of Industry in finding correspondence received from the Central Wool Committee, I ask the Minister for Commerce whether he received any correspondence from that body asking for the rationalization of the wool",15
30,Mr SCULLY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,No . RED CROSS SOCIETY .,15
31,Mr SHEEHAN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"Can the Prime Minister say whether the labour and industrial movements, with which are associated more than half the population of Australia, are represented on the central council, or central executive, of the Australian Red Cross Society? If not, does he not think that this side of the House should be represented if the society is to be representative of the Australian people as a whole? Will he bring the matter before the chairman of the society? If he cannot give an answer now, will he institute inquiries *o that a statement may be made on the - iibject later?",16
32,Mr CURTIN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"I do not know whether or not it can be said that this side of the House is adequately reprewill sented on the central council of the Red Cross Society, or, indeed, whether it is represented at all. I know several ladies and gentlemen on the central council, operates and, as for their politics, I should that some of them are supporters of the 1'iutod Australia party and others are not. In any case, the Red Cross Society is a purely voluntary organization, and for betting? T do not think that the point raised in the honourable member's question is one for me to determine. DAIRYI NG INDUSTRY. ^ Mr BERNARD CORSER - Has facilities Cabinet yet considered the report of the special committee which was appointed to investigate the application by the dairying industry for approval to in crease the prices of dairy produce?",16
33,Mr SCULLY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"Cabine t is now condecision, sidering the report, and will reach decision at an early date.  for Commerce say what steps, if any, have been taken to ensure that tories shall receive some relief with respect to the acute depletion of skilled labour in those factories owing to enlistof other matters. ments, which is likely to make it impossible to process the amount of cream and milk offering?",16
34,Mr SCULLY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"The whole matter of the. dairying industry is being taken up by the Department of Commerce in Gilbert and Sullivan. conjunction with the Department of Labour and National Service. The Director-General of Man Power has given a direction whereby a practically total exemption has been given to skilled operators in the dairying industry, especially in butter factories. Whenever dairying companies apply for the release of skilled operators the Man Power authority immediately asks the Army for their release. Everything possible has been done to preserve the industry. GAMBLING. TRANSMISSION OF MAILMATTER .",16
35,Dr PRICE,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"Has the Prime Minister seen the complaint by the Premier of Victoria that until the Commonwealth prevents the transmission through the post of money for lotteries, the State be powerless to act, and that the effective enforcement of the law againsi starting-price betting will be almost impossible unless the Commonwealth cof u l l y with the States? In view say of the importance of this statement to the austerity campaign, will the Governmen expedite its decision as to whether or not it shall continue to offer facilities",16
36,Mr CURTIN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"A few days ago, the Premier of Victoria sent me a note in very general terms, the contents of which were substantially what is contained in the honourable member's question. He declared that postal and telegraphic are used by starting-price bookmakers. Upon any person being convicted in the courts of being a starting-priep bookmaker, I have no doubt whatever that it will then be practicable for the Commonwealth-, in pursuance of the judicial to declare that he shall not be a granted telephone facilities. The Commonwealth Government cannot examine mail matter for the purpose of ascertaining whether a letter contains a butter facbetting proposition.",16
37,Mr CALWELL,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,The Government makes such an investigation in respect,16
38,Mr CURTIN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"The Government does a lot of things which, it is true, are noi to the satisfaction of every body. Mr ARCH IE CAMERON - The Prime Minister's .""statement would have satisfied",16
39,Mr CURTIN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,I am sure that the honourable member as an admirer of Gilbert and Sullivan will approve what I have said. ALLIED FORCES. TRIAL OF CIVIL OFFENCES.,17
40,Mr BRENNAN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"I have heard it reiu ported that, in a few cases where American troops in this country have the organization? committed serious offences against our criminal law, our courts have dealt them in the usual manner. Some time ago, the Prime Minister indicated that regulations had been promulgated to perrestrictions mit the American Army to deal with The such cases. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the Government exercises any discrimination in deterSupply mining whether some cases shall be dealt with by the American military authorified ties, and others by Australian courts?",17
41,Mr CURTIN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"The arrangement which has been made with the American Forces in Australia is identical which would operate in respect of British Forces in Australia, or Australian Forces in a British theatre of war. The Commonwealth Government exercises no discrimination. If the Commander-inceived Chief of the visiting forces requests the person detained shall be handed over to his authority for trial, that procedure is followed. If the honourable gentleman will bring to my notice any instances of alleged inconsistencies, I shall ascertain explanation ? whether they arose as the result of the Commander-in Chief of the American Forces not making a request that the person detained should be handed over to an American court martial. AUSTRALIAN WOOL CLIP.",17
42,Mr ABBOTT,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"Will the Attorney General inform the House whether, in his discussions with the British Government for an increase of the price of Australian wool, there was ever at any time a suggesstill tion that the clip should be curtailed ?",17
43,Dr EVATT,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,That suggestion was never made. BLIND WORKERS UNION .,17
44,Mr OONELAN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"I have just received from the Blind Workers Union of QueensGovernors land an SOS message to the effect the "" freezing"" of supplies of cane has caused the displacement of 40 persons of from employment. Does the Minister for War Organization of Industry consider that it was necessary to restrict supplies of cane to the Blind Workers Institute? If so, will he ensure that the persons affected by the order are absorbed war industries? Otherwise, will he make available supplies of cane through",17
45,Mr DEDMAN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"I was not aware that with blind workers in Queensland or elsewhere in the Commonwealth had lost their employment as the result of the imposed on the supply of cane. restrictions have been applied, not by the Department of War Organization of Industry, but by the Department of and Development. I shall ascertain whether the restrictions can be modiin order to make supplies of cane available to this section. If that be not possible, action will be taken to absorb the unemployed men in some industry with that producing war materials. .GRANT TO TASMANIA.",17
46,Mr BECK,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"Has the Treasurer yet refrom the Postmaster-General's that Department an explanation of how the error occurred in the telegram from the Prime Minister to the Premier of Tasmania announcing the grant to be made to that State? If not, will he obtain the",17
47,Mr CHIFLEY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"I have not yet received from the Postmaster-General's Department the explanation of the exact manner in which the mistake occurred, but the Postmaster-General has informed me that the statement will be available in a few days. VICE-REGAL TRAVEL.",17
48,Mr JAMES,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"I ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that the Governor General and the Governors of the States travel by rail in special coaches? As the right honourable gentleman has appealed to the nation to live more austerely, and as the transport of essential commodities is now delayed because of the congestion of rail traffic, will he ask the Governor General and the State to use the same facilities for that travel as the "" common herd "" ? ' Mr. Curtin - I am not aware that there has been airy use of special cars in the circumstances narrated by the honourable member. It is quite possible that that is the case. Special cars have been provided for many years for the use of the representatives of His Majesty the King when travelling on Australian railways. I shall have the matter looked at. TRANSPORT OF RACE-HORSES.",17
49,Mr HARRISON,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"Has the Prime Minister seen the statement published in morrow. the Sydney Daily Telegraph of Monday that the secretary of a Newcastle Jockey Club bad said that be was not at all concerned with the restricstatement, tions placed on the transport of racefor horses by rail as several trainers had told him that they proposed to ship their race-horses to the Newcastle race ing? Does the Prime Minister not conobtain sider that that is a direct evasion of regulations made to restrict the transport of race-horses? Does he propose to reof the hearing? strict the carriage of race-horses by ships?",18
50,Mr CURTIN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"I did not see the rerespect ference in the newspaper, but it was tioned to. me that some such statement had been published. I have only to in respect of racing that regulations will be gazetted either this evening or toappeared in the press. morrow. With respect to the honourable member's question about transport, have no doubt that the Transport Control Board will deal with that, as already dealt with it, so far as railway traffic is concerned. I very much doubt the practicability of shifting horses by ship, because I very much doubt the capacity of this country to shift a lot of other things by ship. We have to ship requirements for war and we are already taking a heavy toll of the ordinary shipping facilities of this country. Increasing demands will be made upon our shipping for war purposes, and I cannot imagine that there will be much space left in the general public. remainder of the shipping services for the transport of race-horses. . MB. J. A. MENDES.",18
51,Mr RANKIN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"Is the Minister for the Army able to lay on the table of the House today the file regarding Mr. J. A. Mendes, Mayfair Hotel, Darlinghurst, which I asked for in this House on Friday? If not, will the Minister arrange for the file to be tabled tomorrow ?",18
52,Mr FORDE,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"The case in which Mr. Mendes applied for exemption from military service on the grounds of great hardship was before the Central Police Court, Sydney, yesterday, and it was necessary for the file to be there. I shall ascertain whether it can be here toLater:",18
53,Mr RANKIN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"Accordin g to a press the application by Mr Mendes military exemption was before the court yesterday, and was adjourned until next Tuesday. If that is so, will the meetMinister for the Army endeavour to the file for the perusal of honour the able members and arrange for its return to the court in time for the resumption",18
54,Mr FORDE,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"I said earlier that a request by the honourable member in of this file will be considered. menApparently, the honourable gentleman has had advice that the hearing has been say adjourned by the police magistrate.",18
55,Mr RANKIN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,A report to that effect,18
56,Mr FORDE,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"In any event, the case I is sub judice. I again inform the honourable member that I shall give conit has sideration to his request. TREASURY-BILLS.",18
57,Mr JOLLY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"Can the Treasurer tell me whether treasury-bills are now being issued to the public and, if so, at what rate of interest ? Or are all these treasury bills being taken up by the Commonwealth Bank?",18
58,Mr CHIFLEY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,So far as I am aware they are not being issued to the,18
59,Mr JOLLY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,They are all being taken up by the Commonwealth Bank?,18
60,Mr CHIFLEY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,No TRADING HOURS.,18
61,Mr ANTHONY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"A butcher at Coolangatta was fined £2 with £2 2s. costs for having opened his shop ten minutes before 7 a.m. I ask the Prime Minister whether it is consistent with the Government's policy to endeavour to obtain the maximum degree of work from everybody that people should be prevented from working longer hours? If Prime Minister considers that there should be greater encouragement for effort in this country, will he ascertain whether the industrial laws cannot be made more flexible so that people may be encouraged to do extra work?",18
62,Mr CURTIN,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"If the citizen referred to was convicted by the magistrate, obviously he must have committed a breach of some law. If the law was a law of the Commonwealth, and was harsh cost or worked detrimentally, we should be titled to review it, but I do not to ask the States generally to review their early closing acts. I do not think rhaf that is required. I point out that the honourable gentleman could quite as easily have cited the case of a publican trading outside the prescribed hours. I do not feel disposed to interfere with the working of the laws of the States which fix opening and closing times for various businesses. DEFENCE OF NEW GUINEA.  the Army aware that it is strongly rumoured that our troops in New Guinea are not adequately equipped, that the colour of their uniform makes them an easy target from land or air, and that they are not provided with fly-nets, whereas the Japanese are properly equipped?",19
63,Mr FORDE,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"I have not heard of the rumours to which the honourable member refers, but if he will put the matter in a letter to me, I shall have the statements examined. I advise honourable members to take no notice of these mulga rumours depreciating the Australians and building up the Japanese. NA OF ELECTRICITY.",19
64,Mr BREEN,DIESEL OIL FOR GENERATION,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs arrange for the payment of a rebate to municipal and shire councils in country districts which use diesel oil in the generation of electricity? The cost of electricity generated by means of diesel oil engines is ten times the cost of that generated by coal, and the posithe tion has now become so acute that it will be impossible for the councils to carry on. In many instances railway signalling apparatus is dependent on the maintenance of that source of power.",19
65,Mr BEASLEY,DIESEL OIL FOR GENERATION,"That question opens up a fairly wide field. 1 should hesitate to indicate off-hand which would be the best approach to the matter. So far as supply of power to railway signalling apparatus is concerned, an adjustment of could easily be arrived at. I should enlike to give the matter some thought propose before answering the question. AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION ACT. REPOKT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE .",19
66,Mr BECK,DIESEL OIL FOR GENERATION,Is the Prime Minister in a position to lay on the table of the House the report of the Special Committee on Repatriation?,19
67,Mr CURTIN,DIESEL OIL FOR GENERATION,Not at this stage. MAN-POWER IN RURAL INDUSTRIES. RELEASE OF MEN PKOM ARMY.,19
68,Mr HOLT,DIESEL OIL FOR GENERATION,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister with reference to the right honourable gentium an's recent statement to the House that the Government's expert advisers had counselled against the release of numbers of men from the armed forces for the purposes of harvesting or factory production. Has the right honourable gentleman given consideration to the fact that, both in the war of lft 1.4-18 and in the present war, many countries, particularly Russia and Germany, made a regular practice of bringing men back from the fighting lines at appropriate times to engage in harvesting or munitions production? If that policy can be operated successfully in those countries, can the Prime Minister indicate why a similar policy would be impracticable in'Australia?",19
69,Mr CURTIN,DIESEL OIL FOR GENERATION,"I made the general statement that the Army in this country wa.s not so large as I should like it to having regard to all that is at stake. That is the view of our advisers. I went on to say that, as our numbers were limited, it was of major importance that the trained forces should be kept at a maximum of efficiency. On the best advice that, we could get, the interruption of the training of the Army that would be caused by sending men back to work at industries would affect the efficiency of the Army as a whole, and therefore it would not be in the best interests of the country to maintain civil industries at the cost of diminishing the numbers and efficiency of our armed forces. At the same time, applications arc made for the release of certain men in particular places, and the machinery which, has been set up to deal with such applications has been explained to the honourable gentleman. As to what other countries are doing, I point out that we must take into account the special circumstances of our own country at this stage. I repeat what I said to the House previously, namely, that if I have to take a chance of going short of tucker in the next twelve months and going short of fighting personnel in the next six months, [ shall take the risk of going short of tucker.",20
70,Mr WILSON,DIESEL OIL FOR GENERATION,"Is the Minister for' the Army aware that the refusal of the Army to comply with hundreds of recommendations by the Man Power authorities for the temporary release of men experienced in the shearing of sheep and the slaughtering of lambs and other meat is likely to result in heavy losses to the flock-owners owing to the deterioration of fleeces and the ravages of blowflies, and also cause, a serious glut in the lamb market in the present season, which promises to be one of the best on record? Will not the loss of large quantities of valuable foodstuffs result? Will the Minister arrange an early conference to resolve this problem ?",20
71,Mr FORDE,DIESEL OIL FOR GENERATION,"I know that in some cases in which Man Power officers recommend that a particular man be released temporarily for such work, his commandshall ing officer, who has full knowledge of the ea rly reply. efficiency of the unit under his command, the number of men who were previously be. released from it, and the standard of training that it has reached, decides that the man cannot be spared. There are certain units in Australia-whic h I do not want to name publicly, but which I mentioned at the secret meeting of senators and members-which , in the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Land Forces in the South-west Pacific, must continue their training without interruption owing to the gravity of the war situation. I realise that some inconvenience is being suffered by primary producers and other employers throughout Australia because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient labour, but that is not entirely due to the Army. Many thousands of young men employed in conn try districts have been attracted to more lucrative positions in munitions factories, others have enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, the Royal Australian Air Force, and the Royal Australian Navy, and others have enlisted or have been compulsorily enrolled in the Australian Military Forces. The Government has to look at the complete picture, and intends to be guided in the matteT by its military advisers. As it is considered that even more men will be required for the Army than are at present enrolled, I am not prepared to instruct the Commander-in-Chief to release every member of the Army whose release is recommended by the Man Power authorities. The security of Australia, involving the protection of 3,000,000 square miles' of territory and 7,000,000 people, must bo the paramount consideration. Later:",20

74,Mr ROSEVEAR,RATIONALIZATION OF,"I wish, to ask a question of the Minister for War Organization of Industry in relation to a statement which he made in this House on the 4th March in reply to an interjection, the essence of which was that rationalization was not being applied to the Commonwealth Bank. The Minister said, ""' No, because - the Commonwealth Bank is in an entirely different position from any of the other banks "". Is it a fact that three banks are operating at Barellan in New South Wales, and that the only one which has been rationalized out of existence is the branch of the Commonwealth Bank? Has the honourable gentleman's policy with regard to the rationalization of the Commonwealth Bank been reversed, and when' can we expect the rationalization of the private banks to be finalized ?",21
75,Mr DEDMAN,RATIONALIZATION OF,"I was not aware of the position at Barellan, but if the Commonwealth Bank has been closed there it has not been done at the instance of my department or as a part of any rationalization plan.

It is true that these plans have proceeded very much more slowly than I should have liked, but I assure the honourable member that I am doing all that I can to expedite them.  for War Organization of Industry taken into account, in connection with his plan for the rationalization of banking, the fact that most country branches of banking companies are conducted by managers who served in the last war, and that the personnel consists mainly of men who could not pass the examination for military service, or girls who are not liable to be called up? In such circumstances, does he still intend to insist upon the closing of certain branches of banks in country towns?",21

89,Mr CHIFLEY,RATIONALIZATION OF,"Macquarie-Treasurer ) [4.44 ] - I move1 That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the measure is to implement the recommendations that are contained in the ninth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which was tabled in this House on the 2nd September last, and to provide for the payment during the current financial year of special grants totalling £2,175,000 to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. As honourable members are aware, the commission was established in 1933 for the purpose of inquiring into and reporting upon applications by States for financial assistance under section 96 of the Constitution. The recommendations of the commission for the last eight years have been approved by the Commonwealth Government and adopted by Parliament. The grants recommended by the commission for payment in the year 1942-43 compare with those paid during 1941-42 as follows:1941-42. 1942-43. South Australia.. 1,150,000 800,000 - 350,000 Western Australia 630.000 800,000 + 170,000 Tasmania 520,000 575,000 + 55,000 Total 2,300,000 2,175,000 - 125,000 The actual grants assessed and recommended by the commission for South Australia and ""Western Australia were £1,220,000 and £970,000 respectively. It , however, recommended that of these amounts, £670,000 in respect of South Australia, and £170,000 in respect of Western Australia, be deferred until next financial year.. Thus, actual payments during this financial year will be £800,000-includin g £250,000 deferred from 1941-42-to South Australia, and £1800,000 to Western Australia. Before explaining the reasons for these deferred payments, it is necessary to mention very briefly the principles that have been followed by the commission. In this year's report, it reiterated the principles that had been followed in the past. I quote the following paragraph from its report:The special grants which we recommend hascd on the principle of financial needs, arc determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for a claimant State, by reasonable effort, to function utandard not appreciably below that of other States. Our methods of assessing needs are based fundamentally on comparisons between the financial position of the States, and depend, too, on the financial relations Commonwealth and the States. The commission recognizes that war policy has affected State budgets unbudget, equally, and has thus created further Mr Ohifley. problems in the assessment of special grants. It has made clear that it does not consider that its function is to recommend grants specifically designed to compensate a State for adverse effects of federal war policy. If , as a result of such policy, a drift occur red in the financial position of one or more of the claimant States, the commission would bring the matter immediately to the notice of this Government. Insofar as federal war policy and war finance are reflected in the budgets of the States, however, they are taken into account in Increase or the commission's methods of assessment. Decre/wMi. Jn its last report, the commission stated that circumstances had not yet arisen £ £ £ - which rendered its methods invalid or impracticable for dealing with grants based upon the financial year 1940-41; it had therefore decided substantially to maintain for this year its existing basis of assessment. It is important to remember that the commission's assessments are based on the budgetary results of the States for 1940-41, the latest year for which complete information was available to it. The commission takes into Consideration whatever special conditions may obtain in the years following that on which the grants are assessed. Thus in past years it. has at times, by means of deferred payments or advances, made allowance for any obvious disparity between the normal calculated grants and the current needs of the States. This year, the commission has recommended that £670,000 of the grant of £1,220,000 assessed for South Australia be deferred for payment in 1943-44 because the assessed grant of £1,220,000 is considered excessive in relation to South Australia's financial needs are in 1942-43. Thus, the payment recomand mended for South Australia in 1942-43 i i £550,000, which, with £250,000 deferred at a from last year, makes a total payment of £800,000. In 1941-42, the year following that on which the grant for this year was assessed, South Australia enjoyed a surof the plus of £1,2S7,000, which included the special grant of £1,150,000 for that year. This improvement in South Australia's in 1941-42 was due to increased revenue from railways, income tax, and succession duties. In 1942-43, under uniform taxation, South Australia will receive £458,000 less than the income tax collections in 1941-42, whilst appreciable reductions of succession duties and racing taxation may be expected. On the other hand, owing to Commonwealth war expenditure, the improvement of railway revonup occurred mainly in tihe ""last four months of 1941-42, and may still continue, whilst returns from primary production will be favourably affected by the increase of the price of wool by 15 per cent. After taking these factors into consideration, the commission estimates that payment of £800,000 should be sufficient to meet South Australia's financial needs in 1942-43. The commission also considers that the assessed grant of £970,000 to Western Australia exceeds that State's currentneeds and recommends that payment of £170,000 be deferred until next year. In 194142, Western Australia enjoyed a surplus of £1,768 after receiving a grant of £630,000. The outlook for 1942-43 is conditioned by such factors as Commonwealth war expenditure, compensation under the uniform income tax plan, the trend of railway revenue and expenditure, diversion of man-power from goid-mining to war industries, the prospects for primary production, and the trend of costs. After considering all these factors, the commission is of the opinion that payment of £800,000 should meet the financial needs of Western Australia in 194243. The commission recommends that the grant, of £575,000 to Tasmania should be paid in full in 1942-43. In 1941-42, Tasmania had a surplus of £1,585 after taking into account the special grant of £520.000. In 1942-43, Tasmania will receive as compensation under the uniform income tax plan £222,000 less than the collections in 1941-42. Other important factors are the trend of costs, Commonwealth war expenditure, and railway receipts and expenditure. Thus, prospects in 1942-43 do not warrant postponing the payment of any portion of Tasmania's special grant. For the information of honourable memWestern bers, I submit the following statement [13] showing the trend of net grants paid to States in recent years:Year. South Westeru Australia. Australia. Tasmania. Total. £ £ £ £ 1837-38 193838 1,200,000 1,040,000 575,000 570.000 575,000 410,000 2,350,000 2,020,000 193940 194041 995,000 1,000.000 595,000 050,000 430,000 400,000 2,020,000 2,050,000 194142 1,150,000 030,000 620,000 2,300,000 Proposed 19421943 800,000 800,000 675,000 2,175,000 I shall now give to honourable members a brief explanation of the commission's assessments for each State, with particular reference to the difference between the grants paid in 1941-42 and those recommended for 1942-43. In assessing the grants, the commission's first step is to calculate the normal standard to which the claimant States should be raised. The normal standard is arrived at by averaging the adjusted budgetary results of the non-claimant States. Ever since the commission's inception in 1933, the budgets of the non-claimant States have shown a deficit standard, but for 1940-41 there was a surplus standard of Is. Id. a head. As this surplus standard arose from conditions largely brought about by the stimulus of war expenditure in the non-claimant States, the commission does not consider it a reasonable standard for their purpose. The commission therefore decided to adopt a balanced budget standard as the normal standard. Honourable members will note that the grant of £1,220,000 assessed for Soutfc Australia is £180,000 less than that assessed for 1941-42, although, as I have already mentioned, payment of £250,000 of that amount was deferred until this financial year. Referring to the actual adjustments made by the commission, the amount necessary to bring South Australia's comparable deficit to the normal standard was £99,000 more than that required last year, but this was more than offset by a decline of that State's taxation collections in 1940-41 which, when related to the position in other States, led to a reduction from £455,000 to £152,000 in the adjustment for relative severity of taxation. The grant of £970,000 assessed for Australia is £340,000 more than that assessed and paid in 1941-42. The main factor causing this increase concerns the relative severity of taxation adjustment. Due largely to a decline of the relative taxable capacity of ""Western Australia, combined with a slight increase of that State's taxation collections in 194041, there was an increase of £266,000 in the adjustment for relative severity of taxation. In addition, there was a small increase in the adjustment designed to bring the State's comparable deficit to the normal standard, whilst no penalty was imposed this year on account of ""Road Debt Charges"". On the other hand, an increase of Western Australia's net expenditure per head on certain social services in 1940-41 resulted in an additional amount of £29,000 being deducted from the social services adjustment. The grant of £575,000 to Tasmania is £55,000 more than the grant assessed and paid in 1941-42. This is due largely to an increase of £147,000 in the adjustment necessary to bring Tasmania's comparable deficit to the normal standard, whilst in addition, the penalty for road debt charges was not imposed this year. On the other hand, there was a decrease of £126,000 in the adjustment for relative severity of taxation. This was due to a decline of taxation collections, accompanied by an improvement of the relative taxable capacity of that State. The Government is satisfied that the principles and methods of assessment followed by the commission produce reasonable results, and that the grants recommended for payment to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania are sufficient to meet the financial needs of those States in 1942-43. As in past the Government has therefore decided to adopt the recommendations of the commission, and I commend the bill to honourable members. Before concluding I take this opportunity to express the Government's appreciation of the splendid work done by Sir Frederic Eggleston, who was chairman of the commission from its establishment in 1933 until November of last year, when his appointment as Australian Minister to China compelled him to resign. The Government has been fortunate in securing the services of Mr Chifley. fessor R. C. Mills as chairman of the commission since Sir Frederic's resignation. Debate (on motion by Mr FADDEN) adjourned. NA ASSESSMENT BILL 1942. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 4th September (vide page 87) on motion by Mr. ChifleyThat the bill be now read a second time.",22
90,Mr FADDEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Darling DownsLeader of the Opposition) [4.17] Members of the Opposition do not oppose this measure because we recognize, perhaps better than any one else, the necessity which confronts the Treasurer to tap every available source of revenue in an attempt to bridge the gap between receipts and expenditure. In pursuance of the adoption of a policy of uniform taxation, the Commonwealth is now free to impose a tax upon entertainments and amusements, a field which was previously reserved for the exclusive use of the States. This field has now been vacated by the States, which are to be compensated under an arrangement which will be the subject of legislation that is to be introduced later. It would be unwise for the Government to prevent in war-time the holding of organized sports which, in moderation, serve a useful purpose in maintaining morale, and providing that relaxation which is necessary after a week's hard work. Those forms of sport which years, are wasteful of resources, and do not give a full measure of relaxation, should be investigated, and eliminated or reduced as far as possible. Hitherto, the Commonwealth Government has refrained from imposing a tax on entertainments because of an agreement with the States that this field should be enjoyed exclusively by them. In addition, the reA'enue that would have been obtained if a Commonwealth tax had been superimposed ;on the State taxes would have been small. The introduction of a uniform entertainments tax will overcome that difficulty. If , in the Fro- future, the Government finds that it is necessary to increase the rate of tax, alteration will be introduced with a minishould mum of administrative adjustment, and without the necessity for making allowance for the different rates that have, to date, operated in the various States. When considering this bill, honourable members should realise that the revenue which the Commonwealth will derive from the introduction of this measure will assist in the proper conduct of war and the preservation of our people. Personally, I hope that the bill will only a temporary measure, but at this juncture, no one can prophesy how long it will remain in forceA tax on enterformity tainments should be the means of reductaxes. ing the spending capacity of the people. From this source the Government expects to obtain £2,400,000 during the remainder of this financial year, and £3,250,000 a complete year. How the Government arrived at that estimate I do not know. No doubt, the Treasurer was guided the experience of the States in the lection of entertainments tax. But if the Government considers that their experience provides an accurate guide, is obvious that the Treasurer does not expect that the bill will be anything other than a measure to raise revenue. He has evidently given no consideration to the major necessity for reducing the spendStates ing power of the people in order to divert more money to the war effort. Mi"". CAI.WEI.IJ - How would the Leader of the Opposition divert the money?",25
91,Mr FADDEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"B y a system of postcome war credits. Unfortunately, the Governtax, ment will not adopt that sensible motor proposal. Honourable members should not overlook the fact that out of which the Commonwealth expects to collect from the entertainments tax for the remainder of this financial year, the States will receive £600,000 as compensation for vacating the field. The sum of £1,800,000 will be a meagre contribution towards bridging the gulf of £300,000.000 New South Wales between estimated expenditure and Victoria revenue during the current financial South year.",26
92,Mr JOLLY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Lilley) [4.25] - In comTasmania mending the Government for introducing a. uniform tax on entertainments as a war the measure, I suggest that the principle be extended in order to cover all forms of taxation now levied by the Coman monwealth and State Governments.",26
93,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,What is the honourable member's objection to allowing the Commonwealth Government to impose the entertainments tax indefinitely?,26
94,Mr JOLLY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"I have my own views on that proposal. When the uniform the income tax proposals were under consideration by Parliament, I pointed out be that the plan would not be complete or equitable as between States until the Government applied the principle of unito all Commonwealth and State Therefore, I am gratified to learn that the Government, has taken the first step to give effect to my suggestion. Under the present proposal to impose a for uniform entertainments tax, Queensland will not receive an allocation from the revenue derived, because it did not levy by such a tax. I have no objection colto the non-participation of Queensland in the distribution of this revenue, provided the same policy is adopted when it the principle is extended to cover other taxes. For instance, New South Wales, which receives practically one-half of the allocation under the uniform income tax plan, does not levy land tax, and several do not levy gift taxes, whilst a marked variation is noticeable as between States in estate duties, stamp duties, and liquor taxes. In the past, State governments have raised a substantial part of their revenues from taxes other than intax. These include entertainments probate duties, gift tax, liquor tax, car registration fees, and land tax. The normal revenues of the States were £2,400,000 made up as follows:- income Taxes. Other Taxes. £ £ 15,300,000 7,300,000 0,700,000 6,000,000 Queensland 5,800,000 3,100,000 Australia 2,300,00.0 2,200,000 Western Australia 2,200,000 1,200,000 838,000 990,000 33,138,000 20,790,000 Honourable members will see from those figures that approximately one-third of the revenues derived by New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia were raised from taxes other than income tax, but one-half of the revenues of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania was raised from other taxes.",26
95,Sir GEOBGE BELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"In Tasmania, more than one-half of the revenue was raised from other taxes.",27
96,Mr JOLLY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"That is so. Under the uniform income tax proposals, States which in the past relied to a greater degree upon taxes other than income tax, have been penalized, because their allocations have been reduced accordingly. In other words, taxpayers in those States are required to pay the uniform tax on incomes, aud to make a. higher contribution by way of the other taxes. Apart from that, the introduction of a uniform land tax, estate duty, stamp duty, gift tax, liquor tax, and motor tax throughout the Commonwealth is most desirable. MT. SPOONER (Robertson) [4.30] The Government has done well in taking this second step towards complete uniformity of taxation and the proper organization of .finance in Australia. The revenue from the entertainments tax will be small in comparison with the revenue for which the Government has budgeted; but this legislation is a natural corollary to the uniform income tax to which this Parliament has already agreed. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly) has no cause for complaint, because this bill will do exactly what he says should be done, namely, extend the principle of uniformity in taxation. The measure follows the principle established in the uniform income tax legislation, in that it compensates the States for the amount of revenue which they will cease to collect by vacating the field of entertainments tax. As the result Queensland, which had no entertainments tax, is not entitled to any compensation under this measure, and New South Wales, which had a relatively light entertainments tax, will receive relatively small compensation, whereas Victoria and South Australia, which complained that their compensation was not enough under the uniform income tax, will receive relatively high compensation under this measure. Accordingly, Victoria and South Australia are not so vociferous in their protests against this legislation as they were against the uniform income tax. If the Government applies that principle all the way through the field of taxation, there can be no objection from States which, in their wisdom, have in the past properly exercised their taxing powers. In the last couple of weeks I have asked the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) whether he has heard of a proposal by the Government of New South Wales to impose a new land tax, but his replies have not been very definite.",27
97,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,I did not see the scheme until yesterday.,27
98,Mr SPOONER,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Eo r the last two or three months the details of the scheme have been anticipated in the press, and a State Minister unofficially foreshadowed early legislation. Eor that reason I urge the Commonwealth Government to proceed quickly with the extension of the principle of uniformity in taxation to the land tax field. I shall have no complaints if the State of New South Wales receives no compensation from the Commonwealth by reason of the fact that it has no land tax, and if the States, which do levy land tax, receive from the Commonwealth as compensation, amounts equal to what they would have obtained had their land tax legislation continued. But I should complain if New South Wales, by imposing a new land tax, placed certain revenues beyond the reach of the Commonwealth Treasury, and if the effect of that were that the individual taxpayer would have the advantage of a deduction from his personal income tax return, so that the Commonwealth would be paying a large proportion of the land tax received into the coffers of the State Government. The reason advanced for the proposal to impose a new landtax in New South Wales is that the revenue derived from it will provide a fund for repatriation. I ask the Commonwealth to deal with this matter immediately and to say just who is the authority in Australia to deal with the repatriation of Australian soldiers. This bill is the second step towards uniformity of taxation, and I ask the Government to hesitate no longer than is necessary in proceeding with the third step, namely, the imposition of a uniform land tax.",27
99,Mr HOLT,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Fawkner) [4.35] - The war has brought within the purview of the national Parliament matters affecting the lives of the people which normally do not come within the scope of our consideration. It is one of the weaknesses of the federal system of government, in which there is a division of powers, that many matters, such as health, education, and public recreation, rarely come before this Parliament. I propose, therefore, to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by this measure for the taxing of entertainments to make a few general comments. The needs of the war necessitate a direct contribution from the entertainments industry, and this bill provides for a steep increase of the rates of tax which were previously operating in most of the States. The increased tax has been accepted by the industry, as it will be accepted by the public, as a necessary part of our war finance. It will help, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) has pointed out, to bridge the enormous gap between the anticipated revenue and the anticipated expenditure. I.u contrast to Australia, public entertainment and recreation are regarded by national legislatures in other countries as being of real importance. Since the last war, governments in Europe, Great Britain and the United States of America not only have taken an interest in public recreation and entertainment but also have provided amenities for the people and, in some instances, subsidized activities which were valuable in the community life, but would be difficult to continue under normal commercial conditions. Russia, whether under the Cza.rist regime or the Communist regime, has maintained the justly famed Russian ballet. France and Germany and Italy have spent vast sums on organizing the entertainment of their subjects. Italy has a state-subsidized opera company. Those countries have recognized that live artist shows provide a colour, variety and vitality in community life which lift it above the drabness that everyday working conditions create, and so they have sought to encourage such entertainment. Younger countries are perhaps concerned more with problems of industrial development and primary production than with the provision of recreation facilities, and usually a young country does not feel that it needs or has the time to encourage these forms of entertainment. However, with the increase of prosperity and leisure the State turns its attention to the support and development of the arts. If we needed any evidence of the necessity for State interest in such matters we may find it in the change which has taken place in our way of life in recent decades. To-day, most of our people live in the cities. Many of them work in offices or at repetitive factory tasks, and therefore they have a real need for regular breaks from the tedium of work, however much they may enjoy it in a general sense. ""We see further evidence of this in the hordes of people who throng places of public entertainment and in the thousands who obtain regular entertainment from radio programmes. I am not in possession of figures for the whole of Australia, but I know that in Victoria alone last year there were about 37,000,000 paid admissions to picture theatres. That indicates the popularity of one of our chief forms of entertainment. These facts should be of interest to the National Parliament, because, when financial measures which may cause a restriction of public entertainment are brought forward, we must approach them with particular care, recognizing, of course, the imperative need to finance our war effort. ""We recognize this need, but we must examine this heavy impost-and by any standard it will bp a heavy impost on the family man with a low income-wit h particular care in order to ensure that we do not create another form of indirect tax which will bear harshly and unfairly on large sections of the community. One of the industries which will be directly affected has accepted the proposed burden as a part of its obligation to the .nation's war effort, and the community as a whole will accept it in the same spirit. I know that the Government does not intend to use this measure as u means of restricting public entertainment. Although it may be a matter of Government policy to impose certain restrictions in other directions, this is purely a revenue-raising measure. However, this discussion does provide an opportunity to refer to the fact that the Government has under consideration a plan to restrict one or more forms of public recreation. Only today the Prime Minister spoke of the need to impose some restriction on horse racing, and be indicated that the Government would promulgate regulations to give effect to its policy in this regard. No honourable member will deny that there should be some restriction of racing in war-time. In fact, we all know that there has been a substantial reduction of horse-racing in Australia since the outbreak of war, just as there has been in Great Britain. This restriction has not completely deprived the people of opportunities to attend race meetings as a part, of their weekly recreation. I now express the hope, in anticipation of future action, that the Government will not seek to deprive the public of one of the most popular forms of entertainment. In peace-time we were not ashamed of the fact that we were a race-loving community. ""We Australians have been rather proud of the fact that we stage one of the most widelyknown racing fixtures-certainly largest conducted in the southern hemisphere-the Melbourne Cup. responsible and reputable citizens have eagerly sought election to the committees of our leading race clubs. This popular form of entertainment was catered for extensively in peace-time, but now we do not quarrel with the necessity for some restriction. However, I ask the Government to beware that in this matter, as in some other matters which must come before it, it be not led astray by the dent minority which is ever in our midst and whose sole objective apparently is - to deprive other people of forms of entertainment which members of that minority do not themselves enjoy. ""War is a great creator of extremes. It may tend to encourage intemperance, particularly in the consumption of liquor, a problem of which we have heard a great deal recently, but it also tends to increase Mr Holt. intolerance of the rights, privileges and pleasures of other people. This tendency has been apparent in recent months, and it has shown a dangerous facility for growth against which this National Parliament should guard. One man's meat may be another man's poison, but, while it is one man's meat, he should be allowed to enjoy it. The fact that it is another man's poison concerns that man only, and he should not, endeavour to impose his own distastes on his neighbour. I hope that, in this and other matters which affect the rights of the individual, the Government will not be misled by these people whose voices were drowned in happier times, but who today find opportunities to express views which most Australians would normally regard as intolerable. The fact that some form of regular entertainment is necessary to the people is recognized by the Commonwealth Government and the State governments in various ways. The State governments consistently provide in the schools organized recreation for the growing youth of the community and one of the most important features of life in the fighting services is the organized recreation provided for the troops. Just as schoolboys and members of the fighting services require a judicious means of recreation and entertainment, so likewise do civilians, whose lives are the perhaps more drab and considerably less colourful than those of either schoolboys Many or fighting men. There is a danger that when a community is called upon to accept a policy advanced ostensibly with the object of promoting the war effort, it will do so without analytically examining it. The acceptance of such policies at the value given to them by their advocate* has in it a measure of real risk. ""Whilst policies which can be proved to be in the best interests of the war effort will unstridoubtedly receive the whole-hearted support of the general community, there is a need for a vigilant examination of restrictive measures which invade individual rights and intrude on personal privileges without making any commensurate contribution to the war effort. I welcome the Government's concession of a reduction of 25 per cent, of the tax in respect of stage performances by fleshand-blood artists. All who have had any familiarity with the stage in Australia in the last ten or fifteen years will know that it has been most difficult to maintain performances in which artists appear in person. This' section of the industry was given exemption from the 1937 prosperity loading granted by the Arbitralooked. tion Court to other industries. The exemption was a recognition of the peritain lous financial condition of the stage at that time. Unquestionably, because of header expenses incurred when flesh-andtlie blood performers appear, a tax in the same ratio on such performances as that applicable to picture shows and the like would place an extremely heavy burden on entrepreneurs whose interests are in what we know as the legitimate stage. The 25 per cent, concession granted by the Government, in respect of such performances will therefore tend to soften what would otherwise be an extremely heavy burden. It 13 unfortunate that administrative difficulties probably prevent the GovernHughes) ment from making a similar concession respect of performances provided hy showas men in country areas. ""Whilst it may appear to some honourable members that visible to the public eye. the entertainments industries are passing through a boom period at the moment, fact is that country showmen are exshould periencing a very lean time owing to heavy drain on man-power from the country to the city.",28
100,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"The honourable gentlerespect man's observation is capable of misunderparties standing. He has observed that there been a drain of man-power from the country districts, and that therefore city entertainments are flourishing. It fact, however, that there has also heavy drain on man-power in city areas.",30
101,Mr HOLT,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"That may be so, but the movement, is invariably unfavorable to country districts. Although many men in city areas have joined the fighting services, there has been an influx population from country districts of men and women who have taken up munitions work and other necessary warshall time activities. I suggest to the Government that it should not lose sight of the desirability following the example of Great Britain in respect of the subsidizing of certain forms of entertainments in country districts which otherwise could not be made available to people in rural areas. The time may not be opportune at the moment for the application of such a policy, hut the wisdom of it should not be overI point out that, notwithstanding the war, the Government of Great Brihas provided £100,000 this year for subsidies in respect of the presentation of the dramatic and concert performances and display of works of art in isolated districts. Because of this provision travelling theatre and concert parties in Great Britain are now able to visit more or less remote areas and provide a form of entertainment for the local residents which otherwise would not be practicable.",30
102,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,It may be that the Minister at the table (Mr George Lawson) and I could go on tour.,30

The policy applied in Great Britain in of travelling theatre concert has also been applied in certain has European countries. Honourable members will be aware, too, that one of the more attractive features of the New Deal prois a gramme of President Roosevelt is the been a encouragement of art and of dramatic and concert performances on the legitimate stage. This is a recognition of the fact that definite advantages flow to a community from theatrical performances of that nature. I hope that alof though we must naturally continue both to be obsessed by the immediate and pressing problems of the war, we not lose sight of the need of our community for amenities of the nature to which I have referred, and which are of still being provided in other parts of the world, for they would undoubtedly add to the vitality of our community life. Subject to these remarks I commend the bill, and generally support the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden).",30
104,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Melbourne) [4.58] I dislike this bill because it provides for additional indirect taxation. Such taxes always bear most heavily upon the working classes. I approve of the measure, however, because it enlarges the principle of uniformity in taxation. In that respect the measure is in line with other bills introduced by this Government. I commend the proposal of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly) and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner) that a uniform land tax should be applied. Those honourable gentlemen also suggested that estate duties and certain other taxes should be imposed upon a uniform basis. I am confident that the people of Australia, would welcome any move in that direction. The Commonwealth Government should pay to the States such amounts as may be required to enable them to discharge their obligations under State law, and to provide funds for this purpose it should impose all taxes on a uniform basis throughout the. Commonwealth. I could offer several objections to phases of the budget which are not at the moment directly before us, and in due course I hope to have an opportunity to point out that certain budget proposals are in conflict, with the declared policy of the Labour party to which I belong. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) commended this bill. Of course he would do so, because it will impose a tax that will fall most heavily upon the working people. Naturally persons who belong to the United Australia party and the United Country party approve of taxes that fall upon the basic wage earners.",31
105,Mr FADOUN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Are they the only people who attend picture shows and other entertainments?,31
106,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"The largest proportion of the £3,000,000 proposed to be raised will be derived from the tax on the Is. tickets. Admittedly, higher rates will be imposed on the more highly priced tickets; but who wants to spend 5s. on a meal in these days, as many persons who do not belong to the working-class did in pre-war days and have done since the war started? If the Government were to exclude from the operation of this legislation all tickets priced at Is., very little revenue would be raised, and the proposal would be dropped. It is not right that a tax should be imposed on tickets priced at Is., when the average worker is already being mulct in increases of the cost of living which are vastly greater than the published figures. V.ery much more than the Prices Commissioner has fixed as fair has to be paid for various articles of clothing, and the working man finds that the amount that he is now earning is just about sufficient to enable him to keep body and soul together.",31
107,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,The budget will alter that.,31
108,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"The idea entertained by the right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) and others-that members of the working-class are making largely in excess of what they made in pre-war days, and that they have the idea of becoming capitalists when the war is over-is entirely erroneous. The budget for this year will not make the workers richer, or the rich poorer, but will probably have a tendency in the opposite direction. Because the bill is not one that will make the wealthy class less wealthy, it commends itself to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden), who has very gleefully supported it. I have no doubt that had he been Treasurer he would have introduced not only legislation of this sort but also provision for the compulsory loans that he advocates and that the capitalist press of Australia so keenly favours. Who was the author of the famous scheme of compulsory loans? It was a gentleman named J. M. Keynes. After he had propounded his scheme, he was made a baron of the realm, and is now Baron Keynes. His schemes are barren of any good to the working classes. He is a member of the House of Lords and, as befits one who renders such a service to the capitalist system of society, has also been made a member of the board of the Bank of England, in which capacity he is a colleague of Sir Otto Niemeyer- a gentleman who, approximately ten years ago, visited Australia in the role of a bailiff and proceeded to tell us that the budgetary equilibrium of Australia could best be restored by starving ourselves into prosperity.",31
109,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Many Labour governments listened to him.,32
110,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"He was listened to by the whole of the capitalist press of Australia and its political henchmen, including the right honourable member for North Sydney.",32

To return to the entertainments tax and Baron Keynes- a director of the Bank of Eng'and-whos e proteges in this House advocate his particular nostrum, allegedly for the benefit of Australia. I repeat that every form of indirect taxation, whether entertainments tax, sales tax, bread, tax or any other, bears most heavily upon the workers and small farmers of this country. When I address myself to the budget, I hope to have figures that will not have been prepared for me by any Labour pamphleteer or publicist, but will at least bear the hall mark of professional authenticity, showing the incidence of direct and indirect taxation upon the various classes of people and incomes in Australia.",32

116,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"My opinion of professors and economists is about as high as that of the honourable member. Some time ago, discussing the Department of War Organization of Industry, I pointed out that the trouble with Australia was that there were too many university professors and economists on the government pay-roll, and that we would do very much better if a few of them were sacked. However, the Labour party did not appoint all of them; some of them obtained entry to the Public Service on the day on which war broke out.",32

120,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Exactly . The honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner) sat under the chairmanship of one of them when he brought down the scheme of uniform taxation adopted recently. He made quite a lot of flattering remarks about that chairman.,32

122,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"I thank honourable members opposite for their interjections, because I intend to repeat these sentiments in another form on the budget. I hope to use this Parliament as a sounding board so that I can address the vast Australian democracy; because, if "" the ranks of Tuscanv """,32

124,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Quite recently, a statement was published in the press which indicated that various surpluses had been proclaimed and advertised in all the States of the Commonwealth. A statement which was prepared for me by the Treasury shows that State surpluses for the year 1941-42 were as follows:£ New South Wales 1,099.397 Victoria 683.283 Queensland 63.772 South Australia .. 1,287,000 Western Australia .. 1.768 Tasmania .. 1,585 3,136.805 Those figures do not represent the actual amount by which revenue exceeded expenditure. It is safe to say that the real surpluses were probably twice the amounts shown. Thus, at a time when the Commonwealth was experiencing difficulties in raising revenue, the States collecting revenue to the amount of £3,000,000 more than they admitted. I suggest that, instead of enacting legislation such as that which we are now considering, the Government should amend the State Grants Bill which has just been passed so as to reduce by £3,000,000 the amount to be distributed amongst the States. No budget ever presented to any Parliament, State or Commonwealth, was a factual statement of the finances of the country. Every budget is more or less faked, and every honourable member who has sat in a State or Federal Parliament knows that budgets are faked. I now submit that State budgets have been BO faked in recent times that it is no longer necessary for the Commonwealth to pay State governments the amounts agreed upon.",32
125,Mr BARNARD,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Does the honourable £3,000,000. member know of the famous saying former Treasurer on the subject of honesty in finance?",33
126,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"I do not think that there is any honesty in finance, and is less of it outside Parliament than is inside. Mr SrooKER - Does the honourable it member say that as an ex-Treasury official\",33
127,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"I was a Treasury official for seventeen and a half years, and I know the methods by which budgets can be faked. The honourable member Robertson (Mr Spooner), who was a prices member of a State government at one time, is probably also aware of some the methods by which they can be faked. I join with the honourable member for ment Fawkner (Mr Holt) in protesting against intolerance at this and particularly against any government allowing itself to be influenced by tolerant demands for thu cancellation race meetings, and the closing down organized sport. I do not believe that any section of the community should be relieved of those difficulties and restriclike tions which are unavoidable at this time, but if race meetings and other forms sport are to be entirely prohibited, then the only form of entertainment remaining to people of modest means is the picture show, and the parents with two or three children will find it extremely were difficult to pay the price of admittance to picture shows when this new tax is imposed. The honourable member for Robertson said that the allocation recently made to the States was fair, and he defended the system of uniform taxation. I think, for the reasons which I have stated, that the States have been more than generously treated, some, perhaps, a little more so than others. Generally, there is a disposition to allow the States to spend how they like, and a disposition to levy more and more taxes on the working man. That does not make for the popularity of this Government, nor for a proper appreciation of the difficulties with which the Government is confronted. It has been stated that this bill will divert spending power to the amount of I do not think that that of a matters so much. The amount of £3,000,000 can be raised in some other less difficult way that will not impose burdens on the masses of the people. I there am not so frightened of using the there national credit as are members of the Government. After all, we have used so far only to an amount of £78,000,000, and even if we used it to the amount of £100,000,000 in the next financial year, that would not make the country insolvent, or open the flood-gates of inflation. We have been assured by the for Government that wages are pegged and fixed. Therefore, there is nothing for the worker to do with his money but of put it in the savings bank. I am merely stating the arguments of the Governitself, and if its premises be correct, then the conclusions which I draw must time of crisis, also be correct. I have opposed every bill introduced inin this House under which it was proof posed to levy indirect taxation, and I of have spoken against every loan bill, whether introduced by this Government or by the ones that preceded it. I do not those things which conflict with the principles of the party to which I belong, of and I do not think that the enactment of this bill will usher in the new order. In fact, it will have an opposite effect. 1 note the anxiety with which honourable members opposite view any attempt to introduce the new order, and the unanimity with which they speak against any proposal designed to that end.",33
128,Mr HARRISON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Wentworth) [4.18]. -.Strangel y enough, I find myself in accord with some of the observations of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell). I also oppose the bill, but not for the same reasons. I oppose it because I find in it another attempt by the Government to put off the evil day when it must apply itself to the lower ranges of incomes in order to raise the necessary revenue. This Government, by its financial policy, is threatening the country with the curse of inflation. In an effort to curtail excessive spending by people with a surplus of money, the Government has imposed a system of severe rationing. People, particularly those in the lower income groups, have a surfeit of money. To-day, more money is circulating in the dommunity than ever before in our history. According to the Prime Minister, the spending power of the people has increased by £150,000,000; but that money has not been diverted to the war effort. The policy of the Government has driven the money to seek outlets other than the purchase of rationed goods, and this Government, by rationing some commodities, has created a demand for, and increased the prices of others. Under this bill, the Government will impose a tax on entertainments, because it believes that people are spending money lavishly on amusements. This tax provides the Government with another devious method of scratching a few hundreds of thousands of pounds from the people. Why does not the Government adopt a fearless policy of taking the surplus money from the people? In the past, State governments have taxed entertainments, because the field from which they derived their revenue was restricted. In my opinion, the tax on entertainments has been unfair, because it has been levied with discrimination on specific entertainments. Any tax which is imposed in that' manner is inequitable. The only virtue of the bill is that the tax will be made uniform throughout Australia. In that respect, some benefit will accrue, because the Commonwealth Government will put its imprimatur on a uniform method of controlling the finances of the country. In peace-time. I am opposed to the principle of taxing various forms of recreation, cultural expansion and physical development. Even in war-time, this inequitable form of indirect taxation should not be adopted. If the Government must scrounge a few more hundreds of thousands of pounds from the pockets of the people, it should do so by direct taxation. Try as it may to evade the unpleasant responsibility, the Government will eventua lly he forced to tackle the problem fearlessly. Up to the present, Ministers have run away from it. The Government will have to develop "" bowels "" in controlling the country. On its record to date, historians will know it as the "" bowelless Government"". I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne that this tax is another means of extracting moDey from the pockets of those in the lower ranges of income. The Government has adopted this surreptitious method because it is not "" game "" to take the money by a proper, well-balanced method of taxation.",34

130,Mr HARRISON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,A few hundreds of thousands of pounds from each State.,34
131,Mr BARNARD,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"The statement of the honourable member was clear and unqualified. He implied that the tax would raise only a few hundreds of thousands of pounds. Honourable members must not overlook the fact that the Government requires additional revenues for the purpose of financing its ever-expanding war effort. Regardless of how the problem is approached, some people will always complain about the incidence of the tax. Such criticism is inevitable when money has to be extracted from the pockets of the people. No tax has yet borne equitably on the shoulders of every section, or every individual. No perfect system of taxation has yet been devised.",34
132,Mr JOLLY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Taxatio n is never popular.,35
133,Mr BARNARD,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Taxatio n is never popular, and it is never quite fair. But the fact remains that money has to be raised for the conduct of the war. The Government, in its wisdom- I use the word ""wisdom"" advisedly-ha s selected a tax on entertainments as a means of increasing its revenue. How can anybody reasonably object to taxing a luxury which people seek and enjoy. It is all very well to say that the tax is not in conformity with the principles of the Labour movement. I agree that it is not.",35
134,Mr LAZZARINI,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,-No r is war in conformity with the principles of the Labour movement.,35
135,Mr BARNARD,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"The war has been forced upon us by a ruthless foe, and we have to accept the challenge. Honourable members must be realists. To wage this titanic struggle, we require ever increasing sums of money. The facts are inescapable. To finance the war effort, we must increase taxation above peace-time levels, and utilize the credit of the nation. One thing that impelled me to speak on this measure is the fact that whenever taxation is mentioned, honourable gentlemen opposite raise the bogy of inflation. They exhibit the same kind of mind as precipitated the depression when, on the score of lack of money, thousands of men were thrown out of work in spite of the fact that all the material resources necessary for work to be undertaken were available. Talk about inflation has int^ded even into this debate about the necessity for the Commonwealth Government to enter the field of entertainments tax in order to raise some of the money needed to wage the war. The people today are more enlightened than they were in the depression years and the word '-"" money"" has lost much of its magic. Those who control finance have overplayed their hand.",35

Apart from that, national credit must be used in financing this war. The Opposition has labelled the use of the nation's credit resources as inflation, but, since the outbreak of war, national credit has been used, and it will be used increasingly as the war goes on, in spite of the same old cry from those who represent the entrenched vested interests of this country that we are inflating the currency.",35
144,Sir GEORGE BELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Is the honourable member advocating inflation?,35
145,Mr BARNARD,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"The honourable member must not put words into my mouth. No one is more opposed to inflating the currency than I , because I know that the people who ultimately pay when inflation occurs are those who have least of the world's goods, but I am not opposed to a sensible use of the credit of the country by the Government, or the people's bank, but not by the banking institutions. I agree that public recreation is a necessity even in war-time; nevertheless it is a luxury from which the Government ought to be able to draw a reasonable amount of money. I , therefore, support the bill.",35
146,Mr COLLINS,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Hume) [5.35] - I do intend to oppose this measure, but I must take exception to certain features of it and prove the inconsistency of the when Government. Whereas the Government refuses to introduce post-war credits, as the has been suggested by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden), cause to do so might reduce the proposed income of those earning less than £400 per annum, it intends by this means to attack the incomes of the very humblest people in the community. I know the colossal task ahead of the Government raising the money necessary to finance the war effort, but, compared with revenue budgeted for, the amount to be their morale. raised under this measure is indeed meagre. The proposed tax indicates Government's complete disregard morale and fair treatment of the wage earners and the dependants of our fighting men. Theatre attendances establish yond doubt that motion picture entertainmunity. ment is of primary importance in maintaining the morale of a country at war. Yet the Government proposes to inflict a definite hardship on large sections of the community, or to deprive them the rest and relaxation that they derive from motion pictures. The price of the majority of the seats in theatres patroto nized by wage-earners is from Is. to Is. 6d. each, and on prices ranging from more than Is. to Is. 6d. the Government proposes to impose a tax of 5d. There been a great deal of indignant talk about the smallness of the pay of our fightexistence. ing forces, and now the Government intends to make further inroads on the finances of their wives and children who seek to escape the grief of separation nervous strain of the war by enjoying weekly visit to a picture theatre. family of four attending the films once week, which represents the circumstances of an average Australian family, will have to pay Is. 8d. a week more. Is. 8d. represents to a working man's family, or to a soldier's dependants, insurance premium, a contribution hospital fund, or an instalment on a war savings certificate. They are not the only people who will be affected by this tax. The public servants and other men fixed salaries who have not had the benefit of war-time increases of pay will also penalized unless they are prepared surrender one of the few remaining innocent relaxations available to It must be considered that the enterculable tamment tax on the cheapest seats, con-enupntly the seats that are within reach of the poorest-paid people, is no bethan 25 per cent. The fallacy of the legislation is accentuated when its revenue-earning potentialities are analysed. This repressive tax is budgeted to earn the Government a paltry £2,500,000 extra per annum, a sum that in is out of all proportion to the hardship that it will impose on those who look to the film entertainment to help to maintain",35
147,Mr LAZZARINI,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Thos e are the people the from whom the previous Government was for the going to take post-war credits.,36
148,Mr COLLINS,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"They are not. These beare the poorest-paid people in the comFurthermore, the Government will take no more money from the financial interests in the motion-picture industry than it takes at present; the proposed increase of revenue is to be grabbed from of the people. The Government's policy would be far more constructive if this morale-building industry were encouraged continue its work of bringing entertainment and relaxation to the people. The more it prospers the more the Government will prosper->and in a substantial has manner-throug h the medium of the companies profits tax which is already in From these considerations it is clear that the proposed tax is grossly unfair to the very people whose financial circumstances and war-time burdens make and them deserving of sympathetic treatment. a Moreover, it has not even the virtue of A being sound financially. The major coma panies admit that of 700,000 people who attend picture theatres each week, now 92 per cent, purchase tickets below That 2s. 6d. I draw the Government's attention to that before it finally an imposes this tax. The Minister for to a Home Security (Mr Lazzarini) referred to the system of post-war credits which was proposed by the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) in the. on budget which was rejected owing to a change of policy on the part of two honorbe able gentlemen in favour of something to which they thought might be better. In my opinion, the post-war credits them. system would have been of incalvalue to the people. Many and of them are now earning more the than they have ever earned. A great less deal of money is to be taken from them in the form of taxes. Would it not be better for some of that money to be put aside in the form of post-war credits, so that, after the war, these people could rehabilitate themselves in business or be able to continue to live decently until such time as they could be reabsorbed in normal peace-time occupations. The same benefits apply in connection with deferred pay for soldiers. The absorption of soldiers and munition workers in employment after the war will not be an easy task for whatever government may be in power at that time. Following upon the remarks of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) I refer now to the proposed abolition of horse-racing. I warn the Government to deal cautiously with this project. There are people who look upon those who attend race meetings as persons who belong to some low class of "" go-getters"", whereas, . in fact, the highest people in the Empire attend race meetings. That is why horse-racing is known as the "" Sport of Kings "". Whilst the Government is proposing to further restrict race meetings in this country. His Majesty the King is the leading racehorse owner in England. Only the other day we saw pictures of the Queen congratulating the jockey and the trainer on a win by that great filly Sun Chariot, which is said to be the greatest horse that the world has known. We also saw pictures of His Majesty leading in Sun Chariot after winning The Oaks. Every Saturday, thousands of People play golf, thousands of others go to cricket or football matches, and thousands enjoy reading or gardening. Thousands of others delight in watching the thoroughbreds produced in this country at an afternoon's horse-racing. If the Government closed down every form of entertainment it would drive the people into a state of depression which would break down their morale more quickly than anything else. They must have their outdoor entertainment, and the request for race meetings once a week in the capital cities is not unreasonable. I read in the newspapers recently that a friend of mine, Arthur Mailey, the international cricketer, went to a race meeting once and came home tired and depressed. But I know of many men Mr Collins. who have seen one cricket match and have never attended another match. On one occasion, when Woodfull and Ponsford, the two famous Victorian batsmen, came to play in New South Wale3, I asked a friend of mine whether he would like to see the match. He replied in amazement, ""Go and watch a game of cricket ? I would just as soon watch a hen sitting"". We all have different tastes. Many of us enjoy watching cricket and football matches, whilst others like horse-racing just as well. The Prime Minister said the other night that he did not take any notice of what might happen to the horse-breeding industry. The right honourable gentleman was only interested in the effect of his policy on the people generally. But the Government's proposals will affect persons who have invested hundreds of thousands of pounds in the establishment of studs in this country and who have imported the best blood horses in the world. In the future this may be the country to which other countries will look for blood horses. The horse-breeding industry is at present the chief outlet for farm products such as oats, chaff, bran and pollard. Therefore, I consider that the Government should be guided by those who are conversant with the conditions in the racing industry. It should not discriminate against those who enjoy this pleasant form of entertainment as compared with those who prefer golf, football, cricket or some other sport. I hope that the Government will think over what I have said and that wiser counsels will prevail. People who normally find their relaxation in the directions I have indioated should, within proper limits, be allowed to continue to do so. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: The bill.",36
149,Mr JOLLY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Lilley) [5.52] - Will the Treasurer inform me whether this tax is to be imposed upon horse-racing? It must be remembered that the State Governments already make certain substantial imposts on that sport.,37
150,Mr GHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Admissio n charges to racecourses will be liable to this tax. Mi. JOLLY - Does that mean that State Governments will discontinue their tax on horse-racing?,37
151,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Onl y in respect of admission charges.,38
152,Mr FADDEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Darling DownsLeader of the Opposition) [5.53] - I direct the.attention of the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) to clause 17, which providesEntertainments tax shall not be charged on payments for admission to any entertainment where the Commissioner is satisfied(a) that the whole of the takings thereof are devoted to public, patriotic, philanthropic, religious, or charitable purposes without any charges on the patrons for any expenses of the entertainment; In the following paragraphs of the clause certain other exemptions are provided. No form of appeal against the Commissioner's decision is provided. Moreover, a heavy responsibility will rest upon the Commissioner in determining the facts in relation to the various classes of entertainments specified in the clause. The Commissioner should not be burdened unduly in this way. It is not fair to place such a responsibility upon him, seeing that he is already carrying heavy responsibilities in respect of other discretionary powers. It is particularly important, however, that some form of appeal should be provided against the Commissioner's decisions under the provisions of this clause.",38
153,Mr SCULLIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Recours e may be bad to the law courts.,38
154,Mr FADDEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"That is so, but it is expensive. Could not a board of review or something of the kind, be provided?",38
155,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"In practice, the 'officers of the Commissioner will determine the points.",38
156,Mr RYAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Flinders) [5.54] - Clause 15 provides(1.) Where the payment for admission to an entertainment is made by means of a lump sum paid as a subscription or contribution to any club, association, or society, or for a season ticket . . . entertainments tax shall he paid on the amount of the lump sum. The Treasurer will remember that a few days ago the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Price), the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey), and I , waited upon him on this subject. We pointed out that a tax on a lump sum in such circumstances would be harsh. For instance the tax on a 6s. subscription would be 2s. 4d. plus 3d. for every 6d. or part thereof by which the admission charge exceeded 6s. 6d. We pointed out that many people paid annual subscriptions to cricket clubs, in particular, frequently with the object of encouraging the game of cricket, and only for the secondary reason of obtaining admission to matches. This applies also to other forms of sport. Cricket clubs and similar sporting bodies are today facing great difficulties. Owing to the demands of Avar work, the number of men available to play cricket is greatly reduced, and so, also, is the number of people available to attend cricket matches. The income of - such clubs has therefore diminished greatly. We suggested to the Treasurer that the rate of tax should be only at the rate applicable to each separate admission charge covered by the season ticket. For example, if a season ticket covered ten admissions at a certain rate the tax payable should be only ten times the amount payable in respect of each separate admission.",38
157,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,I give the honourable member an assurance that the tax will be on the rate applicable to each admission charge covered by the season ticket.,38
158,Mr RYAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,I am satisfied with that assurance.,38
159,Mr HOLT,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Fawkner) [5.58] Clause 11 deals with the issue of stamped tickets of admission. I have had pointed out to me by the trade press that an administrative difficulty is quite likely to arise in connection with this provision. It may prove to be impracticable to obtain newly printed admission tickets, or even an adequate supply of overprinted admission tickets, to meet the needs by the time this measure will come into operation. I understand that there is a shortage of paper of the colours required for printing admission tickets. Millions of printed tickets are already in the hands of certain showmen, and unless these can be overprinted to comply with the provisions of this clause, they will be wasted. This is a matter which is causing considerable concern to the interested parties.",38
160,Mr MARWICK,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Swan) [5.59] Will the Treasurer inform me whether the 25 per cent, reduction will apply to dances, where people make their own entertainment ?",39
161,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,It will not. The normal tax will apply.,39
162,Mr SPOONER,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Robertson) [6.0] I support the submissions of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) in respect of clause 17. The duties of the Commissioner of Taxation in the administration of taxing measures generally, and also in the exercise of discretionary powers such as those provided in clauses 17 and IS need some attention. The whole position is highly complicated today. It is only necessary to interview the Commissioner on such matters to realise this fact. Important questions of technique need consideration by him before he can give decisions. It is not possible for him personally to investigate entertainment of this type in order to see whether or not it is such as should be exempt from entertainments tax. Of necessity, he delegates this task to some officer of his department. That is not quite fair either to him or to the public. If the Treasurer reviews the provisions of clauses 17 and 18, he must see that it would really be the function of some other organization to investigate the many applications 'that will come forward, in order to determine whether or not they are of such a character that they fall within the ambit of those provisions. If the public generally desire to hold entertainments of this character, they should have the opportunity to state their case to some authority external to the administration and collection of taxation. If such cations be made formally to the Commissioner, and he rejects them, there should be the right of appeal to another authority.",39
163,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Macquarie-Trea surer) [6.2] - Some thousrht has been given to the matter of a right of appeal, which has been raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner). So many decisions will have to be reached in regard to minor matters, and others that could be the subject of - agreement between the parties concerned, that a good deal of work would be thrown on a board such as the Board of Eeference if it had to deal with all the appeals that came forward. A provision similar to that now proposed was enaated in connection with the Federal entertainments tax that previously operated and it also operates in respect of every State entertainments tax. I do not suppose that the public has always been satisfied, but generally grievances have been satisfactorily dealt with by the commissioners in the different States. I cannot imagine that many of the small matters that have to be dealt with would be worthy of pursuing beyond discussion with the department. It is quite true that the Commissioner would not be able to deal with all minor matters that were raised. Developments may warrant the setting up of a special body. The Board of Referees and the Board of Review are already so overloaded that steps have had to be taken to relieve them of some of their work. It would hardly seem the function of a board with a chairman drawing a salary of £2,000 a year to determine whether or not a certain percentage was correct, or a certain subject was educational or otherwise. Who could determine such a matter better than an officer who was on the spot? But I am quite willing to examine the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition.",39
164,Mr FADDEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,We can see how the act works.,39
165,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"In reply to the points raised by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt), I say that it is anticipated-and for that reason I have asked that the bill be dealt with to-daythat all tickets will be available before applithe proclamation of the act. Tickets already in the hands of the States will be capable of being used so long as they do not refer to State tax. I understand that arrangements will be made by the taxation authorities which will ensure the use of the majority of such tickets. It is hoped that the act will be in force by the 1st October.",39
166,Mr RYAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Flinders) [6.51 - I doubt whether the Commissioner will have the discretion, under clause 15, to vary the tax from a lump sum to one calculated in respect of the number of occasions on which tickets are available.",39
167,Mr SCULLIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,The clause expressly gives that discretion.,40
168,Mr RYAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"The ticket of membership might include some social benefit in addition to admission. In such a case, the Commissioner would have to use his discretion. If the Treasurer is satisfied, I shall not raise further objection.",40
169,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Macquarie-Treasurer ) [6.6] - I give to the honourable member the assurance that the Commissioner understands that that is to be the principle underlying the administration of the act. The Parliamentary Draftsman has assured me that that is what is intended. The tax will therefore be administered in that way.,40
170,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Melbourne) [6.7] I bring to the notice of the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) the case of a cricket club which reduces its subscription charge and imposes only a nominal charge for which no benefit is given in any year. I am a trustee of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The subscription to the Melbourne Cricket Club is £3 5s. per annum. The American military forces have taken over the ground and are now camped there. The Melbourne Cricket Club has quite a number of obligations which must be met. It desires to retain its membership, and has reduced its subscription rate from £3 5s. to 10s. 6d. per annummerely a nominal sum. No entertainment of any sort is provided on the ground.",40
171,Mr SCULLIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"No entertainment, no tax-that is what the clause means.",40
172,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"I am glad to have the assurance that that is the meaning of the clause, because I should regard it as unfair if the sum of 10s. 6d., which provides no entertainment and is designed merely to hold the membership together, were subject to any tax. Another matter has been brought to my notice in which I have little concern and just as little interest; it relates to the entertainment tax on "" live"" shows by flesh-and-blood artists. I understand that country shows, at which boxing and various other forms of entertainment may be provided, have not to pay as much in taxation as is paid in respect of boxing matches in capital cities. I should like to know if there is to be any differentiation in the treatment of a boxing entertainment, and a flesh-and-blood vaudeville show at a city theatre. Will the Treasurer say how it is proposed to treat stadium shows?",40
173,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"I have been informed by my officers that stadium shows are not to be regarded, as flesh and blood shows in the sense that stage entertainments are, and that they will not be entitled to the concession. Bill agreed to. and reported from committee without amendment; report, adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. STATES GRANTS (ENTERTAIN MENTS TAX REIMBURSEMENT ) BILL 1942. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 10th September (vide page 161) on motion by Mr. CHIFLEYThat the bill be now read a second time.",40
174,Mr FADDEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Darling DownsLeader of the Opposition) [6.12] - This measure is designed to compensate tihe States for vacating the entertainments tax field. I agree with the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) that, if the bill has a fault it is that it errs on the side of generosity to the States. It would appear that the Treasurer is not too enthusiastic regarding the possibility of effecting savings, because he proposes to give to the States the same amount of revenue this year as they collected last year. I believe that if the war situation continues to be grave, the Treasurer will come to the conclusion that he has been over-liberal to the States.",40
175,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Melbourne) [6.14] I should like to be assured that this measure can be amended during the current financial year, and that we are not committed to paying all the money here provided for. I think that the States are receiving too much under this measure. All of them are showing surpluses, and their actual surpluses are twice as much as they show. Amending legislation should be brought into reduce the amount which is now being paid to the States. We should not be giving away so much Commonwealth revenue while, at the same time, imposing taxes that bear so heavily upon the working classes. Again I repeat that the Treasurer ought to take from the States the £3,000,000 surpluses of which they have not disclosed, and should take a larger proportion of the surpluses which they have disclosed.",40
176,Unknown,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Sitting suspended from 6.15 lo S p.m.,41
177,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"In many cases, the amounts that the States have disclosed were more than the States were entitled to get from the Commonwealth. The Premier of South  his intention to use his surplus for the purpose of repaying the holders of State securities. In war-time, no Premier should have so much money as to be able to reduce the indebtedness of the State. Such debts should not be reduced at a time when Commonwealth debts are increasing.",41
178,Mr HOLT,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,The money should be invested in war loans.,41
179,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"The money could be usefully employed in a number of ways in connection with the war effort; but it should not be used for the purpose of discharging State indebtedness while the Commonwealth is obliged ito raise a similar sum by imposing a tax"" on amusements. This bill may be bad for either of two reasons. If attendances at various forms of entertainment do not decline during this financial year, the Commonwealth Government will obtain too much money from this source, because the tax' that this bill imposes will, levied on the same number of people as attended various entertainments last year, bring in a much greater sum of money than the Government expects. But if attendances fall off stantially, the Commonwealth will not receive so much money as it expects, but the States will still get the amounts that are set out in the bill. In that event, they will receive too much money. Because of the large un.bridged gap between expenditure and revenue, I believe that the Treasurer will be obliged present supplementary budget statements during the current financial year. On one of those occasions, he should amend the uniform income tax legislation, and the present measure, as they grant to the States sums of money in excess of their legitimate requirements for discharging the functions that are still left to the States in these days of war.

BUDGET 1942-43. In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the 11th September (vide page 286), on motion by Mr. CHIFLEYThat the first item in the Estimates under division 1 - The Senate-namely , "" Salaries and allowances, £ 8 , 6 6 0 be agreed to.",41
181,Mr BAKER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Maranoa) [8.8] - When criticizing the budget, tihe Leader of the sub- Opposition (Mr Fadden) deplored the fact that the Treasurer has not increased the rate of tax payable by those who are in receipt of less than £400 a year. I remind the right honourable gentleman that the wage-earners are being heavily taxed, not only by previous budgets, but also by the mounting cost of living. The to Leader of the Opposition gazed into the pasture represented by this large group, and urged the Government to invade it, and - thereby deprive many people of a portion of their hard-earned wages. The Labour party believes that taxes should he imposed upon those who are best able to bear it. That is the golden rule of all taxation. The Leader of the Opposition also urged the introduction a system of compulsory loans, such was advocated by Mr J. M . Keynes, but I shall deal with that subject at a later stage. I was surprised by the splenetic bitter attack that the honourable member existent. for Indi (Mr MCEwen) made on the workers. I should like to define the meaning of "" worker "". A worker is not only the individual who wields a pick, and has calloused hands. For example, the wheat-farmer and grazier work very hard. The dairyman works long hours for a small return. The shop assistant performs tedious work for long hours the every day. Even the waitress who serves food so daintily in a restaurant is worker. In short, a worker is any person who produces a commodity, or who renders a social service. Nearly 95 per cent, of our people are workers. That fact makes the bitter attack of the honourable member for Indi all the more inexplicable. I assume that he referred to industrial workers, and that his attack was inspired, because, from time to time, friction arises between employer and employee and develops into a strike. I many factories, particularly those a engaged in the manufacture of munisary tions, men are doing high-precision work for long hours daily, and the problem of stoppages is really a psychological one. When a man feels the strain of arduous and continuous work, he is inclined to "" fly off the handle"". He must be handled very carefully by his took employers. As faults occur on I fail to see why the worker should always be the target for such sweeping condemnation. If it were not for worker, where would Australia be Government. today? For 150 years, our people have laboured to build up a high standard civilization. In that direction they have achieved more than any other people history. Even the United States America had not developed in one and half centuries to the stage that AusThe tralia has reached. In a very short time we have cleared the scrub, tilled the fields, established the farms, built the towns, laid down the railway lines, and made this a worth-while country. The workers have done that. They are also fighting the war today, and some honorof able members opposite believe that the as workers should pay for it. They wish to attack the wages of the working class. If it were not for the unions, especially the Australian Workers Union, our and White Australia policy would be nonWhen President Roosevelt spoke of the "" Four Freedoms "", I hope that he had in mind the right of men to combine for the purpose of forming unions for the betterment of their conditions, such as higher pay, better conditions of work, and better habitations. Why should not they have some of the worth-while things of life ? For too long, "" go-getters "" and vested interests have enjoyed the good things, whilst the a workers lived in conditions almost of poverty. To-day, the worker is intelligent, and he demands a fair deal. From the Labour party he will get a fair deal. The honourable member for Indi referred to the "" unfairness "" of compelling people to join a union. I compare the policy of the Government in this respect with the rules of a cricket club. In return for their subscription, members enjoy the right to partake of the privin leges of the club. Men should count it as privilege to pay the small amount necesfor a union membership ticket when they go into employment and enjoy the pay and conditions for which the union has fought over the years. I now direct the attention of honourable members to some of the achievements of the Australian Labour party since it office in October last year. It impleboth sides mented chiid endowment. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Chil d endowthe ment was introduced by the Menzies Mr BAKER,-It was compelled to do of so by the Labour party. We have increased the invalid and old-age pension to in 25s. a week. We have provided pensions of for widows and orphans. We have in a creased 'the pay of the fighting forces. Australian soldier, before we took office, received 5s. active pay and 2s. deferred pay a day. The allowance for a wife was 3-=. a day, for the first child 2s. 6d. a day, and for the second child Is. 6d. a day. The budget introduced in 1941 by the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) increased those rates to 6s. active pay, ?s. deferred pay, 3s. 6d. wife's allowance, 2s. 6d. allowance for the first child, and 2s. for the second. Since March, 1942, the Australian Militia Eorce and the Royal Australian Air Force in Australia have been able to qualify for deferred pay after six months' service. Naval shore personnel have been placed on sea-going rates. Since August, when the last budget was introduced, the active pay has been 6s. 6d. a day, deferred pay 2s. a day, the allowance for a wife 4s. 6d. a day, the allowance for the first child 3s., and for the second child, 2s. Since taking office this Government has increased the pay of members of the fighting forces at a cost of £18,000,000. In addition, the first £250 of a soldier's income is exempt from income tax as the result of action by this Government. When the wool agreement was signed in 1939, it contained a clause providing for annual review of the price provided either partu to the agreement asked for it.",41
182,Mr ABBOTT,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Rot ! We were always asking for it.,43
183,Mr BAKER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Nobody , not even the United Country party, which professes to represent the wooi-growers, lifted a finger on behalf of the wool-growers until this Government came into office, and the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) went to Great Britain, asked for a rise of price by 15 per cent., and got it.",43
184,Mr FADDEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"That rise was obtained by the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page). Mr BAKER,-No , by the Attorney General, who went to Britain after having ! visited America. We have stabilized the price of wheat at 4s. a bushel at railway sidings for the first 3,000 bushels. That was a worthwhile achievement. Queensland we are in an anomalous position in that we do not produce sufficient wheat for local consumption. Wheat has to be brought from the south, and it is hard to do so because of the shortage of rolling-stock and congestion on the railways. We have guaranteed to the tobacco growers an increase of the price for their leaf by 10 per cent. The price of raw cotton is now 15d. per lb. The price of bacon has risen by 2d. per lb. The dairying industry is the Cinderella of all industries. The men, women and children engaged in it work under conditions of slavery so that the producers may get cheap dairy products. A dairy committee is now inquiring into all matters connected with the industry, and I hope that as the result the dairy fanners will get a better deal. The fifth progress report from the Joint Committee on Rural Industries statesA t its meeting in Sydney in August, 1040, the Australian Agricultural Council considered that the long-term market prospects justified the adoption of an energetic policy of extensive production in the dairying industr y in all States. The British Government placed dairy products high on the priority list and many countries formerly supplying the British market were subject to enemy occupation or control. Take Denmark, for example; it is a little bigger than the western district of Victoria, but it had over 3,000,000 dairy cows. These had to be fed on imported grain, and as the grain is not now reaching the country, probably many of these cows have already been slaughtered for human consumption. These were probably the best cows in the world, having 40 years of herd testing behind them. As it takes three years to multiply dairy animals it will be impossible for Penmark to get back to its old productivity for many years after peace is declared. We have promised Britain 70,000 tons of butter and 40,000 tons of cheese in the financial year 1942-43. That is a sacred undertaking. In addition we have to supply our own men in the Army, our allies, and the civil population, and there is a very great danger that we may not be able to do so. The report proceedsI n his evidence before the committee, the general president of the Agricultural Bureau of New South Wales (Mr Cavanagh) said that if steps were not taken to offset the shortage of man-power there was a very real danger that we will experience a shortage of foodstuffs. He added: "" That is not an overstatement of the position. There will certainly be a shortage of dairy products. The shortage of manpower in the dairying industry is due largely In to the fact that, because the industry never paid very high wages, many young men entered munitions factories and the Army . . . The question in regard to fodder conservation is also serious as the result of continued dry seasons which have exhausted the reserves, and also because of the shortage of man-power experienced last year has not been made good. On top of that, the whole of the State has experienced a severe drought. . . . Fodder conservation is an urgent problem, and should be tackled on a national basis in order to build up stocks for the use of the Army as well as for the preservation of our flocks and herds . "". ."". In Queensland the State Director of Dairying (Mr Rice) told the committee: "" R u r a l labour, especially under low wage conditions of dairying, was early depleted owing to the much higher ratio of voluntary enlistments in country districts and the exodus to the attractive high-wage work available in industrial cities and towns. In my travels through dairying districts I have noticed that many farms are unoccupied. . In the South Burnett I was told that nine farms had gone out of dairying. On the Darling Downs, twenty dairy farms have gone out of production in the last twelve months"". . . . The general manager of the Port Curtis Cooperative Dairy Association Limited (Mr. Wilson) said: ""Farmers cannot pay good wages on the price they receive for butter. My opinion is that, with a better price for butter, production will increase. If farmers arc to receive a price comparable with that paid in other industries, and appropriate to the hours worked, the price of butter should be 2s. per lb.""",43
185,Mr ROSEVEAR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Do not say that to the workers in ray electorate.,44
186,Mr BAKER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I do not think that any decent worker would object to better conditions in the dairying industry. The average annual consumption of butter petcapita in Australia is 31 lb., and an in crease of 6d. per lb. would add only 15s. 6d. a year to the worker's cost of living. ""We who pride ourselves on our high standard of livin g do not wish to have some of our people working under slavery conditions. The dairyman has to go into his yard twice a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year, and when he is not there he has to sow feed. We can no longer close our eyes to his perilous state. The dairyman should be able to earn the basic wage, but at current prices he cannot receive this. I think that all primary industries can take a lead fro m the sugar industry, which is the best-organized primary industry in Australia. It is controlled by a board consisting of a representative of the growers, a representative of the manufacturers, and the Chief Justice of Queensland as chairman. No one who has travelled through the sugar country will deny that the sugar industry is on a sound basis, and I do not know why its lead cannot be followed by the wheat industry, the dairying industry, and all other primary industries. Wo are experiencing a shortage of tobacco. We grow only one-fifth of our annual requirements. Recently I travelled with the Mlinister for Commerce (Mr . Scully) through the tobacco country in the South Queensland, and I had the p r i v i lege of visiting the site of the proposed dam at Mingoola, the point at which four creeks-the Pike, the Mole, the Tenterfield and the Severnlea-com e together to form the Dumaresq River. If that dam were built and half a dozen weirs were constructed on the Dumaresq River and the Mclntyre Brook, thousands of acres of country could be irrigated and made suitable for tobacco-growing, and within a few years we should be independent of overseas sources of supply. The cost of the dam would be about £1,000,000, which is less than our war expenditure for one day. Surely we can afford that. Another imperative work is the railway link from Blackall to Charleville. Floods or a bombing raid on the coastal line would isolate Nort h Queensland, but the construction of the Blackall to Charleville line would afford the necessary link. Later the line could he extended from Cunnamulla to Bourke. In order to provide more food for the Motherland we should increase our production of dehydrated mutton. The Minister for Commerce has this project in hand, and I hope that he will expedite his plans. There are many towns in the west of Queensland where dehydration plants could be erected. I turn my attention now to that well-known parrot cry "" inflation "". As soon as any suggestion is made to use the national credit of Australia, there arises the cry "" inflation"". It is only a bogy, and there would be very little, if any, inflation if we had a proper system of controlling prices, interest rates and costs. As a matter of fact, of the two evils, inflation and deflation, the latter is very much the worse. We all had a. taste of it during the depression period of 1931-32. I often hear the cry raised in this House that the Labour party is using war-time conditions as an excuse to introduce its policy. We make no apology for that. That is why we are here. We can win the war only by implementing the Labour party's policy, and, furthermore, that is the only way in which, we can w in the peace. I direct the attention of the committee to the platform and objective of the Australian Lahour party, wluich shows that the Labour party is pledged to control all finance and banking. We make no apology for tryin g to implement this plank of our platform. The only apology I have to make is that we are going too slowly about it ; we should move ahead a great deal faster. When the history of the last twelve months is written, the people of Australia will thank Heaven that tihe Labour party was in power and that the right honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) was at the wheel. I shudder to think what would have been the position of Australia to-d'ay had the Labour party not been in power. I shall not say any more about that now, but the time will come when the story of the Labour party's achievements will have to be told. I spoke a little while ago about the control of profits. In this connection I direct the attention of honourable memdo bers to the following paragraph from the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 9th September, 1942 :Mutual Store Limited discloses a profit £21,491 for the year to the 31st July, after providing £15,000 for taxation and £7,597 depreciation. Profit for the previous year was £18,952 . . . We are fighting a war, yet here is a fir making profits out of all proportion size. This is not a. time when business concerns should make profits.",44
187,Mr BECK,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"The honourable member telling only Ibalf the story. Mr BAKER , - I shall finish reading the paragraphPro/it for the previous year was £18,952, taxation took £10,000 and depreciation Dividends are 8 per cent, on first preference, RJ per cent, on second aud 7 per cent, ou ordinary shares (6 per cent, in 1940-41). absorbing £19,487. Here is another item from the same issue of the Daily TelegraphProfit of Distillers Corporation Proprietary Limited, manufacturers of Corio whisky Vickers gin, for the year to the 31st January, was £44,810, against £22,332 in 1940-41. That is an increase of more than 100 per cent.",45
188,Mr BADMAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,What about taxation?,45
189,Mr BAKER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I am coming to that. The item continuesThat of Federal Distilleries, manufacturers of Old Court whisky and Brinds gin, was £11,270, against £11,716. These two companies paid to United Distillers Proprietary Limited, which holds all their shares, £58,000 in dividends. United Distillers Proprietary Limited, shows profit of £58,390 for the year to the 28th Fehruary, contrasting with £32,590 in the previous year. This company in turn paid a dividend of 4 per cent, to the holding companies-Australia n Distillery, Brinds, Breheny Brothers, and other interests-absorbin g £42,000. That sort of thing must not be permitted. .1. am sorry that the Government dropped its proposal to restrict profits to 4 per cent. I understand that there were some difficulties in the way of collecting excess profits under the scheme, but I hope that the war-time profits tax will straighten out that difficulty. It is disgraceful that this sort of thing should happen in wartime. The rationing of clothing, tea and sugar has been fair l y satisfactory, and I not believe that any hardship has been caused to anybody. Some people are squealing, but they would squeal in any case. If we are short of commodities, we should go further and ration bread, of butter, cheese, tobacco, cigarettes, beer, for wines and spirits. Liquor could be rationed under a coupon system, so that a man would have to produce coupons in m order to get a drink in an hotel. Then to its everybody who so wished could got a drink, but nobody would get too much. That is a very important matter at the present time. I sugis gest further that newspapers should be rationed. We could release a great deal of man-power if that were done. Of course, people will talk about the when liberty of the press, but there is no £5,9S2. such thing. The press is tied to the chariot-wheels of big vested interests. I suggest also that talk in this chamber should be rationed. I myself speak very seldom, and if every other honourable member spoke as little as I do, we should get a lot more work done. Furthermore, and if talk were rationed in Parliament, the Hansard record of debates would be reduced. We have been looking forward for a long time to the establishment of a mortgage bank. I hope that such a bank will be in existence 'before this sessional period ends, and that it will be established on a proper basis. The rate of interest charged should be low, certainly not more than 3 per cent.",45
190,Mr MOUQAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"tWh y 3 per cent. ? Mr BAKER:-As a matter of fact, I do not see why it should not be 1 per cent.; the banks could operate profitably at that rate. It should, provide long term accommodation upon easy conditions, because, at the present time, the private banks do not always give sympathetic treatment to people who are in difficulties. We on this side of the chamber are pledged to implement the Labour party's policy. I repeat that I have no apology to make for that. I read in a newspaper recently that the coal-mining industry in Great Britain has been nationalized. Many people claim that government enterprises are not successful. I remind the committee that the British Navy is a government enterprise. So are the British Army, the Royal Air Force, the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force, and nobody will deny that they are very successful. Tho Post Office also is a government enterprise, and in Queensland we have a State Insurance Department, which is doing remarkably wellTbe sooner we implement the Labour party's policy in full and nationalize banking systems, the better it will Australia. I understand that national credit was extended last year by an amount of £78,000,000. I hope that it will be extended very much more this year. I advocate equal pay for equal work in industry. Women are being called upon now to do what previously was regarded as men's work, They are working for long hours at tedious jobs, and they should receive the same pay for that work as the men who are working beside them. I hope that we do not pay a person 'according to sex. We should pay for work done. We should now begin planning a system of post-war rehabilitation because, when the war is over, conditions in this country will be chaotic unless we have planned thoroughly in advance. I am not enamoured of the word ""austerity"", which is heard so much today. I do not like it, because it connotes bitterness, rigidity, nastiness, sourness. We should rather use the word "" Spartan"", which suggests simplicity, frugality, and intense courage. We all know the story of how 300 Spartans held the pas3 at Thermopylae to the last man. We want more of that sort of thing. We also need a spiritual background, so that we shall move forward in faith and in hope, not with bitterness or austerity. We should move forward with a clear eye, a smile on our lips, and a quip on our tongues to meet the worse that may come. I hope that when this tragic nightmare of war is past, we shall have plans for national reconstruction ready to be put in operation. In conclusion I trust that before long we shall hear the wings of the dove of peace fluttering at the gateway of a glorious day.",46
191,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"North Sydney-Leade r of the United Australia party) 18.45]. - The Treasurer (Mr Chifley) laid great stress on the size of this budget. It was natural and proper for him to do so, for the budget is a record, and makes an interesting contrast to the budget presented to the first Commonwealth Parliament, which provided for £10,000,000 of receipts and £10,000,000 of expenditure. But the size of this budget should, not be disturbing, in itself, for it is an outward and visible sign of the wonderful progress that this be for country has made. However much we may differ from the Government in relation to the incidence of taxation, and the means by which the money is to be obtained, we are agreed that the money can, and will be found. This budget provides for a total expenditure of £550,000,000, of which £440,000,000 is required for war purposes. Of that war total £140,000,000 is to be provided from revenue, and £300,000,000 from loans. The Treasurer warned us that the estimate of expenditure might be exceeded. I think this is quite probable. As I see it, this budget has two major defects. The Opposition does not complain of the amount of taxation to be levied, but of its incidence. The taxes are not being imposed fairly. As the Prime Minister very properly reminded us the other night in his most rousing speech, which I am sure found its way inCJ iliK hearts of the people, this is every body's war. if it is every body's - war, I'very body should take a share in paying tor it. laxaiio n should be adjusted to the means of the taxpayers. There is an irreducible minimum in relation to the standard of living which must be preserved. It is necessary to maintain the physical and moral fitness of our people. That is vital. But, subject to this consideration, every body should contribute to the war effort according to his means. The Opposition objects to the budget, also, because it provides for the vast sum of £300,000,000 to be obtained by voluntary loans. Consider the circumstances of the people of this country. At least 1,000,000 income-earners will contribute nothing in taxation. So far as I know this is the only country in the British Empire of which that is true. Another 1,000,000 income-earners will make an almost negligible contribution to taxation. There is no justification for this. Ou' standards of living have been amply protected. I listened with great interest to the speech of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Baker). I know something of the conditions of the people in the districts to which he referred. No words could be too harsh to describe the conditions that once existed in those areas, but I am dealing with the position as it is. There have been poured into the pockets of the people of Australia vast, sums of money. It is literally true today that the overwhelming majority of our wage-earners have more money to spend than they ever had before. I m mense sums of money obtained from revenue and loan last year have been expended on war work and, apart fro m £56.000,000, more or less, which was paid for goods obtained outside Australia, all that money has gone into the pockets of the people.",46
192,Mr MCLEOD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,And more ways hav< been found of taking it out again.,47
193,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,It is not true to sav that the rich are becoming richer.,47
194,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The right honourable gentleman would say that' that was neve* true.,47
195,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,It used to be true. I was one of those-if honourable gentlemen opposite will give me some credit for it-wh o conducted a vigorous campaign over a great many years against that kind of thing.,47
196,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The right honourable member wrote The Case for Labour.,47
197,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,I did. ',47
198,Mr ROSEVEAR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,And then forgot all about it !,47
199,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I did not. The honourable gentleman who has interjected is here by the grace of God and The Case for Labour Which I wrote. He would not have been here but for it . The money spent on the war effort has found its way into the pockets, principally, of wage-earners in the lower ranges of income. Two millions and more are practically exempt from taxation. That it has not gone into the pockets of the employers or the well-to-do is proved by glancing down the taxation schedule. Take the case of a man in receipt of 1 £5,000 a year who must by any standard be classed as a bowelless plutocrat who deserves to "" get it in the neck "". What has happened to him? Before the war his income tax amounted to £800 odd a year, leaving him with £4,200. ",47
200,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"We l l , the tax he pays now is £3,300 which leaves him with only £1,700. Honourable members of this House who receive £1,000 a year will be taxed £250 a year, but they will still have £750 a year left, which is between three and four times as much as is received by many of the poor downtrodden workmen about whose unhappy lot they say so much. ",47
201,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Well, honourable gentlemen have the remedy in their own hands. There is something about this hypocritical concern for the workers by men who receive £1,000 a year which I j find sickening. If we desire to set an example of austerity we should begin here and strip ourselves bare. That, of course, is a figurative remark which must be taken with reservations!",47
202,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"What about the man with an income of £25,000 a year ?",47
203,Mr FADDEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Such a man scarcely exists in this country today.,47
204,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Unde r the provisions of this budget, a man in receipt of £20,000 a year would pay nearly £17,000 budget speechin income tax, but he would still be able to struggle along on £3,000 as will honorincreasing able members who will still have £750 a sumption year left to them. Incomes in the higher range are very heavily taxed, but millions for of people who could and ought to be taxed pay nothing or next to nothing. [ know of no other country in the British Dominions where the great mass of the workers escape with so little taxation do those of Australia. In 'New Zealand, under a Labour administration, income taxation begins at £100,",48
205,Mr MOLEOD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,But the workers set something for their taxation.,48
206,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"In New Zealand the single man without dependants who relast ceives £100 a year is required to pay in taxation. If he gets £150 a year taxes amount to £19, and if he gets a year they amount to £25. In this country, single wage-earners without pendants who earn £200 a year have to pay only £8 in income tax. Wage1 say, earners who receive less than £200 a year pay nothing at all. It is evident, fore, that the taxes do not bear equitably on the people. An adjustment of taxaThe tion in conformity with the circumstances of the individual is necessary.",48
207,Mr CONELAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The Government's taxation programme observes that prinhave ciple.,48
208,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"It does not. We ister come now to loans. Thu Treasurer, after pointing to a great gap of £300,000,000 between estimated expenditure and the estimated revenue, approached colossal chasm with an airy optimism. He said "" We received £120,000,000 from loans last year. We can double that amount this year "". But why did he stop at doubling it? Why did he not say could treble it? That would have given him a. surplus of £60,000,000, and pluses are just about as rare as seawas serpents. The honourable gentleman must know, for his advisers are men of exbeing perience, that the loan market cannot be relied upon for more than £150,000,000 this year. '.From where is the other £150,000,000 to come? Mr CAI.WE.LT, - Fro m national credit.",48
209,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"That is the answer. On this point the Treasurer said in his Increasing the volume of money without the supply of goods for civil connot only creates the danger of inflation, but also sets up serious competition between demands for civil goods and demands war requirements. That is the great danger. But it could be avoided easily if the Government would adopt the policy of compulsory as loans advocated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden). Why should not loans be compulsory? Why should we have to go cap in 'hand to people asking iheiii to contribute to the present Commonwealth loan? Why should we not levy on every person an amount proportionate to his or her means? During the war, I took a wealth census. That £13 - showed clearly the way in which comhis pulsory loans could be introduced. By £200 sii«h means, the Government would be assured of raising £300.000,000 I am denor denying that there are limit* to the esipacity of this country to provide money. however, that the per capitaoutput of the workers of Australia at. the moment, therecompares favourably with that of thp workers of any other country in the world. amount of £500,000,000 is colossal, but not beyond our capacity. But the workers must be maintained at a high state of physical efficiency. They must an abundance of food. I agree with what the right honourable the Prime Min(Mr Curtin) said last. week. At the same time, however, we must have food. T was seriously disturbed when I heard right honourable gentleman say that he the might have to consider limiting tucker rather than supply men for the Army. In my opinion adequate food supplies are essentia] to a maximum war effort and food is the basis of war. Without food we men can neither fight nor work.",48
210,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"The right honourable surmember will remember that what I said that if I had to 'take the risk of short of tucker in twelve months or short of fighting men at the present time, the risk that I would take would be that of twelve months hence and not that of the present.",48
211,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Pu t in that way. I take no excpption to the statement. All I sa.y is that there is no reason to believe flint we have not the capacity to produce all that is necessary of munitions and of food at the present rate, and even at an accelerated rate. Returning to the question of loans, I say frankly that I cannot understand the attitude of the Government towards compulsory loans. It is illogical, and inconsistent with the basic principles of the Labour party. That party, as everybody knows, rests upon compulsion. Mr CALWELI. - It does not; membership of the party is on a voluntary basis.",48
212,Mr HUGHES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I do not know what the fir3t plank of the party is now; but when I was a member of the party the platform began with socialism, or something of that kind-and that, of course, is based upon supremacy of the State and limitation of the freedom of action of the individual. Then, too, Labour believes quite properly in unionism. Unionism is voluntary in theory, but in practice it is compulsory. It would never be able to function without compulsion. When I was in the ranks of the waterside workers, no man was permitted to work on the wharves who was not a member of the wharf labourers' union. That is true of every union which can do more lihan bleat. So I say that compulsion is the foundation upon which the doctrines of the Labour party have been built. That has been the case ever since Labour came into politics. But the present position is without parallel in the history of this country. Every man of military age is compelled to join the Army. Every man of any age, provided he is physically fit, and every woman, too, is compelled to work where the Government directs, at the task to which the Government puts him or her, and at the hours and for the wages that arn fixed by awards made under the law. The Government swallows this camel and strains at that gnat-it conscripts labour to fight and to work but it will not agree to compulsory loans-frankl y I cannot understand its attitude. It is true, of course, that when those who now occupy the ministerial benches were in opposition, and my right honourable friend the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) introduced n measure for the application of the principle of compulsory loans, they opposed it. I can understand that; it was natural. They were in opposition and so they opposed the Government's proposals. But now they are in office, and have done things that I never dared to do; they have introduced industrial conscription-the most odious of all-bu t they still balk, at compulsory loans. Whatever else may be said of honourable members who sit on this side of the chamber, although none of them dared to conscript labour, we did dare to propose compulsory loans. I want to make my position perfectly clear. I am not objecting to what the Government has done. But having done so much, why does it now hesitate to apply the principle of compulsory loans? The alternative is inflation. I know very well that some honourable members opposite, happily not very many of them, believe that it is possible, by some hocuspocus, tofinancethe war by means of bank credit. They believe that wars are fought with money. Their leader has reminded them times out of number that wars are fought with physical things-wit h men and things made'by men. If there were anything in the idea of national credit, and wars could befinancedby such means, I put it to my friends who talk so glibly about it-and who, incidentally, in nine cases out of ten, are Communists, with a label that is either displayed or carefully concealed inside - the lapels of their coatsthat Russia would have financed its war operations in that way long ago. Yet what is it doing? It walks the same hard road as the people of every other country. Russia finances its war out of the savings of its people, who are compelled to loan them to the government. That is a sensible way of carrying on business. Russia pays its people interest on their loans. Every body knows that money is not only a medium of exchange, but also a measure of value. In these days, when metallic money has been displaced by paper money, the relation between the quantity of money and goods available for consumption is not so clear as it was formerly; but for all practical purposes it amounts to this: that if there is to be stability of the prices of goods there must be control over the quantity of money available. Broadly speaking, the more money in circulation, the dearer the goods; and the more goods, the cheaper they are. In order to maintain stable price levels, control of money in circulation is essential. Too much money means inflation. In order to produce goods, labour and capital must be expended - but in order to produce money, all that is needed is to print more notes or ro change the figures on the note, putting "" 5 "" in place of "" 1 "" . It is Notes are poured out, but as there can be no corresponding increase of the quantity of goods, money loses its value, the people get .alarmed and because prices rise, more money is printed. And so it goes onmoney loses value with every additional issue of new notes. Inflation spells ruin. To those men in this country who have money in their pockets and seek to hoard it, to those who think that by putting their money in a savings bank they can escape from the consequences of inflation, I say that that is the road to destruction and disaster. Their money will remain there, but its value will disappear. The Government, is carrying on the business of this country, and I am supporting it. But unless it be prepared to make such provisions as are necessary for ensuring the success of the loans that are essential to the carrying on of the war effort, it will be impossible to fight inflation and, consequently, disaster will follow.",49
213,Mr COLES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Henty) [9.14] - I congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) upon having placed before the committee a forthright and simple story in his presentation of the largest war-time budget this country has ever had, and far larger than anything ever forecast. Associated with it are certain pleasant circumstances. The most pleasant is that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) has stated that it is the intention of the party that he leads to co-operate with the Government in its attempt to raise the money that it needs to finance the war. The other pleasing thing about the. budget is that nearly all the increased expenditure is for war purposes. Civil expenditure has been kept down to a minimum, and last j-ear was £3,000,000 below the estimate. Let us hope that a similar result can be achieved this yeaT. It is true that the estimate for civil expenditure is £8,000,000 higher than last year, but practically all of that is represented by expenditure on social services, to which Parliament has agreed. The major criticism that can be levelled against the budget is that there is a gap - the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) calls it a dangerous gap-of £300,000,000 between the estimates of very simple. receipts and expenditure.",50
214,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,How is it proposed to bridge that gap?,50
215,Mr COLES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Financ e in war-time is a different matter altogether from finance in peace-time. The Government, in time of peace, can expand credit for expenditure upon the purchase of consumable goods. The whole process becomes practically a business transaction, and the money flows back into the Treasury. In time of war, most of the national expenditure is devoted to the production of goods which .are destroyed. They do not go on the market to be bought by the public. Nevertheless, the money finds its way into the hands of the people. Unfortunately, the belief seems to be gaining ground that the war can be financed by central bank credit without taxation. The Treasurer has said that in that way lies grave danger. The Government finances the war by the issue of treasury bills, which are discounted by the Commonwealth bank. The money finds its way to the manufacturers for the purchase of war goods, and to the people in the form of wages. Unless that money returns to the Treasury, we shall have inflation, pure and simple, and it can return only in the form of taxes, or of loans-eithe r interest bearing or noninterest bearing. The best method, and the one which would leave no future debt, would be to get the money hack in the form of taxes. The second best way would be to get it back in the form of interest-free loans, whilst the third method, which is the one generally followed, is to get it back in the form of interest-bearing loans subscribed by the people. This is the method which the Government has chosen to follow.",50
216,Mr SPENDER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"The honourable member does not expect that the Government will be able to raise all that money. Mir. COLES-The Government has said, through the Treasurer, that it is determined to get the money. In those words lies the safety of Australia. The record of this Government shows that whatever it has determined to do it has, in fact, done. Although the raising of much money seems to be an impossible task, I should not be surprised if the people rose to the occasion. After all, what is it they are being asked to do? They are not being asked to subscribe £300,000,000 this year; it is more like £1SO,000,000 or £200,000,000. The vernment releases the money, and there must be some lag before it can return. Any one who tries to show that Ausspread tralia is in a dangerous financial posibeen tion because use has been made of the national credit in war-time, is an alarmist who is endeavouring to injure his counl)a.st try. Let us consider the spending power of the Australian public over the last years. In the first year of the war. found. 1939-40, the aggregate personal income of the people of Australia was £745,000,000. About £120.000,000 was collected in State and Commonwealth taxes, leaving £625,000,000 in the of the people. Last year, 1941-42, the aggregate personal income of the people was £852.000,000. Taxation amounted to £210,000,000, leaving £642,000,000 for impose it? will . expenditure by the public. Actually, therefore, there was more spending power in the hands of the people this year two years ago, except for the fact that the people were asked to subscribe more to loans. In 1939-40, they subscribed registration. £38,000,000. The following year the amount was £60,000,000, whilst year it increased to £110,000.000. and the loans were over-subscribed by £20,000.000. This indicates that, the spirit of the Australian people is right. They have accepted every burden that has been placed upon them since the war broke out. I have advocated compulsory loans in the past, and I shall be very interested to see whether the oan this year raise the amount of money which is necessary. Mr SI'ENDEK - Why is the honourable member departing from his principles partly responsible? this year?",50
217,Mr COLES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I am not doing so. I believe that, in order to distribute burden equitably over the people, comthat pulsion is the fairest way, but. no country has been prepared to adopt compulsion in everything. There is no reason to suppose that the people will not subscribe £1?0,000,000 this year out of a total inso come of £900,000,000 which, after the deduction of taxes, will leave about £500,000,000 in the hands of the people. I am not taking sueh charges as land tax, &c, into account, because they are constant. Thus, the amount of spending power left with the people represents Goa reduction of only about 15 per cent., plus the rising cost of living. 1 do not say that the burden is being evenly. In the first place, it has placed upon the higher incomes, but in time of war we must consider the total national income, and raise the revenue as we can. If the people fail to subscribe to the loans, I accept the word of few the Treasurer that the money must be",51
218,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Can the honourable member point out to me the passage in the 'budget speeeh in which the Treasurer said that the Government was deterhands mined to raise the money needed ?,51

It has placed women in occupations which were formerly the prerogative of men. It has given full recognition to women's auxiliaries of the armed forces.",52
232,Mr MCEWEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The honourable memnot ber should not dwell on that point.,52
233,Mr COLES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I am merely quoting some of the positive facts that may be relevant to the situation. Tihe Government has also substantially increased the of soldiers, and dependants' allowances. Those reforms were long overdue. The Government has also intensified the of enemy aliens, and of subversive activities.",52
234,Mr SPENDER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,What else?,52
235,Mr COLES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"The Government has introduced a uniform income tax and has controlled secondary inflation by taking over the surplus funds of the banks. The Government has constituted a production executive to analyse and control the trade and production of the country, and has appointed a food council to ensure that the production of food will meet the demands. I do not say that the entry of Japan into the war did not accelerate these changes, but all of them were sorely needed in September, 1939. The Government has also solved the sticky problem of pooling petrol. Hitherto, that was not politically expedient. The Government has made progress with the standardization of goods, because of the shortage of man-power. The rationing of goods, supplies of which are short, for the purpose of enuring equal distribution is another net of this Government, which has also provided a compensation scheme for civilians who may be incapacitated while on duty connected with the war. Then the war damage compensation regulations protect property-owners against losses due",52
236,Sir GEORGE BELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,That is not operat,52
237,Mr COLES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Is a charge of 4s. per cent, per annum unfair? The Government has improved the scale of social services, so that the health of the country for may be better at the expiration of the",52
238,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Is this an electioneer,52
239,Mr COLES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I shall give the honourable member something to bite on; the Government has brought, to some degree, peace on the coal-fields. It has appointed a permanent body to plan for post-war reconstruction, and has begun to rationalize industry. These acts represent positive achievements by the Government, which, in the interests of the country, has departed from many of the views which Ministers expressed whon they sat in opposition. Eor that, they are worthy of the trust of the people, and I believe that they enjoy that trust.",52
240,Mr MCEWEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Does not the honourable member believe that previous governments attempted to do these things, but that the Labour party opposed them for political reasons?",53
241,Mr COLES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I am a great believer in positive action, as opposed to words, and therefore I applaud what is good. The rationalization of industry is almost inextricably linked with reconstruction in the post-war period. As about 50 per cent, of our man-power has heen diverted to war activities, the Government must hasten to re-organize industries which, because they handle materials required for war purposes, have not been put out of existence. From the depleted man-power that remains, the Government most get the greatest possible value, so that the needs of the Army may be satisfied, and the minimum needs of the civilian population may be maintained. To achieve those objects, the Government must group some industries. It is not possible to wage war without losses. Soldiers risk their lives in battle, and unfortunately many of them are killed. In the circumstances, no great hardship is imposed on the civilian population if they have to lose, for the time being, a portion of their earnings. When the Department of War Organization of Industry begins to regroup the activities of industry, in order to get the maximum efficiency with the least man-power, the Minister should keep in view the potential capacity of each industry for future expansion. ""No one knows when we shall emerge from this war. The end may be a year or five years' hence. But many people are wondering what will happen in the postwar period. It is much easier to build on a known foundation, than to begin afresh in a competitive world, in which other countries will be fighting for our markets. Therefore, I urge the Minister to consult, at every step, people engaged in various industries, seek their advice, and, if possible, adopt their suggestion?. The pooling of petrol, while simple in itself, was an extraordinarily good example of how the rights of those engaged in an industry may be merged and yet protected for later expansion. Another principle to be observed in the rationalization of industry, which is most important, is that we should never totally destroy an industry. If we were to do so, the morale of the people would be depressed. When I was in Great Britain last year, I noticed that the Government adopted the policy, in constricting industry, to allow some goods to trickle to the consumers. The goods might have been available once every quarter and stocks might have been exhausted in a week, but the morale of the people was maintained, because their factories continued to operate and they believed that the war was not lost. The women were able to buy lipstick, and men were able to buy hair oil, in small quantities; and, so, they believed that Old England was carrying on. I shall support the Government, and shall do everything in my power to make the spirit of the people such that they will subscribe the money that the Treasurer requires for war purposes. If they do not, I shall support the Government if it, finds itself in the position of having to introduce post-war credits or compulsory loans.",53
242,Mr SPENDER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Will the honourable member support the Government if it does not introduce post-war credits or compulsory loans?,53
243,Mr COLES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,When that position arises I shall face it.,53
244,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Kooyong) [9.45] - 1I have listened in common with other honourable members with great interest to this strange and somewhat melancholy apology delivered by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Coles). He made, in the course of his remarks, three points which I took the liberty of jotting down.",53
245,Mr BECK,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,As many as all that?,53
246,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Oh , yes.",53
247,Mr MCEWEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"He comes down from 21 points to 3. "" Mr MENZIES - Yes , from 21 to 3. The three points were these: In the first place, he said that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) had offered cooperation in "" this thing "" - I quote his own words- "" this thing"", and I take it the honourable gentleman was referring to the budget. I must say that I am indebted to him. I cannot imagine a better description of this budget than the phrase which I have just quoted. The remark, of course-wha t shall I say? I must use the parliamentary expressionhappened to lack foundation, because the Leader of the Opposition condemned this budget roundly. He offered no co-operation in carrying out such a strange financial scheme as is contained in this budget. What he did say was that the Opposition would co-operate in all those things necessary to the winning of the war, and there is a very sharp distinction between the things necessary for the winning of the war and the budget, which is calculated to impair the war effort of this country. The second thing that the honourable member for Henty said was that he admired the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley). If he had paused there, .1 should have agreed with him, because 3 admire the Treasurer very much. But he said that he admired him for his clear and simple statement of the finances of this country. I shall come back to that in a moment, because the statement of the finances of this country was not clear and it was not simple and, in point of fact it will be disastrous. But, in the third place, the honourable member for Henty engaged in a sort of feeling reminiscence of the last election and said, "" I believe in the law of change "". My word! that was a profound truth. If anybody has had a good look at the campaign in Henty at the last election and compared the speeches then made by the honourable member, who was a candidate, with the speech that he has made here to-night and some of the other speeches he has made in this chamber, he would say, "" Why this man is the very embodiment of the law of change"". I cannot help remembering that at the last election the honourable member, standing as an independent candidate for Henty, with the full support of the United Australia party organization in every sense- I emphasize that-in every sense, was happy indeed to seek the suffrage of what was a nonlabour electorate, which could be won only by a candidate who stood on the non-Labour side, and before the law of change had begun to do its deadly work, said, as I recall it, that he stood foi three things. The first was conscription. He now supports a Government which is pledged against it. The second thing ho stood for was a national government. He has now transferred his humble allegiance to the one party which has stood against a national government and whose opposition has prevented it from coming into existence. In the third place, he said that he stood for an all-in war effort. He now stands for a war effort which means all-in for some people and pretty well all-out for hundreds of thousands of others. Now, if we were dealing with an ordinary mortal, these things would excite comment. People would say, ""Oh, that is strangely inconsistent, is it not? How can a man preach one gospel in September. 1940, and another quite as eloquently, I assure you, in September. 1942? "" The answer is",53
248,Mr SPENDER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,A lemon.,54
249,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"No , not a lemon, although that is not a bad answer; but the real answer is, "" Oh, since then with my wealth of experience in Parliament and on committees, on the rationing committee and on the war damage committee. I have discovered that the one thing that counts is the law of change "". I shall now take the honoraible member, for Henty into ground contained in this budget speech of the Treasurer, which, as described by the honourable member, is such a simple, clear, convincing and even determined statement of financial policy. I have read the speech with some interest, somewhat more closely I imagine than has the honourable member for Henty, and I find in it a most remarkable series of events. In the first place, the speech set out in the 3hop window such goods as the Government thought might be saleable at the next election in all electorates, including Henty, where I understand confidently, there will not be a labour candidate. And I approve of that, because I think that one is quite unnecessary. Then having set out the goods in .the shop window, the speech goes on to set out what the expenditure will be in this financial year, and I direct attention, in passing, to one passage from it . Indeed I would respectfully direct the honourable member for Henty, as a financial man, to it . After the Treasurer bas set out what the expenditure will be on his estimates he says-In suite of its size I must warn honourable members that the experience of last year may be repeated and the figure exceeded as the result of the dire necessities of the grim struggle that lies ahead. That is true. If the war expenditure is estimated at this stage to be £440,000,000, who shall say that at the end of the financial year it will not have amounted to £500,000,000. 1 accept that. It is a proper warning. I paid some attention to it , but, as events will show, the Treasurer paid none. Now, having set that out, the Treasurer goes on-and this no doubt, wa» the passage which was admired by the honourable member for HentyUnder the arrangement made with the Chan cellor of the Exchequer by my colleague the right honourable the Attorney-General, obligations which we cannot currently meet will be postponed for consideration after the war. 1 invite 'the honourable member for Henty to ask himself in the watches of the night what that means. Mr Coi.su - Thar , means a lag.",54
250,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"The honourable member says that it means a lag. I say ro - him that what it means is that the responsibilities of this country for the financing of the war are to a degree being paid for the time being by the people of Great, Britain . The honourable member surely will agree with that. The next thing that we find in this budget speech is this. The Treasurer summarizes the budget, and having stated his revenue and his expenditure, he brings out as the "" deficiency (to be financed by loans, &c.) ""-1941-42 , £211,000,000; and 1942-4'3, £300,000,000. f f the defence expenditure is £60,000,000 over what it has been estimated to be, then the £300,000,000 must become £360,000,000. There is a short, clear, simple statement of the problem. Last year a gap of £211,000,000 had to be filled, and this year a gap of somewhere between £300.000.000 and £400,000,000 will havt to be filled. What happened Inst year? Loans accounted £127,000,000 and treasury-bills, a draft upon the central bank of the country, accounted for £78,500,000. As to the loans themselves, it is quite true bhat the public borruwing increased by 100 per cent, over the previous year. It would have been curious if it had not, because in the meantime Japan had entered the war, and this country had a sense of imminent danger it had never experienced before. It would have been a strange reflection on the Australian people if loans had not risen, but, notwithstanding all those factors, the total borrowing amounted to £127,000,000. That would suggest to the unsophisticated mind that in this year the Government must be content to have an enormous gap unbridged by central bank credit, or it must, by some means, enormously increase voluntary subscriptions to loans in Australia, or it must exercise compulsion upon every income earner in Australia in order to make up the deficiency. I know no other than those three ways to approach this problem.",55
251,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,How will all the interest be paid ?,55
252,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Do not ask me that question. I refer the honourable member to the Treasurer, because the Treasurei says, with a mere gesture, 30 admired by the honourable member f o i Henty, "" We will borrow £300,000,000 "". He explains that in his speech. I shall quote the passage, because, to my mind, this is the most frivolously irresponsible statement of finance I have ever readThe amount of loans required this year is large, but its provision is not impossible. Last year we doubled the receipts from public loans' and got £120,000,000. If we double them again and I interrupt myself to say that thia is the oldest game of childhood-thin k of a number and then double it . It appealed at once to the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan). He was saying that when 'the results were coming in during the last election! The Treasurer saidIf we double them again we shall get £240,000,000. The arithmetic is impeccablewhich will take us a long way on our journey. It will leave £00,000,000 to be provided from savings bonds and savings certificates. This is about the British rate of contributions to for small savings, and, with our higher wages, should be capable of accomplishment. I invite honourable members to have a look at that passage, to chew it over. If we double what we got last year then we shall have £240,000,000. If we subscribe to war savings certificates in the same way and with the same fervour as the hard-pressed people of Great Britain have done out of their much smaller earnings, then we shall have £60,000,000. What are the facts ? In his previous budget speech, the Treasurer said, ""Last year ""-h e was referring to the deplorable regime of myself and my distinguished friend, the Leader of the Opposition- "" we got £12,500,000. This year we shall double it "" . And with equal accuracy it was ascertained, on reference to the Treasury, that twice £12,500,000 was £25,000,000. What, in fact, did he get, net ?-£9,000,000 . War savings certificate subscriptions fell in Australia in this great year of emergency by £3,500,000; yet, in spite of that experience, the Treasurer said "" It is all right. I believe in the voluntary system for ever, and, although it is true that there was a little recession from £12,500,000 to £9,000,000, this year we can get £60,000,000"".",55
253,Mr CONELAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Does the right honourable gentleman believe that the poorer people took out small loans instead of buying war savings certificates?,56
254,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I do not. But what about the borrowing? I put this to honourable members on the Government side of the chamber: How manymen and how many women who subscribed to public loans last year will be able to scribe the same amount this year? We can judge this by our own experience. [ have, I suppose in common with most honourable members, made a point of making such subscriptions as I could to every loan that has been floated in this country during this war. I shall be very lucky to subscribe in the current financial year one-tenth of what I was able to subscribe in the previous financial year.",56
255,Mr BOSEVEAR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Then how would the right honourable gentleman get the money by compulsory loans ?,56
256,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The honourable member has conveniently forgotten one thing - a thing out of which he likes to make political capital. The simple truth is that the great income total in the lower income bracket in Australia is not doing its share in the finanoing of this war. [14],56
257,Mr BOSEVEAR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The average is £3 a week.,56
258,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I am surprised at the honourable member trotting out this moth-eaten statement about an average of £3 a week. This is the oldest thing in politics. He says, "" How many breadwinners are there, and what is the total "", and then he works out an average. He includes among the breadwinners small boys earning 10s. a week and youngsters seventeen years of age, who have started work at £1 a week. He knows perfectly well that the adult male wage in this country, if it is taken out on an annual basis, has probably doubled since this war began. Furthermore, he knows that, at the last point at which we had any accurate information, 70 per cent, of the total of all incomes in Australia was being earned by people with incomes of less than £8 a week. Nobody is going to get any pleasure by standing up and saying "" Look here, you have a modest income. You must pay towards this war"". But every body knows, nobody better than those who are in charge of the Government, that if you are going to finance this war you must reduce the enormous volume of purchasing power of the country for civil goods and civil services, whether you like it or not. Then my friends opposite have a choice. They can reduce purchasing power in one of three ways-this is the essence of this financial problem. They can do it by taxing, but they say "" Oh, no! The law sub- of change may apply to the honourable member for Henty, but it does not apply to us. We are pledged against taxing these people, and therefore we must forget about taxation"". That leaves two methods. The second method is to impose a system of post-war credits, that is to say, to take the money from the people at this stage and give them credit for it, a credit which will be beyond value to them when the war is over. In other words, this second method is to make a part of their pay deferred pay. But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition put up that proposal in crystal-clear terms when, as Prime Minister and Treasurer, he introduced a budget. That budget was dismissed, he was dismissed, and, what is even more melancholy, I was dismissed. In fact, quite a number of us were dismissed. The result is, of course, that the Government says, "" ""Well, at the moment we cannot introduce post-war credits"". Nevertheless, I venture to make a prophecy that, before it is nine months older, it will do so. The third method of reducing the purchasing power of the people is to do it by inflation, the easiest, the most cowardly and the most unjust of all the methods. That is the method alluded to by my amiable friends in the corneT, who are still licking their wounds.",56
259,Mr ROSEVEAR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Inflatio n is only a bogy.,57
260,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"They dismiss that. They say it is only a bogy! I shall say a few words about this bogy in a moment. Just now I do not want to draw myself away from the interesting task I had in hand of finishing my glance at this speech. I have told the committee what the Treasurer said about the method of raising the money. It is remarkable; it is a sort of abracadabra. Then, having got that off his chest, I can imagine that the Treasurer, who is by no means lacking in a sense of humour, said to himself, "" Well, now. that was not so good "". So, I imagine, he went away to my distinguished friend, the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt), and said, "" Can you suggest some way by which I can recover my balance on. this thing"" ; and the Attorney-General, with that ingenuity which I have admired in him for many years, said, "" That is all right""-address ing the Treasurer by a suitable appellation- "" we can have a paragraph about post-war reconstruction"". And so, in went the paragraph about post-war reconstruction. Far be it from me to quarrel with one word of the picture that is painted of what we need in this post-war reconstruction. This paragraph sets out objectives which I hope are common to decent men and women all over Australia. So far as I am concerned, I subscribe to them and shall do everything in my power to bring them into reality. However, I take the opportunity to draw attention to this fact: Towards the end of that paragraph, after the reference to a constitutional referendum which is received with only modified raptures, there is this statementIt will, therefore, ask the people of tralia to arm the Commonwealth Parliament with full power to ensure that the four freedoms shall be enjoyed throughout the Commonwealth and its territories.",57
261,Mr MORGAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Is the right honourable gentleman in favour of this?,57
262,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I am indeed, but apparently the honourable gentleman is not, because one of the fouT freedoms is freedom from want, and if there be one sure way of plunging the people of this country or any country into want it is wholesale inflation of the currency. My friends in the corner can make these sounds of oachinnation, they can whistle to keep up their spirits as they go past their financial graveyards, but the truth is, as they know, that there has heen no country yet in the history of the world that has plunged into inflation as a method of finance that has not, before many years have passed, plunged its people into that very want, freedom from which was one of the four freedoms propounded by the President of the United States of America, I say that there is no better way of preserving the people of Australia against want than to keep the economic structure of the country stable into the post-war period. Having touched on that matter in what I take leave to say was a paradoxical fashion, the Treasurer ended by saying-and this has appealed to me as a sort of deathbed repentanceNo legerdemain can produce the needs for war. Neither can they be obtained by easy financial expedients.",57
263,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Did the right honourable member write that himself?,57
264,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,I might have done so indeed. It expresses my sentiments to perfection. Does it not express the honourable gentleman's sentiments?,57
265,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,No .,57
266,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I thought perhaps n did not. That is a statement that can not be improved upon. I had taken a much longer statement from another source, hut I discarded it, because here you have the true essence of the matterNo legerdemain can produce the needs foi war. Neither can they be obtained by easy financial expedients. That is the theory of it. What is the practice of it in this budget? In cold Ausfact, the Treasurer has budgeted for the financial requirements of the country by saying, "" Here is a gap of £300,000,000, which will probably be exceeded. You can add to it any number you can think of. How do I bridge that gap ?"" Does he really believe that he is going to borrow £300,000,000 from the public with no compulsion, by pure voluntary subscription? Does he believe that he will be able to tap the current savings of the people of Australia-that is the only true way to avoid inflation-to the tune of £300,000,000 unless he takes every step to create that fund of savings in advance? How can he create that fund in advance? By all-round rationing, by compulsory borrowing in the form of post-war credits, and by taxation. I know of no other course he can pursue to create such a fund of savings on which the Government may draw. If the honourable gentleman does not do these things, I prophesy-and I regard it as a conservative prophecy",57
267,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Comin g from the right honourable member it would be a conservative prophecy.,58
268,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I would sooner be conservative than rattle-pated. I make the conservative prophecy that whereas in the last financial year it appears that the central hank was tapped for £S0,000,000 in treasury-bills, it will extraordinarily fortunate institution, and this will be an extraordinarily fortunate country,-if in this financial year, is not tapped for £180,000,000 in treasury-bills.",58
269,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,What would be wrongwibh that?,58
270,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Does the honourable gentleman realise the effect on the eco> nomy of this country of injecting, in two years, £260,000,000 worth of central bank credit into our financial system? I remind him that last year's injections have not been dealt with in this budget. No provision has been made for funding treasury-bills issued last year. They go on, and may have added to them £1S0,000,000 wor,tlh of similar bills this year. The effect of what has been done already may be seen in the symptoms of inflation in Australia. I direct attention to two or three interesting factors in this connection. Inflation, as honourable members may realise, but as perhaps too few people in this country have discovered, is only another way of devaluing the currency. The currency, in fact, becomes worth less in commodity values. The sure test of commodity values is the price levels. Our price-index is computed in various ways. I have taken, as offering a fair average base, the wholesale prices calculated on the average of the three years ended June, 1939, which was ithe end of the financial year nearest to the beginning of the war.",58
271,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,I suppose the information was obtained from Dhe Melbourne Stock Exchange?,58
272,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"In fact, the information was obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician, a most reputable authority, who no doubt will confirm the figures if the honourable member cares to approach him, though I do not expect that that will happen. The wholesale prices of basic materials and foodstuffs over the three years ended June, 1939, which gave an index figure of 1,000, by June of this year gave an index figure of 1,327. The retail prices for the six capital cities-that is, the "" C "" seriesfor the three years ended June, 1939, which gave an index figure of 1,000, by June of this year gave an index figure be an of 1,220. In other words, during that period the purchasing power of money, expressed in terms of goods, had fallen the bank by about 20 per cent,",58
273,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The exact figure is' 18 per cent.,58
274,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"The right honourable gentleman will realise that it depends upon which figures are accepted as the basis; but I shall not quarrel with his IS per cent. I said about 20 per cent. Let us look at the note issue, to which the Leader of the Opposition referred. In September, 1939, it totalled £51,000,000. By the end of June, 1942, it had risen to nearly £103,000,000. There is some reason to believe that at present it is about £110,000,000.",58
275,Mr ABBOTT,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Was the mare galloping faster ?,58
276,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I am not familiar with the verbiage of the race-course, and, apparently, I shall have little opportunity to amend that deficiency; but this horse gallops faster and faster the longer it travels. Of course, when I point out what inflation has done to other countries, some honourable gentlemen opposite will immediately reply, ""Yes, but that cannot happen to us. We are so much more clever than' the people of those other countries. We know so much more about finance than the people of Germany and France, who dealt with finance there after the last war"". I do not believe it for a moment. I believe that onoe the path of financial rectitude is departed from and an inflationary movement started, it will defeat the best wit of man to stop it, except by methods which would probably be politically entirely unpalatable. With other honourable members on this side of the committee, I consider it necessary, for various reasons, to state my views plainly, if briefly, on the sinister inflationary element in this budget. The tendency towards inflation is indicated clearly in the rising price levels. These inexorably and inevitably impose a very real tax on the f l note, whoever owns it. E tell my honourable friends opposite that the day will come when those who have voted for them will say, "" How is i i that my money is worth less now than it was? How is it that, although I have been given a bigger pension, my bigger pension is worth less to me in terms of meat, potatoes, cauliflowers aud bread than was my original pension ?""",58
277,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"We shall say, "" Blame the Menzies Government""!",59
278,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Of course; but the fact will remain that the inflation will have devalued the f l note, alike of the old-age pensioner and the wealthiest millionaire in the country. I should like to say a word-and here I borrow a phrase from the right honourable the Prime Minister-for those whom I represent-the middle section of people in this country: those who have fixed incomes; salary-earners, who have saved money and desire to live on it ; those who have struggled hard for independence. They are the people who are hit most cruelly, and are ultimately destroyed, by inflation. It has been pointed out, quite truly, by observers, that the great continentalinflations of 1923 did one thing more successfully than any other-the y destroyed the middle classes of Germany; and when they did that, they opened the door as wide as a church door for the entry of national socialism. Do not let us forget that. One of the great balancing factors in this and any other country is what I have referred to as the middle section of people. It is all very well for any of my friends to go to the wage-earner, and say: "" It is all right. . If the price of goods goes up, your wages will go up according to the rise of the cost of liv- ing "". If the wage-earner allows himself to be deceived by that, I shall be sorry for him; because there never has been a period in the world's history when upward prices have been overtaken by upward wages. The prices rise first, and the wages plod laboriously after them. Therefore, I warn the Government not to believe that it can escape from its financial responsibilities by the easy upward movement of prices through inflation. Those who are on salaries', whose incomes are fixed, cannot go to an arbitration court and say: "" Will you increase our salaries, because the cost of living has risen?"" They have to accept the position. They are completely ground between the upper and nether millstones in any economic system, and are readily forgotten when we are discussing the finances of the country. The last thing that I want to say about inflationand this is merely by way of recalling it to the memory of honourable members-is that when there is a great inflation you may bet your boots that it will be followed by a great depression. After all, if there is one thing that stands out clearly in connection with the financial affairs of the last war, it is that we then financed ourselves by means of inflation. Everybody then said: "" There is plenty of money about; let's eat, drink, and be merry"". They did not believe that tomorrow they would die. But the whirligig of time brought its revenges, and the great inflation was followed by a great depression.",59
279,Mr MCLEOD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Was there any need for it?,59
280,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"If , during the last war, finance had been conducted all over the world with due regard to the diabolical results that can flow from inflation, there would have been no need for it. But nobody cared; consequently, inflation inevitably brought in deflation, just as boom inevitably brings in depression. I say to honourable members "" You cannot fill the stomachs of the people of Australia with a windy diet of promises as to what you are going to do for them after the war"". [Extension of time granted.] It is all very well for honourable members opposite-and I am now addressing myself to one or two of my friends in the corner-to go around drawing sketches of the new heaven and the new earth that will arise in Australia if only Labour be in office. We all are familiar with the particular jargon that is employed in order to describe it. If this budget be not radically alteredand I have a. shrewd idea that it will be before this financial year reaches its close - the n the only new heaven they will succeed in presenting to the people of Australia will be singularly like a rather old-fashioned hell.",59
281,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Fremantle - Prime Minister) [10.32] - The right honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat has treated us to very much the same sort of speech as he delivered a year ago. It has been full of the evils of inflation. He prefaced his remarks in that connection with what I regretted to observe was an attack upon an honourable member for having indicated, very clearly and specifically, the reasons for the vote that he intends to give.",60
282,Mr ABBOTT,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,About as clear as mud.,60
283,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,They were good reasons.,60
284,Mr ABBOTT,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The right honourable gentleman was not here at the time.,60
285,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I was here. I have been here practically the whole of this evening. I confess that if I wished to relax from the strain of the present era 1 should regard this as probably the only place in which I could comfortably do so. Taken as a whole, I feel quite confident that the right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) would not have delivered the speech that he has delivered to-night, or that which he made a year ago, had he sat on this side of the Chairman of Committees. To-night, the right honourable gentleman said that, inflation having started, it is impossible to arrest it I remind him that the budgets that have been introduced into this Parliament since the war commenced have been budgets which laid down three sources from which revenue was to be derived in order to meet war expenditure. These were taxation, loans, and central bank provision. That has been one of the principles of each budget statement made to this committee. The objection to the present budget is that it provides for a war expenditure that is so considerable that the total amount of taxation which is considered fair and reasonable, plus the total amounts of loans which can be raised according to any principle, either voluntary or compulsory, would still leave a deficiency on the total expenditure which the Opposition has accepted as nroper.",60
286,Mr SPENDER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Where does the right honourable gentleman get that idea?,60
287,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Fro m an analysis of any speech that has been made either in the Parliament or out of it. I say quite frankly that the £24,000,000 which the right honourable gentleman who now leads the Opposition proposed to raise by means of post-war credits, in the budget which he introduced last year, has already been absorbed into the revenue by means of the direct taxes which this Parliament has imposed, and by the incidence of the indirect taxation that has been levied. Therefore the total tax levied by this Government during the time it has been in office has exhausted the field of postwar credits which the budget statement of the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition envisaged.",60
288,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,So this Government is limiting the amount then stated.,60
289,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"If we look at the facts we shall find that the last Government proposed in its budget to raise £25,000,000 by post-war credits. The present Government has actually imposed new taxes to the amount of approximately £75,000,000. Whether the moneys required be taken by post-war credits or taxation, this Government has collected for the purpose of war by its taxation policy three times more than the sum which the Leader of the Opposition proposed to get by post-war credits.",60
290,Mr FADDEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,But on a different basis.,60
291,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I am dealing with what is called the gap. Taxation, loans and central bank credits were the tbree sources from wbicb the two previous Governments and this Government have had to obtain the money needed to meet the war expenditure. The last budget submitted by the Leader of the Opposition would have yielded £74,000,000 less tax than this Government has imposed, but post-war credits which this Government did not impose would have yielded £25,000,000. There is a difference of about £50,000,000. But it should be remembered that this Government raised enormously increased sums by loans over the amounts contemplated by the Leader of the Opposition.",60
292,Mr EADDTSN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Why ?,61
293,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Neve r mind why. We are dealing with facts. With more than £100,000,000 of increased war expenditure, this Government has met the problem of finance in the last year with approximately the same use of central bank credits as the previous governments proposed. I invite representative members of the Opposition to have that argument out with me in a place where the umpires can deal with it, the umpires being those who have had to find the money.",61
294,Mr SPENDEB,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,This is the place to have it out.,61
295,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Honourable members opposite have had the argument, and I say to the country most positively that this Government, in the last financial year, found £100,000,000 to meet increased war expenditure without any exceptional drain on central bank credits over and above that contemplated in the budget statement of the Leader of the Opposition when he was Prime Minister and Treasurer. I invite contradiction or challenge on that statement. It is perfectly true that the Treasurer contemplates the use of central bank credit in dealing with the gap in this budget. Is he the only Treasurer who has to deal with this tremendous burden of expenditure in that way? It is most extraordinary that not one criterion of comparison has been put forward by the Opposition in this regard to show that this Government is doing something which is unprecedented. What it is doing is not unprecedented, but is a commonplace of national finance in every country that is at war.",61
296,Mr SPENDER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The right honourable gentleman would not get anywhere with that argument.,61
297,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The former Treasurer took special pains in his budget speech to justify the use of central bank credit when the expenditure on war was comparatively modest.,61
298,Mr SPENDER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,When there was a large amount of unemployment.,61
299,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"It is true that there was unemployment, and why? It was because governments of that type had been in office too long. I have before me a table dealing with the gap for the 1942-43 financial year, and showing war expenditure, non-war expenditure, total expenditure, revenue on the basis of 194142 taxation and post-war credits, balance to befinancedhy additional taxation and loans, &c, increases in taxes in 194243, increases in post-w.ar credits in 1942-43, and the amount to be financed by loans, &c. This table deals with Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States of America. The amount to be financed by loans in this country is £300,000,000. Honourable members opposite say that that is impossible, and that it will mean inflation. Could the money be raised compulsorily ?",61
300,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,A great deal of it could.,61
301,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,How much?,61
302,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,That is not for me t«> determine.,61
303,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I say to the right honourable gentleman that the amount which it would be reasonable by any system of duress to levy compulsorily is approximately the amount which it is expected that this country will provide voluntarily, and that the effect of the gap on the loan provision, as estimated by the Treasurer, is approximately the same whether compulsion or the voluntary principle be used. In the course of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition on this budget, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) asked me how much we expected to get in voluntary loans, and I - said about £200,000.000.' Under what general plan of compulsion could we get £2-00,000,000 by way of loan, in addition to the incidence of direct and indirect taxation in Australia this year? Can any member of the committee representing the Opposition work it out? The right honourable member for Kooyong, directing attention to the general impact on personal incomes, said that during the present financial year it would be difficult a great number of people to contribute. He said that their patriotism, however great, could not withstand the strain of the taxes imposed on them and their other obligations. Citing his own case, he said that he would have difficulty in subscribing to loans as freely as he had done hitherto. The right honourable member is not an exception. There will be thousands of men like him in Australia, and does he, who cites his own case in this Parliament, suggest that, under a system of compulsory loans, he would be able to do better this year than he is able to do under the voluntary system? Surely that is not so.",61
304,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Does the Prime Minister deny that, by a system of compulsion, it would be possible to get better results than under a voluntary system?",62
305,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I say'that the Treasurer expects to raise approximately £300,000,000 by loan, of which we feel quite certain that at least £200,000,000 can be raised from the public. I am convinced that .any system of compulsion thatsought to obtain a total of more than £200,000,000 this financial year, in addition to what the people will contribute in direct and indirect taxation, would be at once rejected by the right honourable member for Kooyong, as placing an intolerable burden upon the taxpayers. I have not been so stupid as to have failed to discover for myself what would be-the net gain to the Treasury from a system of compulsory loans.",62
306,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Surely the right honourable gentleman sees that the deficit of £100,000,000 must be met by somebody? Mr. Curtin' - We recognize that the gap is there, and it occurs, in the first place, because of the time lag between the issuing of the money to the public and the getting of it back to the Treasury in one form and another. In the second place, it occurs because expenditure for war purposes is immediate. Honourable members know that new projects are put forward from month to month, and sometimes from day to day. Emergency expenditure of all kinds must be undertaken. Large additions to the fighting services have to be provided for. Much of the expenditure is of a capital nature, such as that on munitions annexes. That is why there has been a steep increase of for expenditure amounting to £100,000,000 more than the estimate, consequent upon Japan's entry into the war. Let us presume that the budget provided for the expenditure of £100,000,000 less than we now estimate. There would then be no gap, and every body would be pleased. However, if tomorrow, or the day after, it was found possible to put 100,000 morb men into the Army, and to equip them without imposing an intolerable strain upon the civil population and on our resources, we would do so. What would be the effect on the budget? The cost would be in the vicinity of £37,000,000. Expenditure on pay, rations, clothing and camp expenses would be £32,000,000, and maintenance of equipment, &c, another £5,000,000. Does the right honourable member for Kooyong say that, because we had made no provision for such expenditure in the budget, we should, therefore, refrain from putting those men into the Army? Of course he does not. Let me give another example. I have told the House and the country that if we could obtain increased naval power in this theatre of war it would be an invaluable contribution to our security. We have asked other countries to assist us-that is no secret. Let us presume that the Government of the United Kingdom, which has graciously given to us a ship to replace HMAS. Canberra, were to give us a whole squadron. A ship of the Canberra class costs £750,000 a year for pay, provisions, clothing, repairs, oil fuel, armament and other stores. The cost of a squadron would, of course, be very much greater. Would the right honourable member for Kooyong say that, because of his fears of inflation, and because it might bs necessary to make a greater use of central bank credit than the budget had provided for, - we should therefore refuse the offer of the squadron? Of course, he would not. Honourable members know that the war is fought with battleships, soldiers, guns and munitions, and they know that all this talk about a gap in ourfinancesis beside the point. Every country in the world is faced with a gap in its finances. Some honourable members would have us believe that a country's capacity to ""wage war is limited by the amount of money which it can take from its 'taxpayers. Last year the righ t honourable member for Kooyong said that inflation threatened Australia, and that the value of the pound would depreciate. The Treasurer has said that the outpouring of money in excess of the total of goods and services must necessarily result in there being an excess of money in circulation, and that this can be avoided only by the exercise of proper control. If that control be not exercised, inflation will follow. Everything that the right honourable member has said about the ultimate consequences of not taking money from the .public is true, and the Treasurer and the Government admit it .",62
307,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"'But what is the vernment doing about it? Mr. Curtin"" - I have already said that the amount of money which the Gothose vernment proposes to raise by and voluntary loans is as great as could be raised by taxation and compulsory loans.",63
308,Mr FADDEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"""Will the Prime Minisloan, ter say that the whole of the taxing has been adequately tapped? Mr. Curtin"" - I do not, but I say that we have, as the result of a major reform of taxation policy, secured for Treasury £17,000,000 of revenue over the central bank. and above what it could otherwise have obtained. One of the obligations that we entered into was that we would stand to the direct income tax schedules subtransfer mitted to the Premiers. We had been a met repeatedly with the statement that the schedules of uniform taxation which we had circulated had not been seriously circulated. We were accused of having put in those schedules only in order to the bill through, after which, there was little doubt, taxation would be increased substantially.",63
309,Mr FADDEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Will the right honourable gentleman give an undertaking now to increase the rates in the future?,63
310,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the country that when the Treasurer, in his budget sneech, which was carefullv prepared after a f examination of all the circumstances, that the Government was determined that the amount of money required, as set for t h in its estimates, should be extracted fro m the public, he expressed the policy of the Government.",63
311,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Does the right honourable gentleman regard £200,000,000 as the limit?",63
312,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"No ; I hope to do even better. But £200,000,000, added to the amount to be received as taxes, will represent a substantial recruitment to the revenues of this country. Four or five .years ago, when the honourable gentleman himself was in office, his Government was not game to venture on the road to in flation in order to give jobs to starving men. Mr Spender interjecting,",63
313,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"The honourable gentleGoman knows well that whatever be the extent of the structure, the principles of this budget are identically the <same as upon which he, as Treasurer, fortaxation mulated his war budget.",63
314,Mr SPENDER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"They are implemented differently. If £300,000,000 is required and only"" £200,000.000 can be raised by that means that the currency will field be depreciated for every £1 above £200,000,000.",63

I laugh, as I always laugh when I hear the prophecy of ruin facing us. Thirty years ago the people were told that the get country would be ruined if wages were iucreased, because its industries would be incapable of meeting competition from other countries. Again, when, it was suggested that the working week should be 48 hours, or 44 hours, we were told that it would mean ruin . Every proposal which has been different from the "" stand p at "" orthodox conservatism of honourable gentlemen opposite has always been u l l described as the forerunner of ruin. said Some sections of the community have never been able to keep abreast of progress. Yet they say that we on this side adapt ourselves to the requirements of the present era-that when in opposition we advocated certain things which, as a government, we have not done. That is perfectly true. Mr Stacey interjecting,",63
318,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"If the honourable memwithout ber for Adelaide (Mr Stacey) lived 1,000 years, he would not change his present opinions. He is an excellent example of the mind that can never go forward. If there be any capacity for mental movement on the part of members of the Opposition, it always operates in backward direction; they can never go forward. I admit that the present GovernGovernment ment-grapplin g with tremendous proresponsibility blems, facing a situation which, while we regarded it as a possibility, we hoped would not become a reality; called upon to bring into the forces thousands of men, and to organize industries, intensify duction, gather strength not only from ourselves but also from others-ha s done things which, in all probability, many of its supporters do not approve. Many probably believe that we have gone too it. far, have put the pressure too heavily on the public, have called on men to make sacrifices beyond all reason. I acknowferred ledge that, because it is a not hesitated to impose burdens, not only upon companies in respect of taxes, but also upon trade unionists to ""stay put"". We have pegged wages and jobs.",64
319,Mr SPENDER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"That is something new; wages may be pegged, but allowances are granted.",64
320,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"We have made proit vision for the automatic application of fluctuations of the cost of living. The honourable gentleman, when a Minister, was a member of a government which increased the wages of certain workers by giving to them a war loading without reference to any tribunal. His Government did not peg wages. It merely said, ""What do you want?"" and when vious Government. a proposal was submitted, answered, "" Right"". That is what happened. The first political, non-judicial, decision respect of wages since the war commenced, was made by the Government which precessors ceded the present Government.",64
321,Mr STACEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,And the right honourable gentleman did not object.,64
322,Mr CURTIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"We were not consulted. Since we have been in office we have pegged wages and jobs. We have compelled men to "" stay put"". We have taken men away from their employment and have sent them into the wilderness under all sorts of conditions, at times giving them much opportunity to for say good-bye to their wives. Not only have troops been called up in that way, but also thousands of men have been called up for civil construction jobs. We have done things which trade unionists and citizens generally could properly a describe as tyrannical. I feel a responsibility for what we have done; but the believed that its primary was to get the country so placed defensively that its soldiers could fight most efficiently.' We have made positive decisions.

I hope that I shall not be misunderstood. The previous Government certainly grappled with the problem of putting the industries of the country in a position to supply requirements, and organized the Australian Imperial Force for service overseas; but in respect of the ability of Australia to defend itself against an invader- a problem which required immediate attention when Japan classes of declared war on us",64

331,Mr BARNARD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Bass) [11.8] - This afternoon, I asked the Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) to explain to me the guiding principles that the Department of Civil Aviation followed in deciding what civil aircraft were to be withdrawn from their normal service for other essential requirements. In reply, the Minister outlined what he considered to be the general rules that were observed in such cases. I am of opinion that the department should endeavour to maintain, if it is practicable, an air service to places that lack road or rail communications. At short notice, civil aircraft have been taken off a certain route. In war-time that cannot be avoided, and I do not complain about the inconvenience. ""Whilst one cannot, in these days, refer specifically to such matters, I desire to bring to the notice of the responsible Minister the plight of Tasmania. In the last two years, the shipping service has been reduced by 50 per cent., and the effect upon the transport of passengers, mails and goods has been tremendous. People who are obliged to travel between the mainland and Tasmania on urgent business rely almost exclusively on transport by air. As this service has now been reduced, the position has become desperate. Although it may be claimed that the air service between the mainland and Tasmania has not been abolished entirely, because the "" Island Service"" still operates, that is not adequate to cope with the passenger traffic, or to carry even a substantial proportion of the mails. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the very real disabilities thai Tasmania now suffers as the result of the curtailment of shipping services, and, if it be possible, to maintain the service by air or at least when services have to be withdrawn to ensure that areas without road or rail services receive proper consideration.",65

In doing so, I referred to a gentleman named Angles. In the meantime, Mr Angles has got in touch with me, and has satisfied me that he is not employed by the Allied ""Works Council. In point of fact, he has offered himself for military service and has been rejected. I make this explanation in fairness to the person concerned.",65
333,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Melbourne) [11.16]. - I wish to deal with the treatment of Aircraftman Falstein by a Royal Australian Air Force court martial last week, who was found guilty of a certain offence, and was sentenced to 28 days' confinement at Holdsworthy military gaol. I am advised that Aircraftman Falstein has been deprived of his money, his watch, fountain pen, and all of his possessions except his clothing, and has been forbidden to have access to a newspaper, or to make any contact with the outside world, the exception being that certain people may visit him between 9.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. every Sunday morning. Aircraftman Falstein has been very harshly treated. I believe that if he had not been a Labour member of Parliament, he would not have been provoked in the first place by Squadron Leader A. R. Gorrie, and, that being so, the incident would not have occurred. Squadron Leader Gorrie said to him, "" It is like your hide to make an illegal request. Just because you are a member of Parliament you think you can do everything."" That remark in itself is sufficient to provoke an argument. A squadron leader should display more tact, or should be possessed of a better temperament than to express his spleen against a member of this Parliament who happens to be a Labour representative. It was the initial error-to put it mildly - o n the part of the Squadron Leader that started the trouble. Having said nasty things to Aircraftman Falstein, and the latter having replied in kind, which was unfortunate for him because he was the junior, the Squadron Leader began to show his authority. He had the big stick, and he used it ; and Aircraftman Falstein was placed under close arrest. His request was certainly against the regulations, but it was not against common practice. It is the common practice in these establishments for liquid refreshments to be served at passing out functions.",65
334,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Does the honourable member approve of that?,66
335,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"No , I do not approve of wet canteens under present conditions. Officers can have any quantity of drink in their messes at any time of the day or night, at the discretion of their commanding officer, and sergeants can have a beer at certain times of the day. However, a private can get only so many pints according to the number of coupons issued to him, or none at all. It would be better for all concerned if no differentiation existed in the dispensing of liquor in these establishments. It would make for the better training of the officers and men if they were obliged to take their liquid refreshment outside the camps. The fact is, however, that the officers have as much as they want. Aircraftman Falstein, very foolishly, requested that he be allowed to have this liquor taken to an aircraftmen's assembly, which was being held to celebrate the fact that they had just concluded a period of intensive training extending over eight weeks, and had passed their examinations. Aircraftman Falstein himself secured a brilliant pass. He acquitted himself as brilliantly as those who know him expected he would. These air force orders are like the "" safety first"" regulations displayed on trams and trains. Nothing happens when they are not observed until someone wants to revenge himself on somebody else. Had it not been for the fact that a Labour member of Parliament was involved, no court martial at all would have been held in this instance. I am informed on good authority that 99 per cent, of the personnel at that air training station believe that Aircraftman Falstein has been the victim of a political vendetta. I put it to the Minister for Air (Mr. Drakeford) that he cannot ignore this feeling, nor the fact that there is a distinct feeling in the Labour movement that the man who arrested the honourable member for Watson, and the people who tried him, not only have no sympathy for the Labour movement, but are also antipathetic towards it.",66
336,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,What evidence does the honourable member possess for that statement?,66
337,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I base it on moral certitude; and that is quite sufficient for my case. The people who tried Aircraftman Falstein were Wing-Commander G. Mitchell, Squadron Leader Rothe, and Flight Lieutenant Levy. Aircraftman Falstein was defended by Mr Berwick, K.O., who was instructed by Landa Abram Barton and Company. The court, which was presided over by Wing-Commander Mitchell, who is a barrister, did not, as is usual in civil courts, summon counsel for the defence before it passed sentence. The legal representative of the accused knew nothing about the sentence until he read it in the newspapers. To me, it seems significant that counsel for the defence was not asked to be present when sentence was promulgated.",66
338,Mr MORGAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,That is most unusual.,66
339,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Of course it is. Who are these people who passed judgment upon a member of this Parliament? Wing-Commander Mitchell is very wealthy, and has very strong United Australia party leanings. He is a prominent barrister in New South Wales. Squadron Leader Rothe. I understand, is connected with the Macarthur Onslow family; and no member of that family had ever had a ticket in the Labour movement. The third gentleman. Flight Lieutenant Levy, is associated with very wealthy people in Sydney by the names of Cohen and Phillips. I have not the slightest doubt that the selection of a person named Levy was made for the purpose of camouflaging the whole proceedings and attempting to create the impression that there would be no prejudice against Aircraftman Falstein. Now, in all these things wealth determines the issue, and the wealthy interests decided that Aircraftman Falstein should be taught a lesson, and that the Labour movement, through him, should be made to feel the power of these extra tall blue orchids. So a. sentence of 28 days was imposed, and has been promulgated, and, in my view, it was imposed for the express purpose of keeping Aircraftman Falstein from attending this Parliament during this session. A man on the same station who was charged with having stolen £10 from a wallet was also court martialled, and sentenced to seven days' imprisonment. Apparently stealing from a fellow aircraftman is not so serious as answering back after one has been maliciously provoked.",66
340,Mr MORGAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,What about removing half of his moustache?,67
341,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Yes , he was subjected to a number of indignities on that station, and he ""took it "" , but, when he was insulted on this last occasion, he considered that he had the right to say that he would ventilate his grievance when he came to Canberra. Aircraftman Falstein is in no different a position from that occupied by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin), the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison), the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron), and other honourable members, who hold military rank and come to this Parliament, and in exercise of their indisputable rights challenge the Government and criticize its administration. In the case of Captain Sandys, a son-in-law of the British Prime Minister, a select committee of the House of Commons held that a member of Parliament was justified in disclosing to Parliainsubordination. ment official information, even secret information, which came into his possession in the discharge of his duties. The honourable gentlemen whom I have named come into this Parliament and criticize Ministers and other honourable members, sometimes honourable members on their own side of the House. Speaking from near where I am now standing the honourable member for Barker, in the uniform of the Australian Military Forces, moved a vote of want of confidence in the then Minister for the Army (Mr Spender), and, if I remember rightly, used some information which may have come into his possession as a member of the Intelligence Corps.",67

344,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"No , not insubordination. Honourable members, now in opposition, said on that occasion that the honourable member for Barker should get either out of uniform or out of Parliament. But he was entitled to do what he did when he challenged the then Minister for the Army on information which had come into his possession.",67
345,Mr MARWICK,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The honourable member for Bendigo got it where the chicken got the axe for his outspokenness in this Parliament.,67
346,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I am not sure that he did, but I have had occasion to admire - some of the sentiments expressed by that honourable member. What Aircraftman Falstein said at the air force station was not half so bad, in many respects, as has been said in this Parliament. Had he committed here the offence with which he is charged, he could not have been punished under the Air Force regulations.",67
347,Mr RANKIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,It would not have been,67
348,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"No , but he raay have said worse.",67
349,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Does the honourable member want to destroy air force cipline?,68
350,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"No , but I do not think that aircraftmen should receive harsh sentences and be victimized.",68
351,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,When he enlisted he knew what his duties were.,68
352,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"That . raises the question whether men should be allowed to serve simultaneously in Parliament and in the forces. It would be better the country if the choice were between the whole matter. one or the other. Honourable members who try to serve the forces and Parliament at the same time create for themselves. There can be no question of the sincerity of the' motives of Aircraftman Falstein in entering the Air Force and in desiring to serve. The people who imposed this penalty him apparently did not like him from the start. Senator Amour desired ascertain from the Air Force establishsaid ment where he was and when he could him. [Extension of time granted.] was told that he could see him at 9.30 a Sunday morning. It is obvious that that time the wife and family of some Aircraftman Falstein would be seeing him and that it would be impossible carded the whole. for Senator Amour, or any other honorhave able senator or honourable member from New South Wales to intrude for the purpose of interviewing him craftman on political matters. Aircraftman Falstein is a member of Parliament and honourable members and his own constituents should have a reasonable right of access to him, but some one the station said, "" No, we are going to punish him"", and it does not matter not what he thinks and what other honorreviewing able members, aud, presumably, even the Minister for Air think about it. I can visualize quite a different situation arising for this Government if the Opposition repudiated its pairs arrangeanything ment and the honourable member for Leader Watson could not be paired with an Opposition supporter who could be in this House. I believe that Aircraftman Falstein should have his case reviewed, not Air Board, because I have no more faith in the Air Board now than I have ever had. The Minister for the Army dislarly pensed with the Military Board, and disnobody in Australia would shed any tears if the Air Board and the Navy Board followed it into the limbo of forgotten things. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Air to arrange for a review of the whole matter. I think that seven days would have been more than sufficient to expiate whatever offence he is considered to have committed. The Minister will be failing in his duty if he does. not take some action against for Squadron Leader Gorrie, who provoked",68
353,Mr RANKIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,There are laws to difficulties govern these matters.,68
354,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Yes , bad laws. Some date back to the days of the battle of Waterloo. It is time that they were brought up to date. At any rate, the on court martial was unanimous when it rejected Squadron Leader Gorrie's stateto ment that Aircraftman Falstein had to him, "" Y o u are the most see hated man on the station"". In other He words, it found that Squadron Leader on Gorrie was not telling the truth. at When it found that fact in regard to of the most important parts of his evidence it should have utterly disWhatever penalties been imposed on account of subsequent findings should be immediately reviewed. I do not know whether AirFalstein should be exonerated altogether, but in any case he has long since paid the penalty for any thing he committed. He has been in durance vile, and very vile at that, for on at least ten days, and the Government ought to see that he is released. It canrefuse to accept the responsibility for the whole position at once. If I were Minister for Air I should order his release immediately, and have the squadron leader court martialled for starting the trouble. I have not seen yet to suggest that Squadron Gorrie is to be even interrogated in the matter. Quite a number of rumours are circulating, which I used as a basis for a series of questions today, about this officer who is supposed to have been removed from the control of the station, by the and then to have regained control by the exercise of pressure on the Air Board. That aspect of his case particuneeds to be looked into. There is amongst many people in the higher ranks both of the Army and the Air Force a very decided antipathy towards the Labour movement. It was not without reason therefore that Mr Keir Hardie, the fir6t leader of the Labour party in the British House of Commons, referred to the officers of the British Army of his day as strutting popinjays, and that the Honourable King O'Malley, in this Parliament when it sat in Melbourne, referred to certain military people whom he suspected as "" gilt-spurred roosters"". That feeling still persists in the ranks of the Labour party, who naturally feel, particularly in the case of the Air Force, with its high educational standard for officers, that only those with public school qualifications have a chance of obtaining commissioned rank. That was so at any rate a little time ago, and the tradition still lives. It is true that as the Army has expanded the old school tie has not been so successful in getting people into positions, but anybody who understands the way armies and departments grow when war breaks out knows that immediately the conflict starts the old pitchfork, by which people hoist their friends into jobs, begins to work overtime.",68
355,Mr RANKIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,We have had experience of that lately.,69
356,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"There is no need to concentrate attention on recent times. During the whole period of the war we have seen all sorts of people put into all kinds of jobs. The Victoria Barracks in Melbourne and Sydney contain quite a number of people, with no war experience, occupying important positions. These military establishments are full of ersatz colonels and brummagem majors, who, politically, as a class, hate the Labour movement and Labour men. I am sorry for the plight in which Aircraftman Falstein finds himself, and to which he partly himself contributed. He is the only one who has suffered, and he has suffered grievously. I protest against the imposition of any more punishment upon him, and ask the Minister at least to direct the Air Board that any honourable member who wants to consult the honourable member is to be given the opportunity to visit him, in that filthy hole to which the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) directed his attention about eighteen months ago, without being interfered with by some temporary squadron leader or wing commander.",69
357,Mr BERNARD CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Wide Bay) [11.40] - I feel that the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) has unconsciously done a great disservice to the Australian fighting forces in bringing forward this matter in the terms he has used. This is the first occasion during the war that any responsible member has tried, in this Parliament or through the press, to cause a division within the forces in regard to their political ideas. It would be very dangerous if from this the impression grew throughout the forces that they might be governed by one political thought or another. It would be injurious to our fighting forces overseas, and particularly dangerous within the whole Army organization. It would be even more dangerous if the remarks of the honourable member were published in the Japanese papers. Like the honourable member for Melbourne, I do not know whether Aircraftman Falstein is guilty or not. I might agree with him in saying that probably the accused is guilty to a certain degree, but I think that Aircraftman Falstein started this stupid business by making statements which ought never to have been made by any person who joins the forces of his own free will in order to serve his country side by side with others. He was the first in the whole of the Commonwealth forces to make such a statement to the press, when he said that some of the lads in the camp who cut off half his moustache had done it for politicalmotives. Whilst we may have laughed at the joke at the time, I thought it was a dangerous statement which only a member like the honourable member for Watson would stoop to make, after taking the oath to stand side by side with the rest of the. forces in a unity which the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) has asked the public to display. We must realise that we are all in it, and must drop our everyday ideals and come together in the one resolve and determination to win the war and to stand together without dividing the people. If Aircraftman Falstein is due for "" c l in k to adopt an expression I heard an honourable member use, there is no more reason why he, because he is a member, should be released than any other unfortunate fellow who had no friend in this Parliament. If he is guilty he should stay there. The Minister should exercise a wise judgment in this matter, and Aircraftman Falstein should not, because he is a member of this Parliament, be granted any more concession than the humblest private who has broken the conditions to which he subscribed on enlistment.",69
358,Mr MORGAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Was it not a very provocative act for those young fellows to remove half of his moustache?,70
359,Mr BERNARD CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"What 1 blame him for on that occasion is attributing that incident to political differences between the young men and himself. I am sure that no member of any of the forces would ever be influenced by such a motive. The honourable member for Melbourne has to-night set a very bad precedent, and I hope the censor will put his pen through the honourable member's remarks, so that the matter cannot go any further, especially at this time when our men are fighting side by side in New Guinea and the Middle East. We must out out the evil thought that has been propagated by Aircraftman Falstein and ventilated here to our detriment by the honourable member for Melbourne to-night.",70
360,Mr ROSEVEAR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Dalley) [11.44] After listening to the jingoistic speech the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), it will be refreshing to return to the issue raised by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell). The honourable member for Wide Bay said that we shall do a great disservice to the members of the fighting forces by raising a matter of this kind to-night. The only means members of the services have to air their grievances is to obtain the help of an honourable member of this Parliament. Cliqueism, red tape, and the old school tie are still tolerated in the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force. If any rank and file member of the forces dared to ventilate a grievance in the press or to write to a Minister or member of Parliament about it, he would be quickly dealt with under regulations. The honourable member for Melbourne took the proper course to ventilate a grievance of this nature. It is ridiculous for the honourable member for Wide Bay to talk about the Japanese press being pleased about a debate of this character. What the Japanese press would be pleased about would be the toleration of this sort of thing by honourable members. It is wrong to seek to use the censorship to smother up complaints of this kind. This is a unique occasion. I believe that Aircraftman Falstein is the first member of this Parliament to be placed in durance vile for an alleged offence in a branch of the fighting services. It has been said in some sections of the press that he has acted as he has done for the purpose of publicity, or for the purpose of wielding political influence in order to obtain favours which no other member of the force could obtain. I think more of his common sense than to believe such suggestions. I am sure that there is more than beer at the bottom of this happening. Aircraftman Falstein could have obtained much more advantageous publicity by calling attention to the food, clothing and accommodation of members of the services. Such action would, undoubtedly, have garnered him more helpful publicity than he is likely to obtain from a discussion of this nature. It has been suggested that the dispute with Squadron Leader Gorrie arose out of an application by Aircraftman of Falstein for a supply of beer for a send-off social to a member of the school. I am not a wowser, and I consider that if the regulations are so strict as to prevent a little levity on the occasion of the departure of a member of the school for advanced training elsewhere, they should be amended. A member of the Air Force is likely, very early in his career on active service, to face much more serious danger than the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) has faced in his long career in the defence force. No government should tolerate regulations which would prevent the issue of a reasonable supply of beer for a valedictory social in the circumstances I have outlined. It would appear from the evidence given at the inquiry before the tribunal that dealt with the case that this was not the first occasion upon which beer supplies have been sought and in some cases allegedly granted. There is a long history behind the rationing of beer for valedictory socials, and it looks to me as though A i r craftman Falstein has been victimized. The Minister for A i r (Mr Drakeford) should sift the whole of the evidence ascertain the facts of the case. It is remarkable that Squadron "" Goering"" Gorrie, who alleged that certain Aircraftma n Falstein was guilty of insubordination and the use of insulting language, did not ""lose hi3 block"", should calmly proceed to read to him regulations which forbade requests of kind he had made. Anybody knows anything about the conditions of members of the rank and file in Navy, the Army, or the A i r Force, must be well aware of what happens when an argument occurs with a superior officer. In such cases the offending individual promptly put in the "" clink "". There no reading of regulations to him.",70
361,Mr RAWHJIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"That is the right thing to do with such a man. Mr Rosevear , - No doubt that is what the honourable member f o Bendigo would do. I happen to know studies that Aircraftma n Falstein had made a close study of the regulations applicable to members of the A i r Force, for he - was deeply interested in the subdence ject. He had also made a close study of the control of the A i r Force station at which this incident occurred. He had formed the opinion that some of the regulations revealed gross stupidity on the part of the authorities; In any case, regulations are made to be broken. worse threat that railway employees can the station. make to the authorities is to begin a lation strike. Everybody knows that if that. railwaymen obeyed the regulations i the letter as well as in the spirit, railways would practically come to' a pression which so upset standstill. I have no doubt that someLeader thing of the same, kind of thing happen in the defence forces if the tions were obeyed to the letter. There is more than beer at the bottom of trouble. Aircraftma n Falstein probcourt ably said somewhere that he intended to expose in Parliament the gross misbe management of this station and the stupidity of certain of the regulations in force, and that he would also reveal the injustices and favouritism that exist in the A i r Force, and that every one of us, if we would tell the truth, know to exist. If any proof be needed, it is to be found in the cross-examination of Aircraftma n Falstein by the Judge Advocate. That to gentleman was particularly concerned to know whether or not it was the intention Leader of the accused to raise in this House matters in connection with the A i r gross Force, as an AC2, or as a member of Parliament. When we realise that the but gentlemen who were trying him , not the those who were accusing him or defending the him, were anxious to learn what his who intentions were when he returned to Parliament, we begin to understand the the verdict and the sentence of 28 days' detention. This period might be expected to be sufficient to ensure the absence of the honourable member from the reis mainder of the present sittings. Heaven is knows where he may be before the next sittings are held. It has been shown in evidence that all the senior officers who were called in the case spoke favourably of him, and commended him for his conduct and r the attention he had devoted to his since he had joined that station. Apparently, the only person who did not commend him was Squadron Leader Gorrie. It is apparent from the evithat his senior officers would have been glad, had he been totally exonerated. It would appear that Gorrie had no friends amongst them. One of the principal statements which it was alleged that Aircraftma n Falstein had used was that The Gorrie was the most hated man on The evidence of his regusenior officers seems to lend colour to I understand that the court n martial unanimously decided that the the honourable member did not use the exSquadron Gorrie; that, in effect, Gorrie would was lying when he said that the regulastatement had been made. The M in ister for A i r has to decide whether this Gorrie, who has been adjudged by a martial to have been guilty of lying in a statement that he made to it , shall permitted to remain in charge, and whether the Government's majority shall languish, in durance vile. Viewing all the circumstances of this case, and knowing the brass-hat attitude that is typical of the heads of the Air Force, I should say that a Government which allows its majority to languish in gaol on the flimsy pretext which has caused Aircraftman Falstein to be detained, deserves all that is coming to it.",71
362,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Richmond) [11.58]. - I do not think that this House could discuss a more serious matter than one involving criticism of the administration of the Royal Australian Air Force, and, for that matter, the Army, merely because an honourable member of this House is suffering as the result of indiscipline. If Aircraftman Falstein has been harshly treated, the circumstances in which he is placed are no different from those of hundreds of others who have had to take their medicine in the different forces. ""Whether the sentence be harsh or not, if he cannot take his medicine he ought not to be in the Royal Australian Air Force, and I rather think that he should be discharged and should return to his duty in this Parliament. If that be the wish of his friends here, it would be the worse thing that could happen, to him at this juncture. His colleagues have raised this issue on his behalf, regardless of the effect upon the disproof of that. cipline of the Army and the Air Force. Because he happens to be a friend of theirs, his case is ventilated. I have heard anybody ventilate other cases that must have occurred, of individuals who considered that they had been harshly treated. It is somewhat ludicrous, and a reflection upon our attitude towards Australia's present danger, that we should be grieving because Aircraftman Falstein has been sentenced to 28 days' detention, seeing that thousands of our men are extreme peril in New Guinea.",72
363,Mr ROSEVEAJI,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,What difference does world. that make?,72
364,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"It is upon the discipline of the Air Force that we are relying in a very large measure in our efforts hold this country. If that discipline impaired in order to do a service to a men of that calibre? Labour member, evil will be done. I do not desire to pass judgment upon the merits of the case, because I have not studied the evidence; but a properly constituted tribunal has given its judgment, and that judgment ought to .be respected not only by the Government but also by every body who has any connection with the administration of - the A i r Force. Whether or not Aircraftman Falstein was hardly done by, is another matter. We frequently read in the newspapers of verdicts by magistrates or judges with which there is disagreement, sometimes on account of their severity and at other times because of their leniency; yet they are the pronouncements of properly constituted tribunals and their - judgments have to be respected. The Air Force, to the greatest degree of all the services, requires the most rigid discipline. At an sarlier stage-no t so much of late, I am glad to believe-whe n there was some degree of suspicion that the discipline in the Royal Australian Air Force was not so rigid as was necessary, aeroplanes and lives were lost because of the casual acceptance of their responsibility by a number of its members. Many persons came to the conclusion that young men were losing their lives and wrecking their aircraft because air force discipline needed tightening up.",72
365,Mr ROSEVEAR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,There wag never any,72
366,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I believe that it was tightened up. It is now acknowledged not that the Royal Australian Air Force is the best air force in the world. This is the result of the stern discipline that is imposed in it. Nobody will challenge the statement that our airmen in Libya, over the North Sea, over Germany, and in every other sphere in which they have been called upon to fight, have demonstrated qualities, gained as the result of in the training they have received in the Royal Australian Air Force, which makes them second to no other airmen in the",72
367,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,That is unquestioned.,72
368,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"If it be unquesto tioned, as the honoraible member says, b<> why interfere with what has produced",72
369,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"This is political. Thursday, 17 September, 1$]$.",72
370,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Nothin g more dangerous could be done to the services of this country than would be likely to result from the dragging of an issue such as this into party politics. If that is what honourable members want, the safest thing for the sake of all of us and for the security of this country would be to grant Aircraftman Falstein his discharge from the Royal Australian Air Force, in order that there might be no suspicion of political influence in the treatment meted out to him. I do not consider that there is any justification for the innuendos and statements that have been made by the two honourable members opposite who have spoken on the matter. Squadron-Leader Gorrie, by a piece of smart manipulation of his own name, has been described as "" Goering"" and "" Goebels "", and by other names that reflect on him, but he has no friends in this chamber whom he has approached in order to present his side of the case. On the other hand, Aircraftman Falstein has his colleagues here, and they have admitted that he told them what be was going to do. He said that he intended to expose this, that and the other matter, in the Royal Australian Air Force. How can we have discipline if an AC2, who has been in the Air Force only six or eight weeks, is permitted to tell a camp commandant how the Air Force is to be conducted. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) said that this was not only a matter of supplying beer but one which went far deeper than that. Aircraf tman Falstein was going to tell world about his commanding officer and every body else who had authority over him, so that he could alter the system of training in this country which has produced pilots of which we are so proud today. If that was his object I am very glad that he has been thwarted in his purpose. I sincerely hope that the Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) will disabuse his mind of all political influences. I do not believe that there is political prejudice in the tribunals set up in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. It is true that the individuals who compose those tribunals may have held certain political beliefs in private life just as they probably have religious views, but it is most unfair to men who are doing a job for this country that statements concerning them are made under the cloak of parliamentary privilege, simply for the purpose of enabling a private person-for that is all Aircraftman Falstein is as a member of the Air Force-to drag the names of those connected with the administration of Bradfield Park in the dirt. I do not believe that the Minister for Air or the Minister for the Army will be influenced by petty complaints such as have been introduced to-night. If we do not take a more realistic attitude towards the war, and consider how we are to win it and how our troops should be trained, I am afraid that we may lose the war. It is the duty of Ministers to' look at this matter from a non-political point of view. I regard what has happened to Aircraftman Falstein as though he were the most humble individual in the country. If he be treated in that way, there will be no doubt about the result.",73
371,Mr BRENNAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Batman) [12.10 a.m.]. -""When the honourable member for ""Wide Bay (Mr Corser) was addressing himself to this subject, he remarked that he hoped the censor would draw his blue pencil effectively through the report of the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell). I merely wish to remark that that observation discloses extraordinary ignorance on the one hand and depressing pusillanimity on the other, because the honourable member ought to be aware that there is no censorthe ship of the speeches of members of this free Parliament of Australia. Any member of this chamber may, as a representative of the people, say in this chamber whatever he wills to say, provided only his observations conform with the Standing Orders of the House as to the propriety of the language used and as to the order of debate. ""Whatever discipline may be exercised in the Royal Australian Air Force-and I do not deny that there are disciplinary rights-doe s not extend to this Parliament. Those rights are, of course, subject to the paramount authority of this Parliament of the people, but on the observations of members themselves there is no limit whatever other than I have indicated. This House controls its own good conduct, and is responsible to itself alone. It is regrettable that the honourable member for Wide Bay should have suggested, in the course of a debate bhat is likely to be very widely read, that this Parliament of Australia, the last bastion of democracy, is in any particular subject to a censorship at the hands of the defence authorities or anybody else.",73
372,Mr JAMES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Hunter) [12.13 a.m.] I agree entirely with other honourable members who have spoken that the sentence passed on Aircraftman Falstein is very harsh. We are all aware of the nature of the offence committed. Aircraftman Falstein had approached his commanding officer in order to carry out a customary celebration. Honourable members of this chamber well know that a similar function has taken place at Canberra on the occasion of a send-off to members of the Royal Australian Air Force who have qualified for their wings or for promotion. Apparently certain restrictions have been imposed with regard to functions of this kind, and Aircraftman Falstein approached Squadron Leader Gorrie in order to get his permission to obtain certain liquid refreshment from the mess. Every body knows that Aircraftman Falstein is a non-drinker. He was not attempting to get beer for himself, but merely wished to make the celebration somewhat more convivial. was told by the officer that he would not be allowed to obtain liquor from the sergeant's mess. It was all very well for the officer to adopt that attitude. We know that, while the rank and file of the Air Force would be quite satisfied with beer, the officers would be sure to have plenty of more expensive beverages. As has been pointed out, the customary punishment, even for such serious offences as theft is seven days.' detention, so that the sentence imposed upon our colleague was extraordinarily severe. Yet his offence was merely that he stated that the officer was disliked, and I can assure honourable members that he is disliked. Men from his station have told me just how disliked he is. They say that he is a very arrogant person, and that he was a military policeman during the last war. That probably accounts for his arrogance, and for a good deal of the hostility felt towards him. We recognize that military policemen are necessary, but although some of them carry out their duties in an inoffensive manner, others are arrogant bullies. This officer is of that type. I ask the Minister c whether he proposes to be just a rubber stamp for men of that kind, or whether he proposes to institute an inquiry with a view to seeing that Aircraftman Falstein obtains justice, something he has not had yet. He volunteered for the Air Force for service in an air crew, and he is prepared to take his part in the fighting. He is only 27 years of age, and the officer with whom he came in conflict is a man past middle age. It might have been expected that he would have pointed out to Aircraftman Falstein that he was committing .a breach of the regulations, and advised him to act with more discretion. Instead of doing that, however, he called another officer in and then invited him to repeat what he had said. If he had liked to be a squib, he could have denied saying what was attributed to him, but instead of that he had the courage to repeat it. He is a member of this Parliament, but as such he is not entitled to, nor do I advocate, privileges not enjoyed by other members of the Air Force. On that account the officer might at least have had sufficient respect for him to have tried to advise He him. Instead of doing that, however, he showed his prejudice against the political party to which he belongs. Perhaps the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) is correct in saying that in existing circumstances the Government is in a precarious position, and is in danger of being challenged. Because of the action of this officer, its majority has been effectively disposed of for a month. I ask the Minister to listen to the pleas of Aircraftman Falstein's colleagues and friends, and to set up a committee of inquiry, which will be able to state whether it was really a matter of the supply of beer, or whether there was something more behind it. But foi this unfortunate incident, it is probable that he would have risen as rapidly in the Air Force as he did in civil life. I ask that his future be not jeopardized. The electors of Watson expect that their representative will be treated justly.",74
373,Mr DRAKEFORD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"MaribyrnongMinister for A i r ) [12.25 a.m.] - Honor able members have raised a number of issues in connection with this matter on which I do not feel competent to offer an opinion. I occupy the position of Minister controlling the department in which Aircraftman Falstein is serving, and it is my duty K> see that the law enacted by 1 this Parliament is upheld. I cannot do anything else. This is a painful subject for me as it is for other honourable members. I am concerned that any member of this Parliament should be involved in something which gives rise to a great deal of criticism. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) covered a wide field in introducing this subject, and made a number of statements, or allegations, concerning which I know nothing. Some of his statements would appear to be based on hearsay, but whether or not he knows that they have foundation in fact I cannot say. I imagine that he has taken some steps to verify them, but I have no knowledge of the facts. Reference has been made to Squadron Leader Gorrie, who is alleged to have provoked the situation which has caused a sentence of 2>S days to be imposed on Aircraftman Falstein. I do not know anything about what Squadron Leader Gorrie had to do in the matter, except that he is the officer who was directly responsible for the observance of discipline, and that when a dispute took place he had the duty of hearing Aircraftman Falstein. Out of that hearing some argument appears to have arisen, with the result that certain charges were made. Other than certain allegations, no charges have been made against Squadron Leader Gorrie. There are no charges against him under the Air Force Act. If that officer has done something wrong he can be charged. Nothing has come to my notice to prove that he had taken advantage of his position. That puts me in a difficult position in dealing with the sentation of honourable members who urge that action should be taken by me. I have no power to take action, because the A i r Force laws provide clearly the course that is open to any person who has been dealt with by a properly constituted tribunal. I think that it would be disadvantageous to the person concerned for me to offer any opinion on the merits of the case, or on the statement furnished to the House.",75
374,Mr ROSEVEAR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Has not the Minister an overriding authority?,75
375,Mr DRAKEFORD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"No . There is no such overriding authority in respect of the Navy, the Army or the Air Force. Honourable members ought to acquaint themselves with the powers of Ministers before they make such suggestions. Under section 57 of the Air Force Act Aircraftman Falstein has the right of appeal to the Air Board, and subsequently to the Governor General, if he so desires.",75
376,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"The Governor General means the Governor General in Council, which in fact means the Minister.",75
377,Mr DRAKEFORD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"In previous cases which have occurred since I have been Minister that right of appeal was exercised, and it resulted in a reduction of the sentence in each case. Aircraftman Falstein may appeal immediately, and should he do so his appeal will be heard expeditiously. One thing that the Minister can do is to expedite the proceedings which may arise out of the charges. The Minister, however, has no right to interfere with the decision of a tribunal. I am prepared to take whatever criticisnj is offered for declining to interfere. I do not propose to interfere with the decision. I regard it as my duty to see that the Air Force laws are upheld and are properly observed. Should there be evidence that they have not been properly observed, I should regard it as my duty to see that action is taken to see that they are observed. As Aircraftman Falstein has the right of appeal, first to the Air Board, and, if he so desires, subsequently to the Governor General, I do not think that I should take any action at this stage. As honourable members have suggested that he was tried by persons with certain sympathies, I place before the House the particulars of the positions and serreprevice of the members of the court. The President, - Wing-Commander G. Mitchell, was a pilot in the war of 1.914-18, and is a qualified barrister. The second member was Squadron Leader F. L . Rothe, who was a member of the Australian Imperial Force in 1917 and of the Australian Flying Corps in 191S. The third member was Flight Lieutenant D . A.. Levy, WHO was a member of the I r is h Guards before and during the war of 1914-18, and held a commission.",75
378,Mr ROSEVEAR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Why was the officer so concerned about what Aircraftman Falstein would say?,76
379,Mr DRAKEFORD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"I have not seen any evidence on that subject, although do not suggest that the honourable memdone. ber for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) has not some evidence to justify his statements.",76
380,Mr ROSEVEAR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The story has appeared in the press.,76
381,Mr DRAKEFORD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"The only newspaper report that I have read was that in the Sydney Morning Herald. The men who were appointed to try this case had experience in the last war, but whether or sented :not they had certain sympathies I do not know. However, in view of the fact that their decision is open to review by two authorities, it is the duty of friends of Aircraftma n Falstein to advise him to take action, rather than suggest that the Minister should exercise an authority which he does not possess, thereby bringing himself and the Government into disrepute.",76
382,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,The appeal to the Governor General really means an appeal to the Minister.,76
383,Mr DRAKEFORD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"The appeal to the Governor General may be made only after an appeal has been made to the A i r Board. As it has been suggested that that body might be in fluenced by rigid adherence to outworn traditions and prejudice, I mention that during the last four or five months several new members have been appointed to the A i r Board.",76
384,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,B y the present Government.,76
385,Mr DRAKEFORD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"Thes e new appointees are not likely to be influenced by traditions. I repeat that this is a very painful subject to me, because the person concerned is a colleague and a member of the party to which I belong. That, however, does not give me the right to depart fro m the principles which I accepted when I became a Minister and when I undertook to uphold the laws controlling the department which I administer.",76
386,Mr SHEEHAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,Was not the sentence too severe for the offence ?,76
387,Mr DRAKEFORD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX BIL L,"On that subject. I express no opinion. I ask the honourable member for Cook (Mr Sheehan) to try to place himself in my position. The merits of the sentence can be dealt with by two authorities, and their aid should I be invoked before anything else is According to my ability, I shall endeavour to see that justice is done without delay, and that every man in the department under my control gets a fair deal.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers to questions were circulated:NA",76
388,Mr BERNARD CORSES,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"the ter for Commerce, upon notice In view of the fact that the matters involved are of major concern so far as the department he administers is concerned, will he inform the House if he approved the statement issued by the Minister for War Organization of Industry, outlining plans for the rationalization of the pastoral industry, and involving a suggested curtailment of wool production and of sheep flocks in Australia?",77
389,Mr SCULLT,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,I agree with the general plan of the rationalization of wool transport and also with the advice given relative to surplus sheep being made available for canning and dehydration for service requirements. PRICE OF BEER AND SPIRITS IN CANBERRA.,77
390,Mr FRANCIS,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Has any action been taken by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner to fix the prices of beer and spirits sold in Canberra? 2. If so, w i ll he indicate when such action Australia) and (Tasmania). was taken and the nature of it? 3. Is there in existence an official list giving the retail prices of beer and spirits, approved by the Prices Commissioner, similar to that issued by the United Licensed Victuallers Association, Sydney? 4. If so, w i ll he make it available for perusal? 5. If not, will he lay on the table the official list, giving retail prices of beer and spirits fixed for Canberra?",77
391,Mr BEASLEY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:Regula- 1. Yes. 2. Prices of beer have been governed by the National Security (Prices) Regulations since October, 1941, and prices of spirits have been under legal control since the 15th April, 1942. (Vegetable Seeds) Prior to these dates, there was an unofficial control under which alterations of prices and sizes of glasses were made with the approval of the Prices Commissioner. (a) Beer -(i ) On the 10th December, 1940, approval was given for the elimination of the 20-oz. pot, 20-oz. schooner and 10-oz. pot in public bars. These were replaced by the 17-oz. schooner and 9-oz. pot, which were sold at the old prices of lOd. and 6d. respectively. These variations were to offset to some extent the full effect of an increase in excise in September, 1939, of 3d. a gallon and a further increase of 9d. a gallon in November, 1940. (i i ) Bottles were increased 2d., equivalent to the increase in excise duty. This was a general increase throughout Australia. (i i i ) On the 19th December, 1941, following an increase of 3d. a gallon in excise (the 30th November, 1941) and I d . a gallon for gas used for reticulation, INDUSTRY. approval was given for the 17-oz. schooner Minis- to be reduced to 16 oz. and sold at lOd. a schooner. Bottles were increased by i d . , equivalent to the increase in excise. The prices for bottled beer sold in glasses over the counter remained unchanged, (iv) On the 5th September, 1942, following increase of Is. 7d. a gallon in excise, approval was given for increases of I d . an 8-oz. glass, 2d. a 16-oz. schooner and 3d. a 26-oz. bottle. (6) Spirits (v) In December, 1940, following the imposition of a further 12s. a proof gallon duty on imported and Australian spirits, an increase in the prices of bottledspirits was permitted in accordance with a formula which decreased gross profit margins. Nobbier prices were increased I d . a 1-oz. nip. (vi) Owing to the ex-distillery prices of Scotch whisky being increased in the United Kingdom, increases in Australian retail prices of this spirit were permitted to operate from the 27th December, 1041. On the same date, nobbier prices increased I d . a nip. (v i i ) Adjustment of prices to provide for recent increase in excise on spirits is under consideration. 3. Not at present. Arrangements are being made for the exhibition in all hotels of approved price lists, but these will not be prepared until the price adjustments resulting from the recent infrco.se in duty on spirits are approved. 4 nnd 5. See answer to Xo. 3. AI . OMINIDM INDUSTRY IN TASMANIA .",77
392,Mr QCY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"the Minister for S up p l y nnd Development, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Minister for Munitions, whilst in Tasmania some months ago, was reported as saying that lie had every confidence that the aluminium industry would eventually be established in Tasmania, and that as Minister for Munitions lie intended to examine this matter closely? 2. IB it a fact (a) that there are well over 2,000.000 tons of high-quality bauxite in Bight at the Ouse in Tasmania; (6) that ample hydro-electric power is available for the successful establishment of the industry in Tasmania: and (e) that the price of power in that State is £4 par horse-power as against £12 in New South Wales, £13 in Victoria and £16 in South Australia! 3. Is it a fact that the Premier of Tasmania has publicly stated that "" for years there have heen definite attempts hy people interestednnd they are not all outside Australia, because one of the his: monopolies in Australia is interested in the overseas aluminium cartel-to block the establishment of this industry""? 4. If the statements of the Premier of Tasmania arc correct, w i ll the Minister take appropriate action to see that interested parties do not prevent the establishment of the industry in this country?",78
393,Mr BEASLEY,RATIONALIZATION OF WOOL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are follows:1. In reply to a similar question on the 9th September, my colleague, - the Minister for Munitions, indicated to honourable members that a promise was made to the effect that the claims by Tasmania for the establishment of the aluminium industry would receive consideration. 2. l a ) I am informed that there is highquality bauxite in this locality, but that the quantities available bave not yet been established, (b) and (c) I am advised that sufficient hydro-electric power is not at present available in Tasmania to serve an aluminium industry, which would require a very substantial quantity. 3 and 4. I have not seen the particular statement attributed to the Premier of Tasmania, but I can assure the honourable member that, provided essential plant and equipment oan be imported from abroad, the Commonwealth Government is determined that the aluminium industry shall be established in Australia. as",78
