That was never intended by the has become, especially over the last decade almost as much influence as the House of Representatives from being a check-and-balance house, a house for example, by not accepting bills if they are to accept certain budget bills. Previous speakers blocked supply on a few occasions; I accept seeking a mandate and then tries to implement budget bills are an integral part of that, so am not talking about amending it here and there.

It was very imwe have had to deal with bushfires for a back in 1968.

It is my own electorate of Cunningham we need to terms and financially. But in areas such as put in place. Obviously that happened very weeks of my being on the committee. I, like Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, went out to various tion beyond my own electorate. I went to places ern Victoria and western New South Wales, areas where there were no management structures ways of dealing with fires. Maybe there is a the resources there to back up and assist those that they could identify areas which needed hazard reduction and areas which needed to management plan. We found that there were a hazard throughout Australia. I was most of all impressed with Tasmania coordinated way of dealing with bushfire hazards. the front page of a Tasmanian paper which was due. That front page basically told people to stark contrast to the recent news we have had there are mandatory evacuations and we have Tasmania we were taken into the bush and we trees and bush, that had survived the fire. The put in good plans and the volunteers and local bushfire hazard on a regular, almost daily, ties. They had in place water and knew the by the volunteers, the state government authorities needed. In those instances they were able to hazard reduction or not. That was a great example of the fact that stopped.

There were not necessarily volunteers or to give them clear direction so to be conserved, areas which could be subject to be part of a more detailed hazard reduction zone lot of different ways of managing the bushfire and the way in which Tasmania has a very wellWhat was most telling was what I saw on issued the day before a massive fire event was stay at home and prepare for the fire.
