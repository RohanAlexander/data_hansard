2,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Obviously , this is a question of which notice should be given; but I would remind the honourable member that the Prime Minister of Great Britain is said to' doubt the accuracy of the report, which purports to be a statement of French intentions, and one can only hope that he is right. It would be a calamity if, at the present moment, any one'nation took upon itself the responsibility of interfering in the tangled affairs of Europe. This is not a time for playing a lone hand there, and many of the troubles occurring today illustrate the danger of divided councils within as well as without the State. Later:",19

If further complaints are made, I hope that the honourable member will forward them. Our Fleet should not be a nuisance in any harbour; indeed, those in control of it should set an example to private ship-owners. That is the view of the Naval Board and the Commodore as well.

Bill received from the Senate, and (on motion by Mr MASSYGREENE) read a first time. INDUSTRIA L PEACE BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 12th August, vide page 3513) : Clause 15A Special Tribunal shall have cognisance(a) of any industrial dispute referred to it by the persons or associations parties thereto; and '(6) of any industrial dispute as to which a conference has been held under section 19 of this Act and as to which agreement has not been reached as to the whole of the dispute, and which has been referred to the Special Tribunal in accordance with section 21 of this Act: Provided that no dispute as to which a plaint is pending in the Court and the hearing has commenced shall be referred to a Special Tribunal. Amendment (by Mr HUGHES) agreed toThat after "" industrial dispute,"" in line 2, the following - words be inserted:-""betwee n an organization, of employees on the one hand, and employers or organizations of employers on the other hand."" Members- Clause further consequentially amended by the omission of "" associations "" and the insertion of "" organizations"" in lieu thereof.",21
25,Mr MAXWE LL,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,Fawkner)' [11.26]. yesterday that the intention of the Bill was not to deprive any organization of right to approach the Arbitratio n Court if it so desired.,21
26,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,Certainly .,21
27,Mr MAXWELL,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"P a r a g r a p h b refers to a compulsory conference under clause 19. If a Minister desires to interfere in a dispute he can proceed by calling a compulsory conference before an organization has had time to take any steps in regard to the matter. If that conference fails to agree in regard to the whole dispute, the Minister has power to refer the matter immediately to a Special Tribunal which may make an award. The Minister may thus oust the Arbitration Court. The only exception to that procedure is when a plaint is pending in the Arbitration Court, and proceedings have actually commenced. If it is not the intention of the Prime Minister to deprive any organization of the right to approach the Arbitration Court, the provision for a - compulsory conference should be struck out of the Bill. The organizations would then have the right to go to the Arbitration Court or to have their dispute dealt with by a Special Tribunal. - Mr HUGHES (Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.28] - I thought this provision for a compulsory conference would be regarded as one of the most valuable parts of the Bill. It is admitted that the Arbitration Court has done much good work by exercising its power to compel the parties to meet. I said last night, in reply to the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), that the most valuable part of this measure is the fact that it brings the parties together at a conference table. graph b of this clause is to enable a tribunal to deal with a dispute, which has been referred to a compulsory conference without a settlement having been reached, thus giving the tribunal the same jurisdiction as the Court has in relation to such disputes. If that provision is taken away this Bill will at once assume a menacing rather than a conciliatory form. It will say, in effect,"""" There shall be no attempt at conciliation; we shall at once bring you before the bar of justi.ce and make you do a certain thing."" honourable member has suggested that this provision takes away the right of the union to go to the Arbitration Court, but I hope he will not think that such is the intention. This measure will not touch any union that wishes to approach the Court; it will only be used where unions will not go to that Tribunal. It will have nothing to do with those who will go to it. We must have some remedy where unions will not go to the Court, and the first remedy to which we propose to have recourse is that of conciliation through a compulsory conference. Power is given to bring the parties together and leave them to endeavour to reconcile their differences. I hope that the honourable member will not take objection to the powers given to a Special Tribunal under paragraph b.",21
28,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Batman) [11.31] - I quite realise with the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) the very far-reaching effects of paragraph b, because, although paragraph a limits the jurisdiction of a Special Tribunal to cases brought before it by the parties, paragraph b when read together with clause 19, which gives the power to a Special Tribunal to convene a compulsory conference, will open the whole field of an industrial dispute to consideration by such a Tribunal. However, I rise to call particular'attention to the proviso at the end of clause 15, which reads as follows :Provided that no dispute as to which a plaint is pending in the Court and the hearing has commenced shall be referred to a Special Tribunal. This practically limits the prohibition, as one may call it, against interference by a Special Tribunal to a comparatively small number of industrial disputes Para- out of the total number which are under consideration by the Arbitration Court. Not all disputes come before that Court by means of plaints. In practice we find that a great majority of them do not 'originate in that way, but come to the Court following upon compulsory conferences. ' Furthermore, the Conciliation and Arbitration. Act stipulates quite, a number of ways in which disputes may come before the Court other than hy the method of plaint, the various ways being set out in section 19 of the The Act, which reads as follows: The Court shall have cognisance, for purposes of prevention and settlement, of the following industrial disputes: (a) All industrial disputes which are certified to the Court by the Eegistrar as proper to be dealt with by it in the public interest. (&) All industrial disputes which are submitted to the Court by an organization, or by an association registered for the time being as an organization', by plaint. (c) All industrial disputes with which any State industrial authority, or the Governor in Council of a State in which there is no* State industrial authority, requests the Court to deal; and (d) All industrial' disputes as to which the President has held a conference under section 16A of this Act, and as to which no agreement has been reached, and which the President has thereupon referred to the Court. The only matter referred to in the proviso to clause 15 in the Bill are those which come under paragraph b of this section of the Act, and in actual practice the most general method by which disputes may be brought before the Arbitration Court are those referred to in paragraph d of the section. Any number of disputes may be pending before the Court, and the Bill will give a Special Tribunal the power to ""butt in "" upon the consideration of them if only the limitation contained in the proviso to clause 15 is retained. Apparently the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) desires that the powers of Special Tribunals shall be exercised collaterally and on parallel lines with the work of the Arbitration Court, and from the fact that this proviso has - been inserted in clause 15, I should suppose that he does not intend that a case actually in course of being dealt with by that Court shall be interfered with by any Special Tribunal against the will of the Court it may be, and even, apparently, against the wish of the parties.",22
29,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"What the member says is very true. This is the use to which the clause may be put, but the intent of the Bill is to deal with those cases the Court cannot or does not deal with. Mr BRENNAN"" - Then I cannot see why the proviso should exclude the Special Tribunal from dealing with only a limited number of cases which are before the Court.",23
30,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"We tell the parties to go to the Court, pointing out that it is the place where they must get their remedy, but some unions will not do so. On the other hand, a de facto dispute arises with which we have to deal, and subject to clause 17, we tell the parties that we cannot hear them if their case has been taken to the Court because they have ""elected to go to the Court.",23
31,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"I quite agree with what the right honourable gentleman has said, but it does not cure the difficulty I have raised; on the other hand, it rather bears out what I have been saying. Where a case has been brought before the Court by means of a plaint, it may not be considered by a Special Tribunal while it is pending before the Court. It may not be a case in which the Court has failed; the 1 Court may be proceeding quite satisfactorily with the hearing of the case, and the parties may be - quite satisfied to remain under its jurisdiction. In such circumstances, so long as the case has originated by means of a plaint, the Special Tribunal cannot interfere with it, but if a compulsory conference has been held under the powers given by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the President of the Court has referred the matter into Court, as he may do, without the necessity of proceeding by way of a plaint, and the parties are quite satisfied to go before the Court, being so referred to it, the proviso to clause 15 will not prevent a Special Tribunal from interfering in such a case. I have already quoted section 19 of the Act to show that there are a great many other cases in which disputes maybe brought before the Arbitration Court, and the Special Tribunal may interfere with them. So long as the Court is functioning apparently in a satisfactory way, surely the Prime Minister does not desire that Special Tribunals shall be invited to interfere with it. honourable Mr HUGHES - No .",23
32,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,Then I invite the right honourable gentleman to consider the effect of the proviso to which I have drawn attention. He will see that it does not protect the Court to that extent.,23
33,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"If there are fifty cases filed in the Arbitration Court, and a plaint is pending in five, would the honourable member suggest that if a dispute arose in an industry, the case of which was the thirty-fifth on the list, and the parties said they could not and would not wait any longer, a Special Tribunal should not act in such a case?",23
34,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,It might act in such a case; there is nothing to prevent it ; but under the proviso a Special Tribunal may interfere with a case which is in actual course of hearing in the Arbitration Court unless it has been initiated by means of a plaint. There may be something in the view that delay may take place in regard to a large number of cases formally originated by means of plaints; but I invite the attention of the right honourable gentleman to the fact that the very cases in which he empowers a Special Tribunal to interfere are those which have already been referred to the Court for prompt action as the result of compulsory conferences.,23
35,Mr GROOM,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Unde r the Act cases may originate in several different ways, and we only prevent the Special Tribunal from. interfering with those which have originated by means of a plaint. The honourable member's contention is that in all cases where a hearing has been commenced, irrespective of the way in which they have originated and irrespective of whether the Court has gone on with them, the Special Tribunal should not interfere. . Mr BRENNAN - Yes .",24
36,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,Would the point raised by the honourable member be met by amending the proviso to read as follows :Provided that no dispute as to which a hearing has been commenced in the Court shall be referred to a Special Tribunal.,24
37,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,That would certainly be an improvement; but I do not wish to be taken as approving of the policy of interfering with matters which have been once initiated in the Arbitration Court by way of plaint or otherwise.,24
38,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,The proviso will be amended as I have indicated. It will certainly improve matters from the point of view of the honourable member.,24
39,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"It will. is a curious phrase in the last line of the proviso, which says that no dispute as to which a plaint is pending in the Court and a hearing has commenced "" shall be referred"" to a Special Tribunal. Many matters may come before a Special Tribunal which are not referred to it. It may really grip disputes where it likes under clause 19, which gives the power to convene a compulsory conference. ""It is misleading to say that no dispute shall be referred to it. Under clause 19 a Special Tribunal or the chairman or the Minister, or any person thereto authorized in writing by the Minister, may summon any person to attend at a conference. The number of disputes actually referred to a Special Tribunal may be comparatively small. It may be merely a matter of verbiage, but it seems to me that the - phrasing of clause 19 leaves it open to the Special Tribunal itself to seize upon a dispute that is already before the Court. If it is made clear that that cannot be done I shall be satisfied. Will the Prime Minister consider my suggestion ?",24
40,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,A dispute can come before a Special Tribunal only by being referred to it.,24
41,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Perhaps so; but only in the sense that it may refer the dispute to itself. Under clause 19 the Chairman of a Special Tribunal, or the Minister, or any person authorized by the Minister may summon any person to attend.",24
42,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"That relates to a compulsory conference, whereas I am speaking of a Special Tribunal. Paragraph b of clause 15 provides that a dispute can be referred to a Special Tribunal only after failure on the part of a compulsory conference held under clause 19.",24
43,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"But clause 21 provides that where a conference has been held under clause 19, and an agreement has not been reached as to the whole of the dispute, the Chairman of the Special Tribunal, if the conference was summoned by that Tribunal, or the Chairman thereof, may refer the dispute to the Special Tribunal. The main point, however, that I ask the Prime Minister to look into is as to interference on the «part of a Special Tribunal with cases that are There actually proceeding amicably before the Court.",24
44,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.51] - I have every desire to meet the wishes of honourable members in order to make this a workable measure, ancl having listened carefully to the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) I feel that there is much in what he has said. We mustmake it perfectly clear that the object of the Bill is not to interfere with, but to supplement the work of the Court, and to deal only with those cases which for any reason at all cannot be dealt with in any other way. I shall therefore move to"" ; amend the proviso to clause 15 so that it will readProvided that no dispute as to which hearing has commenced in the Court shall referred to a Special Tribunal.",24
45,Mr BRUCE,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,Flinders) [11.68] Before sucli an amendment is moved I desire to put before the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) a point as to which I am not quite clear. Paragraph a clause 15 declares that a Special Tribunal shall have cognizance of any industrial dispute referred to it by the persons associations parties thereto. That is exceedingly broad provision. It appears to me that under it it would be possible for an association of employers or ployees to request a Special Tribunal pointed for a specific purpose and relatCj ing possibly to an entirely different trade to deal with a dispute existing in their industry.,25
46,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,That could not be done.,25
47,Mr BRUCE,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"If , for instance, Special Tribunal had been created i lation to the - coal trade, the wharf labourers, being pleased with the way which that Tribunal had dealt with eoal miners' case, might be able under the clause as it stands to invite it with a dispute between them and their employers, and the Coal Tribunal might express its willingness to do so. point might be raised that the Tribunal, having been specifically appointed for coal trade, had no power to deal with wharf labourers' dispute, but the answer would be made that under clause 15 a rest. Special Tribunal has power to take "" cognizance of any dispute referred to it by the persons or associations parties thereto."" Is there anything to prevent that being done?",25
48,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Bendigo-Prime Minishowever, ter and Attorney-General) [11.55] The honourable member fears that a Special Tribunal appointed to deal with a dispute in a particular take cognisance of an industrial dispute outside that industry?",25
49,Mr BRUCE,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,That is the point that giving me some concern.,25
50,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Clause 13 in the that Bill as introduced provided thatThe Governor General may appoint a Special Tribunal or Tribunals for the settlement of any industrial dispute or disputes, or for the prevention or settlement of disputes which have arisen, or which may arise, in any industry. the Let us take a concrete illustration of the be honourable member's point. We have at the present time a Shipbuilding Tribunal, and the honourable member suggests that one of the parties to an industrial dispute in some other industry, being very pleased with its work, might think it of advantageous to have its case dealt with by it. That Special Tribunal, however, could not deal with their case, because or its charter-the terms of its appointment an - set s out that it is to deal with suchand-such a matter. A Special Tribunal will be limited by its charter. We might, emfor instance, appoint a Royal Commisapsion to inquire into matters A, B, and but it could not inquire into matters D, E, and F, even if they were closely associated with those specifically referred to - it. That is my answer to the honourable member, and I think that, with the proviso as I propose to amend it, the a position will be made quite clear. We n reshall make it clear that these Special Tribunals will be confined to the object in"" of the Bill as stated by me, namely, to the deal with cases that cannot be, or are not, dealt with by the Arbitration Court, to deal and are. a menace to the community. Speaking for the Government, let me say that these Tribunals will not be apThe pointed as an ordinary means of deal- ing with industrial troubles. They will the be a reserve power to conserve the welthe fare of the community, and to preserve it from the consequences of industrial un",25
51,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Hunter) [11.59] I think we shall all agree to the amendment which the honourable member (Mr. Hughes) has foreshadowed. I desire, to move a prior amendment. I have given notice of an amendment of clause 16, but I think it would be better to insert it in the clause now before us. industry could I therefore move That at the end of paragraph 6 the following words be inserted:-""and have power to inquire into all matters pertaining to the inis dustry from the point of production to the final disposal of the commodity. Provided by request of either party, the evidence relating to any trade secret shall be taken in camcrti, and not be disclosed."" I have already placed clearly before the Committee the reasons that actuate me in proposing this amendment; and, since I (desire to help the Government to pass the Bill through its remaining stages before we rise today, I shall not take up much time in dealing with it. It may be argued that my amendment would come into conflict with the Constitution, but I do not see that that is so. Decisions have 'been given by the High Court in regard to the powers of the Commonwealth. For instance, in the MCKay case, which is the only case having any direct bearing, it decided that the Arbitration Court had not the power to fix prices. I am not asking that prices should be fixed, but that in connection with the coal industry, for instance, the Tribunal should have the right to inquire into every phase, so that, in the interests of the employees and the general public, it may Ibe ascertained whether there is any justification for increasing the price of the commodity in order to give increased wages.",25
52,Mr MAXWELL,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"The Tribunal will have all the powers of the Arbitration Court - ting a fair deal-that somebody is "" hav",26
53,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Exactly , but the trouble is that the powers of the Arbitration Court do not quite provide for what I desire. The Arbitration Court has power to do certain things, but up to the present it has not been able to go beyond - the dispute before the Court. Payment by results is a method generally accepted by the honourable members opposite; and if on those results depends the selling price of the commodity, it is fair to the men that there should be some means of ascertaining whether the selling price is commensurate with what they are paid. To-day there is a declared price for coal, but no one knows whether or not it is the price obtained. The men, however, are paid only on the declared price; and to give satisfaction in the coal industry, in which I am deeply interested, the men claim that 'they ought j;o be able to inquire into every phase of it.",26
54,Mr MAXWELL,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"The amendment practically what was accepted by the Government in regard to ""industrial TIT £LfctGl*S-"" - Mr Charlton - Exactly . I hope the Prime Minister will accept the amendment, for it will go a long way to assist in preventing any disruption in the coal trade.",26
55,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [12.3] When speaking on the second reading, and at subsequent Committee stages, I pointed out the limits of our power in regard to prices and profits. I said that once we established, the fact that the evidence sought to be obtained is relevant to the dispute, I personally do not see that there - are any limits, because the Tribunal is created to prevent and settle disputes. The jurisdiction having been clearly established, the only question is whether the evidence desired is relevant to the dispute. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) has taken a concrete case, and, after all, we are dealing with concrete, and not hypothetical, cases. 'The honourable member says that there are men on piece-work, paid so much a ton for hewing coal, and that when the declared price is 17s. 9d. the hewing rate is so much. The men also say that nothing is more calculated to cause industrial unrest, and breed discontent, than a feeling that they are not geting"" them. It is said that a man will be more content, and less likely to create industrial unrest, if he is getting 3s., .with the knowledge that he is being fairly dealt with, than if he is getting 3s. 6d., feeling that he is being "" h a d "" at the latter rate. That is quite true; and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) contends that all the evidence bearing on that phase should be brought out. I appreciate the necessity for such evidence where it is for the purposes of the dispute, and not for other purposes. I pointed out to the honourable member the other day that, recently, there have been made public statements by certain officials of the Coal Miners Federation for which the men are not necessarily responsible. These oflicials have said that the miners wish to own the mines; but that is not relevant to the present dispute. It is an aspiration of a section, an aspiration which may be good or is bad, but the miners as a whole are not necessarily to be held responsible for it. Every man in the Coal Miners Federation has a perfect right to hold' opinions on the point; one man may say that he believes in the mines for the miners; another that he believes in the mines for the people of New South Wales; a third, that they should belong to the people of all Australia; while another may say he believes in the present system. All opinions are perfectly compatible with membership of the union. If a certain section propose to use such evidence ""for the purpose of furthering their political purposes, to obtain information which may, perhaps, do us harm in our foreign trade with our foreign competitors, it will not do at all. Therefore, it must be clearly understood that the only evidence that will be permitted will be evidence relating to the dispute, and for the purpose of dealing with the dispute, which, of course, is a matter relating to the wages and conditions of labour. That being so, we have to ask ourselves how far the amendment is acceptable from the Government's point of view of the desire that is at the back of it, and how far it is constitutional.",26
56,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,T t does not go outside the limits of anything you have just said.,27
57,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"I do not say it does. There are two points I should like to mention to the honourable member. A great deal of industrial unrest arises through a suspicion in the minds of the coal miners that there is much leakage between the shovel and the grate. It is not material whether that suspicion is true or not-the fact is the men believe it. The miners say one thing and the mine-owners another; and if the whole facts were brought out, the Tribunal would consider them, and give a decision fair to the community, in the matter of price-becaus e it would have relation to price-and fair to the men. But it will not help the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) if we insert an amendment that the High Court will say is ultra vires; and, therefore, in order to disclosure make it perfectly clear what questions may be asked, I suggest that we strike out the words ""pertaining to the industry,"" and provide that the Tribunal have power to inquire into all matters ""relating to the dispute, from the point of production to the final disposal of the commodity."" I have never been one to whittle down the powers of the Commonwealth, but have always upheld them. Once you establish the fact that the matter is relevant to the dispute, we have, in my opinion, the right to ask the questions, and, with the alteration I have suggested, the honourable member's these amendment will be constitutional, and quite acceptable to me. There is one other point at which I wish the honourable member to look. He adds the provisoProvided that by request of either party the evidence relating to any trade secret shall be taken in camerd and not be disclosed. I do not think that goes far enough, because, in the coal-mining industry, there is no trade secret. There may be secrets in the chemical or engineering trade, but not in the coal trade, which has simply to do with getting the coal out, and there is an end of the matter.",27
58,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,Some of the proprietors say that there is a secret in regard to their business.,27
59,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"I can tell you a story on that point. In the times when files were cut by hand the. process was regarded as a trade mystery- a secret-and was usually carried on in some cul-de-sac in Sheffield. The business brought great profit to the employers; but one day a donkey wandered into a cul-de-sac, saw through the window of a house a man cutting files, and then came out into a Sheffield street and ""hee-hawed."" Thus the secret was "" given away."" What, I think, the proprietors have a right to expect is that their business shall not be disclosed either to their rivals in this country or their competitors in others, and therefore we ought to strike out the words "" relating to any trade secret."" Section 85 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act providesNo evidence relating to any trade secret, or to the profits or financial position, of any witness or party shall be disclosed except to the Court or published without the consent of the person entitled to the trade secret or nonA l l such evidence shall, if the witness or party so requests, be taken in private. I suggest to the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) that he adopt that section. With that emendation I am prepared to agree to the amendment.",27
60,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Hunter) [18.15] I am prepared to meet' the right honourable member. My only object is to make clear in the Bill what is needed. The Prime Minister and others declare that what I wish to have done is already provided for, but the people outside say that it is not provided for, and at a critical moment like the present it is important to"" make the provision clear. I agree to the insertion of so much of section 85 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as hag been read by the Prime Minister, with the substitution of the word "" Tribunal "" for the word "" Court"".",27
61,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"West Sydney) [12.20],- I entirely agree that only evidence relevant to a dispute can be admitted at the hearing of a case : but a Court of Appeal might hold that evidence which had been admitted as relevant, and which it was quite within the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth to take, was not relevant. Thus the* right of these Special Tribunals to take particular evidence might be challenged, and the evidence disallowed on other than constitutional grounds.",28
62,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"In the coal industry, the hewing rate depends on the declared selling price of coal, which the miners contend means the real selling price. If in a dispute the miners said that they were not getting a fair; deal, evidence as to whether the declared selling price was the same thing as the actual selling price would be relevant, because it would embody the subject-matter of the dispute.",28
63,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"That is so; but a Court of Appeal might declare, as a matter of law, that some of the evidence was not relevant.",28
64,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,We cannot get over that very well.,28
65,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,I think it might be provided that the decision of a Tribunal as to the relevancy of any evidence should not be challengeable in any Court other than on constitutional grounds.,28
66,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"We have already tried to enact that, and the enactment has been declared ultra vires.",28
67,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Of course, it does not matter what we put into the Bill ; if go beyond the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, prohibition will lie. But the situation which I am discussing could be met by a provision such' as I have suggested.",28
68,Mr MAXWELL,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Does the - honourable member suggest that evidence shall be missible if it is not in fact relevant? , Mr Ryan - I suggest that any evidence should be admitted as relevant which it is within the power of this Parquashed, liament to allow to be asked, the question of relevance being decided by the Tribunal which takes that evidence. The admissibility of evidence raises one of the greatest difficulties in law, and a new trial is frequently ordered, either because a Judge has wrongfully admitted, or because he has wrongfully rejected, evidence. We should prevent this Tribunal from being hamstrung by appeals to a superior Court on the ground that the evidence taken was not relevant.",28
69,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"The matter of relevance would be a question of fact rather than of law, and that question could be decided by the Tribunal.",28
70,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"In any case, the Tribunal's decision as to relevancy should be final.",28
71,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Are you afraid that if a Tribunal, during the hearing of a case, asked a.question which subsequently was declared on appeal to be irrelevant, and was made the subject of an order of prohibition, the whole decision would go?",28
72,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"That is not exactly my point. The right honourable gentleman knows how these appeals arise. Some coal magnate will be placed in the witnessbox and asked a question bearing on the profits made between the production of the coal and its purchase by the consumer, which he will refuse to answer. You will then have to take proceedings to compel him to answer, as was done in connection with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. He may then say that the question is not relevant to the dispute, and the point will go on appeal to a higher Court. The High Court might hold that the question was not relevant, although the asking of it was not beyond the constitutional powers of the Tribunal.",28
73,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"If we provide that the Tribunal may ask any question relevant we to the dispute, that clothes it with all the powers that we can give it. /- Mr Ryan - I want to make the Tribunal the final judge as to relevancy.",28
74,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Sectio n 31 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which was amended in 1914 because the original secadtion had been found ineffective, reads as follows:1. No award or order of the Court shall he challenged, appealed against, reviewed, or called in question, or he subject to prohibition, mandamus,. or injunction, in any other Court on any account whatever. 2. The President may, if he thinks fit, in any proceeding before the Court, at any stage, and upon such terms as ho thinks fit, state a in writing for the opinion of the High upon any question arising in the proceeding which, in his opinion, is a question of law. 3. The High Court shall hear and determine the question, and remit the case, with its opinion', to the President, and may make such order as to costs as it thinks fit. I am prepared to put those words into the Bill . That is the best we can do. Many of the decisions of the Arbitration Court ness have been riddled by judgments of the High Court. However, I am perfectly willing to incorporate in the Bill the tion I have read from the Act if the orable member thinks that it will for finality.",28
75,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,There is no doubt that the amendment which the Prime Minister offers would take us some distance in direction I am suggesting. But I desire him to go a little further in this clause. I suggest that he add to the amendment which is before the Committee words the effect that the question of whether any evidence is relevant shall be finally determined by the Tribunal.,29
76,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,How will that carry us any further? In the case to which honourable member referred Mr Knox applied for ah order of prohibition.,29
77,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"If we provide that the decision of the Tribunal shall be final conclusive on the question of relevancy, its decision can be challenged only on the ground of constitutionality.",29
78,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Bendigo-Prime M i ister and Attorney-General) [12.33] At the suggestion of the honourable ber for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), propose the addition to the amendment, after the word "" dispute,"" of the followI ing words, "" and the decision of the Tribunal on the question of relevancy shall be final.""",29
79,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,That meets m y point.,29
80,Mr CHAKLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,I accept that alteracompanies tion.,29
81,Mr RILEY,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"South Sydney) [12.35]. - If this amendment is adopted, will the Tribunal have power to send for books and. vouchers, ancl inquire as to the profits and capital of a company? old Arbitration Act in New South ""Wales the Court had that power.",29
82,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [12.36] The Tribunal will be able to get all docucase ments relevant to the dispute.' I suggest Court that we also add to the amendment the following words from section 85 of the Arbitration Act: No evidence relating to any trade secret, or to the profits or financial position, of any witness or party, shall be disclosed except to the Court, or published without the consent of the person entitled to the trade secret or nondisclosure. All such evidence shall, if the witor party so requests, be taken in private.",29
83,Mr BRUCE,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Flinders) [12.41] - I said on the second reading that I am secopposed to penalties being included in hona measure of this nature, the success of make which must depend on the good-will of both sides. But the Committee will agree that the clause with which we are now dealing is in a different category. If a the member of a Tribunal has not the decency to keep secret information that comes into his possession as a member of the T r i bunal, we should not have any hesitation to in imposing a penalty upon him.. I ask the Prime Minister whether some penalty should not be provided for in connection with this clause as amended.",29
84,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Bendigo-Prime M in the ister and Attorney-General) [12.42] I entirely agree with the honourable member. There must be some penalty for the disclosure of information that is given and under a pledge of secrecy. I refer honourable members to the words in clause 16, that "" any act or omission on the part of any person which would, if the hearing nor inquiry were the hearing of an indust r i a l dispute before the Court, be an memoffence against the Commonwealth ConI ciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1S, shall be an offence against this Act."" am inclined to think that those words meet the point raised by the honourable member for Flinders.' Whatever we think of penalties in general we cannot allow the financial position or trade secrets of or persons to be disclosed to the Tribunal under cover of secrecy and then given to the public.",29
85,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Hunter) .[12.43] Whilst I am against the general penalties provided for in clause 28, I am not opUnder the posed to a penalty for the disclosure of information received under cover of secrecy. That penalty should be specifically stated in connection with this clause.",29
86,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and 'Attorney-General) [12.44] The best thing to do is to include the whole of section So of the Arbitration Act, which says that the penalty for disclosing any evidence shall be £500 or three months' imprisonment.",30
87,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"If a person refused to disclose evidence when requested to do so by the Tribunal, would that penalty apply?",30
88,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"No . If a man refuses to give evidence which is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to demaud, he is liable to the penalties provided for in the Arbitration Act which clause 16 provides shall apply to this Bill. Section 84 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides that any person summoned to appear, or who has appeared, before the Court as a witness, or refuses to obey the summons, or to be sworn as a witness, or to answer any question he is required by the Court to answer, or to produce any books or documents he is required by the Court to produce, shall be liable to a penalty of £100",30
89,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,No such provision is included in this Bill.,30
90,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"No ; but it is covered by clause 28, which reads as follows:Any contravention of this Act, or of the regulations, for which no other penalty is provided, shall be punishable, on conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding £ 100, or",30
91,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Personally , I am not favourable to the supplementary part of the Bill. I would rather have the penalty inserted in the clause we are dealing with.",30
92,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"If it is the wish of the honourable member, the whole of section 85 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act may be added to his amendment.",30
93,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,I am agreeable to that course.,30
94,Mr RILEY,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"South Sydney) [12.48]. - The effect of including section 85 is that a member of a Tribunal who discloses secrets is liable to a penalty of £500, or three months' imprisonment, but I am anxious to see provision made that any person summoned to appear before a Tribunal who refuses to give information in regard to his profits, or any secretary of a union who fails to disclose the memibership of his organization, shall be subject to the same penalties. Furthermore, in my opinion, the two offences should be included in the one clause.",30
95,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney^General) [12.49] - We already provide for penalties in clause 16, and again in clause 2S, but I am perfectly willing to make special provision for the imposition of the same penalty on any person who refuses to give information, as is provided in the case of disclosing information. However, I cannot include the two in the same paragraph.",30
96,Mr MATHEWS,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Melbourne Ports) [12.50] - The Prime Minister knows that a fine of £500 would not be sufficient deterrent to a member of a big corporation who may refuse to give information concerning the affairs of his company. In my opinion, provision should be made to render every shareholder in such a corporation liable to a fine of £500 and three months' imprisonment ",30
97,Mr MAXWELL,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Fawkner) .[12.51]. - There is a distinct reason why the same penalty should not be inflicted for failure to disclose information, or refusal to obey a summons, as is fixed for disclosing evidence already given. The man who, after hearing evidence in secret, discloses it, does that which cannot be recalled. The consequences of his action cannot be overtaken. His is a very serious both. offence, which may have veTy serious consequences to the parties concerned. On the other hand, a man who is summoned to appear before the Court and does not attend can be punished and still summoned and compelled to give evidence, or the man who refuses to answer questions can be punished and still be obliged to answer questions. Amendment amended to read as follows, and agreed toThat at the end of paragraph (B) the following words be inserted ""and have power to inquire into all matters relevant to the dispute (and the decision of the Tribunal on the question of relevancv shall be final), from the point of production to the final disposal of the commodity. Provided that no evidence relating to any trade secret, or to the profits, or financial position of any witness or party shall be disclosed except to the Tribunal, or published without the consent of the person entitled to the trade secret or non-disclosure. Penalty: £500, or three months' imprisonment. All such evidence shall, if the witness or party so requests, be taken in private. Amendment (by Mr HUGHES) toThat in the proviso the words "" a plaint is pending in the Court and "" be left out, and the words "" in the Court"" inserted after "" commenced.""

98,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Batman) [12.55] I ask the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) to look at section 21AA of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which deals with, an application to the High Court for a declaration of the existence of a dispute. Apparently a Special Tribunal is not to enjoy the benefit of that provision. As the clause stands it will have power to hear and determine any industrial dispute of which it has cognisance, and "" any industrial dispute"" means one which is in fact a two-^State dispute. A slight amendment of the clause which I am prepared to suggest would give the Tribunal the benefit of section 21AA of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.",31

100,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Kooyong) [12.56] - The Prime Minister has indicated that he has already provided in his Conciliation and Arbitration Bill that the Arbitration Court shall have the power to vary its awards, and as this clause will cut directly across the authority of the Arbitration Court in that respect, I hope it will be deleted.",31

108,Mr BRENNA N,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Batman) [ 2 . 2 6 ] rise to point out that the curious thing about the Local Boards is that, apparently, they are intended to operate in respect of purely local disputes and within certain well-defined areas. But the Government must be aware that the Federal Legislature has no power to legislate in respect of local disputes. I cannot understand why the Local Boards should be invested with the very wide and general powers proposed-o n the same lines, indeed, as the powers to be given to a Special T r i bunal.",32
109,Mr GROOM,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"But the Local Board is "" in relation to "" a Special Tribunal.",32
110,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"I do not profess to know just what that may mean. It is not a Local Board appointed by a Special T r i b u n a l ; and it appears that, once a Local Board is set up, there are no limitations to its powers, because we shall have gathered up in the Local Boards all the powers which are Court of Conciliation and tion under the Act itself. honourable member cares to take the trouble to examine the A ct to determine exactly what i "" / point implies he will realise how tremendous are the powers to be vested with this purely Local Board. The Government will see that the amendments they have promised in regard to Special Tribunals are no appointed. doubt given also in the case of Local Boards; that is, so far as concerns the determination of what a dispute is before the matter is heard by a Local Board. First, there may be a Local Board appointed "" in relation to a Special T r i bunal,"" and this Board, under the A r b i tration Act , may appoint Boards of reference. So, there will be a Special T r i bunal, which will have a Local Tribunal appointed in relation to it ; which, in ' turn , can appoint a Board of reference under the Arbitration Act.

I opposed the Bill at its second reading stage as undermining the A r b i tration Act ; and, although I have made some honest attempts in Committee to i m prove it , I cannot understand .the position of these Local Boards. Their status should be more clearly defined, as being subordinate in their control to the Special Tribunals in relation to which they have been appointed. In the first place, if - I these Boards operate at all, they will operate in regard to disputes over which this Legislature has no jurisdiction, and, if they have jurisdiction, the Boards will be merely duplicating and repeating the work of another' body.",32
111,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Hunter ) [ 2 . 2 9 ] - I would like the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) to closely examine this clause. In view of the fact that the Committee has left out clause 17, the clause now under consideration .has quite a different bearing. Under clause 17 there was power to a,ppeal to a Special Tribunal under abnormal conditions, but now that clause has been eliminated appeals cannot be made to a Special Tribunal, and there may be difficulties in getting to the Court.

It is easy to make mistakes, and if it is found that the word "" determination "" does not cover "" agreement "" in the ordinary sense, clause 27 can be amended accordingly when the Bill is before the Senate.",34
137,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"If an agreement is arrived at under clause 26, is filed with the Industrial Registrar, and becomes enforceable as if it were an award of the Court, will it then be subject to the review of the Special Tribunal ?",34
138,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"There .is a distinct difference between a forced determination and an agreement which is accepted. In the event of a forced decision, a Special Tribunal has power to review it , but I am inclined to think that an agreement arrived at before a Local would be regarded as final, and could not be reviewed. I know of reason why an agreement between the parties should not be reviewed by a Local Board under abnormal circumstances. There must be finality somewhere, and if the parties agree, the arrangement should stand.",34
139,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,Alway s provided that in the event of something exceptional occurring the agreement should be subject to further consideration.,34
140,Mr MAXWELL,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,That would be a new dispute.,34
141,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,That could easily be overcome by the agreement containing a provision for a review under certain circumstances. If we go any further. I am afraid an agreement would be regarded as a mere scrap of paper.,34
142,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,I do not want that.,34
143,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"B a r r i e r ) [2.45] Under clause 26, when an agreement made before a Local Board as to the whole or part of any industrial dispute is filed with the Industrial Registrar, it will ""thereupon have effect in all respects, and be binding on the parties, and enforceable as if it were an award of the Court,"" and now that clause 17 has been eliminated, it will be impossible for an award of the Court to be varied.",34
144,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"I think the honourable member is wrong. We are providing for that contingency. In clause 10 of the Bill to amend the Conciliation and A r b i tration Act , which has been introduced, it is provided thatNotwithstanding anything contained in this Act, if the Court is satisfied that abnormal circumstances have arisen which affect the fundamental justice of any terms of an award, the Court may, in the same or in another proceeding, sot aside or vary any terms so affected.",34
145,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"The "" Court "" there referred to is the Conciliation and Arbitration Court.",34
146,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,And that will take away the right from the Local Boards.,34
147,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"No ; clause 26 merely provides for an agreement made before a Local Board, and filed with the Industrial Registrar, being binding ""as if it were an award of the Court.""",34
148,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"The Industrial Peace Bill will be governed by the amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act , to which the Prime M in Board ister has just referred, and clause 10 of the amending Bill provides that the no variation of awards shall be the function of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. My point is that the Tribunals for which the Industrial Peace Bill provides will not have power to vary an award, because, with the elimination of clause 17, that power will be reserved to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court.",34
149,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"I should not like to say that the honourable member is wrong,.but even if that were the position, there would still be a remedy.",34
150,Mr GROOM,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,Clause 10 of the Bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act refers only to the variation of an award made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court.,34
151,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"My point is that with the elimination of clause 17,' once an agreement made at the hearing before a Local Board is filed with the Industrial Registrar, it will become an award of the Court, and there will be no power under this Bill to vary that award. The power will be reserved to the Court, and not to the Industrial Tribunal for which this Bill provides.",34
152,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,I am quite sure that the Court would not have jurisdiction. The only point as to which I am in doubt is whether the Local Board would have the power.,34
153,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"The Prime M in ister will undertake to see that, before the Bill is finally passed, power is given these Local Tribunals to vary an award?",34

156,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"That point ready been decided. Clause agreed to. Progress reported. Motion (by Mr HUGHES ) , by leave, agreed toThat the time allotted for the remainder of the Committee stage of the Bill be extended to 3.30 p.m. this day and the time fixed for the remaining stages of the Bill be extended until 4 p.m. today. In Committee ('Consideration resumed) : ' Clause 28Any contravention of this Act or of the regulations for which no other penalty is provided shall be punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding £100, or both.",35
157,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Hunter) [2.56] I hope that the Committee will negative this clause. Regulations of - which the House knows nothing may be prescribed by the Governor General in Council, and for any violation of them this penalty would apply. I object altogether to the provision of penalties in connection with this Bill . This is really a conciliation measure, and it should not provide, therefore, for the imposition of penalties. It would be far better to depend upon the honour and good sense of the parties to whom the Bill will relate. Throughout the arbitration legislation of both the Commonwealth and the States various penalties have been provided. If my recollection serves me rightly, while Mr . Wade was Premier of New South Wales, penalties amounting to no less than £5,000 were imposed under the State Act on various organizations and individuals, but not one penny was collected-. That being so, these penalties go for nought. It would be more acceptable to the people if we relied upon them to honour any compact entered into by virtue of this measure. Let us take care that the Bill is in every respect conciliatory. We have provided at the end of the Bill that whatever penalties are necessary may be prescribed.",35
158,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"But by clause 16 all the penalties for which the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides are in corporated in this Bill . MT . CHARLTON"" - Then - we should introduce a further clause to overcome that difficulty. In justification of my has alattitude I point out that when the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), during the war, appointed a Special Tribunal to deal with industrial troubles in relation to the coal mining industry they came to a certain agreement under the operation of the War Precautions Act. There were no penalties attached to a breach of that agreement, but they loyally abided by it , and it expires in October, about two ., months hence. The men gave their word of honour, and if that is regarded as sufficient in connection with proceedings under this Bill , the measure will be made more acceptable to the people generally.",35
159,Mr MARRS,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Wentworth) [ 3 . 1 ] - I am inclined to agree with the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). Fines are foreign to the atmosphere of conciliation. It is my intention to suggest the insertion of a new clause, as follows:-No sitting of any Council, Special Tribunal, Conference, or Local-Board constituted in the terms of this Act shall be held in any room furnished as a Court or judicial chamber. I do not know whether that is couched in correct parliamentary phrasing, but it sufficiently indicates my intention. It is important, to my mind, to preserve the atmosphere of conciliation. When men are 'brought into a Court and see the bench, the bar table, and the witnessbox, they all suggest a legal quarrel, and that is a factor I should like to remove from the consideration of differences under this Bill .",35
160,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.4] - I shall deal in a moment with the suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks). The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) proposes to delete clause 28. Let me put this to the honourable member: An employer is summoned before a Court, and refuses to appear. If there is no penalty for such a refusal he can continue to flout the Court with impunity.",36
161,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,This is the biggest fine for contempt of Court I have ever heard of.,36
162,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"I think that what the honourable member for Hunter has in mind is that there should be no penalty for breach of an agreement or award; but those are not the only violations of the law with which we might be called upon to deal. We have to get evidence, and if people will not come to the Court how can we get it? It may be necessary to put certain questions. We may wish to examine a man as to his selling price. We may desire to say. "" You state that the fair price is 17s. 9d.; but now, as a matter of fact, how much is it?"" He may know what we desire to ask, and may refuse to appear. I suppose that, if he were at liberty to do so without consequences, he would not appear in the circumstances, if he had any sense.",36
163,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"May I make a suggestion to meet the point the right honourable member is arguing? I am quite prepared to prescribe a penalty for any person who refuses to obey a summons. For instance, in sub-clause 3 of clause 19 provision is made that any person summoned shall attend a conference and continue his attendance as directed by the person or tribunal summoning the conference. I should be satisfied to add to that a provision for a penalty upon any one disobeying the summons. But clause 28 is a drag-net provision, covering penalties in all sorts of cases, and for breaches of regulations of which we have no knowledge. Mr HUGHES . ^ I am afraid that we cannot overcome the difficulty in that way. I shall refer, not to a strike, but to a lock-out. We know that a lock-out is a monstrous and abominable crime, whilst a strike is that resolute indication of the onward march of the people towards the goal of eternal liberty. What the honourable member proposes is that for the crime of a lock-out there should be no penalty. Shame! Shame! Where are the banner-bearers of Bolshevism when such things are said? They are tied to the chariot-wheels of Capital. They are proposing to allow Capital to do with impunity just what it pleases. No, we must have penalties. How do Lenin and Trotsky deal with these matters? They say, "" Work. If you won't work, ."" Honourable members know what follows. MT. CoNsmiNE - The Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has evidently been influenced by the Russian terms to the Poles.",36
164,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"The only poll that interests me is the electoral poll; and, thank God, that is not imminent. I quite understand what the honourable member for Hunter has in view, and I am prepared to meet him this far: He says that we do not know what the regulations under this Bill will provide for. I admit that, and I am, therefore, prepared, in regard to the imposition of penalties, to adopt the regulations of the Arbitration Court. They have been in force for years, and honourable members know what they are. They would not hurt anybody. The honourable member has himself said that under them fines to the extent of £5,000 were imposed, and that not a penny of that money was collected.",36
165,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"That was under a State Act. MT. HUGHES - Well , I do not know that, under the 'Commonwealth law, we have done any better. I remember that my union was fined a great deal of money, and if the accounts of the union are inspected I do not think that any item will be found on the debit side of the ledger to represent the payment of that fine. I do not know how they do these things, but they are done. We must be able to secure evidence, and if a man absolutely refuses to give evidence, and ignores or flouts the Court, we must be able to deal with him. I know of no other way to deal with such cases than by the imposition of penalties. The clause refers to a contravention of the Act or of the regulations under the Act, and I am prepared, so far as the position of penalties is concerned, to agree that the regulations specified be those adopted and in use by the Arbitration Court of the Commonwealth. - That is, I think, .a fair compromise.",36
166,Mr MATHEWS,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Melbourne Ports) [3.8] - The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) knows very well that, under the two final clauses of this Bill, penalties might be imposed for many offences. If each clause were completed by a penal nrovision attaching to a breach it, we could understand it. The Prime Minister knows that these penal prosituated visions might 'be used against the ficials of unions, not because they would not give evidence, but because they would not apipear when their unions instructed the community. them not to do so. He knows, also, that whilst the employer can pay a fine, the labour official cannot do so. If the intention were to treat both alike, there would ,be provision, not for a fine, but imprisonment only. Again, it is fair to imprison the individual employer or labour offidial in these cases. employer, in the case of a business corThe poration, will represent the shareholders, and the labour official the members of his organization. In those circumstances, be just, if punishment is inflicted it should be imposed upon every sharethe holder of a business corporation or every member of a union, and we should gaol the whole lot. Mr CoNSiniNE - That might be an cellent way of carrying on a strike.",37
167,Mr MATHEWS,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"-Where provision made for a fine and imprisonment the greater punishment will fall on the sentative of the worker. The represenAct tative of employers can pay a fine, the Prime Minister will admit that the secretary of a union may not be able do so.",37
168,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,Yes .,37
169,Mr MATHEWS,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Not only that, it might pay a large corporation to pay fine of £500 day after day for a week, since its profits would continue to made. No labour organization could pay fines of that kind. I regard these final clauses as the worse part of the I have not taken much interest in the in certain danger under this Bill. measure, because I think it is useless, imI do take some interest in these penal clauses, because under them those I reshall present will suffer most.",37
170,Mr MAXWELL,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"There is an easy way to escape penalties, and that is to obey the law.",37
171,Mr MATHEWS,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"I am against the imposition of penalties under this Bill, because I know that there are thousands of workers who will not abide by the decisions of these Courts, and it is not right that we should place them in such of a position that they may have to go to gaol, whilst an employer similarly might easily escape imprisonofment by payment of a fine. These penal provisions must be deleted from the Bill if it is to be acceptable to the workers of",37
172,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.10] Honourable members do not appreciate for that a law without sanction is useless. not There must be behind every law at least the shadow of force. Civilization itself The rests upon it. Bolshevism rests upon it. Bolshevists say, "" Be free, or I will disembowel you. Guard the standard of liberty, or else I will cut your head off."" to These - are the anthems of Bolshevism, and, modified and watered down, they are foundation of the pillars of the temple of civilization.

Now the exhonorable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) says that unless this law is left without penalties it is going to be is useless. I ask honourable members to look at the Ten Commandments, and to reprelook at the Crimes Act.

174,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"I suppose it does, but that was not for the honourable member to say, but for us. If I have erred, I have done so because I have endeavoured to treat this as a non-party measure, and have listened to the counsel of both sides of the House. Counsel from the opposite side has been more vociferous, or, shall I say, more articulate, than counsel on this side. penalties the measure is absolutely worthless. There is the League of Nations. What value has the League of Nations unless there is behind it some force? Do honourable members realise that the greatest war in history took place under the shadow of The Hague Tribunal? In The Hague Tribunal, compassed about by 10,000 bayonets, the Angel of Peace was securely guarded - so securely guarded, in fact, that she never got out for five years. I am prepared to strike out the words "" o r of the regulations,"" and leave the clause to provide that, if there is any contravention of the Bill for which no penalty is provided, it will be punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding £ 1 0 0 , or both.

For instance, there is nothing in that Act or rules relating to the Commonwealth Council, District Councils, or the non-appearance of witnesses. I suggest that, before the Bill comes back to us, he should intimate the penalties he proposes in respect of every offence or potential offence under the Bill not provided for in the Conciliation and A r bitration Act?

"" T h i standing order °as that the question which - was being debated when the time allowed for the consideration of a Bill in Committee expires shall be forthwith put. Amendment agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report adopted. THIRD READING. Motion (by Mr HUGHES) proposed - That this Bill be now read a third time. . Mr Charlton (Hunter) [ 3 . 3 6 ] think it will be admitted that the members on this side of the House have kept their promise respecting the measure. We said at the outset that we had no intention of obstructing it , but that we objected to the application of the guillotine to its discussion, because that might shut out the consideration of important amendn ents. I am pleased that we have been able practically to get through the Bill before the guillotine was applied. The Bill has emerged from Committee a much better measure than it was. Many improvements have been made in it . As I said on the second reading, the establishment of Local Boards capable of dealing promptly with disputes as they occur, is a step in advance in our industrial legislation, and I think something that the community is looking for. My regret is that the Government did not comply more fully with the wishes of the Opposition for the amendment of the Bill . Had it accepted the amendment of which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) gave notice, recognising the trade unions and industrial organizations of the country as those which should be represented on the Tribunals appointed, and had the penalty clauses been omitted, the Opposi-. tion could iiave accepted the measure, and rpcommended it to the workers outside. We showed that the amendment was vital to the success of the Bill , and did our best to impress the Government with the need for it . I repeat what I have saia in this connection. In passing industrial legislation, we are dealing with the existing organizations, not with organizations that may spring into existence at a time of industrial trouble. From the beginning, it is the industrial unions that have been recognised in connection with the settlement of disputes. That being so, I do not know why objection was taken to their recognition under the Bill . The dustrial organizations are the parliaments of the workers. The members of the Trades and Labour Councils, and the officials of the unions, are the representatives of Labour, just as we here are the representatives of our constituents. They have won their position by their abilities, and it is their duty to look after the industrial interests of their fellow men. Why then should we refuse to recognise them when we are trying to secure industrial peace? It is for the organized workers that we are passing this measure. - I The Committee made a fatal mistake in negativing the amendment, and I must vote against the third reading of the Bill because of that action, and because of the penalty clauses. Nevertheless, I believe that this measure, when passed, will provide machinery which should be used to prevent the industrial crisis that appears to be brewing. The men who desire a Special Tribunal to settle their troubles quickly now have an opportunity to get such a Tribunal. The leaders of the men are often maligned, it being made to appear that they provoke strikes; but we have now provided a Tribunal for the settlement of disputes which will be constituted of representatives of the workers, representatives of the employers, and an independent chairman, and it can deal with the trouble promptly. I hope and believe that this machinery will be availed of by the miners. The big, strong, militan t organizations, such as that of the miners, are not injured by the refusal to give them the recognition in the Bill which we have contended they should have, but the smaller organizations are injured ; and the Prime Minister will do well to have inserted in the Senate a provision recognising the Trades Han Councils and the industrial unions in making appointments to the Tribunals provided for by the Bill . If he does that, and eliminates the penalty clauses, the measure will be, in my opinion, the best that has yet been passed by any Australian Parliament, Commonwealth or State. The concession for which we asked was a small one, and it has been demanded by trade organizations m all parts of Australia. It is only such organizations that will come under the Bill . Why, then, should we create the suspicion that the measure is providing for unknown circumstances, and the representation of non-unionists, men who in tin es of peace in- do nothing to help their fellows, but when industrial trouble arises, do their best to injure them.",39
187,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Kooyong) [ 3 . 4 5 ] - I have supported this measure because it encourages the idea of conciliatiou and the round-table conference which is very essential at the present time. That is a valuable feature of the B i i l which I hope will be exercised. I have also been influenced to do so by the - urgent assurances of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that some of the provisions were essential to deal with the present grave coal crisis. I , however, express my great disappointment that Part IV . has not been made an adjunct of the Arbitration Court. Bill seems to set up competing authorities, and I fear that the result will be endless confusion and chaos. If it could have been arranged, as it easily could, that Part IV . should be worked under the regis of the Arbitration Court, some very valuable results might have followed, and there would be no risk of the tribunals running counter to the Arbitration Act. I am relieved to some extent, however, to learn that the Government idea is that this should be only a temporary measure, and that they propose to later introduce a comprehensive measure which will coordinate all the leading features of the present arbitration law, and the principles embodied in the Bill . done, and the measure is an outcome of co-operation on the part of employers and employees, we may look for some real benefits. I hope that a big effort will be made to that end. We have also the asr surance of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) that this Bill will be exercised only as an emergency measure. If that policy is followed, some of the disadvantages I fear may be minimized.",40
188,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"West Sydney) [3.47] The many amendments made in Committee are in themselves evidence that the measure was ill-digested and ill-considered before its introduction. amendments have improved the measure to some extent. I regret that I was detained in Sydney by causes beyond my control, and was thus prevented from being in the House during the earlier stages of the measure. The Bill will duplicate the authorities set up to deal with the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, and will thus probably lead to - great confusion. I regret that during the - second-reading debate the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) saw fit to make an attack upon - the President - Commonwealth Arbitration Court. He made misstatements of facts, and I think it is our duty to say that we dissent from them. It is somewhat remarkable that in a measure providing for the creation of four different tribunals, we should provide that the principal tribunal shall inquire into matters that are well within our knowledge. We all know the main cause of industrial unrest. The present Government was largely responsible for it, owing to their failure to deal with The profiteering and their arbitrary exercise of the powers conferred by the War Precautions Act - If the Government would exercise their powers under the Constitution with regard to profiteering, and would also cease to operate the War Precautions Act, they would do much to remove the causes of industrial unrest. I cannot view with equanimity, or as sincere and bond fide, any measure which emanates from a Government who refused to take those steps to remove the main causes of industrial unrest. We are told that they seek to do that by means of this Bill . When the Commonwealth Parliament proposes to legislate, we must have close regard to the powers If that is contained in section 51 of the Constitution. Notwithstanding what has been said by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) with regard to .what he considers the two blemishes in this Bill , 1 say that this measure is at fault, inasmuch as it is not based upon all the powers that the Commonwealth Parliament possesses. On the contrary, clause 2 sets out that the measure shall apply "" to industrial matters in relation to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and.settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any' one State."" Why do the Government confine Those the basis of the Bill to such an extent? Why is not the Bill based on all the powers that this Parliament possesses. They have based it upon one power only, and when it is interpreted, the Courts will . hold that Parliament itself has expressed its intention to exercise'only one power, and that it was not its intention that the provisions of the Bill should be supported by any of the other powers conferred by the Constitution. This limitation satisfies me that the Government intend that the measure of the shall, from a constitutional standpoint, prove futile. Almost any award that may be made by a tribunal under Flinders the Bill may be attacked as beiug unconquote stitutional, because it may be shown that the dispute did not extend beyond the It is as followslimits of any one State; whereas, if the Bill were an exercise of all the Commonwealth powers in regard to taxation and other things, many of its provisions should could be supported that cannot be credited upheld on the limited ground upon and which it is based. Cases will be taken to the Courts of Appeal, which w i l say that the provisions of the Bill are remotest unconstitutional; and then the Prime Minister will go to the people and say, "" I told you so."" We know, however, that the foundation has not been laid as 2s. widely as it should have been. Take, for example, the amendment moved by the he honourable member for Hunter (Mr 2s. Charlton) in regard to the coal-mining the industry. He desired that power should his be given to investigate that industry fro the point of production to the point of fact consumption, whether in Australia^ or If overseas. To that, the Prime Minister seems threw out a suggestion that such an in - above vestigation would be held to be unconof stitutional. If the inquiry were made in exercise of the taxation power, and no described one can deny that the ascertaining of the profits of a company would be an exercise sist, of the taxation power, the investigation would be held to be absolutely valid. there any inquiry from the point of proparents, duction to the point of consumption that would not be an exercise of the taxation the power? But the Bill itself declares that it is intended to be only an exercise of it the Commonwealth power in regard to something conciliation and arbitration. I ask the Prime Minister, as a proof of the bona fides of the Government, to see that amendments ar<> made in another place to set out that the measure is intended and as an exercise of all our powers under the Constitution. If he does that and removes from the first part of the the average Bill the limitation of its scope to I only one power he will be going far amended towards making this a constitutional 'meastances sure, but if he leaves the measure in its present form I am satisfied that clause will be regarded as an invitation to the Court to find that its provisions are in valid.",41
189,Dr MALONEY,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Melbourne) [3.56] In reply to the honourable member for (Mr Bruce) I should like to a passage from Mr Harrison Ord, duel' Inspector of Factories in Victoria. MINIMUM WAGE IN ALL FACTOHIES. This modest provision simply requires that* every employee in a "" factory or workroom"" receive not less than 2s. (id. per week or 2.5 farthings an hour. It will hardly be that some of the largest dressmaking millinery firms in the colonies will resort to all kinds of subterfuges to avoid this payl ment. A girl is taken on as an "" apprentice,"" so it is said. She is not an apprentice in the sense of the word, except that she is required to pay a premium. She can be sent away or can leave at a moment's notice. But, as she is "" apprentice,"" the officers are calmly informed she is charged a premium of exactly Gd. a week. The kind employer will then say that, instead of insisting on the money down, allows her to return to him on Monday the 6d. he pays her on Saturday. He explains it is out of consideration for the poverty of poor girl's parents. He allows her to pay premium in this way. It is doubted if the m above statement would be credited but for the that the system has become public through prosecution for the very offence described above. one thing is more offensive than another, it to be the practice of such deeds as the under cover of "" kindness "" to the poverty a poor girl's parents or the poor girl herself. Others charge a premium monthly. That is, the girl "" hoards up,"" as a magistrate once her action, her 2s. 6d. per week, and returns it at the end of a month. Others in"" it looks a little better,"" on getting 10s. in advance, which is returned to the girl at the rate of 2s. Od. a week. .Another plan is to Is really obtain a premium from the girl's and pay it back at the rate of 2s. 6d. per week. In the latter case there is really appearance of apprenticeship, and it . is possible that the girl will have a chance of learning her trade. I know of cases in which is the practice to keep the girl till she wants more than 2s. 6d. a week, when she is promptly dismissed, and another "" apprentice "" taken on. The whole practice seems to me contemptible in the highest degree. The average wage in the dressmaking and millinery trade is about 10s. lOd. per week, that includes the pay of highly-paid forewomen. In 1897 the average wage for 4,164 workers was 8s. 8d. Imagine making a girl serve at her trade for a year for nothing, when wage for over 4,000 persons is 8s. 8d. would strongly urge that the law should be so that premiums under any circumfor females should be made illegal, or if premiums are allowed, it should only be on condition that the girls are legally bound, and 2 are really taught their trade. Premiums are not exacted in any other trade to any extent, and it is hard to understand why it should obtain in the worse-paid trade of any size in thecolony. In 1896 it was absolutely the lowest, in 1897 it was the lowest but one, namely, corset manufacture, and in that trade only thirty persons were returned for the wagesstatistics. At the close of 1898 there were 4,554 females working in dressmaking, millinery, &c, at an average cost of 10s. Od. per week, and 3,813 of these at an average wage of 8s. 7d. I shall conclude with just one more quotation from the report, in the hope that this Bill will eliminate for all time the disputes which nobody on either side of the House wishes to continueOn this subject Miss (Juthbertson reportsIn some cases I have found that the 2s. Gd. per week is not paid at all, but is kept back for value received; in others the girls receive the 2s. Gd. and hand it back at once. Again, others are allowed to consider it their own from Saturday to .Monday. Some employers take it on the time-payment system of 10s. per month, while the luminaries of the dressmaking profession demand that it be paid down in a lump sum varying from £6 10s. to.£10. If these girls employed in the trade were able, when they had completed a period of some years to earn anything like a living wage, it would not be so bad, but the dressmaking statistics for the year 1897 show that the average wage paid in the trade for that year was 10s. lOd, and as the large salaries paid to the heads of departments were included in these returns, it will be seen that the wages of the "" rank and file "" of dressmakers must be very low indeed. That is an indication of what Flinderslane was twenty years ago, and the "" Lane "" is respectable today only because the law compels it to be so. I believe that this Bill has been made a means of trying to injure one of the greatest men who has ever adorned the Bench- Mr Justice Higgins-wh o worthily wears the mantle that fell from the shoulders of the late Justice H i g in bo'tham.

200,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,The honourable member is obviously very much annoyed at a thine that happened quite recently.,44
201,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,What is that?,44
202,Mr HUGHES,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"The honourable member's present position in this House is very obvious. Mr R ?AN - That is very cheap. The attitude which I am now adopting is one which I took up from the moment when I first caine into this Cnamber, because I noted a certain procedure calculated to render it impossible, at a specific stage, to broaden an oraer of leave. We are now at a point where honourable members can broaden the order ofleave m order to move amendments subsequently. I understand that this Bill has to do with mandates. That is a very important subject which honourable members should be able to discuss at every stage, and they should be informed of what the Government proposes to do at every step. Some time ago a Bill was passed having to do with an agreement in respect of Nauru Island. In the course, of his remarks at the second reading stage the Prime Minister stated that the House would be given an opportunity of judging whether or not the amount to be paid in connection with the whole matter was sufficient. The House was never given that opnortunitv and, as a matter .of fact, the.money was paid over, I believe, without the authority of Parliament, either upon the Estimates or in the Act itself. It was actually paid over before the British Bill was ratified by the House of Commons and. the House of Lords'. I "" do not' ""wish to be found in the ridiculous position'of having the public say to me, as a member of this Parliament, that the Commonwealth Government are paying money over without authority and without honourable members knowing anything about it .",44
203,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,The money in respect of the Nauru Island agreement \vas paid on the same day that the other Governments concerned paid their share.,44
204,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"That may be so, but the other parties which 'paid over had the authority of their Parliaments to do ' ;- - ', so. Mr MASSYGREENE' - But the honourable member has just said that the British Parliament had not passed the measure when the money was paid over Commonwealth.",44
205,Mr RYAN,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"That is so, but the vernments which paid first secured authority of their Parliaments. The New month.

This same point v<ago by the honourable member for West Sydney, who then remarked that in future he would insist upon the ""reservation of his rights. This is not a question for the attention of the Opposition solely. Honourable members supporting the Government may sorre day find themselves in Opposition, and they will then require information upon various matters introduced by a Labour Minister.

I am not objecting to the motion, but I desire to suggest that in the future, when the Prime Minister has a measure to introduce he should give reasons for so doing.  [4.20] - I would not obtrude at this juncture if it were'not for the manner in which the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) treited the statements of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan).

Honourable members of this Chamber are not prepared to allow the Prime Minister to treat them in such a manner. It is easy for the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) to say that, if we had waited until the Bill was introduced, we would have known all about it. That does not meet the position at all. The Prime Minister could easily allow this motion to stand over until next week, but if there is any necessity for extreme haste the reasons should be given. The Government are seeking leave to bring in a Bill for certain purposes, and as the honourable member for West Sydney has stated, we may desire to widen the order of leave. It is quite competent for an honourable member to extend the order of leave to enable certain amendments to be moved at a later stage.",46

If the Treasurer been in the Prime Minister's place we might have allowed the motion to pass. The Treasurer now says that he admits we have rights, but he does not want to exercise them; but the Prime Minister made a cheap kind of imputation against matters other honourable members, and gave the expects Parliament impression that we did not possess rights. The Prime Minister referred in a sneerhas ing manner to the absence of the honorfore able member for West Sydney, who has been indisposed, but the Prime Minister should remember that he has absented, himself on various occasions.

As a new member of this House, I have been surprised to observe the way in which the right of honourable members to discuss measures at their various stages has been abrogated as the result of the slipshod methods adopted by the Governexerment. I can well understand the athad tempt of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) to "" shanghai "" motions through the House in this way in view of his reputation for unbusiness-like methods. us Our experience of the way in which he dealt with the sale of Australian produce overseas has taught us that he delays until the last moment, and then to accept his assurance that "" everything r\ all right.""

A l rethough the Government have paid over Bal- £1,500,000, we are in much the same his position as a man who buys a block of ground without ascertaining whether the convendor has a good title to it. I hope that the Government will not attempt to spring new business on the House in this way. Had they given us reasonable notice of their intention to submit this motion, we should have the unedifying scene to which the Prime Minister has treated us this after have noon. No one can complain of the treatment that the Opposition extend to the Government when we receive at hands the ordinary courtesies to which we are entitled. Our constituents look to us to preserve their rights, and I submit my amendment because of the tendency, during recent years, to introduce into the islands surrounding Australia large numbers of Japanese, Hindoos, Malays, and crossbreds of every description. We - want to avoid what has occurred in New Zealand, where there have been what are known in the United States of America as race riots, because of the introduction of coloured aliens into the Dominion. A few years ago, no one would have dreamt that New Zealand would occupy the position she does today, which has been brought about by a Government of which we have had for the last few years a replica in Australia. During the last five years, the Government have exercised under the War Precautions Act autocratic powers such as were enjoyed only by Governments in the Dark Ages, and these they seek to continue, although the war is over. Just as a tiger, having tasted blood, desires more, so the Government, having exercised these autocratic powers, are loth to part with them. Now that we desire to get back to pre-war methods of government, we find that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) is not disposed to be amenable to reason.

249,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,Order ! I ask the honourable member to refrain from making imputations.  lecture might very well have been delivered to the Prime Minister.,48
250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"Order! . The honourable member for Hume  viously insulted the Chair, is distinctly out of order in making that remark. I called the Prime Minister to order for the same reason that I have just called the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr. Cunningham) to order.",48
251,Mr CUNNINGHAM,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"The Prime Minister, ever since I have known him, has adopted a policy of bustle and bluff, and where he finds that insufficient to carry him through, he does not hesitate to be insulting.",48

253,Mr CUNNINGHAM,POSTAL EXPENDITUREINNEW,"I am now referring to the Prime Minister's attitude outside the Parliament. We need to provide that the civil government of these territories shall be in accordance with the White Australia policy, because it is impossible to trust the Prime Minister to administer the mandate intrusted to us in accordance with the desires of the Australian people. The history of the administration of the occupied territories during the war is in some respects not to the credit of the Government, and we have no desire that the same sort of thing shall happen in the administration of the territories now coming under our control, and for which we shall be directly responsible to not only the people of Australia, but the League of Nations. I am reminded by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) that during the last few days the newspapers have been full of statements showing that our White Australia policy is likely to be challenged within the next twelve months. It is quite possible that our neighbours, the Japanese, may endeavour to make their presence felt in these territories if any loophole is left for their introduction into these islands, as freely as they have entered New Caledonia. We do not desire that Australian money shall be expended in these territories merely to bolster up and support a large body of coloured aliens whose operations may at any time seriouslv menace the welfare of the Commonwealth. I trust that in future the Government little will give adequate notice of their intention to introduce new business, and that we shall have fewer exhibitions of "" bluff "" on the part of the Prime Minister than has recently been our experience. The failure of his "" b l u f f "" this afternoon will, I hope, lead to his taking up a different attitude.",48
