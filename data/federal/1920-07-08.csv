1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Eon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. NAVIGATION BILL.",20
2,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Has the Minister for Trade and Customs any intention of dealing with those provisions of the existing navigation law which provide for the punishment of desertion and of other offences ? Has he any intention of giving relief to the seamen in these matters?,20
3,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I shall he glad if the honourable gentleman will bring the matter under notice when the Bill is before us. REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE.,20
4,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Has the Acting Treasurer made the statements attributed to him in the Age of today and ths Argus of Tuesday? The latter journal states that, though the revenue has exceeded the estimate by over £6,000,000, the expenditure has exceeded it by £4,000,000; while the statement of the Age is that, although the revenue has exceeded the estimate by £6,500,000, the expenditure has increased by nearly £4,500,000.",20
5,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I read those figures with amazement. Neither statement is correct. I have made no announcement about our revenue and expenditure except in the loosest way, because, until we can bring the London accounts to balance, it is impossible to say exactly what has been received and spent. Last week, I gave a rough approximation of what the revenue would he in excess of the estimate, but I have made no statement concerning our expenditure, and I do not know where the figures published in the newspapers were obtained. The statements are preposterously incorrect, and a protest should be made against these attempts to disseminate figures which have no foundation in fact. It will be found, I think, when the books are balanced, that on the expenditure side we have exceeded the estimate hy, perhaps, £1,000,000; hut I cannot say that definitely. Of that £1;000,000, the sum of £600,000 will have been spent in increasing war pensions. It is wrong of these journals to publish statements without attempting to cheek their accuracy in any way. MOTION OF CENSURE.",21
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I desire to give notice of a motion of censure, and would have liked the Prime Minister to he present, though, of course, the Minister acting for him is at liberty to take.any action he may think fit in regard to the matter.

7,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Unde r ordinary circumstances, there would be but one course to take; but there is such a smack of Ballarat about the motion of which notice has been given that it cannot be treated seriously. Is there anything new or emergent about the high cost of living, for instance?",21
8,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,You have no right to make a speech at this stage.,21
9,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Quite so; nor will I make any statement at all regarding the matter at the present moment. Later:,21

13,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Director in charge de- of the particular branch of the Department concerned with the visit of the Prince w%s the proper person to consult unrest; in the matter.

15,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The question of the re-organization of the High Commissioner's office was one of the matters into which Mr Watt was to have inquired during his visit to London.

49,Mr WISE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. It is, unfortunately, a fact that the position is serious in Sydney. This condition has been brought about by the limited funds which the Treasury has been able to make available from time to time during the past six years, as well as the cost and difficulty of obtaining material, which factors have rendered it impossible to carry out the necessary works in the Sydney network. 2. In March last, the Acting Treasurer gave approval for this Department to invite tenders for material to be delivered during the present financial year, and a large portion of this sum has been utilized to obtain material and apparatus for Sydney, which, when received should improve the service to some extent. 3. It is a fact that a largo number of persons are unable to obtain telephone facilities, although application was made months ago, for the reasons given in answer to question No. 1, but it is not the practice of the Department to retain the deposits unless the applicants desire the Department to do so. 4. No effort is being spared to overtake arrears, but it is not possible to give any definite information as to when telephone connexions can be given, owing to the fact that the material which is necessary to give service has to be obtained from abroad, and the conditions existing overseas are such that no definite date of delivery can be given by the manufacturers, who are unwilling to bind themselves to specific dates.

51,Mr WISE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. The revision is made on the statistics of business transacted at the post-office during the previous year, particulars of which business are available at the office. 2. Under the law, such fees must be paid to revenue, and the oflicial, who is entitled to such, has in the past been required to make claim. As a result of recent inquiry by the Inspector of Accounts, action is being taken to pay, in future, without formal application. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I.

Debate resumed from 1st July (vide page 2482), on motion hy Dr MALONEY1. That this House is of opinion that the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act should be amended in order to provide for a destitute allowance to be made to all inhabitants who are destitute, so that any person making a statutory declaration (to a postmaster, Customs officer, or other appointed Commonwealth oflicial, a schoolmaster, a union secretary, a magistrate, or other appointed individual) that he or she is msufficientfy fed, clothed, or sheltered, shall be paid as soon as possible the sum of I5s. per week, and for each child 7s. Od. per week, until relieved. 2. That the passing of the foregoing resolution be an instruction to the Government of the Commonwealth to bring in the necessary amending Act.  my right to continue the debate on this motion. I have already said what I desire to say.",28
74,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Melbourne Ports) [3.3] - The contention of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) that it is the duty of the people to provide an allowance for the destitute in the community is not new - I admit that in common with other .suggestions for legislation of a beneficent character it is viewed by many people in a very peculiar way. Sueh a proposal, it would appear, is for many reasons bound to meet with opposition. It is regarded by only a few as a matter with which they are concerned, because only a small proportion of the population may he said to be really destitute. After all, humanity is very selfish, and people are disposed to view a proposal to deal with conditions which are not brought immediately under their notice as something which should not be considered at all. Arguments of this kind were advanced against the establishment of old age pensions, and practically every attempt to place beneficent legislation upon the statute-book has met with the same kind of opposition. Proposals of this kind are frequently ridiculed, and I know that some persons who may not go so far as to ridicule such a motion as that now before the House, because they would not desire to be considered heartless, have ridiculed the provision for old age pensions. That legislation was continually the subject of ridicule until it was properly understood. Honourable members are aware that it was the practice of many to refer facetiously to the ""baby bonus,"" and the maternity allowance, which is its proper name, is in some quarters still referred to by that and similar contemptuous appellations. We know that when the Eisher Government introduced their legislation for the payment of the maternity allowance meetings in opposition to it were held all over Victoria. This opposition was instigated by certain wealthy people in the community, and also, to their lasting disgrace, by many women in Australia, who were free from all fear of want at the time of their performance of the duty of maternity, and by others who used means to evade that duty. These people referred to the maternity allowance only in terms of ridicule. Those who favoured the proposal were asked why the general body of the community should pay a mother £5 to assist her in bringing her child into the world. There is not a man or woman in the country who does not know that every child born is an asset to the community. The aged, no matter how wealthy they may be, must be aware that they cannot continue to live on their wealth unless there are others growing up in the community to produce the commodities they require to sustain life. All the laughing and gib*ing at the maternity allowance should have been strongly condemned. We are told today that the payment of the allowance has not brought about what was desired by those who supported it. We shall no doubt be told that the adoption of legislation to give effect to the motion now under consideration will not bring about what is desired by the mover of it. So far as the people I represent are concerned, the maternity allowance has been of assistance in thousands of cases. It has meant that the mothers have been given a better chance of health, and their children have been given a better chance than the childten were ever given before. The argument with respect to the increase in the birth-rate makes a strong appeal in the electorate I represent, and appeals forcibly to me, because in that electorate we have the highest birth-rate in any part of Australia. Every argument used as to the benefit of legislation of this character is met by some persons with contempt. On the subject of destitution, I have heard teetotal lecturers, for instance, assert with brazen effrontery that drink is the cause of 95 per cent, of the destitution in the world today. It is because of their infernal ignorance that they make such a statement. They can never have studied economics, or they would make no sueh assertion. As a matter of fact, under the present economic system, if the world were teetotal, destitution would be as rampant as it is today ",29
75,Mr MATHEAVS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The honourable member .questions that statement. All I have to say is that if the workers of today did not spend money upon alcoholic liquors, they would receive so much less in wages. It is only because they require means to satisfy that desire that they have been enabled to secure'increases in their wages.  wages into beer?",30
76,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"When the honourable member asks me that question, I reply that they have as much right to drink beer or whisky as the honourable member has to drink water, so long as they do not endeavour to compel him to drink beer or whisky. The honourable member is like a few more to whom legislation of this character seldom makes any appeal. We generally find that people who take this stand on the question of the consumption of alcohol are narrow-minded, and try to make out that it is the cause of destitution. There are in our midst today men and women who have never been guilty of excess in the consumption of alcohol and are yet in want and destitute. Every honourable member should know, whether we like it or not, that our present economic system produces destitution. We know that under it, for every person who becomes richer, some persons become poorer. I do not intend to give honourable members an address on the economic system, but every student of economics must be aware of the truth of my statements. I do not personally agree with many contentions advanced by some who belong to the Labour movement. I do not agree, for instance, with the contention that the worker pays all taxation. I know that if a worker gets £3 per week, and 30s. of that sum goes in taxation, the employer would take very good care that if all taxation upon his employee were removed, he would only get 30s. a week in wages. Under our existing economic system, no matter what wages a man gets, he cannot with surety make provision against destitution. We are asked why the workers are not thrifty, but "" t h r if t "" is a word that is bandied about without consideration of what it really means. If wo were to inquire into its real meaning, we might suggest that no man need waste 6d. in getting his hair cut. There is no reason why he should blacken his boots, or why he should wear decent clothes, l ie might live in a hovel, if he pleased. There is no reason why he should have carpets on his floor, curtains on his windows, or glass in his windows. The logical deduction from the arguments of those who commend thrift is that a man should spend nothing, and we know the effect which that would produce in the community. Many reasons except the true one are advanced for the destitution in our midst. It is a well-known fact that the wealthier countries are the greater is the destitution in them. There is just as much destitution in the great, wealthy country of America, in proportion to population, as there is in any other country in the world, because all alike are working under a faulty economic system. Whilst I do not agree that this motion represents a panacea for all the evils of our economic system, I agree with those who think that if it were put in operation it would act as a deterrent upon those who are responsible for the creation of destitution. If those who make the wealth were compelled to pay for the destitution which they cause, they would take care that all people were given employment at fair and adequate wages. Is there any honourable member who does not realise that, under a perfect system of civilization, there need be no destitution? Admittedly, even in such a state of society, there would still be men and women who would require to be treated in hospitals. Just - as the community today disciplines certain people in our midst, so would the'community, under that perfect system, demand that those whose actions created undesirable effects should be placed in hospitals-no t in gaols, as some people advocate. Do honourable members think that any man or woman willingly becon^ destitute? That many do fall into poverty is indisputable, but if we inquire as to the cause, we may find that it is a weakness which, in its essence, is a disease. Some look with contempt upon the unfortunate drunkard; they ought to praise God that they are immune from the evils of alcoholism. Many people have never been able to realise that drunkenness if a disease, and not a crime.  when I try to prevent drunkenness? ""Why ask me to pay for it?",30
77,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"No man or woman in the community keeps anybody else. The community keeps the honourable member, as it keeps all of us. He would be walking the streets naked and foodless but for the energies of other members of the community. We all are keeping each other.  their part.",31
78,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I trust that the honourable member is playing his part in civilization. May the time never arrive when civilization is controlled by the men and women who preach teetotalism today; they are hard and narrow in all their views. If they but knew it, they are the real cause of destitution, because, if they were desirous of preventing drunkenness and other evils, they would join hands with us on this side. But they are generally to be found voting against us. If in an election a teetotal Labour candidate is opposing a Nationalist brewer, the heads of the teetotal organizaton vote for the brewer every time. I tell the honourable member that teetotalism is not the panacea for destitution. I admit that some people have become destitute through drink, but they represent only a small percentage of the total number of destitute in the community. There are some who believe that the single tax is the panacea for all evil-that by concentrating all taxation upon the land we shall do away with destitution. That is nonsense. Others tell us that we have only to place a high enough duty on imports to make everybody' in the community prosperous. They say that there is always plenty where there are smoking chimneys. Do we not know that in all manufacturing countries there is destitution ? More misery and sickness are caused by fear of destitution than by anything else. The phantom of want preys on the nerves to such an extent that people are unable to continue at their employment for the modest pittance they are receiving. I believe that it is the duty of civilization to provide for every member of the community so that there shall be no destitution. Just a3 it is the duty of the State to make provision for the dependants of those who fell in the great war, and for those returned soldiers who have 'been maimed or ruined in health to such an extent as to be una'ble to earn a livelihood, so it is the duty of the Government to care for and keep from want those who have fallen or been injured in the great battle of life. There are people who look at. me with horror when I voice that doctrine. But I believe that men and women who have heen fighting in the industrial field, and, who, through lack of proper nourishment and inability to continue at their occupations, have fallen by the wayside, have just as great a claim upon the assistance of the State as have the soldiers and their dependants. Those who cannot see the justice of that argument are wilfully blind. We shall never even approach a proper state of civilization until we realise that every unit in the community has a right to food, clothing, and housing. Surely we are not asking too much when we urge that ib is the duty pf the Government to provide relief-no t in the form of charity, but as a right which a human being should be able to claim from civilization today. Honourable members may differ regarding the causes of destitution. Some may condemn destitution, but they are utterly wrong if they regard the cause as any other than the economic system under which we are working today, whereby the more some people increase their wealth the less others possess. We marvel today why our old-age and invalid 'pensions legislation was not inaugurated years earlier. In years to come we w i marvel that we did not provide against destitution years earlier. Undoubtedly we do not pay enough by way of old-age and invalid pensions. .The sum of 15s. could live. now given is only of use to those whose support is contributed to by their own kith aud k in .",31
79,Mr MACKAY,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,But surely it is their duty to do so.,32
80,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I deny that it the duty of their children any more than it is that of the whole community. giving their pioneer labours to the world these old folk, whom we help to support with a dole today, have done as much, for the general community as for their own immediate family. The responsino bility of providing against. their old age, therefore, is as much that of the general community as of tlieir own children. Suppose that the whole community went in for race suicide and there were no children. Who would keep us in our old age? In days gone by, in Victoria, the aged and invalid poor were not paid pensions, but their children were forced to contribute to tlieir upkeep. Those the community who are not related to aged dependants have as much right contribute to the support of the old infirm as the actual members of their families. In the future people will wonder that our civilization could have so permitted destitution to continue instead of providing against it out of the Conaged solidated Revenue of the country. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN Monaro) [3.25] --Whil e there are some portions of these proposals with which I cannot quite agree, it appears to me that this motion is on the right lines. Only this afternothing noon I asked certain questions concerning what might be done regarding old-age and invalid pensioners; and the answer, in plain language, was that there was money available to provide further assistmight ance.",32
81,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The answer that we had just given an increase involvAustralia. ing £1,500,000 per annum.",32
82,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"W would it matter if it involved £2,500,000 per annum ? Why was the original Act passed ? It was to provide relief for aged and invalid poor. I was chairman of the Commission which inquired [107] whole subject, and was a member of the l l Government which brought in the eventual Bill . The reason why the sum of 10s. was fixed was that it was the smallest amount upon which it was considered a person So low a figure was fixed because it was thought that that was all the country could afford to pay. The very fact that the rate of pension has been increased indicates that that was obviously a mistake. The increase has been made is because it has been realized that the original amount could not keep body and In soul together. It is now the duty of Parliament to perceive, further, that 15s. per week is not as much today as was 10s. when the legislation was originally introduced. The payment of pensions is charity. If we admit that it is a matter of right, as we should all do, then is there any honourable member who will say that we should let the poor and invalid half starve and half live? It is a matter of necessity and of urgency that our Pen-sions Act should be amended. It is only right that we should find more money to help keep our aged' and sick folk alive. There are several anomalies in our peni n sions legislation. The Act today provides that pensioners may not work to to earn money. That is a mistake. Many and men and women who receive pensions would be glad to earn a few shillings per week by way of supplementing their dole; long and there are many folk in the community who would like to employ the folk in order to help them out. If pensioners possess property today a proportional debit is made against their (Edenallowance. Of course they are permitted to own their own homes-that is quite r i g h t ; but it is anomalous that while a pensioner may live in a home of his own somewhat which is worth even £1,000, and have debited against his pension, yet at the same time if he owns £ 1 0 0 worth of land or property the amouut of his pension is reduced proportionately. That should not no be so. There are many other changes that well be made in the Act. This country can afford to be decent to the was aged poor, many of whom have pioneered! We should show that in the opinion of the Federal Parliament it is h at no crime to be poor. I know of nothing more urgent than that reasonable and adequate aid should be afforded needy old the folk. Of course the Government say that there is no money available to do more into the than has been done.",32
83,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,It is not hard to provide money when it comes to a question of killing people rather than endeavouring to preserve life.,33
84,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Sometimes ib becomes necessary to k ill in order to preserve our own lives.

86,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Yes , and the honourable member was referring to the men who won Australia for us. Compare their action with his and that of many others of his age.",33

111,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Apparentl y it does not matter whether we agree or disagree with the honourable member; we get it all the same.,34
112,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I will say what I think until the Speaker calls me to account. However, I know it is a mistake to use a sledge-hammer for the purpose of killing a fly. I have already stated that, in my opinion, there should be some amendment of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act. Some means must be found to raise sufficient money to enable us to pay our pensioners a decent allowance. This half-starvation rate is no good to them at all. What is going to become of them if they cannot get enough to live upon? One-half of the pensioners are tightening their belts today, because the 15s. per week is not sufficient, and we, who are sitting on cushioned seats in this chamber, should not allow this state of affairs to continue. We must face our responsibilities. It is idle to say that the pensions bill has grown to a large amount. Even if it has, on the other hand we have largely iucreased revenue. Some of the big ""money-bags"" who did not subscribe to war loans or do very much to help this country during the war period should be made to pay. Where would they be with their wealth, tlieir homes, their stations, their terraces of houses, but for the services of men who today are among our pensioners; men, grown grev in the service of the country, but who were not wise enough to amass any of the world's goods for their old age? Lack of cash appears to be the only objection to the proposal to increase the pension. That is not a sufficient answer. The present allowance is not any better than 7s. would have been when the Act was passed, and it is logical that we should go further and pay these people at least £ 1 per week. I say unhesitatingly that Australia can afford this amount. I am - satisfied that, if a vote of the people were taken tomorrow, there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of the increase, and I propose, so [107]- 2 far as I am able, to insist upon something being done. I was chairman of the Commission that inquired into this subject, and visited every State of the Commonwealth in order to get the fullest information upon it . The Commission was composed of members of all sides of the House, and its first recommendation was that the pension should not be regarded as charity but as a right ; the right to live. If , now, we are not prepared to give our pensioners the means to live, then we are not acting decently by them. On the contrary, we are suggesting that it is a crime to be poor. Unfortunately, the mills grind slowly. The allowance of 10s. continued t ill 1916, and the increase to 15s. only came into force this year. Twenty years ago the same objections were raised. We were told that we could not afford the money, and it took us t ill 1916 to make up our minds to increase the amount to 12s. 6d. This is not playing the game fairly . We can afford to pay a f u r ther increase. One crank of the Customs wheel, or a special tax upon the rich people of the communityand I do not think there would be very much objection on their partwill provide the necessary cash. I hope the Government will take notice of what I have said on this subject. I know that private members' resolutions do not count for very much in this House, but if the Government, of their own volition, are disinclined to do anything, then honourable members should insist upon something being done in the interests of our old-age and invalid pensioners.",34
113,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Parramatta-Min ister for the Navy and Acting Treasurer) [3.40] - I was to have spoken at a previous sitting on this question, but it will be remembered that the honourable mem up the whole of the available time. I propose to give the House a few figures which may be interesting, if not today, on some other occasioni. This is a matter which, as is well known, falls within my purview just now as a matter of administration. I have had several deputations and representations made to me lately with regard to increasing the old-age and invalid pensions, and it would be the easiest and most pleasant thing to me to be able to sav at once, ' ' Yes, the pensioners shall have £ 1 a week "" ; but it is quite another matter - when we come to consider ways and meansof providing even for so worthy an object. Only six months ago we decided to increase these pensions by 2s. 6d. a week, making a per cent, increase altogether since the Act was originally passed. It was estition, mated that this additional 2s. 6d. a week for the number of pensioners then on the roll would mean an additional expendiEden-Monaro ture of £800,000 a year. For the six months since that decision arrived at, and the Act was amended, increase alone has cost us, as I said day, nearly £700,000, and it is quite tain that before the year is over it w i have cost us £1,500,000 - Prom some figures I have here I find that for the financial year ending 30th June, 1915would when the maximum rate of pension was 10s. a week, the amount paid was £2,704,309.",34
114,Mr TUDOR,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,That is for both invalid and old-age pensions?,35
115,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"For b o t h; and the amount paid must have been a great say that. deal less in the year the Act was originally passed. In1916 the payments amounted to £2,859,766. In that year-and this is dren. the point I wish to make-the l i m it of income and pension was raised to tunately, £ 5 8 10s. per annum, and the maximum pension to 12s. 6d. per week. Although the increased rate was in operation for only nine months of the period, the paythe apex now. ments for the year ending June, 1917, rose to £3,518,987. The full effect increase was shown in the year ending June, 1918, the payments for that year being £3,753,977-a n increase of £894 211 over the expenditure of two vears before, when the maximum pension was 10s. For the year ending June, 1919, the amount paid in pensions was £3,880,865. On the 1st January, 1920, the limi t of income and pension was raised to £ 6 5 per annum, and the maximum pension to 15s. per week. Although the increased rate guine man ! was paid for only about half the period, the payments for the year ending; 30th June, 1920, were £4,574,000; and it is mated that at least £5,300,000 will be quired for the year ending June, 1921, assuming that no further increase is made in the meantime.

123,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I know; but the American experience is not ours, nor is ours American administration. However, that is as it may be, and it remains to be seen whether the war pensions will increase, decrease, or remain stationary. I rather think, as I say, that we are getting towards the apex of expenditure.",35
124,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"You are a very sanSir JOSEP H COOK - If the war pensions increase beyond £7,000,000, it estimeans that our pensions expenditure, retaken altogether, will be a. tremendous liabilitv on the country. At any rate, to giVei the old-age. and invalid penanother 5s. a week would mean a yearly bill of close on £8,000,000, in addition to the £7,000,000 or £ 8 000,000 for war pensions. in- Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - What is the alternative? Sir JOSE PH COOK - There is a l i m it to the capacity of the country to contribute even to desirable objects. The honourable member ' for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman)' has told us that there are sources of wealth that could be tapped, and has spoken of "" moneybags "" from which revenue could be derived. But the ""money-bags"" being tapped today.",35
125,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Some of them. The Government have not had a "" bob "" towards the loans from a lot of rich people who ought to be made to pay.",36
126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I remind the honourable member that there is not only the question of loans, but the question of taxation, and some of the "" moneybags"" are being taxed up to 8s. and 9s. in the £ 1 for Federal purposes alone, in addition to the taxation paid to the States. The ""money-bags"" are "" p a y ing up "" and it is no use girding at them unnecessarily; nor must we let sentiment run away with us when dealing with these poor old pensioners. They are an obligation, and I am one who believes thoroughly in the old-age pension system. I think the State owes something to these people, though I do not pretend to agree with the statement made this afternoon that there are no obligations remaining with members of the pensioners' families. down that doctrine,, and I do not think that an unfortunate member of a family should be altogether a direct charge upon the State when there are other members of the same family who should discharge their famil y obligations if they are able t.o do so. However, this motion is really not an old-age pensions proposition, but one to create a destitute and benevolent department, which is to be associated with the Old-age Pensions office, and statutory authority for the establishment of which is to be incorporated with the Old-age Pensions Act. So fa r as I read it , it simply means that any old-age pensioner who cares to make a statutory declaration that he does not possess sufficient means to enable him to make ends meet, shall be at once granted an additional 15s. per week.",36
127,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"It does not say that. It provides that "" any person "" making a statutory declaration shall be granted that additional amount. . It applies, therefore, to any inhabitant of Australia.",36
128,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"And , therefore, to any old-age pensioner.",36
129,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"It goes much farther than the Minister suggests. Sir JOSE PH COOK - I know that. I am merely dealing with one aspect of it . It means that an' additional 15s. per week shall be granted to every old-age pensioner who cares to go before a schoolmaster, a postmaster, a Customs officer, a\ are union secretary, a magistrate, or "" other appointed individual,"" and make a statutory declaration that he is insufficiently - fed, clothed, or sheltered. Such a provision would double the cost of our old-age pension scheme at once. At present, our old-age pensions amount to £5,300,00 0 per annum, and the effect of adopting this proposal would be to immediately increase them to £10,600,000 per annum. But , as the honourable member for Barrier (Mr . Considine) has very properly pointed out, this motion relates to all destitute persons in the community. Clearly, therefore, we should increase, that sum very considerably. Indeed, it is safe to say that if effect were given to this motion, our yearly bill for old-age pensions and destitute persons would aggregate, £12,000,000 or £13,000,000.",36
130,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"That would cure the position very quickly. The pensioners would go to work then. Sir JOSE PH COOK - Would it cure the position? Would a pensioner be I do not lay likely to go to work if , instead of receiving only 15s. per week, he received 30s. per week I",36
131,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Me n become destitute because of the economic situation. The Minister knows that.,36
132,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,I have yet to learn that an increase of the old-age pension would cause destitute persons to go to work.,36
133,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"There are many honourable members who cannot support this motion, but who are in favour of in creasing the old-age pension Sir JOSE PH COOK - I know that. The honourable member is quite diplomatic in eschewing all the other aspects of the motion, and in confining himself to the old-age pensions side of it . But nobody can agree to a proposition of this kind. It is far too sweeping.",36
134,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Althoug h there are financial difficulties in the way, if the Minister himself will reflect for a little while he will recognise that the course proposed to be adopted is the correct one. Sir JOSEPH. COOK - I should like to point out another striking fact in connection with these old-age pension increases. Somehow or other every in crease in the amount of the pension opens the way to a tremendous increase in the number of applicants for it . The pension becomes more attractive, and people who would not apply for it when it was only 10s. per week do not scruple to apply for it when it is 15s. per week. I have here some instructive figures in this con-, nexion. Our oflicer goes on to say that during the year following 1916, when the pension was increased from 10s. to 12s. 6d. per week, the number of pensioners in creased by 6,488, whilst in the year previous to 1916 the increase in the number was only 2,791. The figures for the half year ended 30th June, 1920-the Act had again been liberalized in the meantime!-ar e even more poinvincing when compared with the corresponding six months ended 30th June, 1919. The in crease in the number of applicants for the six months ended 30th June last was 1,579, whilst for the six months just closed it was 4,313-a n increase of 2,634 above the normal increase.",36
135,Mr RILEY,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The point is whether the applicants were, by reason of age, qualified to receive the pension. Sir JOSE PH COOK - The facts show that every increase in the amount of the pension attracts people who did not ask it previously. That is the point which these figures bring out.",37
136,Mr RILEY,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,But the applicants he qualified.,37
137,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,A new set of pensioners apply for the pension immediately the terms are liberalized in this way.,37
138,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Is it not a fact that the increase in the cost of living has compelled these extra persons to apply for the pension ? Sir JOSEP H COOK - Certainl y not.,37
139,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,The Minister is on a slippery wicket now.,37
140,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Indeed , I am not; why should I be? Surely the in creased cost ofliving ought to have given us more pensioners when pensions were on the lower rate. But experience shows that the higher the pension the greater is the number of applicants for",37
141,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Hav e not the increase in the number of pensioners, and the increase in the cost of living, been concurrent ?",37
142,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Not to the same extent.,37
143,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,The increase in the cost of living is 100 per cent.,37
144,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I would like the honourable member to understand that the increase in the number of new pensioners has amounted to about 150 per cent, in two years. SuTely the cost of livin g has not risen to that extent with in the same period. The simple fact is that the higher we make the pension rate the more applicants there are for the pension, because the more tempting it becomes. People who would not bother about it when it was 10s. or 12s. 6d. per week do bother about it when it is made 15s. per week. I am stating these facts in order that honourable members may ruminate upon them, and in the hope that if t'hev can offer a better explanation of them they may favour me with it on some f u t u r e occasion. I have here another set of figures relating to the number of old-age pensioners in the Commonwealth, which will prove interesting to the House. In A p r i l last there were 98.750 old-age pensioners in the Commonwealth, and 34,000 invalid pensioners. The old-age male pensioners number, approximately, 39,000, and the female pensioners 59,000. must There are thus 20.000 more female old age pensioners than there are male. The invalid pensioners comprise 16,000 male, and 18,000 females- a total of 34,000. These figures, of course, are not absolutely correct, but they are sufficiently close for ordinary purposes. The percentage of old-age pensioners to those who are eligible by age is just less than 34 per cent, for men, and just over 34 per cent, for women. The qualifying ages are, respectively, 65 and 60 years. The numbers of pensioners, according to population at 30th June, 1919, were as under:Old age-19 0 in each 10,000 of population. Invalid- 63 in each 10,000 of population. 253 in each 10,000 of population. About 2£ per cent, of the entire population are in receipt of pensions in one way or another.",37
145,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"If a destitute allowance were made, the proportion would not be more than 3 per cent.",38
146,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Experience does not justify that assertion. Figures show that with every effort at liberalization, there is a great increase in the applicants.",38
147,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Is not the difficulty of finding the money due to commitments as the outcome of the war?,38
148,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Of course, that is one of the reasons. However, everything in the world is more or less relative; and with all the criticism of our old-age pension scheme, it is still the most liberal in the world. I should he glad to be able to concede this extra 5s. per week if , in the circumstances, it were possible to do so; but this year, with all our towering commitments, we are paying the old-age pensioners of the community an additional £1,500,000, and I am afraid that it is more than I can promise at the moment to consent to pay them another £1,500,000 next year.",38
149,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Barrier) [4.4] The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) wilfully or inadvertently misunderstood an interjection I made during the course of his speech. I said that when it became a question of killing, any amount of money could be found. I was endeavouring to demonstrate that in all countries, not only in Australia, any amount of money can be found when it is a question of warfare, but that the cry of insufficient funds is always raised when the matter is one affecting social welfare. I had not the slightest intention of reflecting on any honourable member who had sons or relatives at the Front.",38
150,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Admittin g all that for the moment, the honourable memher knows the old democratic sentiment that the safety of the State is the highest law and the first necessity ",38
151,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"At the proper moment, I shall be quite prepared to dehate that matter with the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook).",38
152,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,What would the honourable member do if a burglar attacked him?,38
153,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I am now engaged in the task for which I was sent to this House, and that is to prevent burglary on my own class; as a sort of policeman, I. am trying to get a restoration of some of the property of the working man which has been taken from him by the exploiters of this country. Wlhile I support the principle, because of the spirit behind it, that there ought to be no destitute men or women in Australia, that every individual should not only have the right to work-, but should also be obliged to work, except those who, owing to physical disabilities, are unable to do so, and that those who have "" done their b it "" in helping to build up the country and make it what it is, and have reached an age when their working time is over, should be provided for, not as a matter of charity but as a right, I disagree with the wording of the motion which makes the granting of the pension an act of charity. It is incumbent upon the person who applies for assistance to seek it as an act of charity, when it is his right to get it . In_the course of his exchanges with me, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro made some reference to the Bolsheviks. The very sentiments to which the honourable member gave expression today have been put into actual practice by those Bolsheviks he so much despises.",38
154,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,How many have the Bolsheviks killed?,38
155,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"All that was necessary. Official statements show that there were more people executed by the Allies in Murmansk and Archangel than were executed by the Bolsheviks in the whole of Russia. For the information of honourable members, I shall quote a few passages from Bolshevik Russia, Its Code of Labour Laws, a publication edited by the People's Commissariat of Justice, and printed in Petrograd. The first I quote is as follows:ON COMPULSORY LABOUR. All citizens of the R.S.F.S.R.. wit h the exceptions stated in articles 2 and 3, are subject to compulsory labour. 2. The following are exempted from compulsory labour:(a) Persons under sixteen years of age; (6) All persons older than fifty years; (c) Persons who have lost their working ability due to mutilation and illness. 3. From compulsory labour are temporarily exempted:(a)Persons who, owing to illness or mutilation, have temporarily lost their working ability, for a period necessary for their recovery; (6) Women with child, for a period of eight weeks before and eight weeks after confinement. I would like to point out to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr . Austin Chapman) that the Commonwealth has a good deal further to go before its legislation can compare with provisions such as these. The honourable member one should work. said that certain persons should be allowed to work if they were able, and that means supplement tlieir pensions.",38
156,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Hear , hear !",39
157,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I am glad the orable member for Eden-Monaro is being converted. The next passage I quote isBIGHT ov APPLICATION OF LABOUR. 12. Out of the number of persons exempted from compulsory labour only those mentioned in paragraph b of article 2 bave the right apply their labour. Paragraph b of article 2 reads"" All persons older than fifty years.""",39
158,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Will the honourable member read the article right through.,39

161,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I gave that relating to the exemption of compulsory labour, and sufficient toshow that Bolsheviks are in. harmony with the honourable member's plea, as submitted this afternoon, that those over fifty years of age should be allowed to apply their labour if they so desired.",39

163,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Yes , with the provision advocated by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) that they can apply their labour if they so desire. It will be seen, therefore, that the honourable member is, to that extent, in harmony with the principles of Bolshevism which he denounces. The next passage isUNEMPLOYED AND PAYMENT OF SUBSIDIES. The fund of insurance of unemployed is composed of (a) payments from all enterprises, establishments, and persons exploiting labour against remuneration; (b) fines imposed for delay of payments; (e) casual payments. In other words, the f u n d from which those who are temporarily unemployed are paid, is made up from contributions of employers or the State-owned works on a percentage basis of the total salaries. An unemployment f u n d is thereby created which provides for those compulsorily out of work. Everybody under the age exemption is compelled to work, and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) nods his head in agreement.",39
164,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,I agree that every,39
165,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"As the honourable by member has expressed himself in agreement, I am glad to see that the principles of Bolshevism are spreading even to the honMinisterial benches. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) has already paid tribute-inadver « tently, I admit-to the principles of Bolshevism, and I am sure he will not go back upon them simply because the Bolto sheviks happen to have adopted them. The honourable member for Denison (Mr . Laird Smith) has expressed himself in . favour of - compulsory labour, and it naturally follows that if everybody works, aud the exemptions are similar to those provided by the much-maligned Bolsheviks of Russia, there will be no need to go further.",39
166,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Will the honourable member allow me to peruse the book from which he has quoted ?,39
167,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Yes , but the honourable member can purchase them in any quantity at a Bourke-street establishment. So far as the discussion on this motion has gone it would appear that there is no. need for further debate; but all persons there is a need for investigation and caref u l consideration of the social legislation of other lands, particularly Russia. If we perused the legislation that has been enacted by people whom some delight to abuse, it would be found that many of its provisions would be very usef u l here. Notwithstanding the prejudices that exist T believe that we could discover much that would be of considerable advantage to the people of Australia and which would render motions of this character unnecessary. The question is one that is worthy of attention, but I am reminded of the Biblical saying-that "" the harvest trul y is plenteous but the labourers are few.""",39
168,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,In Russia they killed most of the labourers.,40
169,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The honourable member will then, perhaps, be prepared to explain why the British Premier (Mr. Lloyd George) and other statesmen, are so earnestly seeking reconciliation with Russia and participation in her food supplies.",40
170,Mr BURCHELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Is that why Mrs. Philip Snowden speaks so enthusiastically concerning Russia?,40
171,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The honourable member for Premantle (Mr Burchell) must remember that Mrs Snowden was one of a party which visited Russia as a Labour mission from Great Britain; but, although we have been told her views, there is a suspicious silence garding those of the other members of the mission, who must have reported the result of their investigations. Why have Mrs Snowden's opinions heen given such prominence?",40
172,Mr BURCHELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Because she was an ardent advocate of Soviet Government, and her conversion is so pronounced.",40
173,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Neithe r she nor her husband were advocates of the Soviet system, as the honourable member knows.

179,Mr LAZZARINI,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Werriwa) [4.25] I rise to support the motion, although, like the honourable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine), I would prefer to have the idea of charity dissociated from the proposal. I should like to have destitute persons provided for by an amendment of the old-age and invalid pensions legislation. The burden of the Minister's argument seemed to be that if those pensions were increased, the applicants for them would become more numerous. There is not much force in that argument. The country has agreed .re- to the provision of old-age and invalid pensions, and the continuance of the system is an admission of the need for providing a decent living for those eligible for the pension. It was.thought, when the pension system was introduced, that 10s. a week was the lowest sum that would be of any service, and if 10s. was the minimum then, £1 is not sufficient now, because, despite Mr Knibbs and statistics generally, it is absurd to say that the cost of living has increased only 50 or 65 per cent. Everything that I buy has increased 100-or 200 per cent.",40

The basis laid down in 1912 was the allotment of £ 1 a week for each adult, with 10s. be for each child under the age of years, so that a husband with a and three children would receive £3 10s. a week.

The subject of my motion was brought before the House some three months ago, when the Leader of the Labour party (Mr Tudor) moved the adjournment to discuss it. It is not my purpose to speak today at any great length, unless replying to interjections makes it necessary to do so. I admit that I have some feeling in this matter, but I wish to discuss it in a spirit of calmness, in the hope of influencing honourable members with a view to bringing a little nearer the granting of justice to certain persons, particularly persons born in Australia, and I should like a vote to be taken on the motion this afternoon. I shall not repeat now statements which I have already made in this Chamber on two previous occasions. I am afraid that were I to allow myself to speak at length, I might be tempted to bring before the House cases that would convince members of the need for fair play for certain men.",41

185,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I may mention one or two, but while some persons who have made statements to me are willing that I should mention ftheir names, others have asked me to keep their names secret. Honourable members may ask the reason for that. I would remind them that the War Precautions Act is still in force. The persons to whom I refer have received such treatment from the present Government that they would not be surprised at anything that might he done to them even now. I do not wish them to be victimized, and I know that feeling generally is cooling down; that the War Precautions Act will presently cease to operate, and that then these persons may speak the truth without; fear of injury. I know, too, that if I cannot get what I am asking for now, I shall be able, if I am spared, to make another attempt next session, and if that is unsuccessful, a further attempt in the following session. This is a letter which was sent to me yesterday. It shows what my opinion of the position is when I have taken care to tear off the name and the place it came from. It was not sent to me in order that I should read it in the House, but there are one or two sentences in it which I think I ought to read, because they show the feeling of fear existing in the minds of our Australian-born who have had to go through the experience of internment. This is one passageHave you any idea when the War Precautions Act is to be entirely abolished? This damnable instrument hangs like the executioner's blade",41

187,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,I am not casting any reflection. I am simply quoting what is in the letter.,41
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,The honourable member by reading the letter is making himself responsible for the statements contained in it.,41
189,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Seeing that I am not allowed to make use of such a strong expression, I will leave it outThis instrument hangs like the executioner's blade over our heads, and naturally prevents any of us from publicly making known many things condemnatory of the Australian Kaiser's attitude towards Australian-born subjects. That gives a true reflex of the state of fear and suspicion in the minds of many of these people, and for that Teason I do not intend to bring under the notice of the House many of the cases which I could quote. It will be noticed that mv motion is divided into three parts. The two first ask for a Select Committee to inquire into the internment camps and the treatment of the internees. That is not the most important reason why a Select Committee should be appointed, and if I could obtain the last portion of the motion-I should be even willing to forego the two first parts. Still it seems to me that some good may come from an inquiry into those things, if only because I have heard, and others may also have heard, of certain things which are said to have happened in the internment camps. I , as an Australian, would like an inquiry, so that if the statements are not true we may he clean and clear in the eyes of all, and, if they are true, the people of Australia may know what militarism means, and may not be deluded, as some of them seem to be today, into the belief that militarism in Australia must necessarily be different from militarism anywhere else in the world.",41

193,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I am not. I will mark the honourable member's interjection, and when the time comes will answer it. If the honourable member will make inquiries privately I think he will find that he may not be correct. In any case there may have been circumstances where even that extreme course was justified. I believe the expenditure on the internment camps was between £1,250,000 and £1,500,000.",42

It would be a good - thing if the whole question could be cleared up. I am here as an Australian, and am proud of the fact that I am an Australian, and it hurts me when I hear of some of the things that are said to have happened. I should like to be on sure ground in saying that they have not happened.",42

I do not wish that reflection to be cast on every member who has been in the ranks. I do not think that of them; but the first man in the House who interjected on those lines was the honourable member for Parkes. His attitude to me seems to show that he is a little inclined to make overmuch of the fact that he has been on the other side of the water.,42

201,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I tliink so much of AusWe tralia that if ever the day comes when I believe it is in danger I shall be prepared to fight. ' Throughout the whole of this war I never once saw any chance of the British Empire losing the war, and never once saw any danger to Australia. After all, I do not see why, if a man is a returned soldier, he should be unjust to Australian-born citizens. If the honourable member has antipathy for me, that is no reason why he should have antipathy to Australian-born citizens who have not been fairly treated. Honourable members may "" sling "" all the mud they like at rae, but I am here battling for these people because I am convinced, from my inside knowledge of different things I have had the chance of reading about, from diaries that have been kept, and from meeting these men, who were once honoured, but who are not honoured today on account of the stigma which has heen placed on them, that many of them have not received a fair deal. I do not want the question of war service to be drawn in , because, after all, that is only an attempt to infiuenoe the minds of some of the members of the House not to give justice to these people. Honourable members can think what they like about me, but I want them to give me a - chance to get justice for these others.",42
202,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Are you going to tell us th* nature of the ill-treatment?,42
203,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,No ; I am not going to make any comments about the camps.,42
204,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Then what is the good of the Select Committee?,42
205,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I am going to bring before the House one or two cases. I could bring u,p many, and in due time. I shall quote all that honourable members want. M i , BELL - We want to hear them.",42
206,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"That would be dangerous to some of these people, unless the War Precautions Act is first removed out of the way.",43
207,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Why ?,43
208,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Because under that Act unlimited power is given to this Ministry. In the interests of these people, and at the wish of some of them, I am not prepared to give the details now. As the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) asks me, "" What is to prevent the Government, if they want to, from deporting any of these men?"" Nothing whatever. It surprises me that the members of this Parliament have allowed the present position to go ou so long. The war has - been at an end for a long time. Germany, Austria, B u l ' garia, and Hungary have a] signed the Peace treaties, yet our War Precautions Act is still in force, and unless something is done to terminate it , it is bound to operate for the full length of this year, if not longer. down here helpless in front of that Act . I have heard one or two members of the Country party, and some of the members on this side, complain about it , but the Ac t is still in operation, and if a man has been once caught under i the is afraid of the same weapon falling upon him again. The honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) may be asking me for particulars from the best of motives, but I am going to tell my story in my own way. Those who were interned, so far as I have been able to go into their cases, may be divided into four classes.",43
209,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Are the people that the honourable member speaks of still in terned ?,43
210,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"No . I am asking for a Select Committee, not to get them out of an internment camp, but to give those who remain here a chance to clear themselves of the stigma of disloyalty that is upon them today.",43
211,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Are they still being in terfered with in any way by the authorities?,43
212,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Not that I know of. The first class would include the recent arrivals in Australia. Amongst those who came here when the war started there would be a good many runaway sailors. So far as I have been able to gain information, it seems to me that much of the trouble was created by runaway sailors and others who had only recently come to this country. I have no complaint to make about the internment of those men, nor could I have. The Government was justified in taking those who had recently come here, and whose sympathies were bound to be with their native country, and putting them where they would not do any harm. I have no complaint to make about that particular class, provided that they were treated humanely in the camps. The second class comprises unnaturalized persons who have been in Australia for a long period. Some honourable members may say it was their own f a u l t that they were not naturalized. Some of these cases have come before me, and I find the position to be as follows: 1 The Soutli Australian law in regard to naturalization did not necessarily confer naturalization on the child with the naturalization of the parent. I am informed that in some of the other States the opWe sit posite was the case, and that, consequently, when a person who came fro m Germany with his family became naturalized there, his naturalization automatically passed to all his children who were under twenty-one years of age. Many of the people in Australia today who have been here since childhood are not naturalized simply because they thought that their naturalization was necessarily consequent on the naturalization of their parents. Others have told me that they paid men to get them naturalized. They solittl e understood the procedure that they did not trouble, even when no certificate of naturalization was given to them, and they find now that they were simply fooled. Honourable members may be inclined to take this with a grain of salt, b ut I assure them that there have been on the rolls numbers of electors who were not naturalized, although they thought they were. It was only when it was pointed out to them, after the war started, that they were not naturalized, that they had to go off the rolls. This class is distinctly unfortunate. I recognise that the Government were acting within their legal rights in their case, but it seems to me that since these people had been residents of the Commonwealth for many years, and had proved themselves good citizens, the Government, in interning them, were pressing for the uttermost.",43
213,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,They were not interned because they were not naturalized.,44
214,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I recognise that; but I do not know why they were interned. The fact that, although they had been resident in the Commonwealth for many years, they remained unnaturalized told against them in the opinion of many people, and it is for that reason that I have explained why they failed to take out naturalization papers. They believed that they were covered by the naturalization of their parents. I understand that under a Commonwealth Act which came into operation only a few months ago, the naturalization of al foreigner will apply to all his children under the age of twenty-one years.",44
215,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,The honourable member knows that these people were in terned because they were believed to be disloyal.,44
216,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"That is what the honourable member and the majority of the House think ; but I can quote a statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) that many of these people were interned on suspicion. A South Australian Judge has said that the fact that a man has been interned is no evidence of his disaffection or disloyalty. Many persons were interned on suspicion, and the trouble is that they come out of the internment camp bearing the same brand as those who might have been absolutely disloyal. The third class to which I desire to refer are naturalized Australians who were interned. There were 267 cases of that kind. A naturalization paper carries with it the rights of a British subject, and one of the rights of a British subject, ""War Precautions Act or no such Act, is that he shall not be condemned or imprisoned without a fair t r i a l . These 267 men had taken out naturalization papers, but under the War Precautions Act those ""scraps of paper"" were, so to speak, torn up by the present M i istry. I can well understand that there might have been suspicion in regard to some of these men, but since they had been naturalized, .and had thus been given the rights of British subjects, - the Government should have carried out their part of the bargain, and have given them a trial. The last class I propose to mention are those of Australian b i r th who have been interned, and it is for these that I am specially in the fight. I am bringing forward these unpopular matters",44
217,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,This is a fairly popular matter in the honourable member's electorate.,44
218,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"In order to clear the honourable member's mind, and to induce him to be a little more charitable, let me tell him that a leading Labour worker in my division some three weeks ago said to me, "" Gabb, old man, you have done enough to show the German people""-h e should have said "" A u s tralians "" - "" that you are trying to be their friend, and are endeavouring to carry out your pledges. Your attitude on this question is being used against you in your electorate for all it is worth. You have proved yourself to be the friend of these people; take my advice and do not have much more to say on the subject."" More than half of my electorate are of British origin, and I know that my opponents are stating all ever my electorate that I am a pro-German. If I had regard only to my own interests I should accept my friend's advice. He is a stalwart Labour worker who travels over a good part of my electorate, and I have had his friendship for many years. I have already fought an unpopular fight in this connection, and if I had regard only to my own interests, I would now allow the matter to drop. I believe, however, that these people have been wronged. They are as truly Australian as I anj. There are forty-three of them who were born on Australian soil, and I am satisfied that those honourable members who are now jeering at me will , within the next three years, view this matter in its proper light, and recognise that our fellow Australians should be fairly, treated.",44
219,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,The honourable member has not shown that these men have been unfairly treated.,44
220,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I shall do so. The Prime n - Minister recently stated in this House that the question of the injustice done to Australian-born citizens was no longer a live matter. There is in my electorate a man of German origin who, like the Prime Minister, had two boys at the Front. One of them paid the supreme sacrifice, and lies buried in France. This man, who is about the same age as the Prime Minister, was put behind the barbed-wire of the internment camp. Would auy honourable member in the same circumstances consider that his internment as a disloyal subject was not a live question?",44
221,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,I know some absolutely disloyal men whose sons went to the Front - me n who said that they would like to shoot their sons for enlisting.,45
222,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,I question whether the son of any man who was so disloyal would go to the Front.,45
223,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,There were many such cases.,45
224,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The spring cannot rise above its source; the influence of the home is great. I cannot believe that a child reared in a disloyal home would enlist. In the light of these facts, it is absurd to say that this is no longer a live question. In another case a poor man of German origin, with a wife and eight little children, returned from work one day to find a constable waiting for him at his gate. He was arrested, taken from place to place, and ultimately interned. His wife was allowed 30s. per week for the upkeep of the family. While he was in camp he learned that she was ill , and naturally desired to go to her, hut was not allowed to do so. How would any honourable member like to be treated in that way, especially when he did not know why he was interned? Would this not be a live question to him? In yet another case a wealthy manand I admit that, in this matter, the Government did not discriminate between the rich and the poor-wh o was interned, has determined, as soon as the War Precautions Act ceases to operate, to take his case into the Law Courts. He knows that an Act is to be passed indemnifying the Government and its officers for any wrongful act that may have been committed by them; but he is determined to take his case to the Court, in order to clear himself. He told me that, although he had struggled hard for what he had, he had resolved to clear himself of the stigma resting upon him hy an appeal to the Courts, even if he had to spend every penny he possessed to do so. How can it be said that this is not a live question to a man who feels so warmly? No honourable member has experienced what it is to be disowned by his own country.",45
225,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,We are not likely to.,45
226,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I hope not. Even if we were justly disowned by our own country we should be much perturbed, but if we were unjustly disowned and dishonouredif the sense of injustice rankled in our breasts-woul d it not be a very live matter to us ? This is an intensely live question to those who, in some cases, have been dishonoured on mere suspicion, and ib is only reasonable that we should appoint a Select Committee to .determine their guilt or innocence. If any of these people, born on Australian soil, enjoying all the advantages of this country, sharing its freedom, and participating in its blessings, are proved to' have been disloyal, then the Government may treat them as it pleases. Such people deserve punishment, but let us give them a fair trial.. Let us give them a chance to prove their innocence.",45
227,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Does the honourable member say that no Germans in this country were disloyal during the war?,45
228,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,I make no such statement.,45
229,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,The honourable member's assertions suggest that he does hold that view.,45
230,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Not at all. The honourable member does not appear to be able to grasp the meaning of plain English. I am surprised at such an interjection from one who is usually most charitable in his views and dealings. The Prime Minister on one occasion said in this House, "" I would be the last to deny justice to a citizen of this country because he happened to bear a foreign name or because his father came from Germany."" If the Prime Minister means that, I hope that the Government will not oppose, but will facilitate, the giving of an opportunity to do justice to these people. If they will afford such .an opportunity, that will be a proof that the Prime Minister meant what he said.",45
231,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,He always means what he says.,45
232,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"We all have our own opinions about that. I notice that a writer in Stead's Review, in commenting . upon this matter, did not seem to think that he meant what he said. I believe that there are some members of the Government who are in accord with the statement of the Prime Minister; but, from my experience in battling here for justice for these people, I am disposed to think that they do not number many, and that there are some Ministers who are inclined to penalize a man simply because he has a German name, or has a German father.",45
233,Mr MARR,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Le t the honourable member name them.,46
234,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,I will not name them.,46
235,Mr MARR,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,The honourable member should not make such an allegation against them if he is not prepared to name them.,46
236,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I am asking no favours. I am merely asking for a Select Committee, the members of which can be appointed by this House.",46
237,Mr MARR,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,The honourable member is casting insults upon Ministers.,46
238,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"They can look after themselves, and do not need a baby of the House like the honourable member to do that for them. To my sorrow, I know that they are well able to look after selves, and so I say the honourable member need not worry. They will look after themselves at the right time. I want to come to the point.",46
239,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,It is time the honourable member did so.,46
240,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) is interjecting so frequently that if he is not careful I shall endeavour, as he deserves it , to have my name passed over to him.",46
241,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH," Order ! As a reference has been made by the honourable member to the interjections that are being made, I ask that they shall not continue.",46
242,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I have no wish to be offensive when speaking, but it is a remarkable thing that it should seem to be recognised that whenever I speak in this House any honourable member may have a shot at me, and so prevent my continuing in the even tenor of my way. If they were wise enough to refrain from interjecting, honourable members opposite would find that I should state my case without undue passion. There is no reason why, because I am fathering an unpopular cause, and on a recent occasion did the same thing, I should be subjected to so many interjections and interruptions. Mr ""WEST - It is because you are honest man.",46
243,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Order ! The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) has complained of interjections, and an interjection immediately follows his complaint.",46
244,Mr G ABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I say that some of these people were removed to the internment camps upon suspicion. I am entitled to come to that conclusion from statements which were made by the Prime Minister in this House. I wish to be as fair to him as possible, and, though I may not use his own words, I quote similes which he made use of to show that he considered that it might he necessary sometimes to have people interned on suspicion. The first simile he used was in regard to loyalty to a political party. He said, in effect, that it is very hard to prove disloyalty on the part of an honourable member to his party or his leader; that one might feel sure that a certain man was disloyal, but at the same time it might be very hard to prove it. Whilst there may be some truth them- in that statement, I make bold to say that there is no member of his political party who would be expelled by the Prime Minister or by any leader merely becauso he 6uspected him of disloyalty to the party. I quote the simile used by the Prime Minister as an admission that some of these people, even if there were only two, were interned on suspicion. We know that loyalty to a political party and loyalty to the country in which one is born are not to be compared, and even if only two of these < people who were born in this country were interned on suspicion, I say that they should he given an opportunity to appear before a body in whom they would have confidence, and be given a chance to clear themselves of the stigma cast upon them. Another simile made use of by the Prime Minister was that of a person suspected to be suffering from small-pox or leprosy. The right honourable gentleman said, in effect, "" If a man comes off a boat, a doctOT may say to him, ' I do not know whether you have small-pox or not. 'but I cannot take any risks, and must put you into quarantine on suspicion.'"" I intend to refer to the case of a man suspected of suffering from quite another disease. So far as my knowledge goes, a an sufferer from either small-pox or leprosy is not blameworthy.",46
245,Mr WEST,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,They are dirt diseases.,46
246,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"So far as, my knowledge goes, sufferers from them are not blamethe worthy. A man may contract either of these diseases through no fault of own. To justify the internment of any man, he should be blameworthy; and so I say that a fairer simile to use would the case of a man suffering from disease of syphilis.",47
247,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Oh , no!",47
248,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I do not-want to exhibit any mock modesty in this matter. I wish to treat this question seriously; and I say that it will be a fairer simile take the case of a man suffering from the disease of syphilis, and assume we had in operation a practice which, my opinion, ought to be adopted, and that is the compulsory segregation of them. those suffering from this disease.",47

252,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I am coming to that part. I am merely instancing a simile, and have a right, therefore, to suggest supposititious case. I will suppose that there is a law which provides for the segreinto gation of persons suffering from syphilis, He and that a man may be placed in quaranwith tine on suspicion that he is suffering from the disease.",47
253,Dr EARLE PAGE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,He can be in New South Wales.,47
254,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"This is a serious matter, and I hope that honourable members will treat it seriously. If they fined in an internment tamp, and had had to put up with that indignity unjustly, it would be a serious matter for likes. them. I suppose the case of a man who, when they sent him here. on suspicion that he is suffering from syphilis, is placed in a quarantine with other persons who are there because they are known to have the disease. then suppose the adoption of the procedisloyalty dure of emptying the whole camp upon the public when it is supposed the occuhonorable pants have been cured of the disease. The man .suspected of being a sufferer from the disease is turned out with those who have been cured of it, and no effort is made to clear him of the stigma upon him by his confinement in the quarantine camp. No effort is made to enable him to take up again his true in the least. position in society, and to Testore to him confidence of his wife and family. He is left to come out of the quarantine his camp with a stigma upon him; and I assert that there is no difference between the case of such a man and the case of a be man who, on suspicion, is placed in an the internment camp, and is turned out afterwards with the stigma of disloyalty upon him. That is a fairer simile to suggest than were those used by the Prime Minister, so and, in my view, it indicates the posito tion into which the Government have forced many Australian-born and naturalthat ized people. Honourable members must in see that they come out of the internment camp with the stigma of disloyalty upon",47

256,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"That is what they want to know, and what the Government will not tell them. It is in order to find out what they were interned for that I ask for the appointment of a Select Committee. The Prime Minister in another a statement made in this House clearly showed that some of these people were put the internment camps on suspicion. said, "" I do not think that we made many mistakes."" That statement carries it the admission that the Government did make some mistakes. Of course, we know that they made some mistakes, and I have reason to believe that they made many.",47

258,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The honourable member thinks he can ""chip in "" as much as he The electors made a mistake The point I make is that there must be some of these camp people now in the community who bear the stigma of disloyalty upon them. I The very fact that they feel the stigma of shows that some of them are not disloyal. If a man were disloyal do members think that it would worry him, except, perhaps, in .business, to be called disloyal. I have tested the heartstrings of many of these people, and I know that they suffer intensely at being cast called disloyal to this country.",47
259,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,I should not mind being called disloyal. It would not trouble me,47

261,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"If it were true, of course I should.",48
262,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I thank the honourable member for his interjection. That is just the point. If it were true he would feel it, and I am satisfied that in regard to many of these people who do feel it , the statement that they are disloyal is not true, and this applies particularly to Australian-born persons who were internecT.",48
263,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Does the member say that none of these people were disloyal?,48
264,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,I ask the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) not to interject.,48
265,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I am coming to the close of my remarks. I feel my heart beginning to patter rather fast, and-1 frankly admit that it annoys me to think that there should be some Australian-born men who can sit in this House and show no desire to give to other Australians an opportunity to clear themselves of the stigma of disloyalty. That hurts me. There has been, so far as I know, only one civil inquiry held in regard to these matters. I do not refer to one that was held recently in regard to the deportation of Father Jerger and Dr Hirschfield. I am not. dealing with their case at all. The inquiry to which I refer was held at Loxton. I quoted nearly the whole of the report of that inquiry in a previous speech in this House, and will not inflict it again upon honourable members. But I desire again to bring under their notice the fact that the magistrate holding that inquiry usod these wordsClearly no inference of actual disaffection or disloyalty was to be drawn from the mere fact of internment. That is not any ""gas"" of mine, but the matured verdict of a man trained to receive evidence and weigh the pros and cons. That was the verdict of Mr. Hewitson, who, so far as I know, is a man of entirely British origin.",48
266,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,That settles the honourable member's argument.,48
267,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"If we could get.the people of Australia to think in that way it would be all right; but in regard to certain men I have been told, "" Oh. but he was interned,"" and that statement has been made as if it were a sufficient answer to everything. It is not a sufficient answer; but, unfortunately, it is so regarded by some people in Australia who do not know that certain persons were put into the internment camps on mere suspicion. In regard to the evidence at the inquiry to which I have referred, I quoted the remarks of the Judge on one of the military men who gave evidence. While giving him credit for his war duties, as the man had done good service, the magistrate saidEither his memory was at fault, or he was prepared to make out his case without regard to the truth. honourable That is a serious statement, and judging by the information which has reached me, the same thing has happened in other cases. The time to speak of that is not yet, but if what I have been told in that regard is true, there will not be many people who in future will condemn me for trying to obtain justice for Australian-born subjects. The only inquiry that has been held has related to the cases of two men, both of whom have been cleared of any suspicion. The acquittals to date having been 100 per cent, of the cases tried, surely that is a reason why the House should appoint a Select Committee so that others may have an equal opportunity to clear themselves. Six of the men who are interned in South Australia were justices of the peace. As a rule, men are not appointed to the commission of the peace unless they have proved to be good citizens, although, at times, political influence does enter into these appointments. To me it is remarkable that men who held such a high status in the community should be interned on on the accusation of, I know not whom, and that their own assertions should go for nought. Some of them were arrested in the middle of the night, and immediately swept into the internment camp. The Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie), in answer to an interjection, said that he differentiated between Germans and Australian-horn citizens of German origin. I think we ought to do that, and I ask honourable members, particularly those who fought against the Germans, and who know more of their conduct than I do, to distinguish bet-ween the two classes of people, and vote for the appointment of a Select Committee, so that justice may be done to those who, like themselves, were horn on Australian soil.  second the motion.",48
268,Mr WIENHOLT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Moreton) [5.23]. - I am sorry that this motion has been moved. Had it been proposed by anybody but the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), I should have said that it had been brought forward for the purpose of making political capital out of the cases of interned Germans. I do not make that accusation against the honourable member for Angas, because I give him credit for being as sincere as is any other honourable member in . this House. But the motion is exceedingly useless. The inquiry which is asked for could do no possible good; at the best it could be only expensive and wasteful, whilst it might be positively mischievous. It relates to a matter that is past and done with. I do not think that even the internees, whose cases have been advocated, would thank the honourable member for proposing an inquiry into the reasons for which they were interned. Much of the difference between the honourable member and myself is due to the fact that he is very much more of an optimist than I am. He said that he never felt, at any time during the war, that Australia or the British Empire was in any danger. That view is held by very few honourable members. Perhaps, because the honourable member believed that the British peoples were in no danger, he takes, a different view of the need for internment. To my mind, both Australia and the British Empire were for many years in very grave peril indeed, and while that danger continued internment was a perfectly justifiable precaution. I do not say that it is very pleasant to be interned- I was a prisoner of war for six months-bu t I am sure that the internees in Australia enjoyed very much better conditions than did Australian soldiers who were in the hands of the enemy. When I was made a prisoner of war, I had been slightly wounded in the hip; my experience commenced with a thirty-days' march without any halt. Only twice during that time was my wound dressed at all. Then for nearly three months it received no ""attention, because tlusre was no doctor in the camp. At night the wound adhered to the mattress because I had neither sheet nor blankets. I am not complaining about the treatment; it was all in the game of war, and my hardships were light, compared with those suffered by others. But I think it is ridiculous to endeavour to arouse sympathy for the men who were interned in Australian camps. They, at any rate, knew when and where they would get their next meal; they were reasonably certain that next day they would be sitting at the mess table as usual. That is more than was known by the soldiers serving at the Front. Internment was a necessary precaution during war time, but I admit that it should not in - itself be regarded as absolute proof of disloyalty. I have already fought that battle, and I would take strong exception to the Government saying that internment in itself is definite proof of a man's disloyalty and sufficient reason for his deportation. In regard to that matter we ought to act carefully. One case in which I have taken a good deal of interest has brought upon me a good deal of blame; in fact, I am not sure that I - have not incurred thereby, even myself, a suspicion of disloyalty. But when I went to the Prime Minister and asked that before deportation the man's case should be reviewed he was perfectly fair. The case was reviewed in the manner we requested, and one must abide by the result. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) and I both represent electorates which include a large number of persons who were either horn in . Germany and came to Australia as children or young men, or are the descendants of such. I have previously made plain my position in regard to them, and that attitude I shall never alter. But the honourable member for Angas has admitted that the feelings which were aroused during the war are cooling down, and I ask him whether it is not better, instead of stirring up and perpetuating bitter feelings which will lead to that most abominable thing in a British community-racia l bitternesswhich, wherever it asserts itself, weakens the Empire, that we should realise that th© had years are past, and now help all sections of the community to live together in friendliness and unity as fellow-Australians and British subjects.  [5.32] - A few months ago, when this inatter was raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), I availed myself of the opportunity to express my sentiments. I cannot understand why the motion should have been referred to by the mover as unpopular. I do not admit that it is. If it be unpopular to give justice where justice is due it is a bad state of affairs for the country. Any unpopularity that surrounds this endeavour on the part of the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) can be due only to misrepresentation of the subject. The mere wording of the resolution is sufficient to disarm all suspicion and feeling. Honourable members opposite have interjected regarding the war services of honourable members on this side who are supporting the request for this inquiry. I believe that those remarks were made in a jocular spirit. ' It is quite irrelevant whether those who support the motion served at the Front or not. As for the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, I do not think he touched the matter at all. He said it was past and done with, and that it should be allowed to rest. That is all very well from his point of view. Perhaps the attitude of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) in regard to this subject, from the beginnirrg, may be such that he does not want it resurrected. I will say no more with respect to that; but this matter is not done with. In the interests of justice, it is not going to be allowed to rest. In the interests of fair play to these people, who are living in Australia under a cloud, having a stigma upon them, it is not going to be dropped. I ask the honourable member for Moreton how this subject can be regarded as past and done with in the eyes of those who have been treated, not as Australian-born citizens, but as lepers, or worse? This motion asks, among other things, that any native-born or naturalized subject who, by statutory declaration, affirms that he has reasonable grounds for believing his internment to have been the result of untruthful information, maliciously furnished, shall have the circumstances investigated.",49
269,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,He can secure that now. It has never heen refused to one who has taken that stand.  statement is absolutely unfounded.,50
270,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,There has not been a case in regard to which such a request has been made that has not been inquired into. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) did not cite a single case in which an inquiry was demanded.,50
271,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"It is useless to demand an inquiry.  the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr. Hector Lamond) says is true, there can be no objection to the appointment of a Select Committee.' When this subject ill - was originally before the House, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said he had no objection to the proposition. Today I expect to hear a favourable reply from the Government. I have received letters concerning men who were interned, who are prepared to make statutory declarations in. regard to their innocence, and who claim an inquiry. If names are wanted, I will furnish them. I have one case, particularly, in mind. It is that of an Australian-born citizen of the second generation who was a district councillor. While occupying that position, he promulgated the most comprehensive scheme for the repatriation of soldiers that has yet come under my notice. During the war, he went on the public platform and advocated enlistment. He and his family have subscribed to the war loans in generous fashion. However, there are always some people who bear enmity against their neighbours. The Prime Minister has stated that among the internees were some who found themselves there because of information supplied hy the secret service. In the district to which I am referring, the secret service was represented by men who bore personal enmity against this Australian-born councillor. His accusers were animated by motives of personal spleen. They made false statements, and their victim was interned as a result. That is his firm belief today. The Prime Minister himself has said it is possible that mistakes were made.",50

275,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I do not think that is the whole case.  give the whole case. He was not allowed - to tender any evidence to refute the charges upon which he had been in terned. Those charges were never made known. known to him . Even today he does not know what they are. He saw that the only thing open to him was to f u r nish evidence of his acts of loyalty; so he provided it . H is scheme of repatriation was placed before the authorities. It was shown, on his behalf, that he taken part in recruiting campaigns, and it was proved that he and his family had subscribed liberally to war loans. All this, however, was of no use. The one thing for which he bad asked tihat the charges levelled against might be made known; but he was i formed that no inquiry would be .^ranted, and that no statement concernhe the reverse. ing charges would be made. That'is the whole case.",51
276,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"No ; there another chapter.  the honourable member will have an To portunity to make known that other chapter. An inquiry was refused. At to in - some later period a number of returned men from his district presented themy selves to me, and asked me to.introduce them as a deputation to the Prime Min(Mr Hughes) in order that they might elicit the nature of the charges - made against their interned neighbour. We waited upon the Prime Minister, and to the returned soldiers made reference to At the have conclusion of the deputation, I said to Mr Hughes, "" Do I understand that this man must go down to the grave guilty. without ever knowing what charge was The Prime M in ister replied. "" That is so."" Comparathe tively recently this man presented himDeself as a candidate for election to the of local shire council, but he found himself the victim of the stigma which is to now and always hanging over his head. Yet the honourable member for Moreton would says, "" Let the stigma remain.""",51

279,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"By the people - on the spot, where all the facts are t  due to the stigma, which, he asserts, is absolutely unfounded, but which, apparently, he may never remove. The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr . had Lamond), I feel sure, will not say in hiscalm moments that if this man and others of his neighbours are innocent they should never be given an opportunity to prove it . Whether it was were popular or not I shall always hi m be found taking exactly the same n - stand as I do today. But, so far from being unpopular, it ought to Surely it .ought to be a privilege for every member to take his stand on the side of justice and fair isplay in a country that prides itseK upon its liberty-loving principles. The honormember for I l l a w a r r a has urged opthat no cases have been cited. I will now quote the case of another man who was interned, and therefore was interested in the deputation to the Prime Minister. This man had a son at the Front. He volunteered this information, or it was supplied on his hehalf at the time of his arrest, but owing, no doubt to the underhand methods employed, and because of personal animus of members of the secret service, amongst whom the man lived, it was some considerable time before he could get this simple statement of fact through to the Defence Department. He now has in his possession a letter from the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), to show that when it became known to the Defence authorities that he had a son at the Front, he was released, and admitting that if it had been known at the time he would not have been interned.",51
280,Mr BRENNAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"That is the first instance I have heard of the Defence Department listening to reason.  tunately, it took a long time for that simple statement to reach the authorities; whereas, if everything had been above board ' it should have been known next day.",52
281,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"It was largely his own fault at the beginning that it was not known.  orable member is wrong, because the statement was made at the time of his arrest. The honourable .member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) might he quite right in affirming that some people deserved to be interned, but I am not dealing with that aspect of the matter at all. I say that if for good reasons 1,000 were interned, surely there could be no objection to an effort being made to secure justice for a tenth of that number if they believed they had been interned wrongly. Quite a number of these people declare that 'they know of no reason for their internment, and, naturally, they feel the stigma that at"" taches to them. They are suffering in business and public life because of it, and they believe that if they had an opportunity of submitting their oases before a. proner tribunal they would be able to prove their innocence. I regret to think that even one member of this House would say that such men are not entitled to a chance to answer such a charge. I do not want to labour the question, and so I will conclude by saying that I believe many of them are suffering an injustice, and that they were interned because of false reports furnished to the authorities by other residents animated by personal bias. I have ample evidence to prove this statement right up to the hilt, and it is 'the duty of this House, and particularly of every honourable member who saw active service at the Front, in what he regarded as 'the fight for liberty and fair play, to see that fellow citizens-becaus e many of these interned men are Australian-born citizens-ge t that British fair play for which they fought.",52
282,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Darwin) T5.55] - Ver y few words will suffice to put my view of the question. The honourable member who submitted the motion made an appeal for justice on behalf of Australian-horn citizens who were interned during the war period, and he made a special appeal, as did the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, to those who have served overseas. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) made some veiled accusations of ill-treatment of internees, but when I asked him, by way of interjection, to cite a case, he said he would defer doing so to a later date, giving as his reason his belief that some of these people were afraid to come forward and tell what they knew.  that my cases are pretty genuine.",52
283,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"If there were any evidence of ill-treatment of Australian-born citizens of German parentage, or even of German birth, during the war period, no appeal to honourable members for the appointment of a Select Committee would be made in vain.",52
284,Mr NICHOLLS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,We will give you plenty of evidence.,52
285,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The mover of the motion alleged ill-treatment, but presented no evidence of it, so the whole matter simply resolves itself into a complaint that some people were interned on suspicion, and that, therefore, a Select Committee should be appointed to inquire into their loyalty or disloyalty. I take the view, however, that it is very hard, at this stage, to prove .any man's loyalty. There was a time when it was easy enough to do that. There was ample opportunity during the war for every man to show where he stood. The question now is-Were the Government of the day justified in interning Australian-born citizens of German parentage on suspicion?",52
286,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Certainl y not.,53
287,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,I say they were justified.,53
288,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Not on suspicion.,53
289,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The British, as a race, have always been inclined to be trustful rather than suspicious; but during the recent war there was plenty of evidence to prove that the Government were perfectly justified in interning any one upon reasonable grounds for suspicion.",53
290,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,You are qualifying ill-treatment. your statement now.,53
291,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,It was a reasonable precaution to take.,53
292,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Surely the honourable member can distinguish between "" reasonable "" ground for suspicion and mere suspicion.",53
293,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Exactly . And most people believe that the Government, when interning these people, had reasonable ground for suspicion.  those men came to you and said he believed he had been wrongfully interned, would you give him a chance to prove his case?",53
294,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Yes . He has a chance now. Wlhile the mover of the motion was speaking, I made an interjection that I would not have minded had I been charged with disloyalty. There was no possible chance of that. Likewise, many young men of German parentage had no fear of the charge during the war; but I know that many people of German parentage, whose sons were at the Front, were openly disloyal, and avowed that they would never recognise their sons again. In the face of all this, it is a peculiar argument that the presence of a son at the Front should have heen regarded as the test of a man's loyalty. - Mr Considine - Almos t as peculiar as the argument that a certain gentleman in Victoria, with a D.S.O. decoration, should now be charged with disloyalty.",53
295,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Exactly . A man might have the D.S.O. and still be distinctly disloyal.,53
296,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Then , your going to the Front was no proof of your loyalty. Mr BELL.:- I had no need to go to the Front to prove my loyalty. Some people would need to go to the Front many times, and still they would be under suspicion. It is, as I have said, difficult now for men who were interned to prove their loyalty, so there is very good reason to believe that the motion has been introduced for the purpose of getting another little stab at the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Therefore, the House would not be justified in supporting it, especially as the honourable member who submitted it intimated that, at somo future date, he is going to bring forward another motion, and cite cases of gross  tion is not carried.",53
297,Mr BELL,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"We might very well defer the appointment of a Select Committee until such time as we get some definite charges. If , by any chance, the occupants of the Opposition benches had ibeen in power during the war, I doubt very much if they would now appoint a Select Committee upon the evidence subof mitted to the House. I would have been very much surprised also if , during the war, they had not taken some action, such as they now condemn, to intern people of German parentage on suspicion of disloyalty.",53
298,Mr LAZZARINI,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Werriwa) [6.5] - I support the motion for a Select Committee to inquire into the whole of the conditions' of the internment camps from the commencement of the war. I do so because, in my opinion, the camps were very often used in order to get rid of people who were undesirable in the eyes of the powers that be. There has possibly been quite enough said about internees of German origin-of both the first and second generation-and I rise in order to say a word on behalf of an Australian born of Scottish parents, who, in spite of his nationality, was put into an internment camp. I refer to J. M . Scott, a gentleman who wrote a book entitled The Circulating Sovereign. He was born, as I say, of Scottish parents in New South Wales, and was detained in an internment camp for a period which may have ranged up to one year and eight months; and to this day he does not know why. I desire the appointment of a' Select Committee in order that this case may be inquired into. This man was resident, I understand, in a little town in South Australia, where he was grabbed by the military police, whirled away in a motor car, and put into a concentration camp, and none of his friends knew where he was. If this were the only case of the kind during the whole period of the war - the only case of a man being spirited away-it is sufficient to justify an exhaustive inquiry. Otherwise, which of us is safe, in view of the policy followed by the Nationalist and capitalistic Governments throughout the world, to whom the war was due? It is possible that we may have another war shortly, and we must look to the future, so as to know where wa stand. Honourable members may not be acquainted.with this particular case, but I had the facts from the man concerned; and, under all the circumstances, no Government dare refuse an inquiry. This man, Scott, is an intensely loyal man; but in the work I have mentioned he advocated a principle inimical to the interests of the banking and other great financial institutions of the country. He is gifted with a brain for finance excelled, perhaps, by very few meni in Australia, and he put forth' a system of financial administration by which the Commonwealth could have met the cost of warlike operations without taxing the people to the extent of l d .",53
299,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Do you suggest that that was the reason he was interned?,54
300,Mr LAZZARINI,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I do suggest Lhat. and I shall continue to believe it to be the fact until a Select Committee proves the contrary. Further, though I cannot prove the statement, it is my opinion he was put there in order to be silenced, as he was, for a period of something like one year and eight months. When the war was over, and the conditions altered, he was given his freedom, being considered no longer dangerous. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) says that enemy subjects, and other suspected persons, were treated much better in the camps in Australia than others in similar positions were treated in the camps in other countries. That is quite possible.",54
301,Mr WIENHOLT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,I spoke of prison camps.,54
302,Mr LAZZARINI,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"But this man, although intensely loyal, was sent into camp While there, in the course of argument with some German internees, one of the latter asked him if he believed, all he read in the newspapers about the German atrocities. He replied in the affirmative, and then the Germans said to him, ""There is one thing that the Germans have not done; they have never interned a German subject along with enemy subjects."" That, Scott informed me, squashed him - h e was beaten. This man, at any rate, is a British subject, and if he made disloyal statements, he was entitled to a trial; but, failing a trial, an inquiry such as that now proposed would satisfy me. A large number of people in the country no doubt believe that this man had done something to justify this detention; but I say that he was deliberately put into camp in order to silence him, because the principles he was j > h in g were reac right up against the principles of financial and banking institutions in all the nations of the world during the war. These institutions have their grip on the economic arrangements and conditions in all countries, and are possessed of great power; hut I repeat that this man was out on an intensely patriotic mission, - trying to prove that financial arrangements could be made to meet the cost of the war without taxation-that we could, as the British have done in the past, conduct the war without adding a penny to the national debt, and thus save the £25,000,000 or £30,000,000 of taxation necessary to meet our interest bill. I am not satisfied that Mr Scott's is the only case of the kind, and I only know of his case because I happened to be acquainted with him, and, brushing up against him, was given the facts. For all I know, there may be hundreds of similar cases. It is, to say the least, disquieting to think that, when passions are roused, as they were during the war, some interests have to be safeguarded, even if it means sacrificing the liberty of British subjects; and if any honourable member says that this case is not one for inquiry, he is ignorant of the elementary laws of justice.",54
303,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Barrier) [6.15] - In supporting the motion I wish to say that very few of the details are within my own knowledge. I have noticed, however, that in Stead's Review certain articles were allowed to appear from time to time without any representations from the Government or the authorities concerned. One statement in particular was that it was only on representations made by the Swiss Consul or the American Consul, before America entered the war, that alterations were made in the treatment of prisoners in the internment camps. I know no more than do other honourable members who have spoken of what were the conditions which prevailed in the camps; but it is within our knowledge that in the press of Australia, especially the Sydney press, statements were made concerninathe use of machjneguns at Holdsworthy Camp. In reference to that matter no report has ever been asked for in this Parliament. I have in my possession a statement signed by, I think, a captain in the German Navy who was interned at Holdsworthy. We know that according to international arrangements officers of certain rank, when prisoners of war, are not to be asked to do certain kinds of menial work; but because this man refused to obey some orders he was ill-fcreated. I do not know whether his statement is true; but, according to him, he was blindfolded and taken by a firing party near to a grave which had been dug. He was told that he was to be shot, and placed with his back against the tree. He 3till refused to do what was required of him, and the rifles were clicked. Then the bandage was taken from his eyes, and the officer in charge of the squad saying, "" Y o u are a brave man,"" shook hands with him ",54

308,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"-The Minister does not believe that I believe the statement; but such allegations have been allowed to go unchallenged, thus showing that they have a substratum of fact. It is up to the »Government to say whether these statements are true.",55
309,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,The Assistant Minister for Defence says that they are not,55
310,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"He has not even seen the document to which I refer. The Government were quick enough to use the powers conferred upon them, by the War Precautions Act to suppress Stead's War Facts. They acted in the same way in regard to other publications. Only into-night's Herald I read that they are so much perturbed about the importation of German hymn-books and bibles into Australia that they have imposed a prohibition upon them.",55
311,Mr MARR,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,That has nothing to do with the management of our internment camps.,55
312,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,It shows the feeling that is behind this business.,55
313,Mr JOWETT,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Has the honourable member read what is published into-night's Herald about the Bolsheviks?,55
314,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The - honourable member will get more about the Bolsheviks than he wishes to hear. By proclamation in the Comm.onwealth Gazette, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) has prohibited the admission to the Commonwealth of bibles, prayer-books, and hymn-books printed in the German language and intended for use in the Lutheran Church unless his consent to their importation has been previously obtained. Yet no honourable member will affirm that the safety of Australia, would be in any way endangered by the importation of the ""good old book"" printed in German. The action of the Minister, however, would lead us to believe that if elderly people are allowed to sing Lutheran hymns, or to offer prayers in German, the foundations of the Empire will be sapped. All this only goes to show the spirit of intolerance which possesses the Government. was Those who are so fond of telling us about the fights for religious freedom, andwho put Luther upon a - pedestal as a pioneer in that connection, are today preventing Luther's countrymen from reading his The idea is absurd and preposterous. When the.

316,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Enoug h has already been said to show the necessity for an inquiry into the conduct of our intern-ment camps. I come now to the treatment of internees and to the need which exists for investigating the circumstances connected with the internment of certain persons. While I was in Sydney some time ago the wife of the gentleman whose case has been mentioned by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) called upon me concerning the internment of her husband. She assured me that the whole of their family were intensely loyal, and at no period had there been the r slightest suspicion cast upon their loyalty. Yet her husband had been interned apparently for the heinous offence of advocating a different financial policy fro m that propounded by the then Treasurer of the Commonwealth.",55

323,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"It is immaterial to me whether these persons were interned by a Labour Government or by a Government composed of ex-Labour men and ex-Liberals, or even of members of the Country party. The question which has t a be decided is, "" Are the Government prepared to have this matter inquired into with a view to righting any wrong which may have been done?"" The Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) cannot shirk the responsibility of the Government by saying, "" Please, sir, we did not do these things j they were done by somebody else."" Ministers are now in a position to right the wrong which has been done to certain individuals. Not only were Germans, who were the enemies of the Empire, treated in the way that has been described, but the Government acted in just as arbitrary a fashion towards their allied Italian subjects. At the dictation of the Italia n Consul, they seized men whilst they were at their work in the mines at Broken Hill , and sent them by rail to the nearest port, without even first allowing them to see their wives and families.",56

I realise the necessity for the provision in its relation to greasers and firementhey must make a start sometime-bu t the"" position of a shipwright or ship's carpenter is too important to entitle those who may have been engaged in the occupation for a limited period only to be rated as shipwright or ship's carpenters when the A ct begins to operate. - Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [ 8 . 5 ] - I have gone very carefully into the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) last night, and find that the objection raised b}' shipwrights to the inclusion of ships' carpenters arose originally out of the dispute between two unions, both of which have members going to sea, and that the amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition would prevent a large number of seafaring men who have followed their occupation all their lives, and are now serving on the coast of Australia, from continuing to follow the same calling. The amendment to section 39 of the principal Act, - as set out in this clause, is really consequential on an amendment to schedule 2 of the Act, which was authorized by the Leader of the Opposition when he was in charge of the Navigati'-n Bill introduced by the Pisher Government and was effected in the Senate. There was quite a long fight on the question of whether ships' carpenters should be included or not. Eventually they but were included. If the amendment of section 39 of the principal Act is not made as set out in this clause, these carpenters will be prevented from following their occupation. My advisers have gone into the matter carefully. .Captai n Davis, who has had a life-long experience, tells me that the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, if agreed to, would prevent ships' carpenters who have been engaged in their occupation for the whole of their working lives from following their calling in future .",56
328,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Melbourne Ports) [8.9] - If there should be any delay in the proclamation of this measure when it is passed, any person who becomes a ship's carpenter in the meantime will be entitled to be rated as a ship's carpenter, although he may not fulfil the requirements of the proposed sub-section 5, which demands that before he may receive his certificate he must have served for three years at sea in the capacity of ship's carpenter - In other words, the Bill provides a certain qualification, and at once proceeds to take it away. In the following clause we give power tto a superintendent, before whom a seaman is engaged, to refuse to enter him as A . B . , O.S., greaser, fireman, shipwright, or ship's carpenter unless he can give satisfactory proof of his title to be so rated. The giving of such full powers to a superintendent is a further entrenchment on the rights of seamen. A superintendent might have peculiar views; he might allow a person who has only had five minutes' experience before the coming into operation of the A ct to be rated as a shipwright or ship's carpenter. The seamen, have their rights.",57

330,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,It is no protection to the seamen to allow a person with five minutes' experience in the calling before the proclamation of the Act to be rated as a ship's carpenter.,57

In many cases that may be quite proper, but we ask that certificates of competency shall be granted to those who are capable of doing the work. We have decided that captains, officers, and engineers must pass examinations to prove their competency, to but, by the vote just given, the Committion tee has determined that anybody may be effect he anticipates. considered good enough to fill the position of shipwright or ship's carpenter.

The provision under which a discharge or cerof tificate showing the right to be rated the capacity in which the man desires be shipped is to be struck out. Of course, there are penalties for the use of a disments charge by a person to whom it does belong; but we know that many diseverything charges are used by men to whom they do not belong. We weaken the law by enacting that all that a seaman need produce is a discharge from his last ship. In another clause we provide that men must do certain work elsewhere before they can be rated as firemen or greasers.",60
351,Mr GREGORY,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,You know this is the usual practice. We must protect the men already engaged.,60
352,Mr TUDOR,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"That is done, but not by this clause. All the Minister is doing by this clause is to provide that if a man is discharged it need not be shown on that discharge that he is competent. If the clause is carried, there will not be one word in section 40 of the Act as to the competency or ability of the man to perform the duty. The section as it now stands is very much better. It is absolutely hopeless to propose an amendment to provide that the man shall be competent. Even if I moved to re-insert the words standing in the old Act as passed by this Parliament, I would be defeated. The Minister has only to say that he in tends to pass the clause as it stands, and the majority will support him , whether it means allowing incompetent men to do the work or not. In order to test the feeling of the Committee, I move That the words "" or certificate showing his right to be rated in the capacity in which he desires to be shipped,"" be left out.",60

What the principal A ct proB u t vided was that the man had to present a discharge or certificate. This meant that if he had the certificate he need not have It is most desirable that in all cases where a seaman applies for enon gagement he should present his - discharge from his last ship. The intention the clause is to make it perfectly clear in that in every case he must present his to discharge from his last ship at the time he seeks engagement. The other amend of the Act which have already been not agreed to by this Committee secure that is required in regard to ihe competency of tliose who are shipped. All that is being done by this clause is to make perfectly clear what was really in tended when the Act was passed.",60
354,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Melbourne Ports) [8.50] - A man may present a discharge as a carpenter, shipwright, or even an A . B . , when as a fact he has not actually served in the capacity mentioned. If an cwner thinks fit, he may give a steward a discharge showing that he had been an able seaman. Under this clause, that steward would not need to present a certificate to show what he really was.",61
355,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"In any case, the seaman who was rated in that way would not have a certificate.",61
356,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The seamen have exactly the same objection, so far as the discharge is concerned. Unless a man has to show some proof of competency, owners can take on any man they like.

This clause will, I believe, save trouble. In times of trouble, owners sometimes get so-called loyalists and others who are not f u l ly qualified to do the work, but, if they have to pay those men the same rate as skilled workmen, they will not have very much to do with the loyalists.

Section proposed to be amended :(1) Where the service of any seaman terminates before the period contemplated in his agreement, by reason of the wreck or loss of the ship, he shall be entitled to wages up to the time of such termination of service only. . . . .",61
364,Mr TUDOR,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Y a r r a ) [8.56] - As a rule articles are signed for about twelve months, and sometimes a period is specified in addition to the trip . The clause curtails the amount which a man can receive after the ship has been wrecked. Even if the wreck occurs on the other side of the world, the wages of the seaman will cease within a month. Complaints have been made that, even in the case of some of the Commonwealth line of ships, men were landed owing to illness at other-ports, and their wages ceased after a certain time. The shipowner should be compelled to bring the man hack to his port if he so desires. If the wreck takes place on the American coast, the man may prefer to go to some port in England, as that may be the nearest way home for him, but we should not cut his pay short at one month after the wreck. I should like to hear from the Minister why the time has been curtailed. It should be remembered that a seaman may lose everything he possesses if the ship is wrecked. We should make the period three months, or, if the man is brought hack to his home port before three months have ©lapsed, we might provide that the pay should cease on his arrival.",61
365,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.59] - This is a new provision and a new departure. It very often happened that the wreck took place near the port where the service terminated. Thus a man engaged for a voyage"" to England, and his service terminated on his arrival in England, but he was wrecked somewhere in the Channel. The ship-owner was in that case compelled to pay his wages only for a day or two. In this clause, - we are doing two things: we are throwing on the ship-owner the liability to take the man either to the port to which he was shipped under his original agreement, OT to bring him back home, or to some other port mutually agreed upon. We are bhrowing that obligation - on the shipowner. ""We are also throwing on him the obligation to pay the seamen's wages for one month. As far as we have been able to ascertain, there is no similar provision in any other navigation law.",62
366,Mr TTTDOB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Is not the provision taken from the Merchant Seamen's A ct 1894? The marginal note suggests that it is. .,62
367,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"That part of the clause which provides for - the payment of a month's wages is nob. My information is fchab an examination of the navigation with laws' of the world shows that, as far as word ' three."" 1 can be ascertained, the general practice, with one exception, is for a seaman's wages to terminate at the time of the wreck. The exception is in the case of the German Seamen's Law of. 1902, which provides thab where a ship is wrecked or lost the seamen shall he entitled to reconveyance to the port of departure or to receive proportionate compensation, and, in. addition, to a continuance of their wages at one-half the original rate for the time occupied in their re-conveyance. Generally speaking, the provision for the payment of a full month's wages will , I think, cover almost every case. At the same time, it will prevent men straying away from .means of reconveyance home, and will not throw on the ship-owners a greater obligation than is necessary in the circumstances. It is a liberal provision. As ib is a new departure, I suggesb that the Committee agree to it , so that we may see how itworks.",62
368,Mr GABB,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Angus) [ 9 . 5 ] - I also feel that the period should be extended from one to three months. Where a shipwreckod sailor could be returned to the port of engagement within a month, the clause; as ib stands, would work very well; hub I would remind the Committee that some time ago one of the Commonwealth line of steamers, while on a voyage from South or No r th America, was - wrecked on an island in the South Pacific, where the men remained for some considerable bime. Under the clause as it stands, in buch a case, the seamen would not only have to endure the privations attaching to life in an outlandish place, but would receive only one month's wages from the date of shipwreck, even if six months elapsed before they were returned bo their home porb, or to the port of departure. The shipping companies would not be penalized-by the extension of bhir provision from one to three months. If a shipwrecked crew were conveyed home wibhin a month, there would be an end to the matter; on the other hand, if three months elapsed before they were returned, then, since they were engaged on the work of the company at the time of the disaster and were disadvantaged by the wreck, they should receive their wages in respect of thab period.

369,Mr MAHONY,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Dalley) [9.8.]-The Minister in charge of the Bill (Mr. Greene) might Very well agree to this amendment which, in effect, will not do more than what he is endeavouring to accomplish by his original proposal. His desire is that seamen who are wrecked shall be paid their wages until they are returned to the port of engagement, the port of discharge, or such other port as may be mutually agreed upon. clause ' provides that the owners of the .shipwrecked vessel shall convey the seamen to one of these ports, and pay them their wages for a period of one month while they are proceeding to their home port. In laying down that principle, we should endeavour to make it effective. Why not put the matter beyond doubt in the way proposed by the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) ? A sailor might be shipwrecked at a point from which he could not he returned to the port of engagement or discharge, within less than three months. Is a sailor such circumstances to be left without sustenance for two out of the three months ' Mr MARRS.;-Would not sub-section 2 of the section to be amended, which deals with men who are engaged for the round run, cover that point?",63
370,Mr MAHONY,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I think not. Tho proviso to this clause governs the whole matter. Under it, even if it took the owners of a shipwrecked vessel six mouths or eight months to return the crew to one of the ports mentioned, they would not have to pay the men more than one month's wages. I amconfident that the Committee desires to do the fair thing by these men, and the mercantile marine ask for nothing more. By agreeing to this amendment, the Minister will not give away anything. It provides foT the payment of wages for a period not exceeding three months, so that if that period were exceeded in returning a shipwrecked crew to their home port they would not receive, more than three months' pay - The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Marks) has an intimate knowledge of seafaring matters, and is able to speak of the privations and hardships to which British seamen are subjected. disaster overtakes a ship, the lives of the passengers depend upon the skill, bravery, and coolness of the seamen, and surely it is not asking too much to demand that this meed of justice shall be done them.",63
371,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Melbourne Ports) [9.12] - It is evident that this clause has been inserted in the Bill because the Minister recognises that it is unfair that shipwrecked seamen shall receive no wages from the time of the wreck until their return' home. It is unreasonable to expect them and their families to live un The air.,63
372,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Our object in introducing this provision in the Bill was to remedy an injustice. At the same time, we are trying to safeguard the position. The amendment would probably do an injustice to the other side.",63
373,Mr MATHEWS,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The erew of the John Murray, when she was wrecked, were stranded for many a month. Why should shipwrecked sailors and their families be expected to live without pay? There are parts of the coast of Western Australia in from which it would not be possible to return a shipwrecked crew to their home port within two months. The industry should be called upon to carry the charges necessary to keep a shipwrecked sailor until he is returned to his home port. ' Having recognised the principle that shipwrecked seamen should be provided for, why should we stop at the payment of one month's wages ?",63
374,Mr CONSIDINE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Barrier) [9.14] - I support the amendment. The Minister (Mr Greene) stated that, in introducing this provision, he was actuated by a desire to prevent injustice to the seamen, and later on he said that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) might do an injustice to the ship-owners. Surely the honourable gentleman must recognise that an injustice would be done to shipwrecked seamen if they were allowed only one month's wages in cases where they could not be returned to their home port within that period. The amendment would do no injustice to the ship-owners. If it takes six weeks to return the seaman to his home port, then, although the Minister claims to be seeking justice for the seaman, the latter will When be penalized, and the shipping company will be saved expense to the extent of a fortnight's wages for the man. If . the amendment is not agreed to, the only persons penalized will be the seamen of a - wrecked vessel. I hope that the good sense of honourable members generally will secure the carrying of the amendment.",63
375,Mr CHARITON,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"Hunter) [9.16] J feel inclined to oppose the proviso alto- home port. gether. I think it is quite unnecessary. Even if the Committee agreed to the amendment, injustice might be done to seamen under this proviso. A seaman engaged for a certain voyage might be shipwrecked at some remote place, and forced to take refuge upon an island. He might have to remain for a considerable time before a passing vessel could be used to carry him to his port of discharge, or the port at which he was engaged. such circumstances, why should the period for which the owner of the ship is held to be liable to pay wages to the seamen be confined to a month, or, for that matter, to three months, or any other period? In my opinion, the ship-owner should be called upon to provide against this risk just as he is called upon to pro- Bill. vide against expenditure under the Employers' Liability Act. I think there should be no limitation as to the period, in these circumstances, for which the ship-owner should be liable to pay the seamen's wages. It should be held that a seaman engages until such time as he reaches his port of discharge, or is returned to his home port; and in the case of shipwreck, his wages should be continued until he has reached one or other of those ports. Mr CoNsroiNE - The honourable member should see that without some such provision a seaman marooned on an island in the way he has suggested would get nothing during the period between the wreck, of the vessel and his return to his home port, or to his port of discharge.",64
376,Mr CHARLTON,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"My point is that there should be no limitation of the period provided for, and it would be better, in my view, to omit the proviso altogether than to deliberately do an injustice to seamen in the circumstances. A seaman may be five or six months away from his home because of some accident to his ship over which neither he nor his skipper may have had any control. Is the seaman and his family to suffer in consequence? The* family of a seaman should not be made to suffer because their breadwinner is out of employment through [108] shipwreck.

381,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,No ; we are inserting such a provision for the first time in this,64
382,Mr TUDOR,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,Was not a similar provision to this passed by the Senate in 1914?,64
383,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I think not. I think that this is an entirely new provision. Part of it , I am sure, is new. I decided to introduce this particular provision first of all throwing upon the ship-owners the obligation to land the seaman at the port to which, under his agreement, he was going, or at such other port as might be mutually agreed upon between him and the master of the vessel, or to return him to his home port. In the next place, I decided that the ship-owners should be called upon, in such circumstances as are set out in the clause, to pay the seamen full wages for a period not exceeding on6 month. The reason why that period was decided' upon is that it is conceivable that a shipwrecked seaman might be landed at a port within a week's sail from Australia, and a vessel by which he could return to Australia might call at that port next day. The representatives of the ship-owners might tell the seaman that he could go back to Australia by that boat, and his passage would be paid. The man might say that that did not suit him, and if he knew that he would receive full wages for three months he might wait for three months before he found a vessel that would suit him.",64
384,Mr MAHONY,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"If the Minister will look at paragraph a he will find that that could not be done. It is at the option of the master, and the seaman has no option at all .",64
385,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"The conveyance of the seaman to the port of engagement or the port of discharge is what - the master of the vessel has to decide, but the clause does not provide that the master shall decide by what ship the seaman shall go to either port. In view of the length of the average voyage of vessels between Australia and other parts of the world, it seemed to me that to throw upon the ship-owners the obligation to pay the seamen full wages for a month was, in the circumstances, a fair compromise. I do not say that in every case under this provision the seaman would secure all that he was entitled to, but in some cases he might secure more, and I consider that a fair compromiss is proposed by the proviso as it stands.",65

I suggest to the honourable member for Hunter that he might move the omission of the first part of the proviso, and if that amendment were defeated it would still be possible to make the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Angas. I do not mind the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) saying that I was responsible for piloting the original measure through this House. That happened eight years ago, and if the Minister or any one else submits an amendment which I regard as an improvement upon any measure I was responsible for passing, I am prepared to welcome it . The Bill now before the Committee is an improvement upon the original Act in some respects, but it also contains some clauses which I do not regard as improvements.

That shows that under the Act as it at present stands a seaman is entitled under his agreement, notwithstanding what may happen to the ship, to full pay until he reaches the place at which he is to be discharged .",65
389,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"That applies only to men engaged for the run . There is no - I agree such provision applying to men employed under agreement. The provision with respect to men engaged by the ru n still stands. Mr CHART/TON - That is to say that if a seaman engaged by the run is shipwrecked and held up for a considerable time, it may be for a couple of months, he is entitled to full pay under the section I have quoted; but if a seaman is working under an agreement, and is shipwrecked, it is proposed, under the clause now under consideration, that he shall not be entitled to more than one month's wages, though he may have been six months earning them. The seaman who is under agreement and is shipwrecked may be detained in some foreign place for two or three months, but he will receive only one month's pay. Even the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Angas would allow him only a maximum of three months' pay. That is an injustice to seamen, who are just as much entitled to protection as is any man working ashore.

The seamen cannot "" sponge,"" as the Minister suggests, and I resent his insinuation that they would attempt .to do so. If the seamen refused the conveyance offered by the ship-owners, they would do so at the risk of their wages. The Minister has cast a slur upon the seamen by suggesting that, in order to draw pay for a couple of months, they would refuse the chance of a prompt return to their homes and loved ones. He apparently fears that AYES. an injustice might be done to the shipowners. Even if the men did "" sponge "" in the way he suggests, the extent of the loss to the companies would be only a couple of months' wages for a few men. Such a loss would not be comparable with the injustice that would be inflicted upon men who were left for some weeks in a foreign country without pay.

Vessels engaged in the coastal trade sometimes have a run of 800 miles, or, counting the return journey, 1,600 miles. This would take well over a week, and I say it is not right that men engaged on such vessels should be denied the necessary conveniences and decencies of life.

If the first port of call is Broome, and the next one Fremantle, then the Deputy Director may order that the inquiry be held at the latter place.

It charges the League with profiteering in the distribution of this tweed, and it suggests that its distribution should take place through the Repatriation Department, in order that every soldier may have the right to apply to the sub-branch in his own particular by agreement. district for a supply of it .",71
436,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,N Sydney-Assistant Minister for Defence) [10.38] - I have not previously heard this rather serious allegation against Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League. I have not heard that it is charging returned men who do not belong mates. to the organization 2s. 6d. per yard more for this particular tweed.,71
437,Mr BLAKELEY,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"As a matter of fact, the Sydney section of the League carried a resolution some six weeks ago that it would not supply tweed to non-members of the organization.",71
438,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"It had TWEED- no right to do that, because the intention of the Government is that the tweed shall be. distributed impartially. It is pronot right to call it "" An z a c "" tweed, because that particular tweed is handwoven and can be sold to anybody. The tweed of which the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) speaks is that which is manufactured at the Commonwealth Woollen I Mills. It is the intention of the Govern-' ment that every returned soldier shall be able to apply for a suit length of this material, irrespective of whether he belongs to any soldiers' organization or not. I will see that effect is given to that intention, otherwise the privilege which the Returned Sailors and Soldiers I m perial League now enjoys of dealing with the distribution of the tweed will be taken away from it . I will certainly look into the allegation that the League is charging 2s. 6d. per yard more for the tweed sold to non-members of that body. 170,000 Mr BLAKELEY - It is a more serious charge that the League refuses to supply non-members with it .",71

441,Mr RYAN,WOOL SALE TO BRITISH,"I would like further to o r t h know whether the authority of Parliament has been obtained for the actual of payment of the money, and when that the authority was secured.
