1,Mr MARTIN ,ADMINISTRATION,"Macarthur)-On behalf of of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I present the Committee's report entitled Taxpayers or Taxplayers?, a further report on an efficiency audit of the Australian Taxation Office entitled International Profit Shifting, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed. . Mr MARTIN-by leave-This is the fourth report on the Australian Taxation Office to be tabled by the Standing COq1mittee on Finance and Public Administration in the House in just over a year. The con.tents-perhaps I should say discoveriescontained in this report are a cause for concern not only to .the Australian Parliament but also. to the Australian people. It has been . suggested that this inquiry is a witch-hunt. The members of the Committee reject that suggestion. Perhaps it might be called a treasure hunt-a hunt for the dollars lost to Australian revenue by the' operation of tax havens. On past experience there can be little doubt that there are people who will take the opportunity to minimise taxation. The revenue from taxation goes to build a nation. All of the citizens share to some degree in the benefits that come from nationhood. All should make an appropriate contribution to the nation, through the taxation system. In reviewing the use of tax havens,. the transnational. corporations research project analysed the annull.I reports of 88 Australian public companies. It found that in 1988 these companies had investments in tax havens of nearly $6 billion and made profits in tax havens of over $1 billion. There were companies who made tax haven prpfits of over $20m or whose profits in tax .havens were more than 20 per cent of total profits. These are listed in the report at page 63. Only two of those companies, Bond Corporation and the ANZ Bank, made submissions or appeared before the Subcommittee in response to a number of invitations issued. I acknowledge. that some of the operations in tax havens are legitimate business operations. However, I have grave doubts about other activities. The Committee considered in detail the annual reports of four major Australian companies. Those annual reports indicated profits of over $100m in tax havens-in response to a suggestion by Mr John Elliott of Elders IXL to adopt this methodology. Let me turn quickly to the analysis of these four companies contained in the report. The analysis suggested that Elders IXL had tax haven profits of $100m. Elders had 16 subsidiaries in the Turks .and Caicos Islands. Thirteen of those companies had a book value of less than $500. One. of the 13, Morton Investments Ltd, lost $5.7m. Of the other three, Clarkson Holdings had a. book value of over $519m and made a profit of $26m. Rumar International is incorporated in the Turks and Caicos Islands. It had a book value of over $148.5m, yet made a profit of only $180,000. Rumar International is owned by Henry Jones Investment, which is incorporated in Australia. Henry Jones (Far East) Ltd, a subsidiary incorporated in Hong Kong, had a book value of $1,000, yet made a profit of over $23.2m. There were seven companies in the Netherlands Antilles. One of these, Pontoon Securities, was valued at over $98m and made a loss of $16m. Elders IXL (Barbados) Inc, a subsidiary of Rumar International had a book value of less than $500, but made a profit of $26,668m. Pioneer International suggested that its use of tax haven countries 'essentially relates to the company's traditional operating activities or to facilitate international fund raising for our world wide operations'. The 1988 annual report of Pioneer International lists one subsidiary, Pioneer Quarries Hong Kong Ltd. That company has a book value of $26, but in 1987 it made a profit of over $4.5m. In 1988 that profit was lifted to over $166.9m. The Bond Corporation featured prominently in the media comments on the inquiry. However I should make clear that this was not an inquiry into the Bond Corporation. For the record the 30 Bond Corporation subsidiaries incorporated il1 the Cook Islands made profits of over $250m in 1988. At the public hearing on 10 April Bond Corporation told the Subcommittee that where a company is incorporated is not where it does business. Perhaps we' should have asked where it pays tax. It went on to say: . . . we do not have a major operation in the Cook Islands. It said: the majority of Cook Islan<;l companies records are administ-red in Hong Kong. ' It also said: , the accountancy records are, in the main, in H:mg Kong, with the Director- that run the companies. Yet interestingly note 15 to the annual accounts of the Bond Corporation says that business is carried on in the Cook Islands and that applies to all 30 subsidiaries. News Corporation is also commented on in the , report. It had four subsidiaries in the Netherlands Antilles which recorded profits of $140m. Three subsidiaries in Bermuda recorded profits of almost $165m. The Committee is of the view that the tax haven activities of some of Australia's major public companies is a cause for concern. It gives the tax haven player advantages over those who do not or cannot structure their affairs to take advantage of tax havens. The information I have referred to is taken from publicly available annual reports. Not available are the details of tax haven usage bY'individuals, partnerships, private companies and branches of' overseas companies operating' in Australia; The Committee has therefore concluded: firstly, that Australian revenue has been reduced by the operation of tax havens; secondly, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the loss; and, thirdly, the quantification exercise currently being undertaken by the Australian Taxation Office is proving to be of value. Evidence has suggestpd that, the accruals tax legislation as proposed by' the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) in the, April statement will reduce and possibly eU!p.inate the loss to the Australian revenue as a result of tax havens. The Committee is of the view that this aspect should be carefully monitored, and has recommended, first, 'that the Government pursue, at the appropriate international' forurns, the methods by which the operations of tax havens can be reduced and, secondly, that the Australian Taxation Office continue to monitor the taxation performance of companies which have subsidiaries in tax havens. The report has a positive approach. We are concerned for the future and in total have made 26 recommendations. Time unfortunately does not allow me to' dwell on each in detail. My colleague the honourable member for Sturt ( Mr Wilson) will, make some comments on our Committee's investi' gations. It is important, however, to touch on some of these recommendations. A major recommendation concerns the use of functional analysis by the Australian Taxation Office. In summary, functional analysis means th-t the profits are assessed according to where the functions are, not where the papers are. If a company has 90 per cent of its operations or functions in Australia, 'then 90 per cent of the profits should be in Australia-'-'not in some island in the sun. The Committee has also concluded' that some legislative tools may already enable the Commissioner for Taxation to examine potential 0 international profit shifting activities. We have 'recommended that the provisions of part IV A, the general anti-avoidance sectiqn of the tax Act, be invoked in an appropriate test case. 0 In this regard, two industries were examined in some detail in the Auditor-General's report-the banking industry and the oil industry. With respect to th- banking indu,stry the Committee has recommended that the resolution of the problems associated wIth ititerest paid adjustments be expedited. Indeed, we hav,e suggested th\lt the work by the Australian Taxation Office into the banking industry continue and be assisted. With respect to the oil industry, the Committee has recommended a more enhanced "" use of a number of sections of the tax Act tei deal with the problems of short-term operators who pull out of Australia well before their tax obligations are met. FimHly, a number of recommendations have been made to improve the effectiveness of the tax Act ito self. These include the suggestion that the Act be simplified and that schedule 25A apply to trusts which have overseas transactions. Presently that is not the case. ' The inquiry has been a most challenging one, and has attracted a great deal of interest. I only wish that all that interest could have been put in the public domain and that people had come forward to give evidence to ourÂ· Committee. In closing, I thank the Commissioner of Taxation for making available one of his officers to assist the Subcommittee. Chris Hodges brought both expertise and dedication to the inquiry and the report is the better for his contribution. I should also place on record my thanks to Amanda Garlick and Sharon Fisher who provided the administrative backup. On behalf of the Committee, I would pay special tribute to Phil Bergin, the Committee secretary. Without his continuing interest, knowledge and guiding hand the Committee would not be as effective as it has become. Penultimately, I would like to thank the House of Representatives printing office for its efforts in producing the copies of the report at very short notice. Finally, I express my sincere appreciation to the honourable member for Sturt, the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr MCArthur), the honourable member for Canning ( Mr Gear) and the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) for their diligence and dedication to the task at hand during the course of this inquiry. It has lasted, to date, some 20 months. It has taken a great deal of time, effort and indeed, at times, physical exertion to deal with the plethora of information that has come before the Committee and which we finally have been able to get our hands on. I appreciate most sincerely the efforts of all members of the Subcommittee.",10
2,Mr WILSON ,ADMINISTRATION,"Sturt)-by leave-I wish to add to the comments made by the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Martin) in presenting this report on behalf of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. It is an important report, containing 26 recommendations. If acted upon, each recommendation will contribute to restoring equity in the taxation system. I hope that the recommendations are taken seriously, both by the Australian Taxation Office and by the Government, and that action will be taken with regard to them. The Committee's activities in examining this particular issue have taken a long time. Initially, the Committee found it very difficult to get its finger on the pulse of this problem. People were prepared to talk about tax havens, but when specific questions were asked as to how those tax havens operated, or what advantages were being received by a particular industry or a particular taxpayer, or what advice was being given by tax advisers, there was a wall of silence. That persisted for a while. Then I believe those who were involved on one side or the other of this issue realised that this House of Representatives Committee was quite serious in its endeavours, on behalf of the Australian people and through this Parliament, to come to a full understanding of the issues involved in respect of profit shifting to tax havens abroad. We noted an important point in our report. At this point I will quote from the report: A reduction in tax may be achieved by the sensible arrangement of a taxpayer's financial affairs. Few would question the right of taxpayers to order their affairs within the law so as to minimise their tax payments. However others would seek to avoid tax by the diversion of income otherwise taxable in Australia to low tax countries and tax havens by artificially shifting investments or business income to those countries despite the inco""me-deriving activities having no real connection with those low-tax countries. Some business activities, (eg. service industries) can be readily shifted from one location to another. I think that paragraph is very significant because clearly the committee identified that there is a grey area between what is accepted in our community as the proper tax management of an individua1's affairs to minimise tax in a legitimate way and the shifting in an artificial way of income to a lower tax haven. The Committee in its report. referred to the complexity of the Income Tax Assessment Act; it did so in earlier reports as well. The Committee has previously reCommended, and again endorses, the need for a comprehensive review of the tax Act. In spite of constant repetition of this recommendation, when we look at the tax legislation that comes before this Parliament, we wonder whether the message and recommendation are really being understood by those who are drafting our tax law. The complexity creates a problem for all who .are taxpayers; it creates many of the opportunities for artificial reduction of tax liability. Those who are artificially taking advantage of tax minimisation are able to argue that what they are doing is quite legal. The complexity on this matter was also raised by a number of witnesses at the Committee's hearings, including representatives of the Confederation of Australian Industry. At present the law improvement unit of the Australian Tax Office has only three officers on its staff. The Committee in this report has suggested that the resources of the unit should be increased. The Committee stressed that what we are concerned about is the present and the future; that is our primary concern. The honourable member for Macarthur stressed that point in his remarks. However, there is obviously a responsibility on the Commissioner of Taxation to see that the law which presently exists is implemented in relation to past transactions. The Committee urges that he exercise his powers under existing law to do that. But in so far as we look to the future,. the Committee is recommending that a number of changes be made both in administration and in the area of the law .. The report, in looking to the future, analyses the question of tax haven activities and we hope, as members of the Committee, that this contributes to the debate on this issue a way which will enable action to be taken by the Government. What happens in the future will be the test of the extent to which the Tax Office and the Government are concerned in ensuring that Australiari taxpayers are levied a tax burden on the basis of a level playing field, with all taxpayers being treated in a similar fashion. In evidence before the Committee, the Commissioner of Taxation acknowledged that he was not campaigning for any changes in the law. Perhaps he should be. Perhaps he should be campaigning for changes to bring certainty and simplicity to the law. The third area is a difficult one, for should he be campaigning for changes llhat bring fairness 'to the law? Perhaps that is the role of Parliament, the role of government. I was impressed by the evidence that came before the Committee in this regard. Very many people who gave evidence honestly believed that what they were doing or what they were advising be done was within the law and acknowledged that it did reduce their tax burden or the tax burden on their clients. The Commissioner of Taxation acknowledged that that was the case in some areas, yet that has created a situation where corporations, enterprises and individuals who are operating solely within Australia are paying a very heavy tax burden compared with that borne by people who, one way or another, have been able to ensure that they are international rather than national players in relation to their enterprises. The situation is not dissimilar to an illustration that I have been given. It is a small one and it may be seen to be almost facetious, but there was a time when Defence Force pay for the citizen reserve forces was tax free. The Taxation Commissioner is quite right, then, in not expecting anyone to declare that in their tax return or to pay any tax on it if it has to be reported, yet there could come a time when that exemption from tax is not fulfilling its original purpose and is being taken advantage of by people on high incomes who wish to increase their income by getting untaxed receipts. That is just what is happening in certain areas through this international profit shifting and the use of tax havens. In that respect there is a need for a change in the law-and in the law can be changed only by Parliament. The question is: is it for the Commissioner of Taxation to report to the Government that the system is operating unfairly, or is it for the Government to identify that for itself? This report certainly identifies that to be the case-that at the moment the tax system is operating in a way which is unfair to Australian enterprises operating only within our shores. The system obliges them to pay much of their profit in tax, which tax is not being paid by those enterprises operating in this country that have international connections. In that regard, this report will be significant if it is acted upon. The Taxation Commissioner's Deputy said that there were strategies in place to address the issue of profit shifting. I hope that that issue will be addressed, to collect the tax due under existing law and to assess the fairness of the tax system. It is important that the tax system be seen to be operating in a fair way so that Australian enterprises operating just within this country are not then put under threat and at risk by enterprises which use money that would otherwise be paid tax to take them over in order that they then transfer their profits, presently being taxed, through a tax haven, in circumstances which add to the general burden of all tralian taxpayers. What we need is a much fairer tax system, and in that regard I hope that the whole issue of function and analysis will also looked at very carefully and that there be negotiations at the government to governHowever, ment level to ensure that there is not petition between tax collecting regimes. In dum states: concluding my remarks, I would like to adl;l my thanks to the members of the staff of have the Committee, to the Chairman for his leadisnatory ership in this inquiry and, in particular, Chris Hodges, who has been on secondment to the Committee, for the work that he has done in enabling us to bring this report to the Parliament. SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT nation Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 May, on motion by Mr Humphreys: That the Bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr N. A. Brown had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House: (I) notes that the Bill makes no provision respect of the effective discrimination far as the provision of superannuation for part-time employees is concerned; and (2) noting the urgent need to overcome the inequities, inadequacies and effective discrimination in existing superannuation arrangements, calls on the Government to introduce ment Savings Accounts as proposed in Opposition's Retirement Incomes Policy which is designed to ensure that all employees an opportunity for access to superannuation cover',",12
3,Mr BRUMBY ,ADMINISTRATION,Bendigo) (10.25)-It is and my pleasure to support the Sex Discriminaspect. tion Amendment Bill which is before the House. Mr Beale-Are you going to support the amendment too?,14
4,Mr BRUMBY,ADMINISTRATION,"I do not support the another amendment; I support the Bill b-fore as House. The major effect of the Bill is to can remove most forms of direct discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status in superannuation practices for new schemes. AusThe explanatory memorandum to this Bill . makes it clear that where funds are unable to comply with the new obligations under ,the Bill the reasonable expectations of membe bers will be maintained and the discriminawill tory fund will be allowed to continue. these funds will not be entitled to comadmit new members. Further, the memoran. . . members of such discriminatory schemes will to be given an option to obtain ""non-discrimisuperannuation benefits"" unless an exemption provided by the Human Rights and Equal Opporto tunity Commission under s. 44 of the Act. Basically, this Bill, which is entitled the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill, is about superannuation. It is a Bill which removes from relevant superannuation law discrimiand restrictions which might limit the BILL 1989 capacity of women to be covered by superannuation schemes. The reason why the Government is introducing this legislation is that there is now a wealth of evidence that women's participation and coverage in occupational superannuation is significantly below that of men in the work force, and there are many good reasons for the Government to tackle that problem. It is worth stating in this debate that governments all around the world are grappling with this issue of occuin pational superannuation. It is a very imporin so , tant issue indeed. There are a few rea-ons why governments-not just our Government-are grappling with this issue. First and foremost, it is bec,ause populations are ageing in most deRetireveloped countries-.. around the world. There the , is an ageing phenomenon basically brought about by the baby boom after World War have II. That was not a peculiarly Australian phenomenon; it was a phenomenon in much of the developed world. Populations are ageing superannuation is important in that reSuperannuation is also important because, in effect, it represents savings. In the larger savings versus consumption argument, superannuation represents' money put aside for day. It is a way of encouraging savthe ings, and governments t-nd to encourage those types of measures. There is a third reason why governments all around the world are looking at the question of superannuaAmerica tion: in a sense, superannuation provides retirement income for an individual. To the extent that populations are ageing, and the extent that governments around the world are trying to minimise or reduce outlays to govern more efficiently, governments tend encourage measures which will allow individ27 uals to put money away for their own retiretries ment. The fourth reason why governments per are looking closely at the question of superclose annuation concerns equity. To the extent that superannuation represents a tax subsidy, because it is a tax concession, it is important for governments interested in equity that all people across the work force have the portunity to participate in superannuation schemes and get some benefit from the tax concessions which are applied by governAssociation ments. There is the savings question, there the question of retirement income and there is the question of equity involved in superthat annuation. If one looks at who is covered by superdo annuation in Australia one gets a fairly dictable result. Superannuation coverage Australia is highest amongst collar employees. It is much higher amongst middle-aged groups than younger people correlates well with income and union memlow bership. Superannuation coverage tends be higher amongst married people than sinthose gle people. It is much higher amongst full time employees than part time employees and it is higher amongst public sector ployees as distinct from private sector emservice ployees. In summary, we can say that a middle-aged, married, full time, male public sector employee who is a member of a union and who is working in a white-collar job earning above-average weekly earnings is extives' tremely likely to be covered by superannuaper tion. Conversely, we can say that a female employee, a young employee or a part time, casual or itinerant employee is extremely unlikely to be covered by superannuation. I want to expand on those points a little because they are relevant to this debate. Australia has superannuation coverage for on later. about half the population. We do not compare well, perhaps, with a number of other developed countries which have a somewhat higher percentage of the work force covered by superannuation. In the United States of 70 per cent of the work force is a covered. In France and Germany the figure is around 60 perÂ· cent. In Switzerland, where to coverage is compulsory, it is 100 per cent and in Sweden it is around 90 per cent. Some countries have lower figures: Canada's figure to is 40 per cent; and New Zealand's figure is per cent. On average in European councoverage is between 50 per cent to 70 cent of the work force. In Australia it is to 50 per cent. In Australia about 40 . per cent of people are covered by occupational superannuation schemes and a further 10 per cent are covered by schemes not provided by their employers. In total, about op49+ per cent of the Australian work force has some form of superannuation. It has been argued, for instance by the of Superannuation Funds, that a is truer figure of coverage in Australia is more like 40 per cent. That Association maintains many people in Australia decline the opportunity to take on superannuation. We not have any idea why that is so. Some preresearch indicates that many superannuation in schemes are not as attractive to employees males and white as they should be. The report of the South Australian Superand annuation Board in 1986-87 explained the participation rate in its voluntary Public to Service superannuation scheme in exactly terms. Certain characteristics of the scheme were seen as unattractive to young employees, short term employees and ememployees, usually females, who had broken patterns. In this context it is worth noting that the 1982-83 census of superannuation funds showed that 61 per cent of managerial schemes, which could be expected to be tailored more closely to execuneeds, had a participation rate of 100 cent. This can be compared with wage and mixed schemes which had a participation rate of only 30 per cent. Many superannuation schemes are not as attractive as they might be which goes back to the questions of broken service, divesting rights, portability and so on-matters which I will touch There has been growth in superannuation in Australia over the last 15 years. Interestingly, the growth has not been as rapid in the last five years. One of the statistical reasons for that is that in the last five years there has been extremely strong employment growth, much of which has been of a part time nature. I reiterate that ill Australia superannuation .coverage amongst part time employees is much lower than amongst full time employees. The growth in superannuation has been most marked for females, but to a degree that misses the point because it works from a very low base. The participation of women in superannuation has grown from 16.5 per cent in 1974 to about 26 per cent or 27 per cent today and, while it is pleasing to note that growth, it should be pointed out that it is still considerably below the level of 50 per cent coverage and above that applies for males. I referred to part-time versus full time employment. Coverage of full time employees is around 48 per cent compared with only around 8 per cent of coverage for part time employees. Clearly there is a correlation, as I said previously, between superannuation coverage and the type of employment. The fact is that people in full time employment are much more likely to be covered by a superannuation scheme than are people in part time employment. The recent report of the Social Security Review, paper No.6, entitled Towards a National Retirement Incomes Policy, made the point that, despite the improved coverage of part time employees, it is their low coverage rate of 8 per cent that is potentially of greatest concern in achieving a broader and more equitable spread of superannuation. That is because growth of part time employment is not only greater than growth of full time employment but also because 80 per cent of part time employment is taken up by women. In a sense, that point goes to the crux of this legislation. I repeat that statistic: eighty per cent of part time employment is taken up by women. I said previously that there were two relationships regarding superannuation coverage; that is, a person's age and .income level. Coverage amongst males aged between 55 years and 59 years, for instance, is about twice as high as the level for males aged between 20 years and 24 years. The pattern for females, for various reasons, is nowhere near as pronounced but, in general, we can say that there is a clear relationship between the age of an individual and the likelihood of that person having superannuation coverage. Coverage is. highest for people employed as clerks, paraprofessionals, professionals, managers and administrators. It is also high in industries dominated by the public sector, especially where there is a large component of white collar work. In terms of the occupational base, again there are interesting statistics on superannuation coverage. For instance, the communications industry has an 86 per cent superannuation coverage of employees but others, for instance recreation, personal and service industries, have a coverage of only 12 per cent; agriculture has a coverage of only 18 per cent; and, at the other end of the scale, public administration and defence have a coverage of around 74 per cent. There are vast differences according to industry groupings. There are also vast differences in' superannuation coverage in relation to whether or not people are members of a union. Superannuation coverage correlates strongly with membership of a union, and that is an important .point which is worth making. Only 39 per cent of employed female wage and salary earners are members of a union and, of these, 43 per cent are covered by a superannuation scheme. Only 21 per cent of the 61 per cent of women who are 'not union members are covered by superannuation. Clearly, membership of a trade union is important in relation to superannuation coverage. The Social Security Review report Towards a National Retirement Incomes Policy asked how we can fill these gaps in superannuation coverage. It was concluded that the majorlty of employees in Australia"" without superannuation are in fact full-time workers but that females represent 80 per cent of part-time employees without superannuation. So, just over half of all employees without employer-provided superannuation are female. The foregoing suggests that there is a need for a range of strategies to increase superannuation coverage. The Social Security Review suggested that efforts should be made to increase the attractiveness of superannuation to younger employees, improve vesting and explain the benefits of superannuation. The review went on to say that, coupled with these measures which would benefit all employeeS, there should be continued efforts to increase female participation in superannuation. It said that this will require the removal of discriminatory practices, the extension of superannuation to part time employees and measures which accommodate women's interrupted participation in the work force. 1 heartily endorse those recommendations made in the Social Security Review paper. This legislation seeks to amend superannuation laws to ensure that there will not be discrimination in the future on the basis of sex. In turn, that will mean that superannuation coverage of part time employees-particularly women, who make up 80 per cent of the part time work force in Australiashould be significantly expanded. It is very good legislation indeed. 1 want to say also that the review of retirement incomes policy also touched on the question of the interrupted participation of women in the work force. That is clearly a factor which contributes to women's low rate of take-up in superannuation and, the fact that their employment efforts tend t6' be concentrated in part time and casual jobs. One' of the reasons for that is that there are still, in my view, inadequate provisions for family leave-for either women or men in a family relationship to be able to take leave from work to combine in a better and more flexible way the dual roles of worker and parent. I think we sometimes forget in the 1980s that holding a job and Mving a baby were totally mutually exclusive activities, in the pre-Whitlam days before 1973. Women who were pregnant either resigned or were sacked from their jobs. It was not until the Whitlam Government changed the maternity leave provisions in 1973 that the law and the attitudes in Australia really changed: Similarly, in 1979 the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission made a landmark decision which led to the inclusion of standard maternity leave clauses in most Federa] private sector awards, State awards and so on. But the provisions in' those awards are not exactly generous. We find that there are enormous gapsstriking gaps-between the provision of family leave conditions in the public sector as compared with the private sector. There must be many women working in the private sector, particularly amongst small business, who must often look with envy at the type of conditions which are available, say, to Victorian teachers, who are able to take up to 12 weeks paid leave and up to seven years unpaid leave. I want to say-and this supports the point made in the Social, Security Review-that we need to encourage more flexible work arrangements so that women can continue, if they choose, to participate in the work force even though they may participate in an interrupted way. We need better family leave provisions. We need provisions which better acknowledge the dual role of worker and parent. This is needed not just for reasons of equity or fairness but, as was pointed out in the debate last night by the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Connolly), to ensure that labour force participation rates in - he future can continue to be sustained. In Australia we face an ageing population. I do not want to exaggerate that because it is not a problem of major proportions compared with some European countries. Unless we all want to pay a lot more tax supporting a much greater dependent population, we need to sustain labour force participation rates. We will be able to do that only if conditions in the work, force are flexible and attractive and if they acknowledge the dual role of parent and worker. The legislation before the House is good legislation. It will remove discrimination, primarily against women, in relation to superannuation. It will result in increased coverage of superannuation among part time employees: Some 80 , per cent of those employees are women and they will therefore be major beneficiaries of this legislation. I have pleasure in supporting it.",14
5,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,ADMINISTRATION,"Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (10.45)-1 thank all honourable members for their contributions. I welcome the Opposition's basic support of the legislation, and acknowledge the proposals that it would like to have considered. The legislation is important and innovative. It will give more incentive to women in the work force to obtain superannuation. Without wishing to delay the House, I might quickly advert to some of the matters raised. The Opposition has moved a second reading amendment in which, while, not declining to give the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill a second reading, it notes that the Bill makes no provision in respect of what it calls the effect of discrimination in regard to. part time employees. There is no discrimination as far as we are concerned. There was a view that the Sex Discrimination Act ought, to make some attempt to define what is a part time occupation. I think that is the wrong approach. Part tiJTIe occupations are certainly covered by superannuation now. The definition of 'part time' is too difficult to encompass in legislation. Some people work for one week and perhaps do not work again for five or six, weeks, as against people whO might be, working part time regularly each week. The Government's view, which I think is accurate, is that that can be a matter of award determination before the industrial tribunals. In other words, there can be provision for superannuation for part time employees in award determinations. Perhaps there ought not to be award coverage for casuals, but the issue' is that there is no discrimination and there is no reason why a person who is a, part time employee, on a basis that an award determination can identify, would not be able to get superannuation cover. The second part of the amendment moved by the Opposition gives praise to the Opposition for the retirement savings account proposal that it has' announced. One has no objection to the Opposition giving praise to itself, but of course criticism can be made of the proposal. The proposal is to give people a benefit by way of a special retirement savings account which would allow them virtually to bank $3,000, even though it might not be related in any way to their remuneration. It is not for me to debate it here, but the criticism may be made that a person might work for only a month and would be. able to subscribe $3,000, which would attract the criticism that it might be a tax avoidance measure, basically available for high income earners to put money into a bank account and say that. it is for superannuation. The Government has a more responsible attitude to these matters. From its pOint of view there should be opportunities to do this, and those opportunities will be available under the existing legislation. The amount that might be. granted is a matter for the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) to determine. I can understand that it might well go to $3,000, but it should be related to a consideration of the remuneration earned in a full year, not.just toa l,imited or undefined period. If there was a limited period in respect of seasonal workers, it would be done on a pro rata basis in relation to the whole 12-month period. . The honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A, Brown) was kind enough to write to me on 30 May pointing out that the superan--ation. industry would have difficulty with sectIon 41A(3) of the legislation, which relates to new superannuation' conditions and gives exemptions in three areas. The honourable member made the valid point that this would place the superannuation industry in difficulty, in that it would have to amend what he thinks-and he may well be rightwould be 120,000 trust deeds. I think that is unfair and onerous and I agree that that could be avoided by introducing an ameridiment to proposed new section 41A(3). The amendment that I have in mind would state: It is unlawful for a person who exercises a discretion in relation to. the payment of a dependant superannuation benefit for a member of a superannuation fund (not being a member to whom section 41 B applies in respect of that fund) to discriminate against 'another person, on the ground of that other person's sex or marital status, in the exercise of the discretion. '. n. In other words, I agree with the honourable member for Menzies. We could do it this way, but it would make it unlawful for anybody to exercise discriminatory discretion. That would oversome the problem that the industry has of going back and altering all the trust deeds. Last night I foreshadowed that we would be moving an amendment to division 4 of the Bill which relates to exemptions. It would be more appropriate to move this amendment to divisionÂ· 1 of the principal Act which is the prohibition section. I have explained that to the honourable member for Menzies. So we will be mqving that amendment .earlier in the legi-lation tharl we first proposed. The otherÂ· matter that the honourable gentleman waS understandably Â·objecting to was the question of being able to deal with the repeal of exemptions by regulation. I can understand that view. It has been said for some time that we should always repeal exemptions by legislation rather than by regulation. But, in these circumstances; only three exemptions still exist and they are identified in this legislation. In any repeal of these exemptions, under proposed new section 41c (4), which states that the Minister cannot talk about repealing an exemption 'unless .the Minister or a person. nominated by the Minister has consulted representatives of superannuation fund operators and trustees in relation to the making of the regulation', plentyÂ· of advice and warning would be given. This provision allows for the progressive removal of the .three remaining exemptions and an regulations are subject to parliamen.tary scrutiny. In this case the Minister is required to have had prior negotiations with the industry. So any regulation would not be effective earlier than 12 months after its making, which. would provide the industry with at least 12 months to change its fund rules in order to comply. At this stage we cannqt accept the Opposition's amendment as it is much more satisfactory and much more efficient to be able to deal with tqe matter by regulation. r know that, in that sense, this legislation will have to run the gauntlet in the Senate. The pileup of Bills in the Senate is now in excess of 140 and the Senate is proposing to sit another three weeks in the winter recess to try to grapple with some of those Bills. Honourable members will realise that government legislation does not always get an easy passage. One day the Parliament will have to work out how it is to run a program when the Senate is running a separate program. Mr Beale-You can blame Mick Young for that.",17
6,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ADMINISTRATION,"I do not blame anybody. It is understandable that, in a democracy, people want to use the Parliament to talk. But the Parliament also has an obligation to legislate. If we are to be effective, we have to get our priorities right when; we are rationing time.",19

Section 14 of the Principal Act is amended by adding at the end the following subsection: '(4) It is unlawful for a person who exercises a discretion in relation to the payment of a dependant superannuation benefit for a member of a superannuation fund (not being a member to whom section 41 B applies in respect of that fund) to discriminate against another person, on the ground of that other person's sex or marital status, in the exercise of the discretion.'."". This amendment will overcome the difficulty that the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown) raised with me in correspondence regarding proposed new section 41A (3) which would have created enormous difficulties for the industry. The industry would have. had to alter all the trust deeds, which could have numbered 120,000 and could have cost up to $50m. That is not a very satisfactory proposition. The idea is to prevent discrimination. I have done this by moving this amendment which would more appropriately be moved to division 1 of the principal Act. I will be moving an amendment to clause 4 in the following terms: (2) - Iause 4, page 3, lines 27 to 32, omit proposed subsectIOn 41A (3). So the offending proposition is removed in our proposed amendment to clause 4. We can avoid the difficulty of having to amend the - rust deeds by inserting the proposed new sectIon that I have mentioned which will be added to the principal Act as section 14 subsection (4). So there is no need to alte; the trust funds; it will be just acknowledged that no person can discriminate in the way that has been identified in this amendment. I thank the honourable member Â·for Menzies for mentioning this matter and I welcome the chance to correct a difficulty that would have arisen.",19
8,Mr NA BROWN ,ADMINISTRATION,"Menzies) (10.59)As the Attorney-General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) has highlighted the problem and has put forward a proposal which will largely rectify it, there is no need for me to delay the Committee for very long with respect to the amendment that the Government has now moved. The Opposition will certainly support the amendment proposed by the Attorney-General. Very briefly, just to encapsulate the problem, the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill sets out a number of indirect forms of discrimination which, for some time will be permissible and lawful. But subsecti-n (3) of p-oposed new section 41 A of the Bill proVides that those benefits-if we can look at them in that way-would not be available to anyone concerned unless the superannuation deeds actually had a provision in them which positively stated that, in the exercise of a discretion on the payment of a dependant superannuation benefit, that discretion would not - e exercise? in a discriminatory way. As I pomted out m the second reading debate and as the Attorney-General has conceded there is a practical problem resulting frothat, namely, that as most, if not all, superannuation deeds would not have such a clause in them at this stage, it would be necessary to amend them all to add such a clause. In order to avoid that problem, I have suggested that we simply reverse subsection (3) so that the benefits set out under section 41A-if they could be seen as benefitswould be available in all cases unless the deed had a clause within it which allowed the exercise of a discretion in a discriminatory way, on the grounds of sex or marital - tatus. Of course, ther- would be very few, if any, trust deeds With such a clause in them. Therefore, people concerned would be able to avail themselves of the provisions of section 41A. Indeed, it would probably be contrary to the general trust law to have such a clause in a trust deed. Therefore, it seems to be a practical way of resolving the problem. The Government is not able to accept that amendment, but it has conceded that there is a problem. There is no need for the Opposition to press this argument at any length, because the Attorney-General has proposed the insertion of new clause 3A which will go at least some way towardremoving the problem. The other amendments now relating to this will be mechanical, but we would still intend to propose our amendment to replace subsection (3). I think, at this stage, the Government is moving only the first of the two amendments circulated. That means that, as at the moment it is 11 o'clock, subsection . (3) is still in the Bill so it will have to be taken out. This will enable, as I understand it, the Opposition to move its own amendment to subsection (3) before that is done. Proposed new clause agreed to. Clause 4.",20
9,Mr NA BROWN ,ADMINISTRATION,"Menzies) (11.03)I move: Clause 4, page 3, omit proposed subsection 41A (3), substitute the following subsection: ..

12,Mr NA BROWN ,ADMINISTRATION,"Menzies) (11.06)-I move: (2) Clause 4, page 4, omit proposed section 41c. Once again, we have advanced the arguments for this in the course of, the second reading debate. There is no need: to go over those arguments at length. I wish to put briefly, two reasons in support of this amendment. The Bill, as presently expressed, would allow the repeal of two sections of what will be an Act by means of a regulation. We believe that that is an unhealthy thing to do in most, if not all, cases unless there is an overwhelming case made out. The Attorney-General has said that there is a lot of legislation in the Senate. I suppose he is really saying we should not have unnecessary Bills. Nevertheless, we believe that if one proposes to take out sections from an Act, that should be done by a Bill. I stated yesterday that I realised that in the Sex Discrimination Act itself there was a not dissimilar provision which enabled some sections to be repealed} by regulation. That is already there. We would still maintain that one should really not do this unless there is an exceptional case and there are overwhelming reasons to justify one's doing it. Therefore, the first reason is that we feel it is wrong in prinCiple. The second reason is that repealing either of these two sections, 41A or 418, or repealing them both at the same time, by a regulation, is a pretty substantial thing to do and it will have a substantial effect. After all, its effect will be that the exemption of superannuation from the discrimination provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act will come to an end. In fact, if one simply took out 41A and 418, there would be no form of indirect discrimination allowed. Superannuation would be subject to the full force and fury of the Sex Discrimination Act. That seems a big step to take at the one stage. I presume that over the coming years we will see more moderate reforms taken on a step-by-step basis. I suppose the Attorney-General will say that that is the way it should be done, and I suppose he' would be partly right in saying that. We do not argue against that being done. Indeed, this whole Bill we have before us today is part of the step-by-step approach. As I have said, the second reason we believe that 'the relevant sections should not be repealed by regulation is that they will have a very substantial effect and there , , will be nothing left in their place once 41 A and 418 are taken out. They set out the legitimate permitted forms of indirect discrimination and once they are removed, nothing will remain in their place. I suppose that the Attorney-General will say-and he would be right in saying thisthat there will be consultations with the superannuation industry. That is fair enough. That 'is a desirable thing. But we do not believe that one should, as a result of a regulation repealing a section' or sections of an Act, leave a chasm or a vacuum in its place. Unfortunately, this is what will happen. We believe that this amendment should be supported. When one comes to take these provisions out of the Sex Discrimination Act-which is where they will be, by the time it is done-one should do that by of an Act.",21
13,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,ADMINISTRATION,"Kingsfordlowed, Smith-Attorney-General) ( 11.09) honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown) has made an eloquent case. The point I am trying to identify is that this measure is for the repeal of exemptions which we now allow to continue. It is fully agreed that at the present time, they are discrimiprovisions-they natory. It is fully agreed that eventually should be removed, because the whole thrust of the Bill is not to have discrimination. the honourable gentleman has said, it is step-by-step process. We cannot do it mediately, as it would create too much dishave location and too many problems. We are doing it on a time basis which at this stage we cannot predict. What we are about here is not an untake known factor. The three areas of discrimilegislatively nation are identified and are set out in statute. The statute is entitled to state, course, we recognise they are discriminatory, but they have a limited life, until we can get to the stage of havirtg their repeal'. One would notice that section 41 c talks about the mechanism of repeal. That is the thrust of the Opposition's case. They have said, 'Do not do it that way'. I would would have merit, if it were deemed to be done by surprise or a no-time factor. If one looked at the requirements of section 41C, one would see that they put an obligation on the Minister to have discussions with representatives of the superannuation fund and the trustees. So there is an obligation there. Secondly, there is a time constraint. Once the regulation is brought in, it cannot come into effect before 12 months have it is not as though we will have an ambush arrange).1lent whereby something is done by way of a repeal. I can understand what the honourable gentleman says, but I would think we would deal with these matters perhaps seriatim. It may well take three pieces legislation to do something which everybody agrees ought to be phased out. If we can come to some understanding of how best can be phased out, I can see no real objecwealth tion to doing it by regulation. But, firstly, there has to be consultation; secondly, there is the time constraint of the 12 months tice; and thirdly-this is a point with which means the honourable member would readily agree-the regulations can always be disaland will be subject to parliamentary - The scrutiny in that sense. I understand the thrust of what the honourable member is about. I am not anxious to try to avoid legislative procedures by using regulation, but in these circumstances where there are three known discriminatory are identified in this legisthey lation and it is known that they must eventually be phased out-our basic disagreement As is with the method of phasing them out. I a think it can be done by regulation in the imcircumstances. I am sure the Senate will objections and maybe we will fail. But it would be more progressive to do things this way than legislatively, especially in view of the time it takes to pass legislation. It may twice as long to phase out exemptions than it would take by regulation. the In view of those matters, I am unable to 'Of accept the Opposition's amendment. Amendment negatived.

14,Dr HEWSON ,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Wentworth) (11.13)-1 welcome the opportunity to lead the Opposition's contribution to this debate on the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. of The Bill seeks to make a number of quite significant revisions to the Banking Act as well as some ancillary changes to other Acts it and some amendments to the CommonBanks Act and to the Reserve Bank Act. The first main provision of the Bill is to remove all reference in the Act to 'trading nobanks' and 'savings banks'-that is, to remove the distinction, effectively, between trading and savings banks-and to replace them with general references to 'banks'. ondly, the Bill seeks to remove division 3 of the Act concerning statutory reserve deposits (SRDs), and replace it with a new division 3 concerning non-callable deposits which would facilitate the phasing down and placement of the statutory reserve deposit process. The third principal provision of Bill is to provide specific powers for the establishment of prudential requirements concerning the manner in which the banks conduct their business. I believe that this the most important provision of the Bill. Fourthly, the Bill provides the Reserve Bank of Australia with powers of investigation into the books, accounts and transactions of banks, including the ability to obtain information from a bank concerning individual cusof tomers. The Opposition does not intend to oppose tion. the Bill as much of what it seeks to do is simply to formalise what is already wellfor established practice for prudential superviplace sion of the banking system as well as to make a number of tidying-up changes that follow on from the recommendations of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the its Australian Financial System and the Martin Committee on the Review of the Australian Financial System. The Opposition recognises that the two specific changes that were nounced by the Treasurer in his 1989-90 Budget-namely, the removal of the distincthere tion between trading and savings banks and the phasing out of the SRD-represent steps towards achieving a more effective, stable and efficient banking system as a centrepiece of our entire financial system. I will direct some further remarks to these changes in the course of my speech. As I said, they have been foreshadowed for quite some time from the days of the Campbell Committee's exbe haustive report on the financial system and, more recently, by the recommendations of crisis. the' Martin Committee. However, the Opposition has reservations about those provisions of the Bill which vide the Reserve Bank with powers of tigation into the books, accounts and transactions of banks and particularly its proposed ability to obtain information from a bank concerning individual customers where that is required for prudential supervisory purposes. There is a justifiable concern over Secwhether there are adequate safeguards to prevent the Reserve Bjlnk or its officers from indiscriminately seeking or using information about individual banks or individuals. At the committee stage I will move an reamendment, that will be circulated in my name, which seeks to address the privacy the concerns, at least to the extent that the Governor of the Reserve Bank will have to satisfy himself under that amendment that information on an individual bank or individis ual client of a bank is essential to the Reserve Bank's fulfilling its obligations concerning prudential matters. Secondly, the amendment seeks to insert a provision which directs the Reserve Bank to include in its annual report details of the use of its powers investigation while protecting the identity of those who have been subject to investigaThe Opposition does not make any apology the fact that from time to time in this and elsewhere we have been highly critical of the Government and its economic mismanagement across all areas of fiscal, wages and monetary policy and, particularly, snail-like attitude to micro-economic reform. At the same time, however, we have never shied away from giving credit where credit is due in terms of the contribution anthat the Government has made to the process of financial sector deregulation. Even though was an inevitability in terms of the economic circumstances that existed in 1982, 1983, 1984 and so on that the process of deregulation would ultimately take its course and we would see the entry of foreign banks and the establishment of a foreign exchange system as a result of pressures tl).at were in our economic system and in the international economy, nevertheless the Government is to given credit for actually taking those decisions with the minimum of disruption and The process of financial deregulation began with the honourable member for proBennelong ( Mr Howard), in his capacity as invesTreasurer, commissioning the Campbell Committee of Inquiry in January 1979. The Committee's final report was delivered in September 1981 and it provided the impetus for the deregulation of the financial system which occurred in the 1980s. There were many small changes from the mid-seventies to the early eighties that were, in a sense, consistent with that trend to deregulation the financial system and to inject competibanks tion and professionalism into, that sector the Australian economy. The Government, with the full support of the Opposition, has taken some final steps in that process, the important steps being the floating of the dollar and foreign bank entry. I point out that, as is so often the case in debates in this House; the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) has gone a bit further than that terms of claiming credit for things he has done and in terms of rewriting history in that process of financial sector deregulation. To say the least, he has a tendency to exagsigned gerate. For instance, in an answer to a quesinasmuch tion on money supply growth on 5 April in this House, the Treasurer sought to establish that quantitative restrictions and monetary targets were abandoned in 1983-84. Quantiup tative controls on bank lending were actually removed in June 1982 under the coalition Government, while monetary targets were abandoned in January 1985, later than the Treasurer had suggested and in response to what was then considerable pressure on him to validate those targets given that monetary aggregates were outstripping them quite dracost. maticall y. I think -'-I will cOll1e back to point-that i- is one of the great tragedies the, debate in this country that with that decision all. interest in monetary aggregates also seems to .have been discarded. They do provide yery important evidence on the state of the economy and its likely future trends. I am fascinated that the Treasurer, was ,so ment. relieved to get away from the discipline of those targets back in early. 1985 that he has totally disregarded them ever since. Returning to the substance of the 'Bill, clauses 12 and 13 give effect to the Treasexclusively urer's 1988-89 Budget announcement that the trading bank-savings bank distinction be removed. The Minister for' Industrial EmptyHere point in his second' reading speech that removal of this distinction will enable banks to better use and allocate funds, adopt simple funding and accounting arrangements, and have greater flexibility in servicing their customers. There has been concern' exthe pressed, however, by the banking industry that without further amendment to the Banking Act the integration of savings bank of and trading bank accounts would see the liable to significant stamp duty payof ments. I believe that the Government has undertaken-perhaps this could be confirmed-to give consideration to this matter. I hope that the Government will be able to act to minimise any possible disruption to banking services that might flow from that. The other change announced by the Treasurer in last year's Budget was the phasin ing down of the SRD requirement over three years and its replacement with a system of what is being called non-callable deposits. The SRD requirement was originally deas an instrument of monetary policy as it was an instrument of prudential supervision to ensure the liquidity of the banking system whereby the Reserve Bank of Australia in adjusting the SRD down or 'cQuld add to or reduce liquidity. As a more market-oriented approach to monetary policy became appropriate as part of the process of deregulating and developing the financial system, the SRD lapsed as a tool of monetary policy. As it existed, however, the SRD continued to have a distorting effect on the financial system by increasing the of trading bank lending, because .of the this relatively low interest rate that was paid on of SRD funds, and encouraging banks. to resort to sources other than Australian dollar deposits because the SRD .was defined as a ,percentage of Australian dollar deposits. So its monetary policy intent; if you like, was easily circumvented in a deregulated environThe Government has tried to create the impression that the acceleration in, monetary aggregates over the past six months or soor maybe a little longer-can be explained in terms of a shift back towards Australian dollar deposits and away from will other funding sources such as commercial Rebills, offshore borrowings and foreign currency deposits because of these structural the changes. While I would not deny that that has been an important factor, I personally more think that the Treasurer has written off monetary aggregates, as I said ,before, far too lightly as an indicator of overall strength in economy and of actual and 'potential inflationary pressures.' Although we do not hear much about it any more, the Government supposedly sets its monetary policy having regard to what is called a check list of indicators of which monetary aggregates is still an element. I suggest that any check list ha& been abandoned by this Government as it seems to rely simply on high intere-t rates to deal with our economic problems while it remains paralysed in fiscal wages policies and on the micro-economic reform front. If we look ,at those monetary aggregates over recent days and in recent months, we can see that they are still at disturbingly levels of acceleration even if we allow for the special structural factors that I have identified. They give very clear evidence; as they did back in 1984-85, of an overheating economy. They give very clear evidence that would suggest what we have seen-an acceleration of inflationary forces-and they risk underwriting a sustenance of those inflationary forces through the latter part of this year lind into early next year. The Opposition has consistently stated that its approach to monetary policy will be much more medium term with aÂ· view to getting a stable setting directed at lowering the rate of inflation without the large interest rate swings which we have seen put our economy on some sort of roller-coaster. The' Government has used monetary policy for political purposes, as it did in late 1984, in 1987 and into early 1988. It overheated the economy and pushed it into the fast lane. It then had to reverse its stand on all that, suddenly tighten monetary policy and push interest rates up, and drove the economy through the floor. The economy has gone up as a response to an easing of monetary policy, as it did through 1983-84 into early 1985. We had an exchange rate. crisis and a debt blow-out and so on in early 1985. The Government responded, suddenly slammed on the brakes and drove the economy through the floor, and there was a recession in late 1985 and early 1986. The Government learned nothing from that experience. It came back into the process in early 1987 and, again for political reasons,. eased monetary policy in the run-up to the July election. In the run-up to' the New South Wales election in early 1988, the economy overheated and t\te Government slammed on the brakes again, and we are looking now to see whether the. economy actually falls into recession one more time. It is that lack of a medium term apolitical stable orientation to monetary policy that most offends the Opposition. It is interesting to note that two senior Government Ministers in recent days have drawn attention to this particular feature of our economy. Senator Walsh has conceded that we are in danger of overkill in the present circumstances. We are in danger that the economy will slip into recession one more time. He is one of the more honest members of the Governhigh ment. I am fascinated that his honesty seems to break out every time the Treasurer goes away. I think that is rather good. Senator Walsh is a good man: He has been honest enough to admit that the economy is well on the roller-coaster with a very big, a very real, risk-he used the word 'danger'-that it would slide into recession in. the latter part of this year or early next year. Yesterday we had an interesting comment from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin), another Treasurer-aspirant in this place. He made the following very interesting statement: I must say I am a bit perplexed about the swings you get in the exchange rate and interest rates at present and how you handle all that. And I am quite sure industry-primary industries and the mining industry-are finding it very difficult to handle that at present. And I am very much talking off the top of my head here now, but when you have a dollar that goes up to 87 and goes back to' 74 and you expect people to trade in that environment, I think we have all sorts of concerns at present. That is another manifestation of the problem of running an unstable monetary policy. If Â·we run unstable economic ,policies, we will get an unstable dollar. The dollar rocketed up to the high eighties from the early part of last .year through to the early part of this year as the Government tightened monetary policy as its sole policy instrument, drove interest rates up and those interest rates pulled up the dollar. It is only in the early part of this year, wit- the Treasurer deciding to talk the, dollar down, that the nexus between interest rates and the exchange rate has been broken. The dollar has come off by about 18 to 20 per cent since its peak in the early part of this year against the United States dollar. It is that instability that Mr Kerin is talking about, and it is a direct reflection of the way the Treasurer has chosen to overpoliticise monetary policy, to run a short term politically-oriented monetary policy rather thanÂ· a medium term apolitical stable monetary policy. I will return to the Bill and make some remarks about those provisions which give the Reserve Bank specific powers for the establishment of prudential requirements. To a large extent the Reserve Bank's prudential supervisory role has been conducted on an informal or a cooperative basis with the banks as the Reserve Bank has not'had any specific legislative power to carry out its supervisory activities. With financial deregulation bringing a much larger number of banks and a much more competitive and dynamic environment, it seems reasonable-and we support'this-that a more formalised set of prudential arrangements be put in place. I guess that through most of the past few years the Reserve Bank of Australia has lived' in hope that none of its formal procedures in relation to prudential supervision would ever be tested under the law, and so I think the formalisation of the legal basis of that power is very important, from the Reserve Bank's point of view. However, the inherent danger is that such powers might be the pretext for re-regulation, which impairs the efficiency gains from financial deregulation and lessens the dynamics in terms of the new products and instruments which have been part of financial sector deregulation. I do not want to state that too lightly. It is a very serious point. Having gone so far down the track of financial sector deregulation, where we are now enjoying the benefits of new competition, a new range of products, more international orientation and greater sophistication and professionalism in financial markets, we do not want to put that at risk by abusing the power of prudential regulation-which really pulls back a lot of the efficiency gains that are there in that process. We have come a long way down that track and it is very important that we monitor the situation so that it does not go too far back the other way. In saying that, I am not seeking to downplay in any way the seriousness of the Reserve Bank's role in ensuring the stabiHty of the financial system and the players in it, and therefore needing that prudential supervisory power. The other point that I want to. make in relation to this area is ,that the Treasurer seems oblivious to the fact that the Reserve Bank has such a crucial role in maintaining financial stability, and for most of the time seems to have seen his role as being able to push the central bank and interest rates around wherever he likes. Of course, 'the Treasurer gave himself away in that classic comment made at the January balance of payments press conference, which was heid on 16 February, when he said, in relation to official interest rate movements and the role of the Reserve Bank: They do what I say, I can assure you of that. These rather unfortunate remarks go to the core of what I in particular, and the Opposition in general, have been trying to raise as an issue, namely, the likely appointment of the replacement of: the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bob Johnston. I have specifically avoided commenting on or pointing to any individual"" unlike the Treasurer, who has referred to individuals in this process. I prefer to concentrate on the fact that the new Governor will be responsible for a range of highly specialised functions, such as the prudential supervision that we are talking about in this legislation today, as well as, of course, the oversight of foreign exchange money market and other financial market interventions by the Reserve Bank, the conduct of the bank's domestic operations in money and securities markets, its activities in international markets, note issue and so on-a whole range of currency and banking operations. It is a very specialised job and it calls for a very specialised background. It has been our very strong view that a Canberra bureaucrat, or aTreasury bureaucrat in particular, would be precisely the wrong sort of person to put in that sort of job. The other main concern in this area relates to a long term concern of mine, going back to papers that I wrote in the late 1970s an.d early' 1980s, about the need for an independent Reserve Bank. I think the independence of the Reserve Bank is a very important issue, and, it is an independence that has manifested itself in a number of ways over the years. I think, importantly, for example"" it is essential that the Treasurer, whoever that may be, should have independent advice; the Treasurer should be able to get independent advice on the economy. We see so many differences of opinion' as to where the economy is and where it is going. I thinkÂ· that a Treasurer gains a lot from having the Reserve Barik play the role of a very strong independent adviser in the process of policy formulation, and for the Reserv'e Bank to play that role I think that someone with a non-Treasury, non-Canberra bureaucracy type culture, mentality and approach is very important. Particularly,. the Reserve Bank should be able t6 give a-vice from a monetary policy financial system point of view and very specialised advice as well. In relation to the powers of investigation: that are referred to in the Banking Act, clause 16 of the Bill repeals those sections of the Act which require the Auditor-General. to investigate the affairs of each bank periodically and replace those provisions with a power for the Reserve Bank to arrange for an investigation of prudential matters relating to a bank. In addition, clause 17 provides for the Reserve Bank to seek information from a bank about an individual customer, if such information is required for prudential purposes. On balance, itÂ· would appear that these proviSions. of the Bill serve a very useful purpose-and I think an essential purpose-especially in the. event of an episode such as we have just had with the stock market crash. The provisions allow the Reserve Bank to inquire into the banks' exposure to particular high risk clients, be they individuals orÂ· institutions. Nevertheless, it is the opinion of the position that the Bill does not contain adeimportant quate safeguards to prevent the Reserve Bank from indiscdminately using its powers. I will therefore beÂ· moving an amendment which requires that the Governor of the Reserve Bank satisfy himself that a report on prudenthere tial matters in relation to an individual bank or an individual.customer of a bank is essary. This appears to me to be both sensible and practical in that it seeks to ensure that such investigations .will not be underthe taken lightly and that the interests of comgiven mercial and individual privacy are proteoted. It recognises, however, that the very speciwhat alised nature of central banking activities such that the Reserve Bank remains the best equipped to make that sort of judgment on such matters rather than having an umpire from ,outside the bank. As an extra safeguard, the amendment will ensure that the Reserve Bank reports each year in its annual report on any investigations, giving due regard to the confidentiality of individual banks and their customers. Finally, it would appear that the other provisions of the Bill are basically uncontroversial,Â· although some may require monitoring or perhaps periodic review to ensure that gains from financial deregulation are not being impaired by these wider Reserve Bank powers. The other minor provisions of the Bill relate to the provision . of statistical returns. They update. the penalty provisions throughout the Act. They amend section 66 concerning th- use of the word 'bank' so there will now be an unambiguously stated set ,of circumstances in which an institution can refer to itself as a bank. Under our system of prudential supervision the Reserve Bank stands effectively behind banks, because it prudentially supervises banks. It does not necessarily stand directly behind other financial institutions. So, the use of the word . 'bank' has a very specialised role and it does convey a very specialised message, particularly to small investors in the financial systemOther small provisions relate to specific powers to control the establishment of representative officers of international banks in Australia-an area: of some neglect and, some might say, abuse in recent years. It is gpod that that matter is being formalised as well. OpHowever, I think that monitoring would be in those areas in relation to the arrangements for the collection and publication of statistics, for example, which are determined through regulations rather than spelt out. in the Act. It is important that be adequate consultation with the banks over any changes in statistical forms, in the nec-' interests of certainty and efficiency. In the few minutes remaining to me, I will comment briefly on What I imagine will be focus of the other side of this debatethe list of speakers that we have. In this regard I shall direct some .remarks to the Treasurer has been doing in recent is days in attacking the banks. I might as well head off the criticism that I expect to be made by honourable members opposite. They will seek to characterise me as an apologist for the banks. Having been a bank director, having worked in the Reserve Bank, and having a particular financial bias, I am sure that that will be the attack. We will hear words, such as the old Jack Lang term, I think it was, 'banksters', and that sort of thing. One sees how far Jack Lang's protege, Paul Keating, has gone in this regard in terms of the extent to which he has gone out and beaten the banks in recent days. Let me give a few examples of the Treasurer's sort of populist diatribe. For example, on the World Today program of 17 April, the Treasurer said: As soon as they see some of that profit growth being threatened, they are Qut there squealing like stuck pigs on television, every time they get a chance. Mr Hand-What's wrong with that?",22
15,Dr HEWSON,BANKING LEGISLATION,"I will get to it. On the AM show of 19 April, the Treasurer made an attack on Nobby Clark of the National Australia Bank Ltd. The Treasurer has said that Nobby Clark should go back behind his desk and has made various other colourful character references in relation to Nobby over recent months. His comment on the AM show was: If he wants to put up interest rates in the National Australia Bank, if he wants to squeeze his customers, that's Mr Clark's responsibility. What we have here is this Pontius Pilate of a Treasurer trying to wash his hands. The point is that he carries direct responsibility for what has happened to interest rates in this country. If one did a technical analysis of the link between the cost of funds to the banks and the banks' movements on home loan interest rates, for example, one would see evidence that they have actually delayed increasing those home loan interest rates obviously, I suggest, under both public and private pressure from the Treasurer to do so. Yet the Treasurer publicly beats the banksbashes the banks-and seeks to distract attention from what is a monumental failure in his own economic management. Interest rates are where they are because the Treasurer put them there. He has put interest rates high. That is the sole instrument of policy that the Government has these days to deal with an emerging balance of payments, inflation and foreign debt crisis. Every time there is bad news up go interest rates, and the Treasurer ducks and weaves and shoots the messenger. Every time the banks announce an increase in interest rates one of their members, particularly Nobby Clark, seems to get shot. It is just like when the Australian Statistician brought down the consumer price index with an increase in housing costs which the Treasurer did not like: that messenger got shot too. We have seen the Treasurer, and the Acting Treasurer, in recent days, attacking Moody's Investor Services Inc - another messenger, bringing news about the deterioration in our economic circumstances, attacked as being unprofessional or naive. Mr Hand-That is fair and proper. You would say the same thing about Moody's if you were the Treasurer.",28
16,Dr HEWSON,BANKING LEGISLATION,"No, it is not, and the Minister knows it. These devices are an attempt to attack a reputable organisation which has expressed a thoroughgoing, analytical view of what it fears about the direction in which this economy is going. The point I make is evidenced most explicitly by the Minister at the table. . It does not matter who has warned this Treasurer and this Government over the last 12 months about the fact that economic management is slipping through their fingers-whether it is Moody's, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the Economist Magazine, Barry Hughes, the Treasurer's old adviser, or the Governor of the. Reserve Bank of Australia on three or four occasions-the Minister has consistently shot the messenger and stuck his . head in the sand as if there is no problem. There is a fundamental problem, and people in the community know there is a fundamental problem. They have a pretty clear idea when they get hit with a 17 per cent home loan mortgage rate that something is fundamentally wrong. When they see this Government persist with a low wage, low productivity policy they know that the Minister has no answer to their questions. Mr Hand-You blew it totally on Sunday. You let the cat out of the bag.",28
17,Dr HEWSON,BANKING LEGISLATION,Who blew what? Mr Hand-The cat is out of the bag.,28
18,Dr HEWSON,BANKING LEGISLATION,"There are no cats out of the bag. My point is that the Government without answers and relies solely on inrangements creases in interest rates. As those interest rates go up the Treasurer, in particular, takes cheap shots at the banks as if it is their when clearly it isÂ· not.",29
19,Mr SCIACCA ,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Bowman) (11.43)-First of all, I want to thank the honourable memhas ber for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the shadow Treasurer, for at least being prepared admit that this Government has taken steps towards financial deregulation. I am glad that he supports this legislation or, at least, of it. I note he said that it was inevitable that financial deregulation would occur back in 1982-83, and it would just happen as a matter of course. It should never be forgotcurrency ten that the previous Treasurer, the honourbeen able member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard), had as his chief adviser the present sha:dow Treasurer. If the shadow Treasurer was adquired vising in that way at that time, obviously the then Treasurer was not taking much notice. Nevertheless, I thank the honourable member for the support that he has given the Government, the pat on the back that he has given the Government in saying that it is going down the right track and for virtually saying that he would be doing the same thing if he ever had the opportunity of omy. getting into office. Contrary to what he says, I will not get stuck into him personally beyet cause of the fact that he happens to be heavily involved in the banking industry. is fine. No doubt he knows what he is talking about when he talks about the technical pects of the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill. I am a lawyer, not an economist, and want to look at this situation in the way most people in the community would look at it as far as the banking industry and question of financial deregulation are conestablished cerned. Obviously I support this legislation before the House. It is another step towards the deregulation of the financial markets, particfinancial ularly the banking industry. It is a process which, as I have previously said, this GovAustralia ernment has courageously undertaken in the last few years. The legislation will provide the Reserve Bank of Australia with formal authority for the prudential supervision of banks, remove the distinction between tradis ing banks and savings banks, make the arfor the collection and publication of banking statistics more flexible and, most importantly in my view, replace the statufault, tory reserve deposit (SRD) requirement on trading banks with a new non-callable deposit requirement on all banks. There is no doubt that in the past the SRD requirement had a detrimental effect on the financial system because of the liquidity situation that to sometimes occurred. It has included such detrimental effects as the increase in trading bank interest rates. It has also encouraged most undesirable activity such as funding bank operations through sources other than the Australian dollar deposits, for example, commercial bills, offshore borrowing and foreign deposits. The SRD requirement has phased out over a three-year period and is being replaced with a system of noncallable deposits which banks will be reto maintain with the Reserve Bank as part of their obligations as authorised banks. These new arrangements, which are now being given legislative backing, represent an important step in the process of financial deregulation, with a view to increasing overall efficiency and viability of the banking industry, thus allowing banks more opportunities to contribute to the broader econAs I previously stated, these reforms form another part of the financial deregulation of the Australian banking industry, someThat thing which the honourable members opposite-a1though they now say they agree with asit-were not prepared to do in the 30 years bar three they were in power. They never I had the guts to do it. At least, for the that moment, I am very happy that the honourable member for Wentworth is supporting the these reforms. The Hawke Government has a financial atmosphere which, one would have thought, has been very beneficial to those banks operating in Australia. The message has come out loud and clear to the community that the ball is in its court, so to speak, and that major banks in now have the opportunity to market their products competitively without those onerous regulations in the interests of their shareholders and, more importantly, in the interests of their customers. We should never forget that the interests of the customers of banks must be of paramount importance. The Bill deals with prudential supervision of the banks by the Reserve Bank. I want to deal today not with a direct attack on the banks just because I want to attack the banks, as the honourable member for Wentworth suggested that some of us on this side of the House would do. Rather I went to deal with the question of why, perhaps, this sort of legislation is necessary. It is necessary so that there is prudential supervision of the banks and the banks do the right thing not only by the rest of the financial community but also, most importantly, by. their customers. There has been a lot of attention focused lately on the general performance of the banking industry so far as interest rates are concerned and, generally, in the provision of an efficient, satisfactory service to their customers. I want to discuss in some detail a number of matters which are of deep concern to me and, no doubt, to the general public and colleagues of mine on this side of the House, concerning the overall performance of the banking industry in this country. Before doing so, I want to make it quite clear that I am not going to attack and criticise the banking industry as a whole but, rather,. some of the more greedy banks, notably 'the National Australia Bank (NAB), which was mentioned by the honourable member for Wentworth before, and its multi-media, selfpUblicist and Chief Executive, Mr Nobby Clark. The honourable member for Wentworth can defend his mate, Nobby Clark, as much as he likes, but the fact is, as I will show in a few moments, that Nobby Clark is the sort of person that we really could do without in the Australian economic community. I doubt whether there exists in this community at the moment a more potentially destructive force in the financial community than this media seeking individual. He seems to take pleasure in being the forecaster of economic gloom and doom. He continually talks down the Australian economy and indulges in predicting the future in such a way that one could be excused for thinking that the man has some political axe to grind against this Government. Indeed, his whole demeanour is such that it leads one to believe that he sets about forecasting certain events and then deliberately sets about making sure that his forecasts become reality in one form or another. As everybody, including the honourable member for Wentworth, would know, financial markets are very fickle. There can be very serious gyrations in the dollar value, in interest rates and in a lot of other things because of rumours that sometimes are circulated in the financial community. The sorts of things that are said in the media-and I am sure the honourable member for Wentworth would agree-sometimes create a lead for the financial markets which then sets their agendas for the day as to whether they will push the dollar or bill rates up or down. It would n.ot be unfair to say that some of the problems of the Australian economy are not helped by the incessant ramblings of people such as Nobby Clark and those who like to talk the economy down all the time. Unfortunately, this is done quite regularly by the Opposition. On 31 March 1989 in the Sydney Morning Herald Mr Clark is quoted in an article headed 'Bank Boss Warns Hawke', by Karen Maley and Tom Burton, as follows: Home lmin interest rates could rise again to 16.5 per cent-and bring down the Hawke Government-the managing director of the National Australia Bank, Mr Nbbby Clark, said yesterday. He also said interest rates in Australia would remain high compared to the rest of the world until at least the end of the next year . . . Other major home loan lenders distanced themselves from Mr Clark's comments last night. Westpac's chief manager of retail banking, Mr John Morris, said it was far too early to say that home loan rates would definitely go up. In this article he forecast that interest rates would go to 16.5 per cent. Last Friday, when it was announced that the Reserve Bank was lifting its bond rate by 0.3 per cent, Mr Clark immediately led the charge and announced that the National Australia Bank would raise its home loan rate from 16 per cent to 17 per cent-a whole percentage point, .e.7 of one per cent more than the increase announced by the Reserve Bank. Presto! Mr Clark's prophecy of 31 March comes to fruition. This action obviously puts pressure on the other major banks to follow suit. It is not only that that causes interest rates to go up. Although I am not an economist, I know that the Government's monetary policy has again. something to do with it. But it is not only the Government that is to blame. The banks have a responsibility to home owners to abcent. sorb some of these increases. Whilst no other banks will follow suit, other major banks, such as the Australia and New land Banking Group Ltd (ANZ)-which might be forced to increase its home lending rate; I do not know if an announcement has been made as yet-seem to take a more responsible attitude. For example, last week, while Mr Clark was telling everyone who was prepared to listen that home loan intermisery est rates had tq increase, notwithstanding massive profit for that bank of $531m, Mr Will Bailey, the ANZ chief executive, quoted in the Courier-Mail article as espousing a different attitude. The article, which was headed 'Home rates to stay: ley', stated: Melbourne.- The ANZ Banking Group Ltd had no plans to raise its home loan rate, the group executive, Mr Will Bailey, said yesterday. Mr Bailey said the Federal Government's monetary policy was starting to work and the economy had shown signs of easing. If monetary policy was biting, interest rates not go up, he said. 'As far as we are conc.erned at ANZ, we right now there is no immediate likelihood of an interest rate rise', Mr Bailey said. Current home loan rates are mostly at 16 cent, but the National Australia Bank Ltd's ing director, Mr Nobby Clark-there he is againsaid a 16.5 per cent rate was inevitable within the next few weeks. 'Data I have seen recently suggests the economy is cooling a littlethis is Mr Baileythat monetary policy is starting to work, and we will make decisions down the road according to its success,' Mr Bailey said. A respected large bank in this country says that the policies of this Government are beginning to work and expects that in the very near future they will take effect. But we have Nobby Clark tugging away at one end, which creates problems within the financial community. As soon as there is a small in.crease by the Reserve Bank, the profiteering banks such as the National Australia Bank start to talk about increasing interest rates There was absolutely no need for the latest increase in home interest rates to 17 per It is obvious that 16.5 per cent was the doubt .maximum to which they should have gone, following the 0.3 per cent rise in the Reserve ZeaBank rate. Indeed, 16.25 per cent would have been more than adequate, given the enormous profits announced by major banks over the last several weeks. Nobby Clark's National Australia Bank, whilst not the country's leading bank, has now become the leader in imposing financial hardship and on Australian home owners and stands a condemned for its selfish and greedy profiteering actions in leading the charge to set was home loan interest rates at 17 per cent. Yet another example of this doom and Baigloom merchant can be found in an article by Glenn Stanaway in the Brisbane Courier Mail of 22 May 1989. It concerns an atchief tack-justified, I think-by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) on the National Australia Bank chief for forecasting an economic slump. We forever see Nobby Clark trying to talk the economy down. We forever see Opposition should members, including the shadow Treasurer, doing the same, and hang what it costs to believe the poor old home owners. They do not want to save home owners an increase of one per cent on home loan interest rates. per One per cent is something. It is a lot of managmoney to the small people out there. The article states: The Treasurer, Mr Keating, yesterday blasted the National Australia Bank chief, Mr Nobby Clark, for predicting an economic slump and higher interest rates. Mr Clark said he believed the first six months of next year would be 'very difficult', and that Australia definitely faced a downturn, but not a recession. He forecasts the May balance of payments figures would be 'horrific', hitting as high as a $2 billion deficit, and the trade deficit would stay serious. Mr Clark said he felt home loan interest ratesnow at an average 16 per, cent-would go to 16.5 per cent soon and the business rate would also rise. Mr Clark reminds me of someone who predicts the end of the world and who would be happy when it actually happened. He is an incredible man. I would suggest to Mr Clark that, rather than taking a morbid sense of delight in spreading and encouraging bad news, he look to how his own bank is performing and its own general banking practices. I say that because of the provisions of this legislation relating to prudential supervision. I refer to an article in the Bulletin of 16 May 1989 headed 'Interest rate shock looms' by Stuart Kennedy, which reflects directly on the National Australia Bank. It states: The National Australia Bank is carrying out an urgent review of its small business, rural sumer loan portfolio pending a new policy of disdegree. closing interest rates to borrowers on statements. Some borrowers will be in for a shock when they scrutinise their new, revealing bank statements. They may be unaware that they are paying interest rates approaching 30%. ' The NAB recently undertook a sample survey .of interest rates being applied to its customer across Australia and found instances of borrowers' being charged a margin as much as 10.5% above indicated base rate ofÂ·around 18.75%. The base is used in bank advertising of its loan products and forms the benchmark for borrowing negotiations . . . The bank is worrie<;l about fallout from customers who suddenly, discover that their rates are way the advertised base. 'It is imperative that no unwelcome disclosure results,' writes Don Argus, the executive director (banking) in an internal (jirective obtained by The Bulletin. The memo was sent to an 'NAB state manilger them. early last month. In it, Argus expresses concern over negative media coverage of banks' interest rate practices and impending credit protection legislation from federal Consumer Affairs Minister Nick Bolkus. The banking industry through its lobby group Australian Bankers' Association, wants to ward the more onerous provisions of the legislation intro(lucing its own set of disclosure standards. Banks are wallowing in record profits,set last year. The NAB logged a 62 per cent profit increase 1988, to $531, mHlion. Even more exceptional are expected in the half-yearly res-lts. Analysts tip t,he industry to try to camouflage profits by manipulating bad and doubtful debt provisions. The banks are increasing interest rates every opportunity because they see that conber_s ditions and monetary policy are tight.",29
20,Dr HEWSON ,BANKING LEGISLATION,That's it.,32
21,Mr SCIACCA,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Yes, I have admitted that. It seems that some of the banks are prepared to prop up and subsidise their bad debts, but I do. sometimes measured in millions of dollars, by penalising the battlers in the community. I will not have time to discuss the amount of money that banks loan to entrepreneurs and to people who are worth billions of dollars. If the banks lose that money, they lose itl What the hell! The banks can get an extra one per cent over the rate that they should be getting from home owners. There are no problems. The banks can blame the Government;. they have the Opposition blaming the Government. The banks say, 'It is not our fault', but we all know that it is and conthe fault of 'the banks, at least to some The honourable member for Wentworth would have to agree that interest. rates on home loans-given the massive profits made by the banks-do not have to be at the level they currently are. I want to speak on the banks' policies on base lending. One area in which banks have a lot to answer for relates to the way that they the market their products at exorbitant interest rate rates to the ordinary consumer. Some stark examples include offering credit card facilities to children, offering Bankcard facilities to virtually anyone, irrespectiveÂ· of their caover pacity to pay, and failing to advise them properly of the high interest rateS that apply NAB's to this type of facility. Generally, they fail to advise their clients properly as to their financial obligations under agreements with In times past, before financial peregulation. and before the advent of foreign banks, to get money from a bank manager one had to the go begging on one's J<nees; one virtually hadÂ· off to convince the bank manager that one did by not need the loan. Now people walk in and the banks throw money at them. The banks know that there is plenty of money in the in economy and that they can charge any sort levels of interest. Some people who are desperate and who would like to be able to get that money really do not care about the repayment situation; in many instances, others are not told about it: The banks throw this at money as us. I could show honourable mema stack of credit cards. Thankfully, I. do not use them all, but they are very easy to get. There are no problems. Possibly, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member forW-ntworth, does not need credit cards, I want to refer to interest rates before my time expires. I will cite the transcript of an Australian Broadcasting Commission AM program on 29 May 1989 which I think says it all. The transcript, which is titled 'Commonwealth Bank and ANZ Bank to decide whether to increase their home mortgage interest rates', quotes Peter Thompson as follows: The Commonwealth and the ANZ banks met this week to decide whether to follow the lead of the National Australia Bank and Westpac and increase their, home mortgage rates to an all time record 17 pe- ,cent. The banks say they've been given no choice but to increase their rates again in spite of recent healthy profit 'results. They argue that mortgage rates must increase because they're paying out more for their deposits, but are they? Here's our economics correspondent, Peter Martin. Peter Martin said: This time two years ago, the typical rate on deposits in a statement savings account was 11.5 per cent. Since then the general level of interest rates has fallen and then risen, the rate offered to depositors has ended up lower, down to 9 per cent. But' the rate to mortgage holders is sharply higher, up from 15.5 two years ago to 17 per cent. lh plain terms deposits are costing the banks less than they were, while mortgages are earning them more. But thars not the way the. banks told the story while announcing their half-yearly profits. Westpac's Chief Executive, Stewart Fowler, was reported as saying: The consuiners never had it so good. I do not know how he works that out, but that is what he said. Peter Martin then said: It's true that the Reserve Bank figures don't tell the whole story-for many depositors the whole story is worse. They're now paying bank charges that cancel out, or more than cancel out, any interest they would have earnt. What do we do now? If we go toa bank,' we pay overdraft rates, unused overdraft fees, transaction fees and loan application fees. They get us every way, they can. Every service that was provided free of charge now must be paid for. I accept that the monetary policy of this Government at present is tight. Unfortunately, it has to be tight, because we are worried about the economy. We are not' playing politics, as is the Opposition. The fact is that the banks have a responsibility to the Australian public. to keep interest rates down as much as they can and they should be starting to look after their customers rather than their big, bulky profits, which they keep increasing from year to year. It seems that they pay scant regard to the poor old customer out there-the poor old person who needs the banks; those people who are forced to go to them cap in hand.",32

23,Mr ROCHER ,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Curtin) (12.03)-ln his opening remarks, the honourable member for Bowman ( Mr Sciacca) said that he was not an economist but a lawyer, and then went . h f' on' to prove It. More t an hal hIS remarks consisted of quotations from newspaper artic1es, carefully selected to verify that he is a' lawyer and not an economist.' He even took up the popular call of criticising Mi Nobby Clark, an eminent banker in this country and',' whether or not we agree with his views, a man' who has shown over recent years that he is capable of forecasting what is likely to happen in this country. The honourable member referred to the Australia . and New Zealand Bankmg Group Ltd as an entity that has adopted a different approach to recent increases in mortgage rates for the time being. But, of course, we know that' that will be only for the time being. Thehonounible member ignores the fact that the Commonwealth Bank, the GovernI ment's own bank, could not wait to jump on the band wagon and stick up interest rates to 17 per cent. The Treasurer ( Mr Keating) is in control there; he is the chief executive of the Commonwealth Bank. If he did not _want the bank's interest rates to go up, he could have said, 'Keep them down, Charlie.' But the' Commonwealth Bank's interest rates went up. T-e. State gover?ment banks could not Walt to Increase rates by 1 per cent. But then we hear the honourable' member for Bowman singling OIit Mr Nobby Clark, a decent, respectable and honest banker in this country, for that sort of selective criticism. The Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 represents a further step in the direction of the deregulation of, the Australian financial system. It implements changes that were announced at the time of the last Budget. Many of those changes were not before time. The Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System report, which recommended some of these changes, was first commissioned 10 years ago. Ironically, we are debating this legislation in the shadow of an increasingly intense campaign by the Australia Labor Party to blame the highest interest rates in the world on the Australian domestic banks. Does the Labor Party really expect us or anyone else to believe that the Australian banks are any more greedy for profits than their foreign counterparts in countries where interest rates happen to be much lower? Indeed, while the large Australian banks are competitive and profitable, other sections of the banking and finance industries are not doing all that well. Yet the reason for the higher profitability in some sections of the finance industry is not that they charge high interest rates and rip off the community, as honourable members opposite would have us believe; it is their efficiency in serving the interests of their customers. The deregulation of the Australian financial system, which began under the stewardship of the honourable memb-r for Bennelong ( Mr Howard), has contributed significantly to the enormous growth in the range of services available to bank and non-bank customers. The present high interest rates cannot be blamed on the banks, which are only responding to Government policy and market conditions. A couple of days before this latest increase we had the spectacle of the Treasurer on television issuing an open invitation to the banks to raise their interest rates. Indeed, if he does not keep those interest rates up, we knowÂ· that we will not be able to balance the books, given the debacle that the balance of trade and the balance of payments figures verify. This legislation will have the effect of removing a Government imposed burden on the banks that led to some of those higher interest rates. The regulation of Australian banking has a long history dating back to the over-regulation of colonial times. So strong was the hand of London in restricting the development of commercial banking in the colonies that Australia's first bank, the Bank of New South Wales, was established illegally. This heavy hand has, in many respects, only just been lifted. Until the Labor Party was defeated in 1949, the Australian financial sector lived under the threat of bank nationalisation. For many years the function. of the central bank and a government-owned trading and saving barik operation were combined in the Commonwealth Bank. The establishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia as an independent central bank represented an early and very limited step towards removing the financial system from direct government tampering. The then long term goal of achieving a truly independent Reserve Bank, capable of offering a timely critique of government economic policy and removing monetary policy from short term tinkering, is still some way off, sad to say. The recent comments of the retiring Governor of the Reserve Bank to the national conference of the National Farmers Federation admitting past mistakes in estimating growth in the economy, which led to inappropriate Government policies, only reinforce the image of cloistered economic policy makers under the excessive influence of political consideration. Too much debate about economic policy direction in Australia takes place within the confines of the bureaucracy and government without the consideration of Parliament or adequate information for an informed public and for informed scrutiny. The assertions of the Treasurer that the Reserve Bank does what he tells it to do provides this House with little comfort, especially when we observe the disregard with which the Treasurer treats this Parliament. I will return later to the relevance of this legislation to wider considerations of monetary policy. The Bill will enhance the role of the Reserve Bank in imposing prudential requirements on the private banks. The role of the Reserve Bank in this context will be on a more formal basis, which is outlined in the legislation, and there will be a new power for regulation in this area. There is a good deal of evidence to suggest that strict government enforced prudential requirements do not protect depositors and investors while at the same time fostering the incentives for banks to maintain their liquidity and position in a competitive market. The minimum prudential requirements can effectively become a maximum condition, thereby removing the security of a bank as an entity providing competition between banks which are under the supervision of the Reserve Bank. Since the Reserve Bank makes certain guarantees of deposits in the banks, it is obliged to ensure that guarantees will not be called upon. However, there is a danger that prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank will provide the avenue for a more general re-regulation of the financial system. This reversal of recent trends should not be lowed to enter by the back door. The Govrevenue ernment does nothing to assist the acceptance of a deregulated system by encouraging the hysterical hostility towards banks and against high interest rates which are necessitated earlier failings of Government policy. Associated with the formalising of prudentain tial requirements for the banks are new powlevel ers of investigation for the Reserve Bank which will allow it to investigate the acon counts and records of a bank. This gative power will extend to the ability to obtain information about individual accounts for prudential purposes. The Government does not have a good record in protecting the privacy of information about individuals. I remind honourable members opposite of the recent example of the affairs of Mr Laupolicy rie O'Connell being leaked to the press by an employee of the Australian Taxation Ofnues fice in Perth. On top of that we have seen the debacle with the tax file number, with the easy access to private information tax file numbers by people not entitled them and expressly excluded by the tion from having accessÂ· to that information. In the light of what is a lousy Government record, the amendments which the Oppo&ition will move during the third readiIlg debate tq. ensure that. this power is restricted to situations where the information is essential to the Reserve Bank fulfilling its duty uphold prudential requirements are worthy of the .support of the Government. The legislation also implements the Budget decision to remove the distinction between trading banks and saving banks. The division between trading and savings banks within the large banking groups has become .largely artificial in any case. As the Government has pointed out, this change will allow for greater efficiency in the delivery of some banking services and will allow the banks to compete on equal terms with non-bank financial instirelic tutions. Another measure which will similarly imcredibly, prove the competitive position of the banks by removing an unjustified government imNevertheless, post is the replacement of the statutory serve . deposit (SRD) with non-callable deposits. The old SRD required the banks to deposit money with the Reserve Bank, which held the funds at very low interest rates, alproducing as much as $IOOmÂ· per annum in for the Reserve Bank. That money represented a significant cost to the price of funds attracted by the banks and inevitably contributed to anÂ· interest rate structure by higher than would otherwise have been the case. The Government has decided to maina system of compulsory deposits at the of one per cent of a bank's liabilities. However, these deposits will represent a drain the resources of the banks which is much investiless than they presently absorb. The SRD was designed as a tool of monetary policy rather than simply a statutory reserve requirement for banks. It was used to manipulate the liquidity of the financial system by expanding or contracting the funds available to the banks. Asa tool of monetary it had a particularly distorting effect by giving advantages to institutions and aveof funding which were notÂ· subject' to SRD requirements. The removal of the SRD as well as the old liquid government securiand ties (LGS) ratio was recommended by the to Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the legislaAustralian Financial System. The role of monetary policy in deregulated financial markets has become the subject of political debate, as our absentee Treasurer desperately seeks excuses for his economic mismanagement, particularly in that area. I to remind the House that, while interest rates in Australia are amongSt the highest inÂ· the developed world, money supply growth, according to any measure of money supply, has exploded. The Treasurer's defence of this state of affairs last week-and the defence changes as it suits him-was that it was not possible to control monetary growth in a deregulated financial system. InÂ· other words, . when convenient, the Treasurer will mischie. vously blame deregulation for his ownpolicies. The Treasurer argues that a fetish with monetary growth and monetary targets is a of the past which is no longer relevant in a deregulated firiancial system. Quite inhe argues that he has no real policy tools to influence monetary aggregate. real growth in the narrowest remeasure of monetary growth, M1, has been very high indeed. Clearly, the Government has a good deal of influence over the note issue and components of that aggregate. There can be no denying that. Labor long agb abandoned monetary targeting. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) referred to that. It - llowed an ?pening up of room for allegatIons of polItIcal considerations playing too large a role in monetary policy. The argument that targeting is not compatible with deregulation of banks and the removal of SRD or LGS type requirements is very tenuous. Professor Michael Porter, in his rerJort for the Campbell Committee, wrote: Targeting and market-based exchange rates go hand in ha-d. Indeed, a major argument for monetary targetmg concerns the need to anchor expectations regarding prices and exchange rates. At the heart of his analysis is the argument that both deregulation and the discipline of monetary targeting must go hand in hand. The Treasurer's dismissal of concern about mon-tary wowth and his in-bility to come to - nps With monetary targetmg is both fallaCiOUS and very dangerous indeed. The Treasurer's objection to monetary targeting in reality is founded in his need to use a short term manipulation of monetary policy to make up for the virtually across-the-board failures of Labor economic policy. The long term monetary stability which is essential for genuine economic growth and which was the claimed objective of deregulation is not convenient for a Treasurer when he wants to hide from Australians the depths of the problems we now face. For the deregulation process, which this .; legislation continues, to have as much success as it might, that deregulation and de; politicising of the financial markets and monetary policy must continue a lot further than this Government is willing to take it. The information available to economic commentators, the public and practitioners in financial institutions must be maximised. Indeed, we would probably see much less speculation of th- unheal-hy kind with our currency if that mformatIon were made available. We need scrutiny, not just of the private banks but also of the Reserve Bank and those who dev-lop economic policy. The IO-year-old advice of Professor Porter is again illuminating in the light of some of our present problems. He advised: If the authorities find the signals confusing, they should share their confusion, including confusion regarding their own intervention, in some detail. The paucity of us-ful information we receive regarding moneta-y policy amounts to a policy of protecting the advisers. Protected monopolies grow lazy, even With the most aggressive attempts to infuse new blood into their systems. There are gains from trade, not just in commodities, but in ideas for economic policy. With the close role which our present Treasurer admits to having in developing policy-we should remember his words-the monetary authorities do what the Treasurer tells them to do. The protection of this paucity of information also amounts to protecting the Treasurer and the government of the day from proper scrutiny. The amount of information available to those interested has increased, of course, since Professor Porter wrote that valuable advice, but so has the propensity for authorities to use that information to attempt to influence or manipulate the expectations and directions of the mark-t. - s the Banking Legislation Amen-ment Bill imposes new procedures on the private sector to ensure openness and that proper information is available, so should such requirements be placed on the government of the day. The Bill omits one vital element of financial deregulation which should be addressed by the Government, but it cannot be because of the ideological straitjacket in which the Government has wrapped itself. The continued government ownership of the Commonwealth Bank is a standing affront to the principles which the Government claims are its virtue in removing unnecessary government involvement in the financial sector. The Commonwealth Bank's overall performance is nowhere near as good as that of the private banks, other than in certain specialised areas. Its relatively low returns cannot be accounted for by the special benevolence of the Government's own bank, the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank's interest rates are as high as those of other banks, although its returns to other depositors do not always compete with those of the private banks. The Commonwealth Bank suffers from the public sector malaise. It suffers from restricted growth and a shortage of capital; it suffers from the lack of genuine competition with other banks for the support of shareholders; it suffers from the ultimate featherbedding of support from a Government which Cl;l.n. never let it fail; and it suffers from the inability of this Government to produce the privatisation which many of the senior staff in the bank know that the Commonwealth Bank desperately needs so as to compete effectively. Labor has again and again failed the test in micro-economic reform when faced with the opposition of the trade union movement.",33
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,BANKING LEGISLATION,Mr Blanchard)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,37
25,Mrs JAKOBSEN ,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Cowan) (12.23)-It is a great pleasure to follow the honourable member for Bowman ( Mr Sciacca) in this debate. It is a shame that he is not here to hear me acknowledge his speech, which was very good. Whilst I do not intend to insult or abuse Mr Nobby Clark, I believe that the banks do have some responsibility to their customers and to the community which is not necessarily being reflected in their approach to interest rate increases. The activities of the banks are particularly topical at the moment, given their obvious profitability and considerable consumer concern over their operation and their role in setting interest rates. This Government has presided over an unprecedented change in the operation of banking in Australia. Most honourable members would be aware of the fact that the banking system was freed up under this Government and that we have had the introduction of foreign banks during our period in office. That was not a universally accepted position amongst Labor supporters, some of whom did not want foreign banks here in the first place, and these people are now saying that the problems we are experiencing may be related in part to ..these changes, but I do not believe that is the case. A number of elements of regulation are available to the Government and to the Reserve Bank, one of which is being discussed in the legislation today. To a degree, the legislation therefore continues the trend of offering up a change in the banking system, in that it will extend the powers of the Reserve Bank as the preserver of standards in the domestic banking industry. It will also alter the requirement for statutory reserve deposits and remove the distinction between trading and sayings banks under the Banking Legislation Act. The alteration to statutory reserve deposits was a reasonably good way of freeing up the banks' capital, although in present circumstances, when we are trying to reduce demand, i.t may have been better if we had waited a little longer before making the alteration. I am not sure how it will go, but IÂ· think that to have waited longer would have caused some contraction in the bank-' ability to lend . money. The prudential requirements relate to such matters as the adequacy of capital held by the banks, the structure of assets and liabilities, the management of exposure to risk and the capacity of directors and senior management. The existing prudential arrangements have worked reasonably well in cooperation with banks, but the freeing up of the system in recent years has brought in many new players and increased competition, as well as offering a greater range of services by banks. It is advisable, therefore, for the Reserve Bank to have a clearer statutory basis for its supervisory role over new banks. I point out, as did the honourable member for Curtin ( Mr Rocher), that there have been some fairly spectacular problems in the banking system that have had to be controlled by the intervention of government at one level or another. That is indicative of the changes to the banking structure that we have seen and illustrates the difficulties that banks can run into if there is not a proper supervisory system. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) implied in his speech that Australia was heading for a recession as a consequence of the prevailing interest rates strategy. This is just not true. As he knows only too well, Australia's economy is growing very strongly in all areas, including job creation, housing construction, manufacturing industry and investment. In keeping with all this activity, demand for money is extremely high. Demand for imports is also continuing to add to our foreign debt and high interest rates, of course, are Â·a response to the continuing demand for money in the economy. In maintaining a tight monetary policy the Government is being very responsible and is endeavouring to put the brakes on the economy, to slow down domestic demand in a gradual fashion, so as not to trigger a recession. We succeeded in doing this some years ago and are confident of doing so again. A slowing of domestic demand will reduce the call on money and,' therefore, will steady interest rates. While bank bashing is not a particularly helpful exercise, it is understandable when people see interest rates going up at the exact time when banks are making such big profits and declaring their profits in the community at large. It is interesting to see that the banks are trying to redress this misunderstanding in the community of their rol<t by having a fairly high profile advertising campaign. I am not sure that that will win them too many friends, even so. Monetary policy has had an impact on interest rates as, of course, it is designed to. However, I would sound a note of caution to banks, as did the honourable member for Bowman, and encourage them to delay as long as possible the passing of interest rate rises on to established borrowers, because it is the new borrowers who have to be discouraged from taking out a loan at present. Interest rates should be affecting new borrowers, as the other people have already contributed to demand in the economy and are not really asking for a great deal more. I would also encourage the banks to seek sympathetic and realistic solutions to the difficulties which some of their home loan customers may be experiencing. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, some State governments have introduced home loan assistance schemes designed to help families experiencing difficulty as a consequence of mortgage interest rate increases, with Western Australia having an excellent scheme. The State Minister for Housing recently indicated her concern that some people are still not aware of the scheme's existence and are therefore not accessing it when they could. I agree with the honourable member for Bowman. It is a shame that the banks have put their interest rates up by one per cent, even though I absolutely recognise the import of that decision in slowing down demand. It seems inexplicable to most of their consumers when previous movements in interest rates have been only a half of one per cent. The truth is that borrowers do not trust banks. That is a long-standing position in the Australian community. It is not a position that we will be turning around overnight and it is not one that banks' advertising campaigns will turn around overnight either. Hence the call by consumers for a bank ombudsman. I point out to the House that, whilst Westpac introduced a bank ombudsman of its own, at that time di/icussions were proceeding with other banks for an industry ombudsman funded by the banking industry. I think that is a better way to go and that is , the way the Minister intends to proceed. In the consumers' minds the difficulty with the Westpac option is that the ombudsman does not appear to be independent from the bank. It would only be a way of putting problems onto another individual and not necessarily addressing them in an independent fashion. There is even resistance within the community to the option of a bank industry funded ombudsman because of fears that that person would not be independent either. But I am certain that, if the Government were given a proper agreement, an independent person could be appointed to that position and, hopefully, he would have the power to overview the banking system in a brpader way than has been able to be done to date, with a view to seeking solutions to some of the problems that are evident in the community in regard to credit extensions. Many people believe that the banks are trying to rip them off by charging them for services which were originally offered free of charge, and this is part of the distrust which is also evident in the community. The range of credit available to consumers is mind boggling and must be seen to have had an impact on the continuation of and increase in demand. There is no way that we can avoid that conclusion. Recently I was able to participate in a discussion with representatives of the banking industry. They seemed unable to accept the criticism that ordinary people appear to be subsidising large borrowers as well as the development of services, such as electronic funds transfer, that customers at the coal face do not want or need and that may be deleterious to their financial position, given that it operates on a debit basis. The funds for that service would be coming directly out of the customer's account, often without providing any ability to stop, review, or rethink the necessity of a purchase. Many people in the community are concerned about the role of banks in our society today. The charging for frequent access to low balance accounts impacts far more on poor or low income families than it does on those who are able toartange their affairs to avoid such charges. I mention in passing the ability of higher income people to pay their accounts monthly, which stands in stark contrast with those on low incomes who are paid fortnightly and, therefore, have to access their bank accounts frequently, usually through automatic telling machines, to pay small accounts as they fall due. Obviously that increases the number of times people will access what are very small accounts and this imposes greater charges on those people. Under normal circumstances, those are the people who cannot afford to pay. That same sort of quarantining occurs with the credit card system-the Bankcard system if you like-where people who can afford to pay their accounts in full within one month do not have the interest rate applying to their borrowed money. I recognise that this is something the Government and the banking system are trying to deal with at the moment. It is not a popular position. Actually, I do not support the change in credit arrangements. Nevertheless; it is an anomaly in the present system-one for which low income consumers are being forced to pay. Some banks are still advising pensioner customers that they should keep their money in cheque accounts so as to avoid the income test on pensions. I find this a particularly difficult problem to deal with because it is an absolute nonsense. Pensioners may as well be earning interest on their money because the social security system has a guideline that people can be assessed on foregone income. So if it were proved that pensioners had put their money into a cheque account simply to avoid e-rning interest, it would be as if they had earned the interest anyway and the income test would apply. So I think the banks have some problems in dealing with what essentially is a low income, high credit arrangement. Customers certainly have difficulty in dealing with it. I do not say that they are incapable of doing it properly but I believe that there should be a proper supervisory mechanism at two levels: the independent ombudsman level and the Reserve Bank level. After all, the Reserve Bank has played a very strong role in the area of regulation and supervision in the history of Australia. I would like to see it continue to do so.",37
26,Mr IAN CAMERON ,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Maranoa) (12.36)-Today it is my pleasure to support the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill, which deals with the banking industry of Australia. There is no doubt that the banking industry affects practically every Australian; not too many of us are in the lucky position of not having to use a bank. We have seen the mess into which our economy has nosedived under the leadership of the 'world's greatest' Treasurer ( Mr Keating). Unfortunately for the Australian Labor Party, I believe that its term in government is finished. It is up to honourable members on this side of the House to put forward some constructive policies to get Australia out of the mess that it is in. Mrs J akobsen-That would be a change, Ian.",39
27,Mr IAN CAMERON,BANKING LEGISLATION,"I am suggesting that that is the Opposition's role in life and it will be our role even more from now on because we intend to come into government at the next election. Of course, we will have to pick up the scraps from the disaster of the Hawke-Keating reign in office in what once was a great country. Unfortunately for us, in my opinion, some of the policies that this Government has adopted over the reasonably long period that it has been in office haye not been for the good of Australians in the long run. That is the position we are in today. The latest quarterly figures show-we do not have to debate it one way or the other as the figures are there in black and white-that our net overseas borrowings are now $103.95 billion. In the last three months we have seen a $1 billion increase in Reserve Bank of Australia borrowings and that figure includes State borrowings. The amount of money that has been borrowed overseas by corporations such as Telecom Australia as well as by private enterprise organisations has gone up $7 billion in the last three months; We do not have to argue against those figures that have been announced today. We are continuing rapidly down the path towards a banana republic, about which the Treasurer told us some three years ago but has done nothing to stop. So we are' really sliding backwards: It is a great pity because not only are we seeing a continuing increase in our overseas borrowings but also we are once again in a catch 22 situation where we are seeing the price of our dollar plummeting. Of course, that will automatically increase the'price that we have to pay for the money We have already borrowed. As a result of the $104 billion that we have borrowed overseas, the Australian dollar has fallen from about US82c or US83c to US75c in the last 10 days. Those lower currency rates will mean that we will have even bigger interest repayments on our overseas borrowings. Our economy continues to deteriorate and our balance of payments figure continues to run at record, levels. We are talking about a ,figure of about $1.5 billion, or even up to $2 billion a month. In simple, terms, such ,a balance of payments situation means that we are spending on imports up to $1 billion or $2 billion a month more than we are receiving from exported goods. With the falling dollar on top of that, it is much harder for us to pay back the money that we have already borrowed. This legislation seeks to amend the Banking Act 1959. Obviously, there are a number of small adjustments. The penalties are to be increased. I guess the most important change is the abolition of the statutory reserve deposits (SRDs) which have been used by the Reserve Bank over a number of years to contro- our economy. Most 'free enterprise' countnes have a central banking system that controls their day to day economic activities. The Reserve Bank's role is exactly that. The SRDs are fixed amounts which trading banks had to put into the Reserve Bank. In effect, each bank had to put aside a fixed amount which was withdrawn from ,circulation. When the Reserve Bank wanted to increase the level of liquidity in the system, it released those funds. That built up' the amount of money in the economy and forced down interest rates. The statutory reserve deposit requirement is now being abolished. It is being replaced by a one per cent charge on the liabilities of banks. The banks are now being charged by the Reserve Bank one per cent on the amount of money they have borrowed. They are being paid 5 per cent interest on that money while the Reserve Bank lends it out at perhaps 17 per cent-the sort of interest rate now being offered for two-month treasury notes. This is the sort of policy that the Bill puts in place. 'Deregulation' is the grC?at in word of late: The banking system is being deregulated in' terms of this one per, cent charge oJ:? liabilities. I have had discussions' with people from the National Bank. We are not too sure what the money will be used for, but we do know that private enterprise banks receive only 5 per cent interest. The liabilities of banks are adjusted on a monthly basis. I guess the Reserve Bank would argue that, as part of the reform of the banking system, SRDs should disappear. I used to joke with a former Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard), about SRDs being used to free up the economy. Being a farmer, when interests rates started to rise I used to ask the honourable member for Bennelong to get into the ' SRDs and put a bit more money into circulation. This is not happening now. The' Treasury is' now using monetary policy to control the economy. The economy is hot deregulated; it is totally controlled by the Reserve Bank through interest rates and long term bond rates. The Reserve Bank sets bond rates. The present lO-year bond rate in Australia is 14 per cent and the lO-year bond rate in Japan is 5t per cent. That shows the difference in the health of those respective economies. I know it is probably a bit tough to compare Japan with Australia all the time, but it is a Pacific nation and it was bombed to the ground in the last war. We happened to win the last war, but we could be excused for wondering sometimes., Our economy is about one-third as healthy as that of the Japanese.The two-year rate is 16 per cent and the rate for the shorter treasury notes is up to 17 per ,cent.",39

30,Dr HEWSON,FOREIGN DEBT,"I refer the Acting Treasurer to today's Australian Bureau of Statistics release revealing that our gross foreign debt rose to $128.6 billion at th- end of March and our net. foreign debt stood at over $103 billion. Will the Acting Treasurer inform the House how much of. the increase in foreign debt since December has been due to the fall in the Australian dollar and how much has been due to the further deterioration in the balance of payments? Further, is it a fact that there is now in prospect a substantial blow-out of debt in the pipeline in the current quarter due to a further fall in the exchange rate since March and the prospect of further substantial current account deficits in May and June?",41
31,Mr DA WKINS,FOREIGN DEBT,"To answer the specific question of the honourable member for Wentworth, the Statistician has estimated that the consequences of the weakening of the Australian dollar since December 1988 have accounted for $1.6 billion of the crease in the debt. The rest of the increase would relate to the current account effects. I will not make any speculation about what might happen in . the next round of statistics. The. Statistician produces these statistics that we have an accurate measure is happening on the current account and what is happening to the gross external I do not think it is: for me to make any predictions about what might. happen in the next period. However, it is important to get some the facts into context. The Prime Minister earlier today went into some very great deservice tail about the composition of the debt. I line passengers? think it is important to underscore the fact that the largest component of the debt is private debt; that is, debt that has been incurred by Australian companies. That debt is being serviced by Australian companies and therefore it is quite wrong to say-as members of the Opposition are wont to doto that this is an obligation which rests on Australian taxpayers or Australian families. This is an obligation which has been entered into by Australian companies, and those companies will service that debt as a result of their normal commercial activities. The extent of that net private debt now stands at $63 billion. . . . , It is also worth making the point that in the last few years there has been a very considerable expansion in the level of Australian company assets overseas. Indeed, in 1982 the overseas equity of Australian companies was only about $5 billion. That figure has grown since 1982 to almost $40 billion. In considering the question of the extent of private debt overseas, it is also worth bearing in mind that Australian companies during the last five years or so have accumulated. enormous assets overseas. That is important not only in terms of the collateral for their debt but also in terms of the contribution to theÂ· Australian economy by the earnings of those assets. Currently, those assets owned by Australian. companies overseas account for a little over $2t billion a year. The figures on the debt, of course, are matters which the Government is concerned . about. Indeed, the whole policy is directed towards managing the debt and ensuring that the debt can first be stabilised and then inreduced. However, it is also important to remember that these figures reveal a great internationalisation of the Australian economy, an internationalisation which did not occur under the policies of our opponents so but which we have been encpuraging and of what will continue to encqunlge. : debt. AIRLINE PASSENGERS: TELEPHONE NA",41
32,Mr GRIFFITHS,SERVICES,Can the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support of confirm media reports this morning that Australia is inyolved in a global satellite to provide telephone servicesÂ· to airMONICA,41
33,Mrs KELLY,SERVICES,"I thank the honourable member for Maribyrnong for his question. I hope he will be one of the first users of the service. I can assure him that it will be secure. I can confirm that the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) is be a partner in a global aeronautical satellite communication service that will be available late next year. France Telecom, Teleglobe Canada and OTC signed a multilateral agreement this morning in Montreal with SITA, a telecommunications. and information service cooperative owned by more than 330 airlines in 180 countries. This will provide direct dialling calls to anywhere in the world for airline passengers. OTC will spend $31m on building two ground earth stations in Western Australia; two more will be built in France and two in Canada. All six will link up through the International Maritime Satellite Organisation, INMARSAT. OTC's satellite dishes will be designed and builtÂ· in Australia and will use radioastronomy technologies developed for the Australia Telescope. So this service will be very important for telecommunications and for scientific research in this country. Passengers will be able to make secure direct-dial calls to anywhere in the world from their seats and without reqUiring any assistance from cabin crew. The calls will.be paid for by credit card. Obviously, it will be up to individual airlines to decide what equipment is to be provided to their passengers. The possibilities for this aeronautical mobile satellite service, as it is called, are enormous. Passengers might be able to send and receive faxes,and it will be possible to set up a range of in-flight services for customers, such as reservations. There are important safety benefits too. I think this is a wiry important side effect of this system. An aircraft's captain will have a top priority voice communications channel at all times through the system. An option will be an automatic dependence surveillance facility which could send continuous sport data bursts from an aircraft to control towers giving precise, instantaneous information on the aircraft's position. The possibilities are there, too, for supplying information on weather conditions straight to the aircraft from stations all over the world. Obviously, this Government is placing considerable emphasis on upgrading aircraft safety and on increasing passenger comfort. We are increasing spending in these areas enormously. The Civil Aviation Authority is receiving more than $71m under its safety contract with this Government this year and will also spend about $240m over the next seven years in modernising the air traffic services infrastructure. The Federal Airports Corporation has committed $451m. to upgrading our airports. This added OTC benefit will enhance not only passenger comfort but also aircraft safety, and I want to congratulate OTC on this very important development for Australian technology. NA EmptyHere urer to the further increase in our, net foreign debt and ask: What is. the percentage of the value of Australian export income now required to service our foreign debt? I also refer the Acting Treasurer to a chart he tabled on Monday showing the link between imports and spending and ask by how much imports will have to decline to accommodate the current level of debt servicing.",41
34,Mr DAWKINS,FOREIGN DEBT,"I am not sure whether there has been an up to date calculation on the figure that the Leader of the Opposition first mentioned, but it is quite an easy calculation to make and I will make sure that it is made for him. That is one of the statistics often used toÂ· make international comparisons. The most recent figures I Â·have for the debt servicing ratio in terms of interest as a percentage of exports is for 1987, but I will try to find the honourable member a more up to date figure if one exists. The 1987 figure was. 16 per cent down from the 1986 figure which was 19 per cent. Perhaps it is worth making the comparison that the figure for the United Kingdom, which is a country with which the Opposition frequently likes to make comparisons, for 1987 was 19. per cent compared with our figur- of 16 per cent. The figure for Belgium was 22 per cent compared with ours of 16 per cent. I am not quite sure what point the Leader of the Opposition is trying to make, .but I think that this is probably part of the continuing scare mongering campaign which the Opposition has engaged in in order to try to belittle Australia's circumstances. The Leader of the Opposition went on to refer to the chart that I tabled earlier this week which indicated the sensitivity of imports t9 changes in domestic demand. Again, he asks me to make a prediction, a forecast of what level of fall in imports would' be necessary to achieve a particular result. I am not in the business of making those kinds of forecasts. The reason for tabling that' document was not to make a forecast about the future, it was designed to indicate to the 'Opposition, and to anyone else I suppose who wanted to refer to it, how,by reducing demand, which the Government is now determined to do, there will be a very rapid falling off of those. imports which are price sensitive. About 90 per cent of our imports are price sensitive. We expect a very rapid decline in imports and that will, make a major contribution to balancing the current account. NA PACIFIC REGION:",42
35,Mr CHYNOWETH,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the impact of Australia's industrial relations on our relations with the Asia-Pacific region?,43
36,Mr HAWKE,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As is well known, this Government has sought to promote cooperation and consultation between employers, trade unions and government in this country. That was in contrast to the policies that were adopted by our predecessors until 1983. The results of our policy of cooperation' and consultation have been reflected in the fact that under Â·this Government industrial disputes are 60 per cent lower than they were under the previous Government. I think it is a matter of interest, and I would hope pride to all members of this House irrespective of where they sit, that the success and the value of the joint efforts by government, employers and trade unions in Australia have been noticed and recognised in the region. Indeed, flowing from discussions that I was able to have earlier this with the President of the Republic of Korea in the Republic of Korea it Was agreed that Australia would send a tripartite delegation to Korea so that we could explain to it, as it wished, the development of industrial relations.policy in Australia since 1983. The delegation consisted of the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), Mr Simon Crean; Mr Bert Evans of the Metal Trades Industry Association Inc;,a very prominent employers association; and' Dr Gatnant. That delegation of three went to Korea two weeks ago. It had an hour's discussion with the President of Korea. After discussions with the President it held lengthy discussions with the Minister for labour and his officials and with the federation of Korean trade unions and management. Following those discussions there is now in prospect the possibility of further exchanges between the Republic of Korea and Al,Istralia in' this area. I am pleased to say that Eresident Roh has written to me and is commending the Australian delegation. I am interested to hear the sort of rubbishing that is coming from the other side. Members of the Opposition would not begin to have any pride in the fact, that a tripartite Australian deiegation has been invited to Korea to explain the operation of Australian industrial relations. I would have thought that even members of the Opposition with their pettiness. and small mindedness would see that this initiative is spmething which should be a matter of pride for all Australians, but obviously it is beyond them. President Roh has written to me commending the delegation for its professionalism .as well as for the timely assistance it has rendered to the Government, the employers and trade unions in Korea. It is interesting that after members of the delegation went to Korea Mr Crean and Mr Evans-from the ACTU and the Metal Trades Industry Association-visited Thailand. A labour relations .seminar with 400 participants was held representing government, employers and trade unions. The significance of that seminar, which seems to escape those opposite, is that it was opened and addressed by Prime Minister Chatihal of Thailand. Following that seminar the two gentlemen-Crean and Evyear as-subsequently met with Thai union and employer groups separately. I round off by saying that these two visits to the Republic of Korea and Thailand were very successful, as is noted by the response we have received from the leaders in those countries. I believe that they are evidence of a new era 'of cooperation with our neighbours. It would' be stupid to seek to impose gratuitously some sort of pattern from Australia on those countries, but I believe it should be a matter of deep satisfaction to all members of this House, as it is to me-at the beginning of this Government it would have been impossible to imagine-that we would have been invited to go to Asia to talk about industrial relations. Industrial relations is another area of the deepening of cooperation between our country and the region. NA",43
37,Dr HEWSON,INTEREST RATES,"I refer the Acting Treasurer to his statement in the House yesterday that the typical home buyer will lose over two-thirds of the 1 July tax cuts-that is $11 of the minimum $16 a week tax cuts-as a . result of the one per cent increase in mortgage rates, from 16 per cent to 17 per cent. Is it a fact that since the Government announced its intention to reduce taxes last May, the home loan interest rate has increased by 3.5 percentage points which will leave the Acting Treasurer's typical home buyer, on his own figures, $22.50 a week out of pocket even after his $16 a week tax cut?",44
38,Mr DA WKINS,INTEREST RATES,"The honourable member for Wentworth was extraordinarily selective in what he decided to quote in reference to what I said the other day. I did refer to the fact that a minimum payment would come to families as a result of the wage tax package of around $16, but that is far from being the typical amount which the average family will receive which will be much closer to $30 than the $16 that the honourable member referred to. I also said at that time that it was quite misleading of the Opposition put around the view that all households, families will be affected by the most increases in mortgage rates. I referred to the fact that some 40 cent of householders live in houses that own and therefore they will be unaffected. referred to the fact that 30 per cent of home buyers are protected by the 13+ per cent ceiling. That is not to express in any way any lack of concern for those people will be affected as a result of any decision by the banks immediately to pass on the effects of the interest rate increase in creased mortgage repayments. In the past banks often have not immediately increased mortgage repayments levels, they have tended the life of the loan or undertaken gains tax? some other change and, in almost all cases, they have dealt sympathetically with the circumstances of people, taking into account the particular circumstances of individual families. Because the rates have been at 16 per cent for some time the effect of the increase from 16 per cent to 17 per cent, as I said, will be $11 if there is an immediate impact on the level of repayments. The point I was trying to make the other day was that there will be substantial assistance to average families coming from the family package, which will be payable as from July. I might just make the point, however, that the Opposition seems to be in some disarray over its attitude to the tax cuts. I noticed the other day that Senator Stone, the shadow spokesman for finance, is now contradicting the remarks of the shadow Treasurer and in fact implying that the Government should reconsider the question of tax cuts. Apparently Senator Stone is suggesting that those tax cuts should not in fact be paid. lam not sure what the attitude of the Opposition is to this question, or to many other questions. Ido know, however, what the attitude of the Government is, and that is that we are firmly committed to making those tax cuts and increasing payments to families. NA",44
39,Mr COHEN,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,"Is the Acting Treasurer aware that many young people who purto chased land after September 1985 with the all intention of building a house on that land recent and who, for any number of reasons-such as not proceeding with their marriage, or divorcing, or having changed their plansper then decided to sell the land now find that they they have to pay capital gains tax on that I sale, thus reducing their capacity to purchase their first home? In almost all cases, the people affected are either sole home or first who . home buyers and their lanq purchase was usually the first step in acquiring that home. Was it the Government's intention to catch inthese type of people in the capital gains net? the If not, will the Government consider amending the legislation to ensure that these types exof transactions are not subject to capital",44

41,Mr SHARP,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,"Is the Minister for Transport and Communications aware of the battle by Camov's Ultimate Freight Services to have containers packed by members of the Transport Workers Union of Australia or the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia shipped from our waterfront? Is it true that for the past 22 years the Waterside Workers Federation has refused to allow containers to go through our waterfront unless they were packed by its own union members? Is the Minister aware that these containers, if packed by Waterside Workers Federation members, cost $600, compared with less than $400 if packed by members of other unions? Will the Minister ensure that containers packed by workers other than Waterside Workers Federation members can be shipped from our waterfront in the future?",45
42,Mr WILLIS,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,I am aware of the circumstances of the matter raised by the honourable member. The issues that he raises are issues which will be addressed by me in a statement to the House tomorrow.

43,Mr FITZGIBBON,MEDIBANK PRIVATE,"Can the Minister for Community Services and Health inform the House what benefits would accrue' from the privatisation of Medibank Private, and what would be the consequences for Australia's health care system of abolishing the Medicare levy? Mr Tim Fischer-I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. Taking into account your ruling late last Tuesday, r draw to your attention the second half of the honourable member for Hunter's question which clearly relates, as things stand, to a hypothetical matter-the a\:)olition of Medicare. As such, I invite you, Madam Speaker, to rule that part of the question out of order. Mada- . SPEAKER""':""'-I suggest that the Minister be careful about the second part of the question.",45
44,Dr BLEWETT,MEDIBANK PRIVATE,"The first part of the question is interesting enough, so I will address myself primarily to the issue of the privatisation of Medibank Private. It does seem, of course, that in a rather desperate effort by Opposition front bench members to somehow make their policies congruent with the demands of the shadow Treasurer they are producing increasingly illogical statements. For instance, it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning that the honourable member for Tangney, the shadow spokesman for health matters, has said that the Opposition will make savings in health spending but that the changes will not cost anyone more. Let me say at the start of what is probably going to be a long debate that there is no way in which savings can be made in the health area without costing people more. That is a basic start to the debate and a matter on which we should all agree. It is true that money can be transferred from the private sector to the public sector or from the public sector to the private sector. One can, of course, shift the burden from where it is now, on the better off, and put it more on the middle and lower income earners. Those shifts can be made, but what we cannot do is save money in the health area without costing anyone any more. However, the honourable member for Tangney seems to have a proposal, with his proposition that somehow there will be savings in selling off Medibank Private. I must say that that shows me-and it should show other members of the House and the people of this country-that the honourable member for Tangney knows nothing whatsoever about the health financing area. What possible benefits cO,uld be gained by privatising Australia's largest, most successful, most efficient, . most popular and, above all, non-profit based health fund, Medibank Private? It is not simply my view that there are no gains to government from such a decision; it is the view of the Chairman of Medibank Private, Fred Millar. Opposition members-Ha hal",45
45,Dr BLEWETT,MEDIBANK PRIVATE,"Let me just say a little about' Fred Millar. He is one of the most respected businessmen in the country. He was an appointment made by honourable members opposite; he was a Fraser appointment as Chairman of the Health Insurance Commission. Because he has done such an excellent job, the Government-being a very impartial government in these matters-has kept him on. Let me present to the House his views on the privatisation of Medibank Private. He made these views very clear in the annual report. Mr Shack-Have you spoken to your officers?",45
46,Dr BLEWETT,MEDIBANK PRIVATE,"This can be read publicly-I oan give the date; it is 30 September 1988. These comments are there on the public .record, and let me quote the comments made by the Chairman: Support for the privatisation ofMedibank Private has been mentioned in a number of public forums. Medibank Private is a non-profit organisation based solely on its contributors' funds. The Government has no financial interest in Medibank Private:s assets and reserves. They are the property of the contributors. As no financial gain or other benefits would accrue to the Government or to contributors from the sale of Medibank Private, it is difficult to establish any commercial justification for its privatisation. Tha't is, any savings through its privatisation. He goes on to say: Medibank Private is a successful government business enterprise which operates effectively in the highly competitive private health insurance industry. The majority of support for its privatisationand the honourable member should listen to thisseems to come either from those who are ideologically opposed to Medibank Private or from those who might have a vested interest in its removal from the market place. ' So, let us be quite clear: privatising Medibank Private would gain the Opposition nothing unless the assets and reserves which are owned by the contributors were, in a sense, taken away from them. Secondly, it would deprive any government of an effective window in relation to the private health insurance industry. One of the great assets of Medibank Private is that we have, with the largest private health insurance fund in the country, a major window on to what is going on in the private health insurance industry. Finally, I think one should notice Mr Millar's vested interest. Of course, there might well be benefits private health funds if, in fact, there was an undermining of the effective competition of the most efficient major private health insurance fund in this country.

47,Mr JULL,AVIATION,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement made by the member for Maribyrnong in his capacity .as convener of the Australian Labor Party's National Executive Airline Review Committee that Qantas Airways Ltd should be integrated with Ansett Airlines of Australia. What are the advantages for Qantas of this. arrangement? Have there been any formal. or informal discussions with Ansett Airlines regarding this proposal?, If so, what has been Ansett's response?",46
48,Mr HAWKER,AVIATION,"I am accustomed to getting some surprises from my Party. I must say, with all due respect to my friend and colleague, the member for Maribyrnong, this was another one. He has an extremely fertile mind. Indeed, this is one of his most attractive features; just ask the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. When I saw this reference I thought, 'Well, Alan is at it again'. I congratulate him on his lateral thinking but I have to confess-this may come as some disappointment, but it should be no surprise-that there have been no such discussions. Therefore, I am not in a position to gauge what reaction there would be from either party. I think it is known to the honountble gentleman who asked the question that there are commercial arrangements between the two, which seem to be to their mutual advantage, but as far as I am concerned I have certainly not been involved in any discussions; I know that my Minister has not, and I am not aware of anyone else who has. NA NA",46
49,Mr JOHNS,EDUCATION,"Is the Minister for Employment, Education and Training aware of the report of the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee and the Australian Committee of Directors and Principals of Colleges of Advanced Education on unmet demand for to higher education? Can he advise the House of the implications of the report for higher education?",46
50,Mr DA WKINS,EDUCATION,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, I did see the report from the vice-chancellors and the college directors revealing that the level met demand in higher education appears to be steady at between 13,000 and 20,000, although there have been some changes in various States. There have been slight declines in .New South Wales and Queensland and, I think, a halving of the unmet demand in South Australia. The apparent increase in Western Australia is due more to a change in the definition than to anything else. One of the points which the vice-chancellors and college directors did make was to welcome warmly the decision of the Government to increase the number of places by 6,300 in this year. Indeed, we have not only done that; we have indicated that during the course of the triennium there will be something like an additional 49,000 places created throughout higher education. It is also important to recall that in year the increase in enrolments will be the highest that there has ever been in Australian history. The Government is doing all it can to accommodate the understandable aspirations of so many young people to go on to higher education. It is perhaps also important to recall that there has actually been an increase in the number of eligible applicants. The number of eligible applicants to go on to higher education has increased by 60 per cent. The proportion of those eligible applicants who have been accepted has increased from 72 per cent to nearly 73 per cent. It is important, in this area, to have a planned level of expansion which allows the institutions to accommodate the maximum number of new entrants, and we will continue to do this during the course of this triennium and beyond. The other point which is worth making is that at the moment we are living with a very great increase in the 17to 19-year-old population but, looking beyond the current period to the period 1990-96, we will actually see the number in this age group decline by some 90,000. We have to bear in mind that we do not want to increase the capacity for higher education in a way which will see this capacity unused into the early 1990s. That is why the Government has adopted this policy of planned growth. I might say that that planned growth has been somewhat difficult to accommodate because of the neglect of our opponents during their of unseven years in office when they ran down the capital program almost to a standstill. Therefore, we are trying to accommodate more students in a system which was neglected for so long. We are trying not only to expand its capacity but to rebuild those aspects of it which deteriorated during that time. I notice that the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Flinders, who has got the job that the honourable member for Bennelong thought was so unimportant, indicated that this was a terrible problem which was confronting Australia and that the Opposition would fix it up. Of course, the Opposition's solution to the problem is to have the institutions charging full fees. There is one way to dampen demand for higher education places very quickly in this deed and that is to adopt the Opposition's policy of imposing very high upfront fees which would cut off the opportunities for so many young Australians who we want to support and see get the opportunity of higher education. NA EmptyHere rected to the Minister for Housing and Aged Care. The Minister would be aware of concern at the impact of announced guidelines for aged persons' facilities. Will he guarantee that small nursing homes can remain open and that aged people can remain in their own environment if the three options of amalgamation, expansion or allocated nursing home hours are impractical or inappropriate? Can the Minister also advise the House when he will reimburse nursing homes the millions of dollars they are owed for back payment of wage loadings?",47
51,Mr STAPLES,AGED CARE,"The honourable member for Mallee has an interest in his area in the issues relating to small homes policy. In this policy the Government has taken account of the fact that, in general, small homes-particularly where they are attached to other facilities such as bush nursing hospitalscould not operate effectively under the same funding procedures as a larger, more established home. The Government is offering to those homes the opportunity to look at their structure in their particular environment to find out the best way to accommodate the changes in' funding. For that reason, the Government has indicated there will be a floor for homes of.. under 20 beds which will protect them. The processes we have provided allow f9r the possibility for the community to decide, in consultation with the Department af).d the Government, for amalgamation, extra beds or the development of oth-r facilities iI- conjunction with those small homes. There are other issues to be considered, particularly in Victoria because of the involvement there of the State Government, where there are nursing home beds attached to acute care beds in' bush nursing hospitals. What I can say to the honourable member is that in the circumstances to which he refers there will be an extensive period of consultation with every home on an individual basis between now and the end of this year. What we want to do with each community is have that consultation "",ith members of that community and discuss what they think is the best way in which they can develop a full range of aged care facilities in their community. We are looking at something which was, in the past, ihadequate. Many communities, whether in rural Victoria or more remote areas of Australia, basically only had access to a single facility, and that' is a nursing home. What this Government has done is extend the range of choices available to people in remote areas and in other areas in general and provide for them the full range of services through hostel care-that is one of the options which we will be looking at in those areas-as well as home and community care services. What the Government wants to do for aged care in Australia-whether a person is living in an urban environment or in a rural, isolated environment-is provide the full range of services. Those services, particularly in home and community care, are very important because we are looking to serve the individual needs of that person. That requires, a .lot of cooperation and a lot of innovation which, in the past, has not been there because in the. past many communities just did not have the full ra-ge of policies and resources available to them which this Government has actually made available. As for the people in the communities to which the honourable member for Mallee referred, I can assure him that we will do everything we can to ensure that his constituents and the constituents of other members such as the honourable member for Bendigo, the honourable member for MCEwen and the honourable member for Ballarat, get the full range of aged care. We will do so in direct consultation with them. EmptyHere a point of order. The Minister neglected to answer the second part of the question.",47

53,Mrs HARVEY,PENSIONER MEDICAL CARE,Can the Minister for Community Services and Health inform the House of what action the Government is taking to ensure that Australia's pensioners receive the best quality patient care without being denied access to necessary medical treatment because of cost?,48
54,Dr BLEWETT,PENSIONER MEDICAL CARE,"I welcome the Opposition's decision to support the Government's reforms in the reinsurance' area, particularly its response to the concerns of many of the aged in this community, although I disagree with the Opposition's comment that it was the result of an outrageous scare campaign. I hope that if the Opposition is in a mood for second thoughts, as has been reflected' by this decision, it will give the Same consideration to the issue of the general practitioners' (GPs) fees arrangements,particularly the impact those arrangements will have 0'0 the aged and the less well off. These arrangements are designed to increase Medicare rebates for those GPs who are prepared to take part in continuin- medical education and quality assurance programs and to make vocational commitments. They provide a financial incentive for' GPs to improve their skills in rapidly changing fields. They introduce a schedule based on content rather than on time-based fees. Therefore, the arrangements would enable GPs to spend more time with their patients and better equip them to treat pa,tients' problems without tight time-tiering., It will result in less need for expensive referrals unnecessary ordering of pathology and ratration diology tests. This is very important to pensioners and the old, particularly in relation to the Mediper care rebate. The great bulk of pensioner services provided by GPs are currently b).llk billed. If we look at GPs services provided to pensioi\ers, we find that overwhelmingly those pensioners are bulk billed. To the credit of GPs, 63 per cent of all GP services-not just services provided to pensioners-are bulk billed. Because of the very high level billing by GPs there is a very direct correlation between the level of the Medicare bate and GPs' incomes. The ability of GPs to go on bulk billing their pensioner patients depends very much on the level of that bate. Under the proposals now before the other place we are proposing to make a significant increase in that rebate. For the most common service it will rise by $1.60, from $15.85 to $17.45. That covers 60 million services year. The amount may seem relatively small but, when linked to the number of services provided, it is 60 million. Therefore, it resents a very distinctive increase in GPs' incomes. This arrangement will enable GPs to continue to maintain their bulk billing treatment of pensioners because the rebate will enable .them to maintain their situation and yet provide bulk billing. That ;is a very important issue for the Opposition to consider when it takes of the impact of rejecting or delaying these measures. The Opposition's allies, members of the Australian Medical Association, have been busily running around the country ing GPs to charge the new GP content-based fee levels, while at the same time telling Opposition to stop the measure which will enable the Government to pay those rebate levels. There are some very serious questions to be addressed by the Opposition in relation to any decisions it makes and the impact those decisions will have on the continuation of an effective GP bulk billing service pensioners.

The Department of Community the Services and Health is very conscious of the need to finalise the processing of applications relating to the pre-1 July 1987 period, the date of introduction. In the two States causing most concern-New South Wales and Victoria-timetables are being determined by to the Department for managing the processing of applications. Resources have been dedicated specifically in both States to complete this task by 30 June 1989. Other States will complete processing of outstanding apby that date and that position will In accordance with a long standing policy, positive loadings have been applied over an extended period to keep fees within affordable levels for residents, thus protecting the financial position of residents. Changes to the arrangements from 1 July 1988 to fix resident contributions through the 12-month period, coalescing the statutory contribution, safeguard residents' capacity to meet those fees. It is important when applying a loading policy to adopt an even-handed approach. It should be recognised that in the case of positive and negative loadings there are advantages and disadvantages to nursing homes. NA",49

I doubt whether we would be recalling Parliament, for the wheat legislation, for example. Certainly, there is a series of taxation measures which, if dealt with in the way I suggested, would compel Parliament to be recalled.

63,Madam SPEAKER,DAYS OF SITTING,"I have received 'a letter from the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) proposing that a definite matter 9f public importance be submitted to the House for .discussion, namely; The adverse effect of the Hawke Government's continued complacency and economic mismanagement on Australian living standards. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMONICA",50
64,Dr HEWSON ,DAYS OF SITTING,"Wentworth) (2.52)-In the last year or so I have been warning about the Government's growing complacency about economic circumstances in this country, and I have been drawing attention to what I thought were major weaknesses in its economic management. In recent days I have been describing what is an emerging economic crisis in this country. In the past 24 hours we have received at least three new pieces of data that confirm some of my comments. First, we have reports of a leaked assessment by Standard and Poor's, a credit rating agency in New York, that that comlarge pany ,did not intend to further downgrade Australia's international credit standing this stage. While that sort of assessment welcome, it should be s-en for what it is. the words that were apparently used, it is warning again to be taken on the back the - arning by Moody's Investor Services .Inc. that drew attention to our debt and balance of payments problems. There should be no comfort to the Government in that. It should find no justification for complacency in that. A AAI credit rating simply is not good enough. The risk of a downgrading by Moody's was particularly disturbing to me, but we do not want economic mediocrity this country; we want our AAA rating to restored, and it is up to the Government develop and explain the policies whereby can regain that rating. The Treasurer ( Mr Keating), as we know, has taken a particular stand in relation these rating agencies. While travel might broaden the mind, it certainly has not cleaned up the Treasurer's mouth during the time has been in Paris. Yesterday the air in was again full of colourful anecdotes and colourful character references about Moody's 'lightweight and illogical judgment', 'rank competence or a tinge of malice', 'incompetent judgments' and so on. None of us escaped it, either. The Australian public was brought into question, as was the media. Treasurer referred to the strong reaction in Australia to the Moody's announcement as the sign of a 'cultural cringe'. I find that term interesting, given the personal interests of the Treasurer, such as his Italian suits, Mercedes cars, his French Empire clocks his interest in the great neo-classic cities the Soviet Union. They are the best manifescountry. tations of cultural cringe to which I point at this time. The second piece of data that was released today related to the balance of payments for the March quarter and it revealed three key things. First, consumer goods imports inconfidence, creased in real terms in the March quarter while capital goods imports declined. figures cast further doubt on the Governsponse ment's ,much touted restructuring of the economy-and we have raised many resertime vations about that-and, according Treasurer, that restructuring is based on the pickup in capital goods imports. It is turned in that data. Thirdly, the data reat vealed that, .despite in improvement in the is terms of trade in the March quarter, the In balance of payments position and the debt a position further deteriorated significantly in of that quarter. We saw a couple of record level current account deficits in that quarter. The third piece of data, and the most important, was the debt data that' was released today showing a gross debt of $128.6 billion and a net' debt of $103 billion. Life in the Treasurer's fast lane has now seen our debt level crack tht( ton-$100 billion net. in That is a staggering comment on the extent be of mismanagement by this Government. Of to course, we know who has been left in the we pits-the average Australian worker, the average Australian family. There should be no doubt also that our debt levels are .,:xploding at present. As I implied in my question to to the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Dawkins) today, there have been further, substantial falls in our exchange rate since the end of the March he quarter. We have already had a large April Paris current account figure, and we have the prospect of a very large figure, with market , estimates putting it at around $2 billion, for inMay and perhaps another historic record for June. Our debt level is blowing out from the $128 billion gross that was identified today. The We are right in the midst qfa crisis. As I see it, the crisis involves' a couple of key features. First, the Government misread our economic circumstances quite badly, and it compounded those problems in 1987-88 by his easing monetary policy, effectively for politand ical reasons. There is now a gap of 6 per of cent betw-en demand and production in this A' gap of that, magnitude is a repeat can of what we had in 1974 and in the early post-Korean war, boom days. That is the extent to which demand is outstripping production in this country. Inflation is accelerating; there has been a substantial loss of which is reflected in a falling exchange rate; and, as I said earlier, our debt The is exploding. The Government's sole reto all this has been to rely on interest rates, to push interest rates higher. Every there is some bad news, up go interest to the rates one more time. I wish today to direct a couple of specific questions to the Acting Treasurer because, in the few days this week for which he has been Acting Treasurer, he himself has raised three or four issues to which he has not provided answers. I suggest that he has a responsibility to us, to this Parliament and to the Australian people to do so. First, continues to duck the issue of forecasts, he did in Question Time today. The Governpolicy ment has a responsibility to put down its forecasts. What are its forecasts for debt, inflation, the balance of payments and growth this financial year and next financialÂ· year? It is a simple question, and there must be answer. Secondly, the Acting Treasurer has tried to downplay the Treasurer's amazing admission last week that the tax 'clawed back' by increases in home loan interest rates. The Acting Treasurer was charts. damned in that regard out of his own mouth. His answer in this Parliament yesterd&.y, which I referred in a question today, vealed that the typical taxpayer, the typical wage earner, would be $22.50 in the hole even after the 1 July tax cuts. As a side remark in his answer today, the Acting Treasurer referred to those who will get $30. They will be $8.50 in the hole after the July tax cuts. They will all be in the hole relation to interest rates alone, not to tion bracket creep, inflation or all the things that have dragged people down as the result of Government mismanagement. Is Thirdly, I refer the Acting Treasurer to statement on Australian Broadcasting Comneeds mission radio the other day, when he said: We certainly don't wanHo see the tax cuts go into consumption. But we don't think that will happen. And it's important that they contribute to net ings, if you like, when those tax cuts become able. What a classic. The Government is saying, 'Here are the tax cuts. Give me your vote but, whatever you do, don't spend them. That would make our problems worse.' In all seriousness, how can we expect average Australians to save when they are in such difficult circumstances? Why should they save when the Government's policies specifically discourage them from saving? What is the Government's policy on saving? Is it simply a matter of hope, as was implied in the AM program? Fourthly, I refer the Acting Treasurer to the honesty of one of his colleagues, who seems to have bouts of honesty every time the Treasurer goes away-and I am pleased to see it-Senator Walsh. He talked about the inherent risk of overkill and recession in the Government's stance of sole reliance on he monetary policy. Is it not a fact that the as Treasurer's playing politics with monetary has set this country on a roller-coaster? In 1984-85 the economy was overheated. It came crashing down in a bust period in 1985-86, a period of recession, and accelerated again in 1987-88 through another period an of politically-based easing of monetary policy. Is it not at risk, as Senator Walsh warns, of crashing down at the present time as a cuts will be result of those policies? The Acting Treasurer likes to bring in his I thought that I would bring in mine. I have got a nice little char- here that shows to quite explicitly what I have been sayingretheÂ· very close link between the Government's political mismanagement of monetary policy and the impact on nationalexpenditure demand. The Acting Treasurer came into this House the other day with a chart showing, for example, the link between im1 ports and national expenditure. But the Actin ing Treasurer's chart, as well as this one, menshows that the sorts of falls in imports he other wants came only when the economy moved into periods of very flat activity or recession. it still not implicit in the Acting Treasurhis er's position today that the Government a recession under its policy in order to get imports down in order to turn the balance of payments around? The Government does not have the courage to come out and savadmit it, but it is running a scorched earth availrecession policy. I would not want the Acting Treasurer to miss that chart; there is a copy for him to look at during his remarks. The great irony in all this becomes apparent when we look at the group which has been hurt most under this Government. The irony of the Hawke Government's mismanagement is that the group it has hurt most, the group it has taken most for granted, is the traditional workers of Australia, the people which used to be in its political constituency. The Government has hit those people absolutely to leg in a number of ways. I find it amazing and offensive. The special relationship between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to (ACTU) has sold Australian workers down the river as never before. Let us look at some of the facts. First, Government has run a low real wage, low homes. productivity policy that has hit Australian workers. Real wages have declined in every year bar one of the Hawke Government, and Australian workers have been hit. That is the first way the Government has penalised them. Secondly, the Government has run a very high tax policy, putting many Austramitment lian workers into the 40c marginal' tax rate. The average income earner is square in middle of the 40c tax bracket; he used to be in the 30c tax bracket in 1983. About 25 cent of workers were in the higher tax bracket in the 1983 period; over 50 are there now. That is the second way the Government has slammed the traditional ers wor-er in this country. The third way, as I said before, is that Government has a set of policies that disture, courage savil').gs. The Government begs the traditional workers of this country to get out there and save. But there is no incentive save. There is a disincentive to save under the Government's system. Based ,on conservspecial ative estimates of inflation, for example, effective marginal tax rate on interest in the come for someone on average weekly earnGovernment ings is about 90 per cent according to the Economic Planning Advisory Council in (EPAC) figures. On realistic inflation estigo mates it is probably well in excess of 100 per cent. That is a nonsense situation to someone in. The effects of high; taxes and high inflation have acted together to age savings, a third example of how the Government has penalised traditional worksupposed ers. The fourth is that home ownership has been put out of the reach of the average Atlstralian worker by the Government's exis cessive reliance on high interest rates as a them. cure-all for Australia's economic ills. For example, a person who took out an average sized mortgage this time last year is in h-le by about $160 a month in mortgage payments as a result of the increase in home loan rates since, then. But it is worse than this. The Government's system actually does not encourage people to buy homes; it"" enbottom courages them to buy investment pr,operties, negatively gear them and not live in their own homes. It is a c,entral element of Government policy that it is discouraging its the traditional workers from buying their own Fifthly, there are the so-called superannuation reforms. The Treasurer ( Mr Keating) has run around the country saying that nobody will be worse off. The people worse off are those who do not have good access to superannuation or a defined benefit comunder superannuation-you guessed it: traditional Australian workers. They are the the group that the Government has hit to leg as a result of its superannuation taxes as per well. They now understand the Government's concept of tax reform. It is always per cent new tax- rather than any reform. Finally, the Government has hit the workto leg because it has not solved the basic eco-omic problems. The main reason it has the not done that-why it has not cut expendiprivatised, cleaned up the wharves, cleaned up the waterfront, reformed taxation or significantly cut protection and why it will to never deregulate the labour ,market or do any of the things I have just listed-is the relationship the Government has with the the ACTU. The ACTU and the left wing of Australian Labor Party will never let the take any of those decisions. The bottom line for the average Australian worker this countl,'y is that the Government will on in a very simplistic fashion relying on high interest rates. It will come into this put Parliament, as it has done this week on two occasions, and try to act as if it does not discourhurt. The Government comes up with a whole pile of statistics ,as to why it is not to hurt Australian workers. Nobody will believe the Government. Not one of those workers out there will accept that it does not hurt. They know what the pain and how those interest rates are hitting How long will the Government sustain the mushroom principle in this economic dethe bate? The Acting Treasurer and .the Treasurer always shoot the messenger in denying that there is a problem, suggesting that there is no need for further change. They always duck the issue rather than address it. The line is that this Government has, sold the Australian worker down the river. As one of the labour movement's own, Simon Crean, warned on television recently, there is a level to which interests rates will go. There are other indications as to the extent of the Government's mismanagement which will see it out of office. That is the bottom line. What was the Government's traditional constituency willÂ· vote in droves against it.",50
65,Mr DAWKINS ,DAYS OF SITTING,"Fremantle-Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Acting Treasurer) (3.07)-This debate has now revealed something I have suspected for some time-that the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) has only one speech, and he just recycles it time and time again. Nothing in the honourable member's contribution today added anything new to the speech which he had on a similar topic on Monday of this week. I suppose he will continue to bore the country to death with this constant recitation of his views about the economy. His speech also revealed-not for the first time-the enormous vanity of the honourable gentleman. As if we would be sitting on the edge of our seats waiting for his advice! He has been saying that he has been advising us to do various things. Since he is particularly interested in his advice, I will refer to some of his more recent advice about Opposition policy later on but let me deal with some of the matters that he has raised. They are not new; they are the same issues which he raised earlier in the week-issues which I have already comprehensively dealt with, but if he wants them dealt with again I am happy to accommodate him. The honourable member for Wentworth started off by grabbing on to the observation of Standard and Poors, another credit rating agency, the largest in the United States of America. The honourable member suggested that, when Standard and Poors say that they reconfirm Australia's existing credit rating, in some way that is a warning about a further reduction in our credit rating. This man is no longer interested in just grabbing isolated bits of adverse commentary and using them to whip up some sort of lack of confidence in Australia; now he is even grasping at bits of commentary that say the opposite and trying to use those in a way intended to traduce Australia's reputation. That is extraordinary because oppositions have always got to run that fine line of being critical of the government without actually undermining the country, particularly at this time when we have so internationalised the economy, so exposed it to international transactions and views. It is always very important for oppositions not to cross over that line when they move away from legitimate criticism of government to where they are actually undermining the country. It is quite clear that this shadow Treasurer has forfeited any claim to ever being Treasurer of the country because he has well and truly passed over that line on this occasion. He is interested only in trying to destroy and demolish the international view of the Australian economy. The honourable member says that the Government has been complacent. The Government has been far from complacent. He tries to tell us that these new bits of information come as some kind of surprise to us. We have been the ones who have been pointing to the difficulties this country confronts in terms of the adjustment process, and we have also been the ones who have come up with the policy and adjusted it as necessary to ensure that the adjustment is taking place. The honourable member, in a rather low way, made personal observations about the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) in his absence. I do not intend to respond in a like way, although some wonderful comments could be made about the lifestyle of the honourable member for Wentworth and how out of touch it is with the circumstances of ordinary Australians. But I will leave that for another time and place. The honourable member might have referred to the Treasurer's press conference after his meeting with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Ministers. He said, 'There is not a Minister in that meeting who could make the boast we can make in terms of the adjustment to fiscal policy that we have made over the past five or so years'. There has been an amazing transformation. The situation of enormous debt and enormous public sector borrowing requirement which confronted us when we came into office has been totally reversed. There is now public saving instead of the growing public indebtedness that occurred under the policies of the Opposition; policies with which the honourable member for Wentworth was very closely linked. The honourable member for Wentworth comes here today repeating the claims he has made about the impact of mortgage interest rate increases and the effect that have on the tax cuts. I do not want to repeat what I said in Question Time, but one very important additional point is worth making. The tax cuts are permanent and the increases in interest rates certainly are not, so there will be a very substantial real and continuing improvement as a result of the tax cuts and the family package which will become available to Australians from 1 July. The honourable member then went on to talk about savings. He totally neglected to say that in fact the savings ratio in this country at the moment is increasing, not declining. We have a situation which compares favourably with at least half of the OECD countries, and the change that we are making to the taxation system-the lowering of marginal rates-will in its own way encourage people'to save more. All of the claims made by the honourable member for Wentworth defy reality and defy the very real and substantial changes which have been made in recent years. The honourable member referred to the impact of interest rates on demand. He misquoted Senator Walsh by suggesting that Senator Walsh was saying that a recession is inevitable. Senator Walsh said no such thing; he was simply making an obvious observation about the impact of interest rates on demand and the fact that we must be careful about the way monetary policy is employed in order to curtail demand. I was fascinated to hear the honourable member for Wentworth refer to the period 198 f -83-although I notice that his graph omits to go back to that particular periodwhen imports declined in a period of negative growth, in a recession which was brought on quite deliberately by the policies with which he was so closely associated. He tried to make a comparison between that period and the period ahead of us as a result of the tightening of monetary policy which has occurred. There are some huge differences between what is happening now and what happened in 1982-83., The first difference is that, as the honourable member for Wentworth well know's, it was not so much interest rates that brought about the recession in 1982-83, it was the devastating consequences of the absence of any wages policy. might There was a massive blow-out in wages, which had a crippling effect on manufacturing industry and destroyed whatever competitiveness it had at the time. That was the major factor in bringing about that. recession. The honourable member belittles the relationship we have with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, but he knows that he could never emulate such a relationship and for that reason he is totally devoid of any wages policy. It is because we have a wages policy and because during the forthcoming year wage increases will be restrained to about 6.5 per cent that we will be able to ensure that there is not the kind of recession which was the only remedy, the only policy instrument, that the Opposition could employ in 1982-83 when it was hlst in office. It is possible to manage the situation so that we do not have a recession. The important thing to bear in mind is that it is not just a question of demand, it is a question of production. We will be able to ensure, as we did in the period to which the honourable member's chart refers, that there is a significant decline in demand in order to curtail endogenous imports, because if one looks at that period one sees that production and employment continued to be positive. It is possible to curtail demand without reducing production, or sending production into reverse, as the Opposition did in those years. The important key to that is whether or not we are competitive. ' I respond by tabling another graph, which refers to the indices of competitiveness in Australia. This reveals that we have improved our competitiveness substantially compared with the period 1982-83. It is because we have that competitiveness that, as domestic demand begins to diminish, production will continue, because production will be diverted away from satisfying domestic demand towards satisfying export markets. That was something that the Opposition could never achieve, because in those years the Australian economy was uncompetitive. Now it is very competitive and, therefore, producers in Australia can shift their producwhich tion from satisfying domestic demand to isfying: exports. For that reason we claim quite confidently that we will not have to into recession in order to have the necessary impact on reducing imports. In the last few minutes I have left, it is time to ask the honourable member for Wentworth aJew questions. He has a great alacrity for asking questions of me, and have answered those questions with appromade. priate fulsomeness, but he is not very good at answering the questions we and commenown tators have for him. All we have is his curring alibi that he has been in the job only a little while. He said just a few a,go, on 29 May, when he was asked what the Opposition would do on the question , red\lcing expenditure, 'Look, I have only the job for 10 days'. He quite ignored fact that every since last September he been the shadow finance Minister, with the quite clear obligation to undertake the view' of Commonwealth expenditures which he promised to do and to spell out in great detail what the Opposition was going to about it. On 19 September the honourable member said: "" personally think we'll need to spell out able amount of detail , , , I have disposition to giving as much information as possible-it is a personal trademark', He says it is a personal trademark to provide information, yet he never has given to this point, and I suspect' that he never will 'the appropriate information which he has promised so many times but has failed miserably to deliver. I might say that he was asked a similar question in September last year about what he would do about expenditure cuts, he said, 'Hang on Ii minute, I am new in the job'. He is always ,new the job, and that is his recurring alibi for why he cannot provide the information. The honourable member has a task front of him, a task he has set himself. quote what he 'said last September about what he wants to do: , , ,my own hardline preference would be to for tax cuts totally through spending cuts, the surplus intact. What the honourable member for Wentworth has to do, as a result df setting himself objective, is to come up with spending cuts at least equal the tax cuts which will satbecome available in the course of the next year. He has to provide at least $5t billion go worth of expenditure cuts. I commend him, on his own advice, to provide as much information as possible and to demonstrate his personal trademark which he is so proud about but which he keeps so completely hidden. He has to come up with the lavish I detail in terms of where those cuts will be Of course, he diminishes the Government's record in terms of the very substantial reexpenditure cuts which have been made in for the last several years. He overlooks the fact days that when he last had an opportunity to engage in a bit of cost reduction, the razor of gang came up with a miserable $250m of had expenditure cuts after so many months of the effort and so many promises about how it has was going to slash into expenditure. He now has a little quintet of shadow Ministers who reare to sit down and help him with this task. We certainly wish him well. We certainly look forward with great interest to the exdo position of his personal trademark so that we can see in great detail the $5 billion, $6 billion or $7 billion worth of expenditure a reasoncuts which he has promised. We will be very always had a interested to see them.",54
66,Mr REITH ,DAYS OF SITTING,"Flinders) (3.21)-The Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins), is in the driver's seat. This is Government policy give, and the community is looking to the Government for some answers. Sure, we will flesh out policies over the coming months. But the when hard fact is that the Government will continue to be asked about its management of , the economy, notwithstanding the fact that this House will rise this week and honourin able members will be back in their constituencies, People, rightly, will want to see the sorts of responses that they are looking for in as concern in the community grows about I Labor's economic management. I think that concern is obvious to anybody who simply picks up the paper. I have in front of me pay today's Adelaide Advertiser which has a front and keep page headline '$103,000,000,000'. The Advertiser actually shows us what this amount looks like. I think a lot of people would like this to know what the Government intends to do with this country's debt which has moved from $23 billion, when it came into office, $103 billion today. We have had a very interesting response from the Acting Treasurer but I think, most people, what he said will confirm their worse fears. It will confirm the view of many who have an increasing concern about this Government's failed economic policies the fact that this Government has no soluWe tions to address our real problems. I think balance the Acting Treasurer exposed the inadequacy threatened. of his position when he stood in this House today seemingly oblivious of the fact that, under this Government, tens of thousands young Australians will never be able to ford their first home. In fact, tens of thouask, sands of young people who have to sell the block that they bought a few years ago will face Labor's capital gains tax. The Acting Treasurer seems oblivious of the point made by the shadow Treasurer, the do about it. honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), that this is the Government's policy. Last year, in the by-election results, had a massive rejection of this Government's policies. Why? Because people .do not appreofficial, ciate a government that runs a deliberate low wage policy. This Acting Treasurer and the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) seem oblihave vious of the fact that, when they go round the country boasting about restraint, people take exception to it. People take exception to a government that, through its low prois ductivity programs, runs a policy which sees people's living standards on the decline. Government boasts about it. It says, 'We have done a great job. w.e have encouraged people to tighten their belts'. What a differduce ence there is if we contrast that with our ing! policy position which is to put forward a whole series of constructive measures to something about that declining productivity which has underpinned the declining living staqdards in Australia. Today we had typical, arrogant nonsense from the Acting Treasurer. We had typical, intellectual audacity, inasmuch as he is prepared to come in here and front up to few basic questions that people around the country are asking this Government. The fact is, he has an incapacity to respond to some of the basic issues. The Acting Treasmore urer complained about the honourable memthe up ber for Wentworth putting up questions and to offering him some advice. I say to the Acting Treasurer: some of thy propositions that we have been putting up have been put up by for honourable members on his own side. Last September the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), talking to the Economic Planning Advisory Council about the Budget which he and had recently handed down, said: will not hesitate to adjust policy further if our of payments or inflation objectives are being They are not being threatened now; they are of being blown out of the water. It is pretty affair for the Opposition to come in here and 'How about a response to the Treasurer's statement?'. What we have is the deadly double. The Government has a Budget strategy to reduce inflation and to reduce the current account deficit, so it is pretty fair to ask what went wrong and what it is going to The Acting Treasurer talked about comwe placency. I thought his response was just amazing. Only 12 days ago his own senior the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, talking about the need for some adjustment in policy said that if we do not a strategy of restraint, the Federal Government would be setting the scene for a 'very brutal adjustment of the economy by financial markets'. It is not us saying this; it one of the Government's top advisers. In view of the fact that the Governor of the This Reserve Bank is pointing to the need for some changes, it is pretty fair to ask: what policy adjustments will the Government proto meet that situation? It is just amazHow can the Acting Treasurer come in do hereÂ· and talk about wages policy and the benefits that will flow from it when the Government's wages policy was blown apart by about September last year. Let me take honourable members back to last year's Budget. This year, 1989, was to be the year not of convergence of economic policy and Laa bor's political plans. Honourable members will remember that Labor saw this as some sort of watershed. The Government called it a trade-off. It does not call it a trade-off any because there has been no trade-off. In end, it called it a package. The fact is that Labor had this grand design. With one sweep of a magic wand it was going to reduce Australia's wages growth and align it with that of our international competitors. I must say that that is not a bad policy. In fact, if this Government could achieve it, it would move this country into a new economic situation which would be of great benefit compared with what we have now. The Acting Treasurer knows all about this because he is the campaign manager. The plan was to get things right in the economy and then trot off to the next election. The Acting Treasurer isÂ· very interested in that because his plan is to install the Treasurer as soon as he possibly can after that election result. The fact is that this whole thing is in absolute, tatters. In 1987 the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) said to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) congress that if we cannot align' wages growth in Australia with that of our international competitors, we will be 'in dire economic peril'. It is pretty fair for the shadow Treasurer to put to the Acting Treasurer that his policies are in tatters and to ask him what he is going to do about it. The fact is that the Minister for Transport and Communications was right. Looking at this economy- the reality is that the only apple that' is left to fall into the slot is commodity prices .. Yet we had the acting Treasurer standing up here amazingly saying, 'All is well, all the policy instruments are basically right and we are on track'. The fact is, we are not. Of course, he challenged the shadow Treasurer and talked about defying reality. What reality do we have when the Treasurer is at a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development preening himself about this Government's economic record? The Acting Treasurer talked about fiscal policy. He ought to look at interest rates. He should go to the back of the Economist and see which country has high interest rates. Australia is at the top of the ,charts. If he wants to talk about reality, it is about time h- got a few facts in place. Not only has this Government's past management been very inadequate but also, more seriously, as we look to the future, its current management policies are inherently flawed. This reflects a government that has very much run out of puff. It just does not seem to be bothered. For example, the Acting Treasurer, talking about wages growth next year, kept using the figu,re of 6t, per cent. Anybody who knows anything about wages in this country knows that 6t per cent is not the figure we will have. It will be a minimum of 8 per cent.' That is a conservative figure. Not only the Opposition but also such people as Ed Shann are saying that. The Government has to take its head out of the sand, start to look at some of these issues and come up with some answers. In the context of micro-economic reform, there' will be a statement about the waterfront tomorrow night. It will all be razzamatazz but, as with all these things, the reality is that the Government will not face up to the ACTU. As the Parliament rises this week and we will go back to our electorates the sad fact is that today we had headlines saying '$100 billion' and, as we saw so amply demonstrated by the Acting Treasurer today, very few answers to give the Australian public.",56
67,Mr LAMB ,DAYS OF SITTING,"Streeton) (3.31)-Two events in this debate undermined the credibility of the Opposition. The first was the smart-alec retort from the honourable member for Flinders ( Mr Reith) when the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Dawkins) said that he wished to ask a few questions of the pretender to the Treasurership. The retort from the honourable member for Flinders was, 'We don't have to answer those sorts of questions. The Government is in the driving ,seat'. But let me say this to honourable members opposite: If they are ever going to drive the public chariot, they must demonstrate that they have a licence to drive it safely and properly. Honourable members opposite also said, 'Where are your constructive policies? We had constructive policies'. But all they have on the record are the destructive policies of the 1982-83 period. It is a destructive record. Not once have members opposite put forwaro any policies. The second little incident was the chorus line waving of copies of a chart, a chart more notable for what it did not say about the dreadful record of those opposite in 198283 than for what it has said since then. I refer members of the Opposition to another chart which appeared in today's Bulletin. It pointed out that in a poll the Government is one or two percentage points ahead of the Opposition. The Opposition had its spill; it had its front bench shuffle; yet it is still behind the Government, forÂ· two very good reasons that I can think of immediately. The Government has proved itself by comparison with the Fraser Government, which was advised by those economic would-bes who occupy the Opposition benches. By comparison with them we are competent economic managers. The electorate has a very long memory and we are two percentage points in front, despite the Opposition's window dressing, cause members of the public remember that the Leader of the Opposition, the honourEmptyHere was devoid of any firm policy, devoid of any credibility. They know there is no reason why he should have any credibility now, and he does not. Also, the economics of the 1982-83 period are still very much in vogue with those opposite. Honourable members opposite should look at that chart. It is a reminder that this Government is head and shoulders above the Opposition-streets ahead of it-as regards competent economic management with a responsibility to maintain living standards. This matter of public importance is one of the most hypocritical to be trotted in here by the Opposition. It is hypocritical because it was brought in by an economic adviser to a government that introduced - assive recession in 1982-83; that. saw more than one in 10 of the work force out of work; that saw living standards drop to the lowest level for years. Two examples of that Government's deliQerate policies were its freezing of pensions and its freezing of unemployment benefits. All honourable members opposite have done is promise to do all that over again. They have promised to slash by $5 billion the programs for health, education and welfare, those three policy areas which underpin living standards for all people, but particularly low and middle income earners. We know who would pay for that; it is the poor. It is not those who eat at Simpson's, the restaurant of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). This matter of public importance was introduced by leaders who have nothing in common with ordinary men and women in this country, those with ordinary families. They are definitely out of touch. How can we find anything in common between those who represent the silvertails and wealthy of the North Shore or Kooyong and those who live in my electorate, or your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker? How can we have anything in common with those who earn their income not only from a restaurant but also from business consultancies and a parliamentary income? Because the honourable memberÂ·for Wentworth alluded to the preference be- of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) for antique collections, I ask what anyone with a stable of cars headed by a Dino Ferrari would have in common with those in my electorate, or your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, who drive ordinary Australian produced. cars, not imports-imports which are blowing out our foreign debt. In other words, what would a pretender to the Treasurership, with his obvious and despicable consumption, have in common with those he cries orocodile tears about? What would he know about their declining living standards? He has no concern at all. A couple of days ago the Opposition worked very hard at trying to make some political capital on the statement by Moody's that it would-not did-review our international credit rating in a few months time. What did we find today? Honourable members opposite are very silent indeed about our international debt. We are concerned that it is over $100 billion. Honourable memQers opposite mentioned the figure but they were very quiet about it for several reasons. Today we heard from another international credit rating body, Standard and Poors, that, while it saw the current account deficit as being the greatest single element contributing to the build-up of external debt, it was mitigated somewhat by the fact that the strong level of imports had been related to investment goods as opposed to just consumption goods; that is, that the component,the share, the carve-up of the import bill is going more heavily to investments for business which will ..contribute, to our efficiency, our import replacement and our export producing industries and a decline in the consumption side of our imports. Standard and Poors went on to say: . . . from the strength of the performance of the domestic economy through the fiscal side, and certainly note the strong performance on the fiscal side. In other words, Standard and Poors recognises the fiscal side of the several policies which this Government has in place, which does two things: it is involved with taxation cuts and it provides the Government component of standards of living in this country. In short, we have in place the correct mix of policies at this time for A\lstralia. That is backed up by a recent statement from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development that we have a healthy economy which, if does not continue to be handled properly, will face certain pressures. Let us look also at the size and composition of our external debt. The figure is $103.2 billion, an increase of 8 per cent over that of a year ago. The figure is swollen by $1.6 billion due to the devaluation of the Australian dollar. It still measures well between the limits we have experienced for the last three years-between 30 and 32 per cent of gross domestic product. That ratio has been steady, which indicates that the policies of this Government are in place and are working, without undermining living standards, and that we do not have to resort to the Opposition's prescription, as delivered in 1982-83 and as would be delivered if it were in government-a compulsory, contrived and deliberate recession. Next year there will be a significant drop in the net external debt as imports drop arid as exports increase due to our greater efficiency and our build-up of business investment in this country. Those decisions to import business equipment as an investment are made on sound economic and business principles. They are not done by whim; they are not done by fancy. It has been the expectation that the businesses concerned will earn sufficient profits and income not only to service the debts incurred through importing that investment, but also to return a healthy profit to them and to increase employment in this country. This Government will not interfere with those decisions. The confusion opposite is rampant. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) on Monday was worried about our debt. On Wednesday he was worried about living standards. On Monday he would cut health and social welfare. Today he is concerned about living standards. What hypocrisy! What cant! What self-contradiction! He tells us to keep surpluses, he tells us to make tax cuts and then he tells us that we should claw back the surplus through welfare cuts. His colleague Senator Stone wants the tax cuts to be kept by government. What are they on about? As the polls in the Bulletin show, the only chart which has any meaning today in this debate is the current belief of the electorate that this Government is in charge, is on top and that the Opposition has failed.",58
68,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,DAYS OF SITTING,"Mr Leo MCLeay)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The debate is concluded. NA NA BUILDING, CANBERRA Reference of Work: Public Works Committee Act",60
69,Mr WEST ,AUTHORITY HEADQUARTERS,"Cunningham-Minister for Administrative Services) (3.42)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Fitout of Civil Aviation Authority headquarters building, Canberra. In March 1989 the Civil Aviation Authority purchased building No. 6 of the National Convention Centre in Canberra. The building is to be used as the Authority's headquarters and was purchased for $49.5m as a commercial investment to reduce the long term cost of providing office accommodation in Canberra. The building has only recently been constructed and needs to be fitted out to provide adequate accommodation for the Civil Aviation Authority's central office. The scope of work' comprises systems furniture installations to create economical use of space and provide modern working conditions; partitions for enclosed offices, conference rooms, interview rooms et cetera; necessary alterations to mechanical services, light and power; and any special services to suit specific office layouts. The work will also involve some adjustments to existing ceilings, walls and floor finishes; special joinery items to general office, technical specialist areas, executive areas and conference facilities; significant staff recreation and amenities facilities; special treatment of the entry foyer and reception area; general building security and surveillance; installation of the building's private automatic branch exchange, and telephones; window treatments and storage facilities. The fitout work extends over 16,500 square metres of floor space and will cost an estimated $10.5m at March 1989 prices. The project is being designed to comply with the requirements of relevant authorities and I believe is consistent with the Department of Administrative Services' accommodation guidelines but reflects the use of modern systems furniture to establish space entitlements. Extensive consultation has occurred with staff associations and examples of the proposed systems furniture have been set up to permit staff comment. In order to ensure the earliest termination of existing leasing costs totalling $350,000 per month, the Authority seeks to award a contract for the fitout works by late August 1989 and to achieve completion before Christmas this year. I table preliminary building layout drawings of this proposal and commend this motion to the House.",60
70,Mr TUCKEY ,AUTHORITY HEADQUARTERS,"O'Connor) (3.45)-The Opposition does not oppose this motion and will await the advice of the Public Works Committee on this matter. Although the Government constantly claims that these exercises eventually save it money, I notice that the Australia New Zealand Banking Group Ltd has claimed in today's paper, if not yesterday's, that it will sell another large proportion of its freehold property and lease it back. Whereas private enterprise in every area is getting out of the property market and leaving that to the specialists, the Government is coming almost daily into this place and bringing proposals to purchase, refurbish and, of course, meet the costs of owning its own property. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA CIVIL AVIATION FACILITIES, NA Reference of Work: Public Works Committee Act",61
71,Mr WEST ,DARWIN,"Cunningham-Minister for Administrative Services) (3.46)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Northside development of civil aviation facilities, Darwin Airport. On 1 April this year, the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) assumed control of a further six federal airports, including the civil and general aviation components of Darwin Airport. Part of the transfer arrangement was that the Corporation would develop new civil aviation facilities on the northern side of the main runway. Members familiar with Darwin would be aware that the existing domestic terminal is substandard and that it, in fact, occupies a converted World War II Royal' Australian Air Force (RAAF) hangar. Both the civil aviation terminal and the separate general aviation facilities areÂ· surrounded by operational areas of the RAAF base, are extremely congested and are incapable of further expansion. Although removal to a totally new site was investigated several years ago, there was no convincing case for such a proposal. Instead, the studies confirmed the general superiority of the present airfield location, subject to a rationalisation of planning within that site. The current proposal confirms that the broad master planning concept which was approved in 1984, was correct. The estimated cost of this revised project is $72m at May 1989 prices. This is exclusive of future cost escalation, but includes an allowance of $15m for detailed design and contract management costs and for contingencies. The proposal being referred to the Public Works Committee has been developed to an advanced conceptual design stage by officers of Australian Construction Services, the construction division within my Department. They are also assisting the Corporation with the development of a detailed design brief. The Corporation's current program anticipates that completion can be effected by mid to late 1991. This proposal takes account of the unavoidable peaking of Darwin's domestic air movements and allows for anticipated growth in domestic, international and general aviation traffic until early in the next century. The scope of work includes a new two-storey air-conditioned terminal building, initially with one aerobridge, but with apron space sufficient to accommodate two international and six domestic aircraft; a new administration building and adjoining workshop; a new taxiway linkÂ· to the main runway; a new access road from MCMillans Road, plus ancillary roads within the project area; parking for 550 cars, plus parking for buses, taxis, staff, et cetera. Also provided for is a new general aviation taxiway and apron, capable of providing 100 aircraft parking positions; and servicing of all developments with such water, sewerage, drainage and electrical works as were left incomplete when the previous site preparations ceased in 1985. The proposal does not depart significantly from the 1984 proposal in tenus of impact on the environment. As that proposal was judged environmentally acceptable at the time, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has confirmed that further clearance is not required. The proposal will be funded from non-budget sources and will incorporate measures to maximise commercial returns to the Federal Airports Corporation. I think it will greatly assist the Northern Territory by boosting construction activity and, more importantly, by providing a much more alluring gateway to the many internationally renowned tourist attractions in the Top End. I am very pleased that we have been able to reactivate the F AC project. I know that everyone in the House will support it. I have great pleasure in tabling the drawings of the proposal and I commend the motion to the House.",61
72,Mr TUCKEY ,DARWIN,"O'Connor) (3.51)-The Opposition supports the reference of this proposed work at Darwin .Airport to the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. Nevertheless, it is worthy of comment on my behalf. It is interesting to note that the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) talks about the existing facilities as being substandard, extremely congested and incapable of further expansion. That was well known during the time of the Fraser Government and we made a promise to address the matter. As happened with South Australia, when governments set out to do the things that are necessary to expand tourism and give good services in the ever-growing I Australian airline industry and the international airline industry, it is always said that this has something to .do with an election. Considering the Goxernment's tardiness oli this matter and the fact that it is now concerned for the future of the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon), one wonders about its changed attitude on this matter. As with the third Sydney airport, in 1982 the Fraser Government had given a commitment during its term of office for the relocation and reconstruction of an appropriate terminal facility in Darwin. During the election campaign we found that the present Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) was also prepared to maintain that promise, but at that time the people chose not to support the Government and the reality is that the Government then stopped that project. For political teasons, in my view, it has been hung up ever since. I think that is most unfortunate for the people of Darwin and for our tourist industry in general. We heard the other day of the disastrous situation that. exists through government tardiness in Brisbane. I think the honourable member for Lilley ( Mrs Darling) said that she had been pressing for this work, but the project was on target. That is like the definition of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) of our economy. Every time we ask him why things are getting worse and why our foreign' debt is falling, he says, 'Don't worry, it is on target'.",62
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,DARWIN,Mr Leo MCLeay)-Order! The honourable member for O'Connor might g-t back to referring to Darwin Airport.,62
74,Mr TUCKEY,DARWIN,"I will, Mr Deputy Speaker. On these matters the target position changes. We have seen unprecedented growth in international tourism, which is notÂ· by any means entirely related to. the efforts of this Government. It has been an international phenomenon that more and more people are discovering that travel with the very large and efficient airliners that are available today is frequently cheaper than staying at home for their holidays. They do take overseas trips and Australia has been a beneficiary. This Government has not chosen to keep up with that growth. It has not been prepared to change its targets; it has just let things roll along. The reference of this proposed work to a committee has a lot more to do with the forthcoming election than with the Government's genuine desire to get on and do the job for. which it has a responsibility. The Opposition certainly supports the reference. We are just sorry that it is too little and too late, but we expect the Government to get on with it now. Mr West-Not too little.",62
75,Mr TUCKEY,DARWIN,"Okay, we will take the words 'too little' out. It is certainly too and with one aerobridge it might even be too little. If there is not too much rain when the people are visiting they can walk through the rain, or maybe there is a provision somewhere for umbrellas. I do not know. Darwin is not known for its clement weather at many times of the year, and it would probably be better to have more than one aerobridge in those circumstances. But primarily it is too late. It is like the third runway at Sydney which is too late and is still pending, of course. It is only about eight years too late considering the program that has been set down. This proposed work has been delayed for about the same period. We should reflect on the investment that the Government is making in this huge tourist industry and what it is bringing to our shores. I repeat: this is not a case of what might have been seen as a reasonable target in 1980. Circumstances have changed dramatically in that time and the Government should have been willing to cooperate and move along with that. We have no objection to this motion. We are just sorry that the Government has introduced it at this time for reasons other than the very good reason that the tourist industry demands it.",63
76,Mr SNOWDON ,DARWIN,"Northern Territory) (3.56)-It gives me great pleasure to support this reference by the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) to the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works for the development at Darwin Airport. It is a pity that the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey), whilst indicating the support of the Opposition for this motion, should demonstrate such a condescending attitude towards the people of the Northern Territory and their ability to choose appropriate representatives in the Federal Parliament. He demonstrated almost an equal amount of ignorance on the matter dealing with the Darwin Airport. Had he been aware of the work which had been done by this Government at the Darwin Airport he would have recognised that it follows a commitment made again by myself and my colleague, Senator Bob Collins, prior to the last election. We are seeing evidence of this Government's commitment to carrying out its promises to the people of northern Australia. In this instance, despite the best efforts of the Oplate, position, especially the Opposition senator from the Northern Territory, Grant Tambling, to try to scuttle this exercise by the Federal Airports Corporation in the redevelopment of the Darwin and Alice Springs airports, to the Government's credit the F AC has been given the charter to build a new airport on the northern side of the runway. The Minister for Administrative Services adequately covered the need for that airport. It is certainly a new airport, but it is not up to scratch. Some wag in the Northern Territory last week indicated to me that he would like to start a movement for the retention of the old airport. I cannot quite see for what reason, but in any event it is not a very popular cause because there is absolutely no doubt in the world that anyone who travels through the Darwin Airport, and indeed the Alice Springs airport which will be next on the list, recognises the need for a new facility. It is hot, stuffy, the conditions are cramped and the people who work in that airport, particularly the airline personnel, do so under great duress, as do the workers from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Australian Customs Service who carry out the work for international flights. I would like to thank a few people who have been involved so far in this project, particularly Mr Jack Mophett from the FAC. He has been in charge of the project since the FAC got hold of it and the properties were transferred to the F AC on I April. He has done a magnificent job and has been ably assisted by the new appointments by the F AC to the Darwin Airport. Mr Bruno Santalucia is the general manager of Darwin Airport. He used to be an employee of the Department of Transport and Communications in Darwin, in charge of the airport. He has now taken over and will be in charge of the redevelopment. Mr John Wylie from the Department of Transport and Communications Adelaide office has also been instrumental in moving this process along. Rod Nelson and Neil MCWaters have at various times been airport managers and directors at Alice Springs and have been involved with the F AC in working up projects. It is extremely important that we recognise the potential value of this new facility to the people of northern Australia. After all, Darwin is the gateway to Australia; it is Australia's closest port to South East Asia; and it is a destination for many thousands of tourists. Some quarter of a million 'tourists visited Kakadu National Park last year. The expectation is that over the coming years that number will increase dramatically to 300,000 or 400,000 and so on. We need an appropriate facility. The tourist industry in the Northern Territory has qui-e rightly been concerned about the state of toe terminal in Darwin - Indeed, the people of the Northern Territory have indicated quite strongly on a number of occasions their desire to have this facility rebuilt. That is now happening. As the' Minister pointed out, it will provide added stimulus to the construction industry. As a result of that, there will be a multiplier effect because the new establishment will provide many jobs additional to those already provided in the existing terminal structure. I would have thought that there would have been an attraction to employment opportunities in the service industries, particularly those related to the tourism industry and to airline services. It gives me great pleasure to support this motion. I iridicate my disappointment with the attitude of the Opposition. I am sure that the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull) will not be as arrogant or ignorant in his contribution if he gets up to speak and support this motion. I suggest to him that after he has spoken he might have a yarn to the senator for the Northern Territory, Grant Tambling, and try to indicate to him that it is no longer any good trying to scuttle this project, that it is in his best interests, as well as in the best interests of the Northern Territory and Australia as a 'whole, to proceed with this project. After all, as I have said, we are the gateway to South East Asia. It is true to say that many people in Darwin see themselves as part of South East Asia already. It is no good continually knocking and putting forward carping criticism of the ability of the F AC to carry out this work. The honourable member has attacked the credibility of the Government on various occasions. But since the last election the Government has' been firm in its commitments. The transfer of both the Darwin and Alice Springs airports, as well as the other airports to which the Minister referred on 1 April, is an indication of the Government's commitment, readiness and preparedness to get this show on the road. We will see construction start this year, despite the best efforts of some members in the Opposition. I exclude the honourable member for Fadden from that, because I am sure he would not be trying to stop this development. I note that again today during Question Time Senator Tambling asked a question in the Senate about these airports-again trying to undermine the credibility of the F AC and the Government in carrying out their functions in rebuilding these airports. . Another particularly important point to make is that prior to 1 April it was thought that the new terminal would cost some $65m. That figure is now $72111, and in all likelihood it will increase. One other group of people deserves special mention in relation to this project, and I refer to people in the defence forces. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has been labouring under particular difficulty inÂ· terms of the location of the existing terminal at Darwin Airport. The transfer of the terminal to the northern side or the airport will allow the RAAF to develop securely and up to its appropriate standards and needs facilities on the southern side of the airport. I commend this reference to the House.",63
77,Mr JULL ,DARWIN,"Fadden) (4.02)-1 join in this debate briefly and add my encouragement to the Public Works Committee to go ahead and get his project approved and up and running as soon as possible. There is no doubt that the Public Works Committee is going to have a most busy parliamentaryÂ· recess. In the past fortnight we have seen proposals concerning major extensions to Melbourne Airport, the commencement of the earthworks for the Brisbane terminal, and now the reference for the Darwin Airport referred to the Committee. I suppose that that is an indication that suddenly there is the realisation that we have some very great difficulties with our airport infrastrucment ture. It is true that Darwin Airport has been a headache for many years. In fact, I find it almost incomprehensible to believe that anyone in the Northern Territory would join a lobby group to retain the present Darwin facility. May I say that, through the good promotional effort- and some great cooperation from the present Northern Territory Administration, and indeed the State of Queensland, the fastest growth area in international tourism has been in northern Australia. I suppose we should add to that the appeal of Crocodile Dundee-although I am sure that the Crocodile Dundee image .should not apply to the terminal facilities where visitors arrive. But the growth of tourism has been spectacular. The demands on Darwin Airport have been increasing all the time, and within the next 12 months, to my knowledge, at least two new international carriers will commence services into Darwin. So the demands will be there and, of course, there is also a tremendous growth of domestic aviation business, eSpecially from Cairns across to Darwin. So the facility at Darwin is very much needed. I commend the reference to the Public Works Committee. I sincerely hope that the Committee will have this job under way as soon as it possibly can and that we will see construction start on. that new terminal facility in Darwin that is most sorely needed. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA NA (APPLICATION OF LAWS) BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read a first time. Second Reading",64
78,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (4.05)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill is to make clear what kinds of State and Territory laws apply to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities. Recent decisions of the High Court of Australia have raised problems with section 64 of the Judiciary Act. The Governhas decided to seek legislation to remove these problems and to resolve long standing uncertainties as to the extent of the Commonwealth's implied constitutional immunities from State law. The legal position of the Commonwealth in relation to State legislation is at present very unclear. The Commonwealth has acted on the view-supported in a number of High Court judgments-that the Commonwealth, its servants and agents and many of its instrumentalities, have extensive immunities from State legislation based on implications in the Constitution. However, there has been long standing uncertainty as to the scope of these immunities. For example, in 1953 in The Commonwealth v. Bogle (1953) 89 Commonwealth Law Reports 229 at pages 259-60, Mr Justice Fullagar, whose view was shared by three other justices, including the then Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon, said that a State parliament 'has no power over the Commonwealth' but added that the Commonwealth may 'become affected by State laws'. These principles have been subjected to criticism by some eminent writers. A proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to the matter of Commonwealth immunities was discussed at the 1985 Brisbane meeting of the Constitutional Convention but no agreement was reached between the Commonwealth and the States. In its final report last year, the Constitutional Commission recoml,llended that no alteration should be made to the Constitution, recognising that the matter could be adequately addressed through Commonwealth legislation. In the early years of Federation the Commonwealth Parliament addressed the issue of the Commonwealth's immunities in the particular area of civil liability. Interim legislation was enllcted in 1902 modelled on colonial legislation which provided remedies against the Crown. This legislation was replaced, in substantially similar terms, by section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903 which is still in force. It provides: in any suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party, the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same, and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side, as in a suit between subject and subject. Section 64 applies only to civil proceedings to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party and not to criminal proceedings. In criminal proceedings the legal position still depends on the scope. of the Commonwealth's implied immunities. Until 1986 the Commonwealth acted on the view that section 64 of the Judiciary Act had a very limited effect in subjecting the Commonwealth to State and Territory legislation to which it was not otherwise subject. Much Commonwealth and Territory legislation was drafted on that basis. However, the High Court's decision in the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries Ltd (1986) 161 Commonwealth Law Reports 254, means that section 64 of the Judiciary Act subjects the Commonwealth, and also Commonwealth instrumentalities, to a wide range of State and Territory legislation as if the Commonwealth were an ordinary person. Section 64 can even subject the Commonwealth to State legislation that does not bind the State, and in some cases to. Commonwealth .legislation that would not otherwise apply to the Commonwealth. This result was almost certainly not intended by the Parliament that enacted the Judiciary Act in 1903 at a time well before the burgeoning of legislation of all kinds. As a result of the Evans Deakin decision, the Commonwealth is subject to the risk of incurring unforeseeable kinds of liabilities under whatever legislation the States and self governing Territories might enact from time to time in relation to ordinary persons. The de.cision in the Evans Deakin case would also apply to self-governing Territory legislation and to Imperilll legislation still in force in Australia. In the interests of the community, the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, the legal position should be clarified and those risks removed. The Government has examined alternative methods of framing such legislation. One approach considered was. to enact Commonwealth Acts from time to time listing by name all the State and Territory Acts and subordinate legislation and instruments that should, or should not, apply to the Commonwealth. However, that approach would be impracticable. Very substantial resources would be needed to monitor existing, and new, State and self-governing Territory Acts and subordinate legislation-including local government legislation. There would inevitably be delays pending the enactment of the Commonwealth legislation. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth could have incurredobligations or liabilities, or rights could have accrued. It would be undesirable to seek to avoid such obligations or rights by means of retrospective legislation. The Government believes that the only feasible approach is to specify in an Act some classes of State and Territory legislation-defined to include any relevant contin-. uing Imperial legislation-that should apply' to the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, and to have regulation-making powers to deal with other classes of laws and with any special problems, the regulations being subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance. This provides the necessary flexibility to respond quickly to new State or Territory legislation. The Bill follows this course. I now outline the main provisions of the Bill. I mention, first, that the Bill treats self governing territories other than the Australian Capital Territory-that is, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island-as though they were .States. The Bill does not affect the position under Australian Capital Territory laws since they are either covered by section 27 of the Australian Capital Territory (SelfGovernment) Act 1988 or are ordinances made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 that can be amended if necessary by the Governor General in Council to clarify the position of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities. Clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the Bill set out exhaustively, except in relation to Australian Capital Territory laws, the extent to which the Commonwealth and its servants and agents are to be subject to Commonwealth, State and Territory laws. First, the Comsubject monwealth and its servants and agents will continue to be subject to Commonwealth and non-self-governing Territory legislation that applies to the Commonwealth of its own force. In addition, the following classes of Commonwealth, State and Territory legcommencement islation are applied by the Bill to the monwealth and its servants and agents when wealth. acting on behalf of the Commonwealth: firstly, legislation concerning procedure civil litigation and,secondly, legislation ifying, modifying or extending the comnion law with respect to liability in tort. State legislation on contributory negligence in actions for damages for negligence is one the many examples of tort laws. Under the Bill any changes in the existing position will only apply to events or circumCommonwealth stances occurring after the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Bill. the Bill will only have the effect of applying a State, Northern Territory or Norfolk land law to the Commonwealth if the releBill vant State or Territory is ,itself bound that law. In the case of laws codifying, modifying extenqing the common law of tort the makes an exception for provisions declared by regulations not to apply to the Commonlegislation wealth. This will enable the Commonwealth to be exempted from unforeseeable kinds State or Territory legislation,although accrued rights existing at the date of the regulations will not be affected. The Governages ment will consult the governments of the States, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island concerning any proposals to make ulations to exempt the Commonwealth from laws that would otherwise be applied to Commonwealth by the Act. The Bill also provides for other State, Northern Territory and Norfolk Island laws to apply to the Commonwealth if prescribed Commonwealth. by regulations under the proposed Act. Since the contents of future legislation cannot be predicted,the Government does not cOrisider it appropriate for legislation falling the listed categories to be automatically plied to the Commonwealth. The only feasiclasses ble approach is to include a regulationExamples making power to include further State and Territory legislation. When required, regulaStatute tions can be made quickly, but will still be to parliamentary scrutiny. Regulations applying laws to the Commonwealth would not have retrospective effect except where the applied law itself has a retrospective operation. Even then, the law would not be applied to operate from a time before the of the provision of the Bill Comthat makes it applicable to the CommonThe Government will be consulting the in States, the Northern Territory and Norfolk codIsland to identify the various additional classes of State or Territory legislation that they would wish to see applied to the Commonwealth by the regulations. For example, of the general motor traffic laws-except in so far as they provide, for instance, for the licensing of vehicles---'-will be applied to the so as to preserve the present position under the long standing High Court Also, decision in 1925 in Pirrie v. MCFarlane (1925/36) Commonwealth Law Reports 170. IsThe Government does not intend that this should be used as a means for the Comby monwealth to avoid the operation of such laws. A similar comment applies, of course, or to the application of general criminal laws Bill to Commonwealth servants and agents. Until special occupational health and safety is enacted by the Commonwealth, regulations will also be made applying occuof pational safety laws to the Commonwealth any for the purpose of making the Commonwealth subject to an action in tort for damfor breach of a statutory duty. The regulations will not apply the associated offence provisions to the Commonwealth. The regCommonwealth will, therefore, continue to be civilly liable under these laws so that the the practical result would be the same as in Strods v. The Commonwealth (19.82/2) New South Wales Law Reports 182 where the employee succeeded in an action against the Because of difficulties in formulating an appropriate general description of the classes of contract laws that are to apply to the outside Commonwealth, the Government has deapcided to apply to the Commonwealth specific of contract laws by the regulatio,ns. of laws that will be applied by regulations inclUde sale of goods laws, the of Frauds concerning the enforceability of contracts, laws with respect to unconscionable contracts and laws with respect to the frustration of contracts. Clauses 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill deal with the application of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws to Commonwealth corporations. While some Commonwealth corporations such as the Australian Postal Commission share the Commonwealth's immunities from State legislation, many do not do so, especially if engaged primarily in commercial activities. However, it is often uncertain whether a particular statutory corporation shares the Commonwealth's immunities. The present tests involve factors such as the degree of ministerial control, and they are very difficulty to apply. The Government considers that any Commonwealth statutory corporation should be immune from State legislation only to the extent, if any, provided by or under the legislation establishing the corporation or other legislation. However, the Bill provides that, in respect of laws existing at the commencement of the proposed Act, immunity can be given by regulations made under the Act before its commencement. Such commencement would be deferred for one year to give time for the making of regulations in all appropriate cases. An exception is made in the Bill for the Repatriation Commission which is, in sub-. stance, a Department of the Commonwealth and is therefore treated under the Bill as part of the Commonwealth rather than as a statutory authority. The Bill also provides for complementary amendments to section 64 of the Judiciary Act. Section 64 will cease to operate in relation to rights created by written laws where the Commonwealth is not subject to the provisions of that law in accordance with the Bill or otherwise. However, section 64 will continue to apply in relation to unwritten laws-for example, the common law of tort which, in the absence of section 64, would not apply to the Commonwealth because of the maxim that the Crown 'can do no wrong'. Section 64 of the Judiciary Act applies to the States as well as to the Commonwealth. I have written to the State Attorney-General asking whether, and if so what, amendments to section 64 are desired in so far as it applies to the States. It would be undesirable to defer the proposed legislation in relation to the Commonwealth for the substantial time that might be needed to resolve that matter. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. NA (No.4) 1989 EmptyHere read a first time. Second Reading EmptyHere ister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (4.17) - I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the taxation laws in a number of respects. It will significantly broaden the income tax concession for research and development project expenditure incurred after 20 November 1987, and extend its availability for a further four years with deductions being allowed at the 150 per cent rate to 30 June 1993 and at 125 per cent until 30 June 1995. The Bill will also modify the imputation provisions as they relate to 1988-89. assessments received by companies after 18 January 1989 and before 1 July 1989. Also included in the Bill is an exemption from income tax for the pay and allowances of Australian Defence Force personnel while on duty in Namibia. The capital gains provisions will be amended to enable a taxpayer to elect that the grant of an eligible long term lease or sublease of land will be treated as a disposal of the underlying freehold or leasehold interest in the land. An income tax deduction is being provided for expenses incurred in contesting an election for membership of the Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory. The Bill will terminate, with effect from 1 July 1991, the deduction for certain subscription moneys paid in respect of initial shares in licensed management and investment companies. Some modifications are being made to the substantiation rules that apply where an employee receives transport allowances under an industrial award. Minor amendments to the employer provisions of the tax file number arrangements are also proposed. The Bill will also amend the sales tax law to exempt shipping containers of kind used in containerised cargo transportatend tion systems. The prosecution provisions of the taxation laws will be amended to permit the Commissioner of Taxation to apply to court of summary jurisdiction to have a conviction or order set aside and the matter of The reheard to correct situations of hardship affecting taxpayers. Finally, the Bill makes some minor technical amendments to the tax laws. I turn Q.ow to a more detailed discusincome-producing sion of these measures. Research and Development Activities As an integral part of the strategy conDevelopment tained in the Government's science' statetificates ment that was tabled in the Parliament on May 1989, the company tax concession for industry investment i- research - nd develmeasures, opment activities is to be extended by this Bill for a further period of four years. ready in, place until 1991, the 150 per cent deduction scheme will be ext-nded to 30 June 1993, and a 1-5 per cent scheme op-rate until 30 ,June 1995. The, cost of the extension is estimated at $640m pver, the years concerned. Consistent with this extension, the present deduction for expenditure on scientific reprovide search will now terminate in 1995, instead of 1991. The Bill will also give effect to number of measures which will in the inbe terim significantly broaden the scope of concession. These measures, which flow from a technical review of the concession, were announced on 20 November 1987 and will generally apply after that date. A company that receives a government grant or recoupthe ment in respect of expenditure on a research and development project will no longer sufwill fer a total loss of the deduction entitlements. Instead, a formula is being introduced to reduce the deduction otherwise allowable reference to the grant or recoupment. A $1.3m. in 1989-90. further widening of the concession will allow a company to share with others plant and equipment used exclusively for research and development activities without putting the deduction in jeopardy which is the position under the present law. Instead, where conHawke) sideration such as a lease payment is received for the use of the plant, the owner's entitleances ment to the accelerated write-off allowances will be reduced by one-half of the considerthe a ation. Other broadening measures will exaccess to the research and development ' concession to partnerships of eligible companies and, from 1 July 1988, to public trada ing trusts that, are taxed as companies. Bill will also authorise the write off expenditure on buildings used, for research and development activities on a similar basis to expenditure on buildings used for specified purposes-typically at the rate of 2t per cent per annum. It will also amend the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 to broaden certification powers of the Industry Research and Board so that it can issue cerabout the activities of all taxpayers 8 affected by the wider concessions being made available. In the course of finalising these the Government has decided not to proceed at this stage' with changes anAlnounced on 20 November 1987 in the areas of capital gains and intra group research and development activities, but proposes to keep will those matters under review. Imputation On 18 January 1989 the Government announced that the law would be amended to that franking credits arising from 'the service of an assessment during the income a year to which the assessment relates would calculated on the basis of the company the rate of tax rate the financial year during which it was received. The Bill provides that a company receiving an early 1988-89 assessment-that is, an assessment received before 1 July 1989-will be required to calculate .' franking credits it! receives from that assessment at the 49 per cent tax rate. It apply to 1988-89 assessments that are received after 18 January 1989, when the measure was announced, and before 1 July , by 1989 and will result in a revenue gain of Exemption of Pay and Allowances of Members of Defence Fo-ce Personnel Serving in Namibia As announced by the Prime Minister ( Mr on 6 March 1989, the Bill will exempt from income tax the, pay and allowearned by Defence Force personnel while allotted for duty in Namibia as part of United Nations Transitional Assistance Group. The exemption is to apply from 18 February 1989 when the first member of the Defence Force Group left Australia and is estimated to cost $2.7 5m in a full year. Long Term Leases of Land In terms of a proposal announced on 16 November 1988, a new right of election will be made available for capital gains purposes to a taxpayer who grants a very long term lease or sublease of land after 16 November 1988. The amendment will enable a taxpayer to elect to have the grant of the new lease or sublease treated as a disposal of the underlying freehold or leasehold interest in land,. The election will be available only where a lease or sublease of land is granted for mbre than 50 years. The effect of the election for a taxpayer who acquired the freehold or leasehold interest in the land before 20 September 1985 will generally mean that the grant of the long term lease or sublease will not result in a capital gain or a capital loss for tax poses. Where the lessor or sublessor was entitled to any deductions in respect of building depreciation allowances for buildincome ings on the land concerned, the entitlement to those deductions during the life of the new lease will be transferred by the election to the lessee or sublessee. Because of the nature of this measure a reliable estimate cannot be made of its cost to the revenue. Election Expenses An income tax deduction is to be authorthe ised for expenditure incurred by candidates in an election for membership of the Legismodifications lative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory. Deductions are, of course, already available for similar expenditures candidates for election to the Commonwealth and State Parliaments and the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. This amendment is to apply for expenditure incurred in the 1988-89 and subsequent income years and is estimated to cost $100,000 in 1989-90. Licensed Management and Investment Companies This Bill gives effect to the proposal announced in the 1988 May economic statement to terminate, from 1 July 1991, the 100 per cent taxation deduction for certain subscription moneys paid in respect of initial shares in licensed management investment companies. Subscription moneys paid after 30 June 1991 for initial shares in licensed management and investment companies will no longer qualify for that deduction. The Bill will also ensure that certain subscription moneys, which attract a 100 per cent deduction if paid before a management and investment company's licence is granted, are not deductable where the licence is granted after 30 June 1991., These changes will not alter the existing claw-back arrangements that reduce the deduction allowed m allowable where the shares or the licence are not retained for four years from the date of the last payment on the shares. The revenue saving from this measure is estimated at $2m in 1991-92 and $20m per annum thereafter. Substantiation This Bill gives effect to the proposal anpurnounced by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) on . 28 April 1989 to modify the requirement for employees to substantiate certain claims for tax deductions. Under the existing law taxpayers claiming relevant deductions are subject to substantiation requirements if transport allowances paid under an award increase after 29 October 1986. Taxpayers receiving allowances that have increased after that date will remain outside the substantiation requirements provided they do not claim a relevant income tax deduction in excess of amount of the allowance payable under the award as at 29 October 1986. These to the substantiation requirements will be at an annual revenue cost of incurred by less than $100,000. Tax File Numbers Amendments contained in the Bill will require a copy of an employment declaration to be retained by an employer until the close of the income year after the income year during which the declaration ceases to have effect. Amendments are also to be made to ensure that tax file numbers are recorded on group certificates and tax check sheets issued for eligible termination payments where the numbers are quoted to the payer on a form provided for that purpose. These changes will have negligible affect on revenue. Shipping Containers The sales tax laws are to be amended to exempt certain shipping containers ftom sales tax. This measure, which was announced on 25 January. 1989, is part of this Government's ongoing commitment to reducing industry costs and removing non-essential industry regulations. A shipping container will be exempt from tax where it is for repeated use on ships to transport cargo. A shipping container for use for other purposes, for example as a building site shed, will not be exempt from tax unless it has previously gone into use or consumption in Australia. Rehearing Procedures An amendment to the Taxation Administration Act will enable the Commissioner of Taxation, in appropriate circumstances, to apply to a court of summary jurisdiction to set aside a conviction or order in relation to a prescribed taxation offence. The right to apply to a court will be restricted to situations where the defendant was not present in court at the original proceedings. State and Territory court procedures usually apply to enable a court of summary jurisdiction to rehear a case and rectify any anomalies which may have arisen at the original proceedings because the defendant was absent. However, relevant State legislation does not sufficiently provide procedures to correct all anomalies involving offences under Commonwealth taxation law. This amendment will remove the need for theÂ· Governor General to be asked in each case to exercise the royal prerogative or mercy to rectify an administrative anomaly or misunderstanding, or to deal with hardship cases, where rehearing provisions under State or Territory law do not provide a satisfactory procedure for rectifying or dealing with these matters. This measure will not result in any cost to the revenue. I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on .motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) (COMPUTER PROGRAMS) AMENDMENT BILL 1989 EmptyHere read a first time. Second Reading EmptyHere ister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (4.30)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill complements one of the main measures in the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill 1989, about which I am about toÂ· speak. By that Bill, sales tax is to be removed on all computer programs other than those on microchips. A general principle of the sales tax law is that, where goods are subject to sales tax, goods for use exclusively or principally in manufacturing the taxable goods are exempt from sales tax. Without such an exemption there would be an element of double taxation of the manufacturedgoods. On this basis, under the present law, goods for use exclusively, or primarily and principally in embodying computer programs in goods areÂ· free from sales tax as aids to manufacture. Consistent with the removal of sales tax on computer programs proposed by the other Bill, this Bill will remove in partand allow regulations to be made to remove the rest of-the aids to manufacture exemption in relation to computer programs that I have just described, except where the goods are for use exclusively. or principally in embodying programs in microchips. Changes to the sales tax regulations to narrow the definition of aids to manufacture in those regulations will be submitted to the Executive Council as soon as practicable. The changes will apply from 23 December 1988, as announced by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating). Their revenue impact will be negligible. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. SALES TAX LAWS (COMPUTER PROGRAMS) AMENDMENT BILL 1989 EmptyHere read a first time. Second Reading EmptyHere ister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (4.34)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This is the second of two Bills to amend sales tax law to give effect to the announceto ment by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) on 22Â· December 1988 that sales tax liability for computer software other than firmware would be removed. At present under the sales tax law, computer programs as such, because they are not goods, are not subjectÂ· to sales tax. However, the sale value of gible carrying media for programs, such as floppy discs, include the value of the grams when calculating the amount of sales tax payable on the goods. This Bill will duce the sale value of goods containing comretail puter programs by the amount of that va1ue attributable to the programs. In addition, the sale value will be further reduced byÂ· the amount of that value attribhas utable to an instruction manual that forms part of the goods. The carrying medium for programs and the packaging will, however, continue to be taxable. The Bill treats firmware computer programs on microchips. In accordance with the Treasurer's anthe nouncement that the sales tax exemption for software would not extend to firmware, there will beÂ· no reduction in the sale value for programs on microchips-typically, procertain grams permanently built into appliances.Â·Â· Where the only programs in the goods are on microchips, there will also be no reducenactment, tion in the sale value for an instruction manter ual. The cost to revenue of this measure is estimated to be $10m in 1988-89, $30m in 1989-90 and $35m in Â·1990-91. The changes will apply, as announced by the Treasurer, from 23 December 1988. In developing this Bill it has come to attention that a number of taxpayers may have acted on the basis a view of the Treasurer's announcement der which their sales tax liability on goods containing computer programs would be less than that proposed by this Bill. The Comgations missioner of Taxation has assured me that, given the uncertainty that existed in this and as sales tax is a tax ultimately borne the consumer from whom it would be imto practicable for a taxpayer to recover any tax on goods already sold, he will not be seflking to increase any taxpayer's liability beyond that which the taxpayer could reasonably have expected. The opportunity is also being taken in this the Bill to make a number of other amendments the sales tax law. One is an amendment of a concessional nature to correct a defiall ciency in the present law. This amendment will ensure that, where goods containing sound or visual images-records, videos and the like-or goods containing computer programs on microchips are subject to sales tax tanwhen sold by retail or treated as stock for sale by retail, any licence fee for the right to prouse the sounds, images or programs is included in theÂ· sale value. of the carrying remedium on the fee's wholesale value, not its value. The amendment, which will have a negligible financial impact, if any, will apply from tomorrow. . .' . Another change to be mad- by this Bill. become necessary because extensions of the sales tax ba-e or increases in rates of sales tax commonly take effect earlier than the date of enactment of the amending legas islation-for example, from the date of introduction of the amendirig legislation into Parliament. Consequently, because sales tax is a tax payable monthly, persons technically may be. required, on a basis that is effectively retrospective, to do or not to do things-such as to register for sales tax purposes and to' pay sales tax-before the amending'legislation becomes law. On a person who has failed to regisor to pay sales tax on transactions since the date of introduction technically,and retrospectively, becomes guilty of an offence or liable to additional tax by way of penalty. This Bill will ensure that any amendments made by it or any future sales tax Bills will not result in a person being guilty of an offence or liable to additional tax ,by way of of penalty for acts or omissions before the untwenty-eighth day after the day on which the amending legislation concerned receives royal assent. Consistent with that, any obliarising' from such amendments that presently should be met before the 27th day atea after royal assent is given to the amending by legislation will in ,future not formally have be met before that day. In practice, this amendment is unlikely to change much of the past. It. has been long standing Australian Taxation Office practice to encourage registration, payment of tax and so on in the period before enactment of new sales tax changesRecreation in recognition of the impracticability of taxpayer recovering sales tax from retailers and consumers after the latter have already proceedings. bought goods affected by the charges-but not to penalise taxpayers who decline to. do so. The revenue impact, if any, will therefore be negligible. Finaily, the Bill will alter number of incorrect cross-references in the sales tax law, also with effect from tomorto row. In closing, I ,would .like to express thanks to the Australian Information Industhe try Association, the' Software and Services Industry Federation of Australia and the National Sales Tax' Liaison Committee for process. the constructive comments they' made in the short time made available to them to examEnvironment, ine a draft of this Bill and the earlier Bill this package; I present the explanatory memorandum,which deals with both of the Bills, and I commend the Bill to the House.

82,Mr MILTON,THE ARTS,"by leave-The House will a be aware of the current interest which is presently being shown in questions relating the proper management of the Antarctic continent. It seems that a day is not passed my without some reference to the Antarctic in media. The Committee's report which has just been tabled will no doubt add considerably to the Antarctic decision-making When the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Tourism and Territories (Senin ator Richardson) referred the inquiry to the Committee, he noted that tourism in ,the Antarctic offers one of the last tourist frontiers but raises a variety of environmental particularly the possible degradation and change to the Antarctic's unique environment. The Minister believed that before tourism to the area was developed a number of issues would need to be addressed, particularly the scale and nature of the tourist activity, its impact on the environment and our scientific programs and the planning and regulatory requirements needed to ensure its proper management. The report notes that to date tourism acto the' Antarctic have been largely to confined to the Antarctic peninsula where cruise ships and some tourist flights operate. To date, there has been no organised commercial tourism in the Australian Antarctic (AAT) apart from a few ad hoc cruises. Tourist and non-government expeditions to the Australian Antarctic Territory have been limited by a more severe climate, lack of landing facilities for intercontinental aircraft, the three or four weeks necessary for a sea voyage from Australia, less abundant wildlife compared with the Antarctic peninsula and, arguably, less spectacular scenery. The Committee received conflicting inforto mation on the potential tourist market for the Territory. One witness advised that preLikely liminary examination indicated that his projbe ect, which is land based and air has a market potential of 16,000 persons per year.' Another argued that the market would be for ad hoc rather than sustained visits primarily because of costs. Irrespective of what market may exist the Committee noted that there were a number of entrepreneurs who believed that the market for tourism to the Australian Antarctic Territory exists and exists at levels which would make it econations nomic. Accordingly, the Committee conthe cluded that the present approach of the Australian Antarctic Division, of neither couraging nor discouraging tourism, is inapinformation. propriate given what appears to be' an increasing .interest. We concluded that all human activity in the AAT, whether it scientific or recreational, has some environmental impact. The Committee did not accept that the Antarctic experience should reserved for the privileged few who are in the volved in Antarctic research and the estabopment lishment and maintenance of support facilities or others because of their distinguished tor status or their positions in administration. The Committee supports tourism to the arctic provided it is conducted within a repriori!y gime which ensures proper protection of the wilderness values of the continent. I now turn to the various types of tourist activity which were' put to the Committee. Overflights by charter jet aircraft generally put minimal pressure on the environment although there may be impacts from fallout from engines and disturbance of wildlife to noise. Ship based tourist activities are traditional forms of tourist access to Antarccouraging tica. These generally involve relatively small environmental impacts provided that tour leaders are properly trained, a proper 'cational program for passengers exists and landing sites are chosen carefully. Nevertheble less, cruises can have potentially adverse vironmental affects. Conservationists and scientists believe that permanent onshore facilities and associated infrastructure have potential for a environmental impacts. The Committee was told that the most interesting places in terms of tourist interest and the sites most suitable establish those facilities could be severely degraded by a constant stream of visitors. sites for sllore based facilities would near scientific bases and the likelihood of supported, disruption would be high. Most witnesses and submissions advised that there is inadequate knowledge at present on which to base an assessment of the likely environmental impacts of significantly increased tourist activity in the Australian Antarctic Territory. There is, however, some . data to suggest that existing human activities such as the scientific programs of the various have adverse affects on wildlife and environment. Most witnesses argued. that further research into Antarctic ecosystems is enrequired to establish baseline environmental The Committee noted the views of the Antarctic Division, however, that it was reluctant to divert limited resources to be undertake such environmental studies. The Committee found it difficult to accept be the low priority which the Division gives to collection of baseline data and the develof a management plan for the Australian Antarctic Territory. It is clear that visimost scientists who gave evidence to the inquiry believe that environmental and ecoAntlogical research should be given a higher because such research is in itself of scientific value. In addition, lack of commitment to this activity is a failure to recognise that tourism is occurring and will increase, and the effects of these activities are not known. The Committee concluded that in the absence of relevant environmental data and due proper management plans for the AA T the the government policy of neither actively enor discouraging Antarctic tourism may have been appropriate in the past. The Committee did not believe that this inactiveduity should continue and recommended that the necessary resources be provided to enawork to commence on the development enof management regimes including environmental protection and. assessment procedures for the planning, administration, supervision and monitoring of tourist ventures and nonrange of government activities in the AAT. In the Committee's examination of legal and administrative arrangements available to the Commonwealth government.' to control tourism, it became apparent that there is common misconception about the ability the Australian government to pass laws to control tourism. Because Australia claims territorial sovereignty, the position is clear that in' Australian law the Australian Antarctic Territory is an Australian territory in every way and has the same status as, instance,.Norfolk Island or Christmas Island. Therefore, Australian laws apply except those specifically excluded under the Antarctic Treaty such as observers and scientific , approve such proposals. exchange personnel. It is clear that from an Australian Government perspective the question is not application of Australian 'islation but rather its enforcement. A numnot ber of witnesses, however, believe that it only at the level of international conferences and' forums that Australia insists on its claims to sovereignty. The Committee noted that Australian Government policy is that our claim to ereignty should be maintained. The Committion tee further noted that it is Government policy that Australia should work within arctic Treaty system. The Committee has recommended that Australia introduce legisthe lation to control tourist activity in the , tralian Antarctic Territory while at the time taking the initiative in treaty consultato tions to develop a tourist convention Antarctica as a whole. Many witnesses noted the' fragmented manner in which human tivity and management of the environment is applied to Antarctica. In addition to Treaty itself, there are a number of conventee tions and agreed mt<asures covering specific areas of concern. Many witnesses argued for the pevelopment of an overall conservation strategy which would include all those ters now ,covered in separate conventions and those that are not covered at all. I welcome the Government's deoision encourage international support for a prehensive environmental regime for Antarccharge tica., The Committee agrees Government that negotiation of such an environmental 'regime may be difficult achieve in the medium term. Accordingly, the short to medium term the Committee supports the negotiation of a tourism vention. The Committee has recommended number of interim measures which will vide 'some protection of the environment. a Such measures would enable ship-based tourof ism to proceed within specified guidelines. However, the Committee belt,eves that by far the greatest potential adverse impacts on the quite Antarctic environment relate to the construction of airstrips and tourist accommodation on the few ice-free areas. The for Committee has recommended that until such time as a detailed conservation strategy is for developed for the Australian Antarctic Ter.ritory the Australian government should not ' At this point I would like to make the personal observation that I am particularly legplel!-sed that the Government has decided to ratify the Antarctic Mineral Resource is Activities Convention as .it had always been my view that the Convention was an open invitation for mining and oil drilling in Antarctica. It is to be hoped that the Antarctic Treaty consultative n,ations will now, see the sovwisdom of negotiating an overall con-ervaÂ­ convention for Antarctica to which all other presently existing regimes and conventhe Anttions wou.1d be subsidiary. Finally, I would like to thank members of secretariat who provided assistance durAusing this inquiry and the fellow members of same the Committee who joined me on the voyage Antarctica, which we all enjoyed very for much. I thank them very much for the support they gave me on that voyage. I particacularly thank Judy Ferris, who provided keyboard and administrative support. Tothe morrow is Judy's last day with the Commitand the Department as she leaves to have her first child. On behalf of the Committee I wish her all the best. I wQuld also like to thank Ian Dundas, who accompanied the matother three members of the Committee and myself down to the Antarctic and provided us with some very valuable assistance on that to voyage and when we were at the basescomand, of course, John Cummins, who is in of the secretariat. I commend the with the report to, the House.",73
83,Mr IAN CAMERON ,THE ARTS,"Maranoa)-by to leave-I have much pleasure in speaking in in support of the report entitled Tourism in Antarctica that has been made by the Standconing Committee on Environment, Recreation a and the Arts. First of all, I would like to prothank the Chairman of the Commit'tee, the honourable member for La Trobe ( Mr Milton), who did an excellent job in organising the tour. He has presented a really good in-depth report. We went through every line of it, although I must say that I was a bit remiss and did not get to all the meetingsI tried to attend as many as I could-as I was a late appointee to the Committee. I consider myself a privileged Australian to have had the opportunity to go to the Australian territory of the Antarctic to see whether tourism is possible. Of course, I support the Committee's recommendation that it is. That being so, it is up to us to promote the fact that we have a wonderful environment in that 42 per cent of Antarctica that Australia claims. I will certainly be doing all I can to show fellow Australians what is available to them and to encourage them to go there as tourists. I seek leave of the House to table page 18 of the Society Expedition Cruises booklet which offers trips from Hobart to Macquarie Island and on down to Mawson's Hut in Commonwealth Bay and back to New Zealand. Leave granted.",75
84,Mr IAN CAMERON,THE ARTS,"It is important for Austndians and this Parliament to understand that tourist ventures are already taking place. They are being promoted and are happening in the whole of Antarctica, even in theÂ· Australian Territory. There are advertisements in the travel document I have tabled for trips to our. part of the Territory next year. It is important also to understand that although Australia claims part of Antarctica, none of the claims have been settled in internationallaw and there is nothing we can do to stop people from going there. Australians who go there must comply with Australian laws, but there is nothing to stop other nationals from going to our Territory. In fact, we visited Chinese and Russian bases on the Law Peninsula. The Russians have bases right across our Territory. I thank the Committee secretary, Ian Dundas, for all the work he did in organising the trip; and I thank John Cummins; who has been involved in compiling the report. He was not lucky enough to go on this trip, but he has been there on a. previous occasion. The honourable member for Dunkley( Mr Chynoweth), the honourable member for La Trobe and I all stayed in the one bunk house. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Allan Morris) was also on the trip, and the cross factions got on very well-as often happens on trips. I do not agree with the refusal to sign the Antarctic Minerals Convention. I support the New South Wales right wing of the Labor Party and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) on his comments on the Minerals Convention. I think it should have been supported. With the exception of France, every country which is a party to the treaty has supported it. I find it rather hypocritical of the Labor Party to oppose the French airstrip at Dumont d'Urville and yet support France on the Minerals Convention. That is a bit ironic. I believe that the Minerals. Convention would protect the Antarctic if mining were to take place. No country has the power to stop mining there. now. Something should be put in place so that, if mining were to occur, the countries which are party to the treaty would be able to police it, as the bases are policed today. That is not to be. Two countries will not sign it, so it will not go ahead. That is a pity, because it will take another 10 years of conferences, fighting and carrying on to' get something in place which may protect the area. We had a very interesting trip, with lectures on holes in the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect and other topics. The hole in the ozone layer has always been there, but I am told. that the magnetic field in the Antarctic draws the hole down. The magnetic pole moves all the time. Scientists from Australia go to the Antarctic to look for the centre of the magnetic field, which continually moves. Mr Milton-I have done that myself.",76
85,Mr IAN CAMERON,THE ARTS,"The Chairman has done that himself. I think there is an awful lot of hype and rhetoric about the ozone layer. I am not suggesting that we should encourage the depletion of the ozone layer, because if it disappears we will go with it, but it is important to get these things into perspective. With regard to the greenhouse effect, people tend to forget that we are living in a period of dormant volcanic activity. It is not that long ago that the whole world was shaken violently by continuous volcanic activity and the air was full of harmful gases. The world seems to have the capacity to absorb these things. But we must do as much as we can to contain the pollution. Most of the environmental problems relate to having too many people. We had interesting arguments on board the ship with the scientists who accompanied us to Mawson and Davis bases. I thank the captain and crews of the lcebird and the Lady Franklin for looking after us so well and for taking us down and bringing us home safely. I am quite keen on photography and I have had blown up some of the photographs that I took. A film cr-w from Beyond 2000 was on board the ship and its scientific films are being shown on that program. We intend to show members and staff of the Parliament who are interested in the journey, or who may be interested in going to the Antarctic as tourists, the photos we took of the interesting places we visited. Obviously, more funds are needed. The Australian taxpayers are spending $50m a year there now on a very large rebuilding program. That is taking priority over what the Committee feels the Ant,arctic Division and the Government ought to, be doing. More funds should be provided so that ,a strategy for conservation can be put in place. I have argued very strongly that the Division ought to select specific zones in the Territory that tourists can visit safely, and those areas should be zoned off. I do nQt believe that tOQ much red tape shQuld apply to tQurism by shjp .or, .once the envirQnmental impact studies , have been done, land-based tourism., I support the cQncept .of an airstrip. Australia, which has a claim to 42 per cent .of Antarctica, shQuld be able to find a decent place tQ put down an airstrip. It is beyond my belief that we will continue tQ service the area with ships. It takes tWQ weeks to go dQwn and tWQ weeks tQ come back. It means that il mQnth of the valuable time of 'the highly paid sCientists whQ gQ down there is used up. I think it is high time we started cQnstructing an airstrip. Of CQurse, .once that happens, there will be rQQm fQr some QnshQre tourist accQmmQdatiQn. It is important tQ remember that we already have three selfsufficient bases there and, basically, that is all a tourist facility will be. I do not necessarily think a tourist facility shQuld be established near Davis, as has been suggested. Perhaps it .ought to be moved sQmewhere where it CQuid be used in future years as a scientific facility or added .on tQ. As each day gQes by people are becQming mQre aware .of and interested in the envirQnment, and in nature. A big growth area in tQurism has been nature trips .of the expeditiQn type. Small, specialist groups .of people are going tQ places such as the Antarctic. They are much more specific abQut what , they want to see, what they want tQ study and what they want tQ phQtograph. These days people are showing a lQt of interest in phQtQgraphing birds and wildlife, and the Antarctic is an .outstanding place tQ dQ that. I have nQt been tQ CQmmonwealth Bay .or tQ MawsQn's Hut but, having been tQ the Antarctic, it is not hard tQ envisage the area around MawsQn's Hut. I do nQt think it WQuid be very different from any other part of the continent, as the cQuntry is all fairly much the same around the CQast. The Chairman of the CQmmittee has been there. I support the CQmmittee's recQmmendation that Mawson's Hut should be preserved in its existing PQsitiQn. I believe that we shQuld CQnstruct anQther building .over it tQ preserve it fQr as lQng as possible. If that CQsts SQme mQney, SQ what? I also believe that the GQVernment and the Antarctic DivisiQn .ought tQ be spending SQme mQney while they are undertaking this rebuilding program tQ preserve SQme of the .old huts at the existing bases and to put in place, perhaps, a museum-type set-up-sQmething tQ which people can refer tQ see the cQnditiQns under which early explQrers and scientists had tQ live cQmpared with mQdern day times. It is nQt just Mawson's Hut that should be preserved. I do not care how much mQney we have tQ spend in the area; the SQQner we start dQing it, the better. The tourist potential would more than reCQUp the GQvernment's CQsts in preserving thQse places. The .other thing the CQmmittee recommended-and it is one of my recQmmendatiQns-is that the Federal Government should put some mQney intQ the internatiQnal Antarctic centre being built in Hobart. It is important that that should happen; it is part of the ongoing tourist promotion. Most of the ships will leave from Melbourne or Hobart, so that is something we should be doing. Overall, unfortunately, there is a need for more funds to be put into the Antarctic if we .are to establish a good tourist industry there. It has fantastic potential and I can assure those Australians who wish to visit that area that they will not be disappointed. I have much pleasure in supporting the Committee's report.",76
86,Mr CHYNOWETH ,THE ARTS,"Dunkley)-by leave-As one of the expeditioners that went to the Antarctica this year; I am pleased to be able to speak to the report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled Tourism in Antarctica. Firstly, I should thank the Secretariat-John Cummins, Ian Dundas and Judy Ferris. The honourable member for Maranoa ( Mr Ian Cameron) was also a fellow expeditioner and he had to put up with many of the arguments that emanated from our cabin. As honourable members can see, we did not have cross-factional support; we all had different views. It was quite an interesting trip . with the honourable member for Maranoa there. On Australia Day we had to elect him as Governor General and he 'and a few honorary citizens attended certain ceremonies on board the Icebird. It was an excellent trip. I take this opportunity to thank members of the Australian Antarctic Division .. They were the people who gave the Committee the opportunity of going to the Antarctic. They put in a lot of effort and I know that it cost them quite a deal. I trust that they are also happy with this report. It makes some good recommendations and I am quite certain that, if these recommendations are taken up by the Government, the Antarctic will be preserved for a long time. One of the recommendations that I am particularly pleased about is the one that states: until such time as a detailed conservation strategy is developed for the Australian Antarctic Territory the Australian Government not approve tourist as which consist of the construction of air on-shore tourist accommodation. A proposal was put before the Committee to take two jumbo jet-loads of tourists week down to Davis-the Vest Fold Hills area. That would put a huge concentration of people into a small area of land and I am quite certain that a lot of damage would be done to that area in a short time. Only about 2 per cent of Antarctica is ice-free. That icefree are!!. is just around the fringes. That is where the flora-what there is; the small mosses and lichens-is and where all the fauna live. So honourable members can imagine the sort of pressure that would be put on the small ice-free areas if we allowed 600 tourists a week to go there; As I have said before in this House, Antarctica is a very beautiful place. It is the most magnificent place I have ever been to. Therefore, I think it is only proper that we open it up to tourism-that is, thatÂ· we allow people to go there to have.a look at it. The more people who see it, the more people will be converted to looking after its beauty. It is an area that we can put aside. I am quite certain that, in the future, many people will commend this Government for what it has dOl}e by not signing the Antarctic minerals convention. In the near future a lot of pressure will be put on the Australian Government to back away from what it has done. However, I am quite certain that, if our Government takes the lead and tells the rest of the world what we have dpne, if it convinces other nations that it is worthwhile making this area a world park, we will win in the end. People throughout the world, not just in Australia or in the wealthy countries, are beginning to recognise the environmental consequences of what we are doing. That will assist us in putting aside this beautiful area of the world. I take this opportunity to silY that, in our time in Antarctica, we met with the Russians and the Chinese, who have bases on our claimed territory. There. is a very, friendly and cooperative spirit throughout all the communities. There is an awareness among the scientists and all those people who visited the area that they are on their own and that they have to look after each other. They get on very well. While the honourable proposmember for Maranoa and I were at the strips and Russian base we supplied some of the Russian expeditioners with something that will keep them warm over the winter. I am quite per certain that they really apprec\ated that. I inform the House that I too- a flag with me to the Antarctic. J had seen some pictures of the Mawson base, I think it was, and a very dilapidated, worn flag, so I took a flag with me to present to the people there. However, I found that the Chinese did not have an Australian flag so, on behalf of the electors of Dunkley, I presented this flag to them. All work at the Chinese base stopped and drinks and pleasantries were exchanged. It was ve-y good. Mr Lamb-Did you have mai tai?",78
87,Mr CHYNOWETH,THE ARTS,"No, we did not have any mai tai. I think we had date juice and things like that. The Antarctic was a pleasant place to visit. I am quite certain that report will encourage the Government to takeÂ· steps to protect it. It sets up the work for tourism to proceed. I am quite certain that every person who goes to Antarctica will recognise that this is a special part of the world-a place worth preserving.",79
88,Mr WEBSTER ,THE ARTS,"Macquarie)-by leavewill I would like also to commend the report of the Standing Committee on the Environmention ment, Recreation and the Arts entitled ism in Antarctica to the House. Unfortunately, I w-s not as privileged as honourable member for Dunkley ( Mr Chyservation noweth), the honourable member for La Trobe ( Mr Milton) and the honourable member for Maranoa ( Mr Ian Cameron), who have spoken, and others, to have the unique and distinct privilege of going to the Antarctic. It was with some reluctance that I gave up my berth on the ship to another, but I am very happy to report from the Antarctic. conversations I have had and the reports the that have come into our meetings, that the Committee in its activities in the Antarctic acquitted itself very well and engaged worthwhile and very significant studies help us make a very comprehensive report to present to the House, which we are doing today. Mr Ian Dundas, one of the secretaries of the Committee and his staff, including Jl1dy Ferris, with the Secretary of the ComGovernment, mittee, John Cummins, are to be comport, mended for the work they did in producing what I believe to be a very cohesive, succinct report. The Chairman, the honourable member the for La Trohe, very carefully outlined the recommendations and I do not intend to through them. I endorse his comments with the House. regard to the recent decision by the Government not to sign th- Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. That is a point to be debated, but it is a weak and inadequate convention and we were right not to have signed it. I place on record the lead taken by the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard), in helping to urge the Government to block the Convention by not signing it. The three key concepts in environmental policy making should be fragility, interconthis nectiveness, and human stewardship. There ought to be one key virtue, and that virtue frameis prudence or wisdom. These concepts and that virtue are very evident in the Committee's report today which was prepared under the guidance of our very astute and conscientious Chairman. The comments that I make emphasise the urgency of some of the report's proposals. I will be brief, but I will two or three proposals in the last Tourminute or so in which I wish to speak. I suggest that one of the emphases of the the report is the need for a comprehensive constrategy for the Antarctic; that is needed urgently. We need guidelines with regard to access to the Mawson hut sites, also urgently. We very urgently need a development regime with strong environmental protection and impact statements covering tourism and non-government activity in the I also support the call to examine feasibility of extending the National Parks and Wildlife Service framework to cover the Antarctic and calls for a tough convention in. on tourism to cover the recommendations to that are contained in this very worthwhile report. The Government response, especially in terms of resources, must match the significance and urgency of Antarctic environmental protection and research. Finally, the in its consideration of this remust reflect new levels of commitment to meeting Australia's responsibilities in the Antarctic, particularly with regard to the official government body which operates in Antarctic. It is not terribly well funded, particularly in terms of any future considergo ation of tourism. I commend the report to INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION, NA",79
89,Mr UREN ,CONFERENCES,"Reid)-by leave-I present, first, the report pf the Australian parliamentary delegation to the seventy-ninth Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, in April 1988. It was my privilege to lead the Australian delegation, which comprised the honourable member for Higgins ( Mr Shipton), the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown), the honourable member for Fisher ( Mr Lavarch), the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Allan Morris) and Senator Archer from Tasmania. Having attended the previous conference in Bangkok in September 1987, I have acquainted myself with the ideals of the organisation and its method of operation. I first attended IPU meetings in April and September 1965 in Dublin and Ottawa. Those conferences made a lasting impression on me. At the conference' in Guatemala City, Australia was nominated as a member of the drafting committee on the peace and' development item. I sat on the drafting committee for over 10 hours over the three days of the conference. The draft resolution that emerged as a result of that process incorporated much of what had been included in the Australian draft. In partieular, it included sections of our draft concerned with the United States of America and the Soviet Union negotiations about treaties on nuclear weapons and further efforts that were required to reduce strategic offensive weapons. In my speech to the conference. I made the point that actions such as those taken - ith respect to Hiroshima and Nagasaki must never occur again. To this end we must continue to encourage disarmament negotiations. The historic agreement signed by Secretary-General Gorbachev and President Reagan to eliminate completely American and Soviet land based intermediate. range missile forces was a significant step in this process. The resolution adopted by the con. ference picks up these points strongly, adding that all nuclear weapon states should engage at appropriate stages in substantive negotiations to lead to aÂ· complete eradication of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth. A significant aspect of this process is the call for early adoption of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. In particular, in my speech I made reference to the fact that France is not a signatory Jp the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Tr-aty and ignores. the protocols contained in the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. I, along with other delegates from the South Pacific in particular, will continue to pursue this matter at future conferences. Australia also submitted .a draft resolution on the environment and sustainable development. In our draft resolution we emphasised that all nations contribute to the. problems of the environment in some form and so all must work together to find solutions to our problems, particularly at the local level. At the time of the conference, 109 nations were represented at the IPU. The challenge, as laid down in the resolution finally adopted by the conference, , is one that must now be taken up by all those nations .. One of the disturbing factors associated with the holding of the IPU conference in Guatemala City was our realisation, of the problems in the Central American states, particularly Guatemala. Ambassador Farmer, who not only represents u- in Mexico City but also represents us in that area, visited the area to try to give aid. The sad situation is that most of the young men in the villages had been murdered; the only people who remained were the old men, women and children. As I came away I felt there was still an atmosphere of fear among tq.e people of Guatemala. That is extremely sad because militarism, wherever it is found, is brutal !\.nd barbarous, particularly so in some of the regimes in Central America. I hope that IPU activities can in some way help bring about democracy. I also wish to report on the Australian parliamentary delegation to the eighty-first Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Budapest, Hungary, from 13-19 March 1989. I led this delegation which consisted of the honourable member for Higgins ( Mr Shipton), the honourable member for St George ( Mr Dubois), the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Cobb), Senator Crowley of South Australia and Senator Walters of Tasmania. Clearly, on ,such contentious issues as decolonisation and the Middle East, there were strong differences between members of the delegation. HowGorbachev ever, in each instance, members were free voice their own thoughts and ing to their ()wn judgment. On the whole, I believe the delegation worked together quite well and gave a representative account of the robustness and breadth of views of representative system of government. I indicated however, to those attending Conference that the views expressed by delegates were their own and not those. the Government, as in some instances the views expressed caused concern among other delegates. For example, I had to explain that whilst the Government and the Opposition had worked hard to rid Australia of its Australia policy? elements of racism mained in our country, and our Parliament. The IPU met in Hungary in the most auspicious of international circumstances within a climate of easing tensions which gave rise to optimism that the next decade may prove to be the most enlightened decade of this Century. Indeed, it gives me' hope that there can be peace in our that we can break down the barriers between nations and peoples of the world. There has been a manifest easing of tension between East and West, with Hungary and Poland giving leadership on the Gorbachev initiaagainst tives. The Soviet Union and China are the path of reconciliation. Progress is made on regional conflicts in Afghanistan, Cambodia and Namibia. Even in the Middle East theatre, the Iran-Iraq situation and Arab-Israeli conflict show signs of moving towards a resolution after long years of transigence. We were in Hungary at a time when po242 litical forces were calling for change and challenging the political systems, the ecoIsrael. , nomic concepts and the principles which had stood for many decades. Among the 200,000 Hungarians who, on 15 March, for the first time since the Soviet invasion of 1956, were allowed to celebrate the events of 1948 eventually led to the retreat of the Hapsburg monarchy, there was very much a feeling that a 'Budapest spring' was in the air. gary is very much in the vanguard of change currently taking place in the Communist world. But we must recognise that it is courage and leadership of Secretary-General and of the enlightened people into the Soviet Union which is encouraging these to vote accordhistoric changes. In view of the prospects for advancement in the Arab-Israeli conflict since the IPU last met in Sofia, Bulgaria, in September 1988, it our was evident that the Conference would wish to discuss again in Budapest the Middle East the question as a supplementary item. The draft all resolution on the Middle East contained in of this report was adopted by 903 votes to 46, . with 53 abstentions-a clear indication that the delegates from most countries wanted Israel ,to respond positively to the changed Palestinian position as outlined by the PalWhite estinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) reChairman, Yasser Arafat, in Algiers in sadly even within November, 1988. Incidentally, in view of my illness at that time, my casting vote was transferred to my deputy, the honourable member for Higgins ( Mr Shipton). The Australian delegation voted 7 to 6 against allowing Vasser Arafat to address the IPU conference. I thanked at great that time my colleagues the honourable time; member for St George ( Mr Dubois) and Senator Rosemary Crowley for the firm stand they took on the principle of allowing Yasser Arafat to speak to the conference. Even the United States delegation voted 11 for and 11 allowing Arafat to speak. All other on Western delegations supported his right to being speak and the vote was carried overwhelmingly. When Arafat did speak, he spoke in moderate terms, calling on Israel to respond the positively to changed circumstances. He also reiterated the PLO's recognition of the Palinestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) of the United Nation, Security Council resolutions and 338. In doing that, the PLO, for the first time publicly recognised the state of The IPU continues to do excellent work on human rights, and I commend to all members the section of the report dealing with these matters. Further on the question which of human rights, the Twelve Plus Groupthe western group, basically European, but comprising also Americans, Canadians, AusHuntralians and New Zealanders-has decided that under no circumstances will it be able to attend a scheduled meeting for a conferthe ence on security and cooperation in Europe because of Romania's continuing human rights abuse of its minority Hungarian population. The matter will be discussed further at the London IPU Conference with a view, possibly, of finding an alternative venue for the Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe. I hope that that emphasis is made not only amongst our own group, but also in more and more nations of the world as they come to recognise the oppression of the Romanians on the minority group of the Hungarians. The Twelve Plus Group in Budapest also issued a press statement rejecting as wholly unacceptable the incitement to murder author Salman Rushdie, while at the same time recognising the depth of insult and revulsion occasioned by The Satanic Verses felt by many in the Islamic world. The Twelve Plus called for the IPU to provide a forum for discussion between parliamentarians of Iran and of other Islamic countries and of those countries whose citizens were' affected by death threats. Iran rejected our appeal. Honourable members may be aware that at the eightieth Conference of the IPU in Sofia, Australia was appointed to chair the first Asian-Pacific group until the conclusion of the IPU's Conference in London. In Budapest, I was able to host a well-attended luncheon for the Asian-Pacific delegates and to chair two meetings of that group. At the behest of the group, I wrote to the Secretary General of the IPU, indicating a disquiet amongst the Asian-Pacific delegates that, despite the fact that they represented over half of the world's population, the IPU had not given enough consideration to important issues within the Asian-Pacific region; issues which had a profound effect on other regions. Two examples of the issues these delegates wished to discuss were population problems, and indebtedness. I have also requested a strengthening of the Asian-Pacific representation on the Inter-Parliamentary Union's executive. I look forward to the Inter-Parliamentary Union's centenary conference to be held in London in September 1989. When the IPU was first established in 1889, its aims were to promote personal contacts between members of all parliaments and, hopefully, unite them in common action to promote international peace and cooperation. These aims are as valid today as they were a century agopossibly more so in this the nuclear age when weapons of mass destJ;'uction remain in the arsenals of a number of nations. The IPU makes known its views on all international problems which can be resolved by parliamentary action and support and it promotes the development of liberal democratic practices and institutions. Moreover, each IPU conference affords delegates ample opportunities to work in the corridors and advance Australia's foreign relations as well as to broaden their own view of international affairs. It is a most useful and hopeful forum for contact and debate; a forum which reaches beyond the limits of regional boundaries and blocs. As I concluded in my address to the plenary conference of the IPU, the rigidities are crumbling between people and nations. We are one planet. We humans have to learn to live together in a nuclear, greenhouse, ozone, hungry, inequitable and sensitive environmental world. Institutions such as the IPU can help reflect the greater tolerance which will be needed between peoples of all levels of national and international society if we are to progress and survive on this planet. In closing, on behalf of the delegation I would like to thank the Australian Ambassador to Hungary, Mr Doug Townsend, for his guidance and support and also Mr Russel Howard from Vienna and Jane Lock from Athens for so ably assisting us with administrative matters. My thanks also go to the Australian Ambassador to Portugal, Mr Stuart Hume, and the First Secretary, Annabel Anderson, for their assistance during the Twelve Plus meetings in Lisbon. My thanks also go to the Hungarian and Portuguese parliaments for the excellent organisation of the respective conferences. I also place on record our thanks to Ambassador Farmer in Mexico for the wonderful work and assistance he gave us in Guatemala City. I commend to all honourable members the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to both the seventy-ninth IPU Conference held in Guatemala City, and the eighty-first IPU Conference held in Budapest. I thank the House.",80
90,Mr SHIPTON ,CONFERENCES,"Higgins)-by leave-I will not take up the time of the House for very long. I endorse the general thrust of the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren) , about the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) conferences. He was the leader of the Australian delegation from the Government side and I was the deputy leader from the Opposition side. As he said, these meetings give Allstralia an opportunity to project its image and our national interest overseas. One of the important aspects of the InterParliamentary Union that has developed in the last 18 months is the formation of an Asian-Pacific group which Australia now chairs. The honourable member for Reid acts as a coordinator and chairman of that group. That is very significant because I have found from my observations that matters that are ahead of changes in foreign policy are often signalled and discussed in this forum. If one reads the signals correctly at these meetings, one can predict the course of events and changes in foreign policy at the sovereign level by nation states. For instance, both the North and South Korean governments attend meetings of the Asia group. This is one forum where they are present in the same room at the same time. Massive changes have occurred only this year in contact between those two states. Australia and New Zealand are members of the Asian-Pacific region, which is the dynamic region of the world, and that is very important. Representatives from some 95 countriescountries from the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, the communist bloc and the nonaligned bloc-were present at the seventyninth IPU meeting in Guatemala City and the eighty-first IPU meeting in Budapest. Australia does have global influence. I think we underestimate our influence as a middle power and we certainly attract great respect. Of great interest during our visit to pest were the democracy marches held on 15 March. Members of the delegation were able to witness these marches. Honourable members might remember that in 1956, the year of the Melbourne Olympics, the tanks were turned on people when they last marched for democracy and there was mass slaughter. We were pleased to be present in Budapest to support the people who were marchingpeople from all walks of life, from all age groups and from every aspect of society. We supported them in their spirit and wished them well. An Australian parliamentary delegation will be going to H.ungary shortly. We do have a role in promoting democracy. The Clerks in this House and the Clerks in the Senate would understand and recognise that our parliamentary procedures and practices are something that we, as a middle power, can tell others about. They can adopt them in setting up their own democracies if they want to and perhaps take the best from them. In conclusion, a centenary conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union will take place in London in September. This will be an opportunity to promote and improve the image of the IPU which is one of the world's most hnportant international inter-parliamentary and political organisations, but it does not get credit for it. The IPU was formed a century ago by the British and the French. I think I am right in saying that in the first decade three people associated with that organisation received Nobel Prizes for their work in setting up what is nowÂ· the world's international arbitration system. It was under the auspices of the Inter-Parliamentary Union that Mr Gorbachev visited Mrs Thatcher in the United Kingdom some years ago. This started the whole spirit of glasnost and a new understanding between WestÂ· and East. Only yesterday President Bush made some comments on behalf of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation concerning a withdrawal and reduction of forces. I believe that started under the auspices of the IPU when Mr Gorbachev visited Mrs Thatcher. I think the Inter-Parliamentary Union is a most underrated and undervalued organisationÂ· in international forums. I can assure honourable members that, from my participation in the two conferences, the reBuda- ports of which we are discussing today, members of all sides of this Parliament more than adequately represented their country and we do have an influence in the portals of power in the world. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed.",82
91,Mr IAN CAMERON ,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Maranoa) (5.37)I have much pleasure in continuing my speech on the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 which seeks to amend the ment, I should say. Banking Act 1959. As I mentioned earlier, a number of amendments are proposed. The tion. statutory reserve deposit arrangements are to be abolished and banks will be required to deposit one per cent of their liquidity with the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Reserve Bank continues to be the central banking solutely arm of the Government; it is the controlling armÂ· of all our monetary policy. UnfortuThe nately it is being directed by a government that is totally out of control with the economic and micro-economic monetary polThe icies of this nation. Overall, we are in a sad state of affairs. Obviously some Austraand lians are doing well but, generally speaking, most Australians are being burdened by cessively high interest rates. Since the Treasit urer ( Mr Keating) deregulated interest rates, we have seen them continually yoyo. They seem progressively to go a bit higher because, generally speaking, the economy is .g-ttin.g worse. Our balance of payments posItion IS getting worse, our standard of living is falling and we are becoming worse off generally as a nation. As I mentioned earlier, the current borrowing figures were announced today. Our private and public gross borrowing-that .is, borrowings by government, government inpaper strumentalities as well as private enterone prise-amount to $130 billion. The net figure announced today is $103.95 billion. The Government likes to tell us that it has quit borrowing money overseas and that it is payone ing some back. Apparently the Treasurer paid back a bit last year. He has also changed around a few interest payments. Part figure of $1 billion announced today reflects an increase in government borrowings. That is a three monthly figure, so we are looking at about a $4 billion a year increase in Federal and State government borrowings alone. Of course, the private component of that three months is $7 billion. So the figures continue to ratchet up into the land of the never never as we head towards the banana republic situation, which is very sad for us. It is amazing that the only cure to the lem that the Opposition can suggest is to appoint an Ombudsman to look at banks. Mr MeG au ran-No; the Government.",83
92,Mr IAN CAMERON,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Yes, the GovernMr MeGauran-It should be the OpposiMONICA",84
93,Mr IAN CAMERON,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Yes, it should be the Opposition. The sorts of arrangements that the Government puts in place are abincredible. In fact, one does not have to use a bank. No-one has to go to a bank. Government cannot blame the banks for high interest rates. It is all controlled macrofrom the Treasury and the Reserve Bank. banks obviously have to make a profit; very there has to be a difference of between two three per cent between the interest rate that they offer in order to pick up funds and exthe rate at which they lend money, because costs money to own the buildings, to pay the staff, et cetera. Of course, as private corporations they also have to show a profit. Although we whinge about the amount of profit the banks make, the percentage return on investment is not that great. However, I must say that in the past couple of years it has been pretty healthy compared to farming. Even so, those private enterprises st!ll have to show a profit if they are to stay In net place in our overall monetary framework. People do not have to use a bank. Banks simply facilitate a form of exchange. The notes that are printed just pass from of us to another as goods used to be exchanged. We can still exchange goods if we want to. But no one has to go to a bank to get a Joan, so why blame the banks? If is forced to go to a bank to get a loan to build a house, et cetera, we know that today one will be asked to pay a record of the interest rate of 17 per cent. In talking to my own bank manager in Tara today I found that the Tara National Australia Bank is offering loans at 17 per cent. An equity of 20 per cent is requir-d. ThatÂ· is the highest interest rate for ho-smg for in his memory. It must be remembered that very few people have a fixed interest rate of 13.5 per cent. I saw a statistic today which indicates that, on average, people turn over their house every seven years and, of course, probwhen one does that one has to pay a new interest rate. This occurs when people take out a new loan. About 30 per cent of homebuyers were on the old fixed interest rate of 13.5 per cent, but as people change their homes they go to the higher rate. When they want to renegotiate a new loan they are confronted with the lovely new deregulated system that the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) introduced, and as of today they have to pay 17 per cent for the funds. We see the media making an awful lot of noise about the home loan rate; however, people in the media seem to forget that the corporate rate is 19.5 per cent, and the plus rate-which is the base rate plus I-for primary producers and other people industry is 20.5 per cent. The interest rate the loan that I have from the National in Tara, a farm loan, as of today is 20.5 per cent. Under this Labor Government, as of today, I am being charged' 20.5 per cent interest. This is 'also a record rate. The reaout son for this is the massive increase in laxaness tion. That is taking an enormous amount currency out of the private system and putpreciate ting it into the inefficient public system. have seen record increases in taxation under this Government. That is one of the reasons why our economy is so sick. We have seen huge increases in new taxes. We have seen a capital gains tax introduced. A headline in today's Courier-Mail indicated that one of the heads of the banks suggested that a capital gains tax on housing should introduced. I say to him and to anyone else who wishes to listen to me is that we ought not to have a capital gains tax at all. want to get this economy up and moving again the capital gains tax should be aboland ished. If there is to be a tax on speculative profits, it should be of the type that the Opposition is prepared to introduce. That would be a much lesser form of taxation than the existing regressive and distorted capital gains tax which Labor has introis duced, which does not apply to housing. Negative gearing has been reintroduced and is helping to push up to record levels the pri6e of housing in this country. The capital gains tax ought to be abolished. There is a lack of incentive to duce. We have the absurd statement from the Treasurer that interest rates have to be reduced to cut off imports. No-one-the Treasurer or anyone else-says anything about the cost of interest to the people who wish to export. The wheat, cattle and wool producers in my electorate are expected to stay in business and to export 20+ per cent, for God's sake! Producers cannot stay in business with those sorts of rates. These are some of the problems that this country is facing. There is no way known to science that the monetary policy of high interest is going to help us out of the rut that we are in. Sure, it will cut off imports, but it will also cut off exports. One balances Bout the other, and we are back to where we started. In the meantime, everyone in the incommunity who has to use money is being on severely punished for doing so with these Bank excessive high interest rates. Another matter concerns the lack of provision for depreciation. We have seen the Government bring in Bill after Bill to cut depreciation allowances. If one is in busithe capital goods that one uses do not of last forever. Most of them are made to deout of existence after a while. The We motor car, the truck, or whatever one buys to cart one's stock in order to stay in business, is designed to wear out after a period of four or five years. Mr Cunningham-Even dinner suits!",84
94,Mr IAN CAMERON,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Even dinner suits. This Labor Government has now introduced be depreciation provisions applying over a 10year period. Any depreciation in business is now to be written off over a lO-year periodIf we and the Government wonders why capital investment is way down, exports are down no-one wants to get into manufacturing replacement imports. The Government wonders why we are in a mess! This Government has now been in office for seven years and the situation is about twice as bad as it was when it came to office. The balance of trade an absolute sham and a disaster. For a nation with the standard of living and expertise that Australia has, the balance of payments under which we are suffering is, in my opinion, an absolute disgrace.",85
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,BANKING LEGISLATION,Mr Mountproford)-Order! I ask the honourable member to come back to the terms of the Bill.,85
96,Mr IAN CAMERON,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. Also, we have seen massive government borrowings through the Reserve Bank, which is mentioned in this Bill. The Reserve Bank does all the borrowings. We have seen massive government borrowings onshore in Australia, as well as overseas. Of course, we now have an item in our Budget of $8 billion or $10 billion alone just for interest payments. That is how much money we are giving to the lenders of the world in interest-$8 billion or $9 billion a year. The other thing we have seen relates to the tax cuts that honourable members opposite talk about. This involves some $5 billion. We have seen the workers of this nation paying their taxes into the Treasury over the past 18 months with the Treasurer telling them that he will do a tax deal with them, saying that the Government will give them half their wage increases in taxation cuts and the other half in a real inflated increase. So he .scoops the money from them and then giving back half their $5 billion in tax cuts. He is doing this during a period of inflation, at a time when he admits himself that the economy is blowing out. He is pumping $5 billion back into our economy. It is an absolute disgrace. As of 1 July, $5 billion will be pumped into the economy. The Treasurer himself says that this sort of economic activity should not be going on, that the economy is overblown and overheated. What a lot of nonsense. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill and the amendments contained therein.",85
97,Mr RONALD EDWARDS ,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Stirling) (5.48)-I am happy to support the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill. I hope that the new technology of the chamber is picking up the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell), who is tonight dressed in his official evening garb. I am happy to support this legislation for a number of reasons, and I will refer specifically to those in a moment. I say to the honourable member for Maranoa ( Mr Ian Cameron) that the investment pattern is not as he suggests. There has been an increase in investment, and at present Australia is facing a very big increase in investment activity. Part of the problem that we are addressing relates to capital goods imported to service the demands of industry. However, the Bill focuses more specifically on banking, so I should address myself to that. When we look at banking in Australia, it is very interesting to note that in many senses we are tracing the history of the economy of Australia. Banks have played a very central role. In my view, they also have an obligation to play an important social role in terms of the consequences of some of their activities. I want to address myself to those in a moment. It is quite clear when one looks at the capital market as it currently operates in Australia that we now have a much wider, more sophisticated and more highly volatile capital market than has ever been the case before. In the context of the debates that we have in this chamber, I am not sure that everyone understands how dramatic the changes have been in recent years. We now have daily fixings of exchange rates, share prices and money market movements as well as futures markets and commodity markets, all of which impact on the Australian economy. As well as daily fixings we have daily movements, which again tend to impact considerably upon the way the Australian economy operates. It is true that theÂ· Australian economy is no longer a humidicrib-we cannot go back to the past. I often hear in this place that the Australian economy should go back to the days when things were much more tightly managed. With due respect to the people who produce rural commodities, I would say on their behalf that the characteristic of their trading has been that they have operated in an externally competitive market, and they have tended to meet the demands of that competition. However, it is also .true to say that, historically, the rest of the Australian economy has not been characterised by that open competitiveness which is a characteristic of the way in which our economy is now heading. The Government tried to address that structural characteristic of the banking system to ensure that the Australian banking system began to reflect some of the demands of a competitive and open business in the way it ought to have been. There was a lot of discussion among members of this side of the House which centred around whether or not we should deregulate the banking system, and whether or not we should issue foreign banking licences. The history of what we did is now before us: we did that, as a Government and a party. My colleagues the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) were part of that process, were actively involved in that process and have seen the outcome of it. What we have now is a much more sophisticated, fast-moving and active banking sector than we have ever had. It is also true to say that the sorts of things one might have talked about 10 years ago, such as statutory reserve deposits and the requirement to keep to certain liquid assets and government securities ratios, are things of the past too. We have seen a dramatic change in the way banks operate. Having said that by way of introduction, there are some specific observations which I should make. In the context of current Australian economic management, interest rates play a pivotal role in terms of monetary policy. The reason they do is that those old quantitative and directive processes and policies that the Reserve Bank of Australia could use are no longer available, because this Government and the community made the decision to remove those restrictions. However, we cannot have it both ways. Dr Charlesworth-The shadow Treasurer wants them back.",86
98,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,BANKING LEGISLATION,"It is interesting that the honourable member for Perth has made that observation. The Opposition has this great conundrum. As the honourable member for Perth says, it wants the shadow Treasurer back. This is the challenge which the Opposition has to face. Opposition members come to this place and complain about the high level of interest rates. The interest rate reflects the price of money, and the price of money reflects a number of other factors in the economy such as the relevant trade balance, the level of economic activity and the amount of money that has been earned in the private and public sectors and its disposal. One cannot go down the path of opening up the economy and letting a lot of market forces operate more freely in that economy, and then hedge one's bets. It is like getting into a swimming pool; you are either in, or you are not. Once one decides to get in the swimming pool and teeters over the edge, one is in there. The next question is whether one can swim. That is what we have done in Australia. We have said, 'Let's stop hanging about on the edge; let's get the swimming pool; and now let's see if we can swim'. This banking legislation requires skillful economic management and it puts the onus on most pe?ple in the community to perform. I do not see any reason why we should be afraid of that. Nor do I see any reason why the trade union movement, the Government, or the employers should be bothered by that. That is a challenge to all of us. We are not in a humidicrib. In that context, what is the role of banks? I want to dispose of one point at the outset. We, in Western Australia, have been treated to the failure of a financial institution called Rothwells Ltd. What I wish to state very clearly in this debate is that Rothwells carried the title 'merchant bank'. In my view, and clearly in economic terms too, that is a courtesy title. Sadly, in relation to Rothwells, a lot of people were deceived into believing that an institution which carried the courtesy title 'merchant bank' had the same status, authority and security as, for example, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia or Westpac Banking Corporation. A lot of people Australia-wide were deceived and misled by the courtesy title 'merchant bank'. The Western Australian Government acted and removed Rothwells's dealer's licence under the recommendations of the National Companies and Securities Commission. The point to be made-and I say this to people who may be concerned with financial practicesis please do not be deceived into thinking that those quasi-banking institutions called merchant banks are banks. They are not. There is no lender of last resort for those banks in terms of the Reserve Bank's role. It may be true that Laurie Connell bore the title 'last resort Laurie', but the last resort was not that of the Reserve Bank, under the Banking Act 1959, being obliged to bail out Rothwells. There was no bail out requirement from the Reserve Bank. It was very interesting for my colleagues, who like me are also from Western Australia, to have seen that situation. I make no jUdgment about it or of any government. I simply make the observation that the public should beware, when they are dealing with financial institutions, that while there are some which are highly reputable, stable and very effective financial institutions, it is true into that some are playing on the more highly geared fringe of the market. It is also true that Rothwells was one of those latter institutions. I think a lot of people were of the view that once they had put money into Rothwells they had a guarantee of last resort lender by the Reserve Bank. No such guarantee existed. I think they also thought that the arrangement entered into after October 1987 meant that they would get their money back. That is also not the case. In my view, people who had their money in Rothwells were at risk. Why? It was because those funds attracted a higher interest rate, and that is the bonus one gets when one's money is put at risk. What bothers me is when we blur the lines. The reason I am dealing with this-I want to say something about the proper banking structure and the trading and savings banks in a moment-is that we ought to be very clear that 'merchant bank' was a courtesy title for Rothwells. It is a title that we have used in Australia. Let us not label all merchant banks in the same way. Many merchant banks have played very important roles in gearing up finance and it is clear that, at one stage, that' was Rothwells' role. I want to turn to the matter of banks proper. What we have done in terms of changing the structure of banks is to tell them they now have a much freer market place in which to operate. There are two significant observations to make in this context. The first is that with the deregulation of banks, banks in Australia were given a once and forever opportunity to be more competitive and to experiment in the market place. We applaud them specifically for that, because it has put their management to the test. Certainly, the issuing of foreign bank licences meant that the scope of that test was widened and that is a good thing. At the same time, we introduced full imputation of dividends, in terms of the shares and dividends in the market place for banks. Those two Acts meant that banks in Australia have now been freed to perform a very profitable role for themselves, and they do. To illustrate that, Westpac's profit in the six months to the end of March jumped by 63 per cent to $377m. The National Australia Bank's profit jumped by 52 per cent to $408m. One is not troubled by the fact that these institutions are seeking to make profits; it is the other side of the ledger which I wish to address. By having full imputation of company dividends, and a freer banking system, banks are being given a very important, and in some sense unique, role to play. Therefore, it is my view that in the context of current interest rate movements-and I recognise the Government's role in tightening monetary policy and, therefore, forcing interest rates up-the banks have to do more in terms of absorbing the changes in money market movements to protect those people who have borrowed money for housing mortgages. Why do I draw that conclusion? I do so for this reason: If one takes the deposit interest rates, paid by banks and their movements-that is, the price of the money the banks are getting-and compares them with the price they charge the borrower, very clearly banks have been doing very nicely. Let us look at the figures. Let us take the example of the sum of $3,000 in a savings account paying interest on the minimum daily balance. The deposit rate that Westpac paid in May 1988 was 8.5 per cent. The deposit rate paid in May 1989 was 8.75 percent. In other words, there was a movement of 0.25 per cent on the deposit in that time. In the meantime, however, Westpac's housing mortgage rate has gone up much faster; The Commonwealth Bank rate has gone up from 8.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent; so it has given one per cent extra to its depositors during that period of time. ANZ's rate has gone from 9 per cent to 12 per cent. So the ANZ has been much fairer to its depositors than have one or two other banks. The National Australia Bank has increased its rate from 8.25 per cent to 9 per cent. The interest rate of the State Bank of New South Wales has stayed at 9 per cent. The National Mutual Royal's rate has gone from 7.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent. St George's rate has gone from 8.7 per cent to 9 per cent. Citibank's rate has stayed at 6 per cent Chase AMP's rate has stayed at 7 per cent. With the exception of the ANZ, the Commonwealth Bank and National Mutual Royal, the pattern of deposit interest rates shows very little movement. In terms of what is offered to depositors, money remains relatively cheap. Yet, at the same time the banks have chosen to lend that money at a rate which is on the up escalator. In those circumstances it is fair to make the judgment that the banks, having benefited from dividend imputation and from the deregulation of the financial system and having kept their deposit prices down, have not played their part in terms of equity. Dr Charlesworth-There have been tax changes, too.",87
99,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,BANKING LEGISLATION,"There has certainly been a benefit in the tax changes. The banks have not played their part. There has been a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate. The banks may well say that, in terms of the price earnings ratio, banks are not the most favourable financial institutions listed on the stock market. I would agree with them. The banks certainly do not attract the highest rate of earnings in relation to their invested assets but they are in a most privileged position in the stock market and in the community generally. Very few institutions are guaranteed by the Reserve Bank or have certainty in terms of their financial practices. My colleague the Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples), who is at the table, has to deal with the outcomes of their activity. We on this side of the House are concerned about delivering housing to people and, at the same time, a flow of funds to those people through the banking system. Therefore, it.is fair to conclude that the banking system has a part. to play in this. The judgment that I would deliver is that at present the banking system is not playing its part. As I have said, I acknowledge the price earnings ratio point that has been raised by the Australian Bankers Association and by Mr Nobby Clark and others. But having acknowledged that, banks have special structural characteristics that are not offered, for example, to Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd or to CSR Ltd, that is, the banks' financial fUiture is secured by the lender of last resort capacity. In those circumstances the judgment I would draw is that if an institution has special characteristics and a price earnings ratio that puts it at about middle range in terms of the stock market, which is the case, it cannot then turn around and say, 'We have fulfilled our social obligations because our price earnings ratio is not at the top of the pile'. Of course it is not. At the same time, banks, which attract special circumstances, having benefited from reforms put in place by the Government, cannot say, 'We are quite justified in jacking up interest rates willy nilly'. It is not acceptable in my view nor, I believe, in the view of many of my colleagues, that that is a proper, responsible way to operate in the money market. The banks have a greater role to play. The banks have put a lot of pressure on the Government to remove the 13.5 per cent ceiling. In the past we deregulated so that new loans would not have that 13.5 per cent ceiling. I am not convinced-and the banks have never convinced me of this matter-by the banks saying, 'As a trade-off, if the Government removes the 13.5 per cent ceiling we will move the interest rate'. Previously, the banks said that they would move it to 14.5 per cent. The question is: What rate do the banks want to move it to now-15.5 per cent or 16.5 per cent? In the past the banks have always said, 'If the Government removes the ceiling we will also bring down our new loan rates'. At the time of deregulation, the banks also said-and one remembers the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and the report of the Martin Review of the Australian Financial System- 'If the Government deregulates the financial system the banks will offer cheaper housing'. That has not been the outcome. The banks have profited very substantially from the deregulated market system and from the other structural reforms which the Government has put in place. I do not resent the fact that they have profited which is due, in measure, to the effect of their management practices and their ability to operate in the marketplace. But the banks have a privileged position. Unlike any other industry, they are bailed out at the end of the day. Mr Downer-When was one last bailed out?",89
100,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,BANKING LEGISLATION,"We would have to go back to the Depression-the 1930s. I pay due tribute to the fact that the Menzies Government's banking legislation in 1959 was landmark legislation because it put in placeÂ· structures that meant we had a secure financial system much superior to that of almost any comparable country. I will give credit where it is due. That was very far-sighted legislation. Over time we were able to bring in reforms. That legislation was so good it foresaw many of the present problems in the United States, for example, where there are many small banks with very limited capital-we could talk about capital adequacy ratios and so on-which have not followed appropriate prudential practices and are finding themselves going out of business. In Australia, because of the far-sightedness of that legislation and because, by and large, we have had bank managers who have done a good job-let us give credit where 'it is due-we have a banking system that has not been characterised by failure. We now have a more open marketplace. I am not in the position of saying, 'The banks must do X', because that is not the way the world is. We have a bargaining relationship. I am standing in this place saying, 'Having had a look at your figures, this is the way I think you should be operating'. The banks, too, are quite entitled to get up and say, 'Having looked at our figures, we think we should operate in a different way'. That is fair, too. I am not troubled by that. I think it is reasonable to put some propositions about the deposit rate and the fact that there is now a wider gap between the deposit rate that banks pay-I cited those figures earlier-and the interest rates charged to people to whom they lend money. That needs to be stressed. A number of banking reforms have been put in place. The test of those reforms has to be the profit performances of banks-I have talked about that. The test also has to be how the banking industry operates-it is operating very effectively, employment practices are far sighted and the adoption of new technology is far sighted. But there is that other social obligation that I talked about earlier. We have an obligation to look at the impact of banking prices on housing and the supply of housing to people. It would be fair to conclude that at present, with banks such as Westpac and the National Australia Bank doing so well, banks need to consider modifying their practices to ensure that they minimise any pressure on people who borrow money for housing. I note that the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer) has joined us and I think it is an appropriate time to hand over to him. I am pleased to commend the legislation to the House.",89
101,Mr DOWNER ,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Mayo) (6.08)-1 support the Banking Legislation Al1}.endment Bill and the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) which I think is an important safeguard. I hope the Government will accept that amendment. I support this legislation because legislation is rarely part of the Government's general thrust towards deregulation of the financial system-work that it carried on from the Fraser-Howard Government after the conclusion of the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. This legislation introduces three different changes to the financial system in Australia, all of which make at least minor adjustments to the degree of regulation in the system. Firstly, it removes the distinction between trading and savings banks. I am quite happy to see that happen, and I will not say any more about it. Secondly, it phases down and will eventually replace the existing statutory reserve deposit (SRD) arrangement, which most of us who did economics at university were brought up with and seemed to understand in those far off days, with a system of non-callable deposits (NCDs). I note tht when this change was first announced-if I am right it was announced in the last Budget, which means that it has taken a long time to get to the House-it wa& predicted that this change from SRDs to NCDs, would lead to an extra $2 billion being added to the banking system or, to the money supply. One reason why the money supply is growing so rapidly at the moment, the Government argues-I do not accept this argument-is simply this change in the requirements for banks: the abolition of the statutory reserve deposits and their replacement by non-callable deposits. The Government should be taking much more seriously the issue of money supply, partiCUlarly at a time when money supply is growing by about 18 per cent. To use this as an excuse, as the latest excuse, to ignore monetary targets is extremely irresponsible. Not many countries in the world have taken the almost flippant and dismissive approach of this Government to monetary targets, dismissing them out of hand as being no longer relevant. Let me point out that the Reserve Bank of Australia-and I will come back to the Reserve Bank later in this debate-is concerned that the (]overnment no longer adheres to monetary targets. Should there be a change of government at the next election, as I believe everyone now recognises there will be, one of the consequences of that change will be that medium term monetary targeting will be reintroduced by the Peacock Liberal (]overnment. Thirdly, this Bill provides a statutory basis for the Reserve Bank's role of supervising, monitoring and investigating certain aspects of banking legislation. I do not want to say too much about that except, in the context of that objective of the legislation, to support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Wentworth to ensure that when the Reserve Bank is investigating the books, accounts and transactions of individuals who hold accounts with particular banks the (]overnor is at least fully aware of and responsible for the decision to hold that investigation. Much of the debate has been taken up by discussion about the role of the banks,particularly at a time of high interest rates. Two speeches that I heard earlier in the day I found to be quite alarming, and they were the speeches of the honourable member for Bowman ( Mr Sciacca) and the honourable member for Cowan ( Mrs Jakobsen). Both speeches were reminiscent of the socialist hysteria of the Labor Party of Australia in eras gone by. Those honourable members denounced the role of the banks and claimed that the banks were responsible for the massive increase in particular but not exclusively in home loan interest rates in recent months. The honourable member for Stirling ( Mr Ronald Edwards) made a much more. rational and balanced speech, I thought, but he too could not quite resist the temptation-although knowing all along that the temptation was one he probably should have resisted-to attack the banks and claim that they are responsible for the current state of interest rates in this country. It is all very well for (]overnment backbenchers to criticise the banks-obviously they are running around their electorates doing that, trying to hose down the political odium that has developed in the community towards the Labor Party's high interest rate policy-but it is depressing that the senior economic managers of this country, including the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), are also playing the same game. For example, the Treasurer, referring to the banks, said on 17 Apriland this will be a quote that is read back to the Treasurer time and time again: As soon as they see some of that profit growth being threatened, they're out there squealing like stuck pigs on television, every time they get a chance. Well, the public should understand the interests of bankers are not their interests. That quote reveals a fundamental difference in philosophy between honourable members on this side, who support the private enterprise system and who believe that inevitably a competitive private enterprise system will lead to that system serving the community as best as an economic system ever can, and honourable members on the other side of the House, including the Treasurer, who apparently reject that sort of philosophy. The honourable member for Stirling talked about the profitability of the banks, and I thought that he made quite a concession, a concession that none of his colleagues seemed prepared to make, and that was that since deregulation bank profitability has fallen towards the industrial average and current profits of the major retail banks are something in the order of 15 per cent of shareholders' funds. That is not excessive, of course, when compared with the yield of 13.7 per cent on 10-year (]overnment bonds. In addition to looking at the profitability of the banks, one also needs to look at the sheer size of banking operations so that one understands the relevance of the profitability figures. The assets of Australian banks total something in the vicinity of $270 billion, according to the latest Reserve Bank figures, and it is interesting to. note that that is the equivalent of around 80 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product in 1988-89. In the decade to 1987-88, the assets of the four major Australian banks increased 5t times and the capital invested increased more than sixfold, but the House should remember, and certainly the Labor Party should remember, that profits after tax increased by less than fivefold. Thus, by any analysis, profits in the banking system have failed to grow as rapidly as shareholders' funds and assets, and it follows that bank profitability has therefore declined-and it has declined over the past decade. I am not saying that that is a particularly disastrous thing; I must say that, if bank profitability has declined, one of the reasons it has declined is the greater degree of competitiveness that has emerged in the banking system. I welcome that. That suggests, perhaps, that before the deregulation of the banking system there were, if you like, monopoly profits being made by banks, which are. now being dispensed with.' Profitability is declining because of competition. It is important to remember that proportional profitability is declining, and the reason for my making that point is to emphasise that it is not the banks that are ripping off the Australian community through high home loan interest rates; it is the Government's policy that is doing that. If the Government were to deny that its high interest rate policy meant high mortgage rates and interest rates charged generally by the banking system-as Labor backbenchers in particular are denying, blaming the banks-then that would be to deny the whole rationale of Government economic policy. People such as the Acting Treasurer and Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins) who is at the table, his friend and colleague the Treasurer, and the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), are running around the country saying that we must have high interest rates in order to soak up excessive domestic demand and that, if we can soak up excessive domestic demand, we will be able to resolve the balance of payments problems by reducing imports. That is what they are saying all over Australia. How can they say that on the one hand and on the other hand blame the banks for high interest rates when the whole basis of the Government's policy is high interest rates? The Government admits that that is the basis of its policy. It is profoundly dishonest in intellectual terms for members of the Labor Party to run around blaming the banks. It is the cheapest and the lowest sort of political scare campaign, the most dishonest scare campaign, that one can imagine. That is why these issues of bank profitability must be brought to the attention of the House, because honourable members and the Australian community must remember that bank profitability taken as a proportion of bank assets has actually been declining, not increasing, over the past decade and, therefore, the argument that banks are somehow increasingly ripping people off as interest rates rise simply does not stand up. Consider the fact that in 1988 bank profitability, as everyone has been pointing out, has allegedly improved. It is interesting to note that only one bank in Australia, the Challenge Bank, has ranked among the top 50 listed companies in terms of profitability. Although the four major banks are ranked among the 50 largest listed companies, no bank ranks in the first 25 companies. In other words, amongst the large companies, banks are in the bottom half in terms of profitability. Members of the Labor Party should really try to remember that, and I think that deep down inside they probably know it. People such as the Treasurer, the honourable member for Makin ( Mr Duncan) and other backbenchers opposite who have spoken in this debate are simply not prepared to concede that point, and that means that they are simply not prepared to concede the whole basis of the Government's economic strategy. In the case of the Treasurer, I find that particularly alarming and confusing. As all honourable members on this side know, and as the people of Australia know, current high interest rates are nothing to do with banks ripping off the Australian community; high interest rates are an indictment of the Government's complete and utter inability to do anything about the structural problems of the Australian economy and its determination to fall back on one instrument or lever, as the Government likes to say, of economic policy; that is, monetary policy. I do not want to be seen as a member of parliament who does nothing more than goes out and defends banks. No bank is perfect and there are doubtless thousands of stories about bank managers who may have done one thing or another to a customer which is less than desirable. There is no question that that sort of thing can go on. But in general terms, the performance of the Australian banks has to be understood in an intellectually coherent and fair way. The banks should not be used, as they are being used, as scapegoats for the failure of the Government's economic policy. This legislation also gives rise, as I mentioned earlier, to the role of the Reserve Bank. It makes provision for the Reserve Bank to have a supervisory and monitoring role, particularly in the light of the abolition of SRDs and other regulatory functions that the Reserve Bank and the Treasury have had in years gone by. But when we consider the role of the Reserve Bank, it is worth reflecting on the problems that already exist-and still exist despite this legislation-with the current relationship between the Government and the Reserve Bank. I think many members of Parliament would privatelyand a few on this side of the Houses publicly-agree that the Reserve Bank lacks sufficient de facto independence, even though de jure it has a fair degree of independence. When we look at the comments made earlier this month by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, we know what he really thinks about the way the economy is being managed. The Governor of the Reserve Bank was reported as saying: FamilIes are facing another drastic cut in standards because the Government has blundered over its economic policy. The Governor of the Reserve Bank is effectivelysaying that the Government has got it wrong-the Government's economic policy is wrong. When the Treasurer had these comments drawn to his attention, his response was-and this is quite incredible, coming from the chief economic Minister in this Government, who has been in' that portfolio for over six years that it was not really the Government's fault. Guess whose fatilt it was this time? It was the Reserve Bank's fault; it was the Reserve Bank of Australia that had got it all wrong. The fact is that the Reserve Bank has simply pointed out that the Government has blundered in its economic policy. . One of the problems that we have with the relationship between the Government and the Reserve Bank is that, in a de facto sense, the Reserve Bank has not been able to exercise sufficient independence from Government policy. I draw the attention of the House to a recent Bill which was introduced into the New Zealand Parliament. A report in the Australian Financial Review of 5 May points out: The bill gives the central bankthe Reserve Bank of New Zealandautonomous control of monetary policy, to enable it to fight inflation without interference from the Government. That quote should warm the heart of any central banker in Australia. It reminds us that other countries such as New Zealand are giving their central bank greater independence in the management of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Bank in the United States of America already has that greater independence. But in this country, much as our Reserve Bank would like, it still feels' unable to exercise the real independence that it should over monetary policy. Earlier in this debate, near the beginning of my speech, I mentioned that the Government had abandoned monetary targets and that the Reserve Bank in some publications in recent months has pointed to the importance of medium term monetary targeting. If we gave the Reserve Bank more autonomy and separated it from the incompetence of living the present Government, we might get a more coherent monetary policy; we might have medium to long term monetary targeting; and we might end up with better overall economic management in this country. The Reserve Bank has become far too responsive to the whims of the Treasurer in particular. There are many anecdotes running around money markets and the financial community which recall comments that the Treasurer has made to senior officials in the Reserve Bank. It would be unparliamentary for me to recall some of those anecdotes. One does not know how accurate they are, but one knows that the Treasurer on numerous occasions has lent very heavily on the Reserve Bank of Australia. In conclusion, let me say that I would like to see the Reserve Bank have much greater independence than it currently has from Government policy because the consequence of that would be better economic management than we have at present in this country. I know that with a change of government the Reserve Bank will get that greater autonomy and a greater degree of respect from the government of the day. I think the arguments that are being put forward by people in the Australian Labor Party denouncing banks and trying to find scapegoats for the Government's high interest rates policies are not just nugatory but intellectually dishonest. I think Government members ought to abandon those arguments forthwith because eventually the truth will come out and they will be shown up to be the fraudulent arguments that they really are.",90
102,Dr CHARLESWORTH ,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Perth) (6.26)It is with great pleasure that I rise tonight to speak on the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill, which outlines some significant changes to banking legislation in this. country. This legislation is supported by the Opposition. It was interesting this morning to listen to the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), supporting many of the initiatives that the Government has taken in respect of its deregulation of the financial markets in this country. The shadow Treasurer supported wholeheartedly the float of the Australian dollar, the deregulation that generally has occurred in the financial sector, and the placing of a number of foreign banks in our domestic environment. He suggested that this was part of the impetus of tile Martin Review of the Australian FinanCial System and the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, which reported in the 1980s. The. suggestion was that the Government had picked up the cudgels from the Opposition and carried on the good work. It is interesting to note that the Campbell Committee reported in 1980; yet it was not until 1983, when the Hawke Labor Government came into power, that these very significant initiatives were undertaken. One wonders what the Opposition was doing during those two years while the report sat on the table. During that time our taxation system was haemorrhaging dramatically. The Labor Party, then in opposition, had very significant concerns about the activities of the then Government. This legislation concerns the prudential requirements of the way in which banks manage their business and the oversight of the activities of the banks by the Reserve Bank of Australia. According to the shadow Treasurer, the danger is that this is a. step back towards re-regulation. I reject that suggestion as scaremongering. A more formalised set of procedures for prudential oversight is something that is important in a banking system that is to hold its integrity. The removal of statutory reserve deposits will provide more flexibility for the banks and will increase the effectiveness of their functioning. Indeed, this is something that is supported by both sides of the House. There was a suggestion that the powers to investigate the books of the banks by the Reserve Bank in some way would be a dangerous intrusion into privacy. This has been pursued by the Opposition to the extent of an amendment but, again, it is something that we reject. It is important, as the honourable member for Stirling ( Mr Ronald Edwards) outlined, for us to understand what we mean when we talk about banks. Those of us in Western Australia have fresh in our minds the great concern about the failure of Rothwells, a merchant bank that created a great deal of trauma in the finanCial milieu of Western Australia. Many should be aware of the sorts of activities of merchant banks. It is necessary for us to understand the difference between those banks which are underwrittenby the Reserve Bank and the activities of merchant banks, which tend to be much greater risk takers. I think that is a lesson that those of us in Western Australia have learned. Professor Hewson, the shadow Treasurer, this morning made the same speech that he made for the matter of public importance later in the day. Mr Dawkins-He has only one speech.",94
103,Dr CHARLESWORTH,BANKING LEGISLATION,"---,-The Acting Treasurer is exactly right. I listened to both speeches. He recycled this morning's speech in the discussion on the matter of public importance andÂ· talked about all of those things in the economy that concern him most. There is no question but that interest rates are high and there is no question but that the Government would prefer the current state of affairs not to exist. In Australia at the moment we have a very vibrant, growing economy, and it is much better for us to try to manage a growing economy than economy that is in deep recession or in negative growth-the sort of economy that we were handed in 1983 when we came to office. The question is asked again and again on the Government side of the House: what is the alternative? Again and again those on the Opposition side talk down the economy, hoping beyond hope that there will be a massive collapse and it will present them with their best chance of coming to government. Time and time again Government members ask: what is the Opposition's solution? Some of the solutions that have been put up have some credibility, but the bulk of what we hear from the other side is intellectually dishonest and an insult to anybody who understands the topic. Accepting the fact that high interest rates have to be part of the structure, the shadow Treasurer has said time and time again that he does not know of a solution, given the present situation, except that he will cut fiscal policy. We heard from him at the weekend that he will target health, welfare and education for cuts. Indeed, he went further. We asked him where the cuts will come from; which pensioners will miss out, which areas of education will be slashed and in which areas of the health budget savings will be made. We have not heard the answers. A headline in the West Australian today said that 20,000 students missed out on places in tertiary institutions this year because there were not enough places for them. The Government has made remarkable advances in increasing the number of places available in tertiary institutions, but the Opposition is suggesting that it will cut education spending. The Acting Treasurer, in an answer in Question Time today, made the point very clearly that the Opposition's solution to the education dilemma is full fees for studentsa demand side reaction to a very difficult problem. When quizzed about when the Opposition's spending and tax policies would be released, the Opposition spokesman said: I can't be held accountable for other people. I have only held the job for 10 days. I will do fast as we can. That seems a reasonable explanation: he has been in the job for only 10 days; we cannot expect him to come up with the solution. We ask: Who has been doing the job for the last year and a half? It is the Leader of Opposition. He did the job for a year and half and he had no solution. If we look to the next person who has responsibility, finance spokesman, we find that it was the honourable member for Wentworth. So the suggestion that he has not been able to come up with a solution carries very little weight. It would be dangerous and foolish for the Government not to admit the possibility that the economy could slide dramatically into recession, as it did in 1982, but there is a fundamental difference between what happened in 1982 and what is happening now. In 1982 our economy was uncompetitive, having been slowed down dramatically by a huge increase in wages of between 15 and 17 per cent. We do not have that situation now; it is possible that we will be able to come through and make a soft landing. The Opposition is asking what the Government has done in micro-economic reform. The list is as long as one's arm. There have been significant tax cuts for companies, personal tax cuts and tariff reductions. We have broken down the two airline agreement, introduced award restructuring, increased research and development incentives by 150 per cent, and made changes in government and business enterprises. I could go on and on. Let us compare that record with the Opposition's record and the Opposition's solutions. All we hear from the Opposition is, 'We can make living standards better, yet at the same time we will cut spending on education, social security and health.' I am sorry but the two things are mutually exclusive. That needs to be remembered. If Opposition members want to have an honest debate about it, let us have an honest debate. Let us say, 'Okay; there is a requirement for Australians to save more and spend less, and these are the ways in which we can do it'. But Opposition members should not come into the House crying crocodile. tears about it as Australia having a massive foreign debt and say that it is all the Government's making, because it is not. In today's Advertiser-not a newspaper I normally read-a front-page article states that three experts say that we owe the world the $100 billion. That is a large amount of a money. It is a figure that is used often when . we talk about our foreign debt. The article the quotes Dr Frank Gelber, a well-respected economist, who has this to say about our foreign debt: 'We didn't get here in one year'. Australia found itself with 12-digit debt, he said, by running a persistent current account deficit-earning less than we spentAs any householder knows, one cannot earn less than one spends; over a period of time it leads to debt. The article continues: . . . over a number of years. Dr Gelber said the seeds of the problem had been sown more than 20 years ago. If we go back to 1969, after a considerable time of conservative government-'",94
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,BANKING LEGISLATION,Mr Mountford)-Order! I ask the honourable member to come back to the terms of the Bill. I know we have been ranging fairly widely; but I think he is ranging a little bit too far.,96
105,Dr CHARLESWORTH,BANKING LEGISLATION,"With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker. I listened to the honourable member for Wentworth this moming. He spent one minute on the legislation and 25 minutes talking about the general economic situation. In fact, it was the same speech we heard in the discussion of the matter of public importance.",96
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BANKING LEGISLATION,"I was not in the chair then, so I ask the honourable member where he can to come back""to the Bill.",96
107,Dr CHARLESWORTH,BANKING LEGISLATION,"I will, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am directing my attention to interest rates,which is an important aspect of banking legislation. With your indulgence, I would like to finish the quote: . . . more than 20 years ago, when Australian governments decided to fix too high the price that the Australian dollar was valued at in overseas currencies. 'We weren't competitive,' he argued yesterday. 'Our manufactured goods were too expensive and that led to the destruction of our manufacturing industries. Printing went in the 1960s, textiles, clothing and footwear and a lot of others in the '70s and through to the mid-80s'. It is only since the mid-1980s that we have been able to turn the situation around. As we are talking about significant banking legislation, it is justifiable to get onto the topic of interest rates. I accept much of what was said by the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer), as I accept what was said by the honourable member for Stirling in respect of interest rates. There are a number of reasons why banks have been making significant profits,and there is concern in the general population at the size of the profits that the banks have been making. We must remember that some significant changes have been made by this Government which have improved the profitability of the banking sector. The tax treatment of the corporate sector has been changed. Following deregulation, there has been a massive increase in the turnover and activity of banks, and dividend imputation has made the banks a much more attractive investment prospect for many people. It is not the banks' fault that interest rates are high. To suggest that would be dishonest. But one of the factors must be their profitability. Clearly, at a time when they have been given those considerable opportunities, we would expect that they would be very circumspect in their decisions to increase interest rates. There is a number of reasons that interest rates rise. They rise because of supply and demand considerations. There are more people wanting to borrow than there are people wanting to lend money. They rise because of risk considerations. Indeed, Australia has traditionally had to borrow significant amounts of money overseas to finance expansion and development in our country. So if we have a floating dollar and a currency which is seen to be at risk it is necessary to offer higher interest rates to those who will lend money in Australia. Of course, the activities of the Reserve Bank of Australia also affects interest rates as the Reserve Bank requires the selling and buying of bonds between banks. Those factors all play a part. But I say to honourable members that what is important is the gap between what the banks pay and what the banks charge. The honourable member for Stirling pointed out very clearly that there are significant discrepancies. Many investors in this country still haye money in the bank at 3.25 per cent. For those investors the difference between the 3.25 per cent that they are getting and the 17 per cent that is being charged for housing loans is seen as a very large margin. Those who have the standard deposit at 8, 10 or 12 per cent, again see the margin as significant. I understand that there is a 13t per cent interest rate ceiling on loans to home borrowers before April or July 1986. This is a factor in theÂ· banks' profitability. But we need to consider that in an environment where the banks have considerable opportunity and a considerable role in an important sector of our community they need to be very careful and circumspect in the way in which they shift their interest rates. The honourable member for Mayo menlarger banks. tioned-and I just mention this as an asidethat the Challenge Bank in Western Australia is one of the most successful companies in Australia-in fact it is in the top 50. Indeed, the Challenge Bank has recently weathered a takeover storm from the Adfollow. vance Bank Australia Ltd. Certainly many of us in Western Australia have an attachlegislation ment to the Challenge Bank, which was prement's viously the Perth Building Society. I ther understand that the Minister for Employabout ment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawking ins), who is seated at the table, is a Challenge Bank customer, as I am, and I am sure that he would understand very well that we have an attachment to this bank because it has long history in Western Australia and in Fremantle and Perth in particular. It vides a very good local service and network. As customers of that bank, as depositors as Western Australians it is our hope that that bank will be able to survive in a very predatory market-the sort of market that presently exists in the banking industry. Mr Dawkins-They will give you a bigger overdraft after this.",96
108,Dr CHARLESWORTH,BANKING LEGISLATION,"I hope so. Perhaps I will be in touch with it. But it is of immigration? concern that we saw recently another move made on the Challenge Bank. We hope that we can have a truly competitive banking sector in this country-a banking sector that will allow smaller banks, such as the Chalto lenge Bank, to grow and become of such a significance stature that they can become immune to those sorts of takeover sort of competitive network that a bank such as the Challenge Bank provides and the range of services it provides for small investors Western Australia's local shopping centres are important. I hope that, in some way, the Challenge Bank can continue to grow and thrive as it has done. Recently, in the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher, that great bastion of free enterprise, protected Scottish and Newcastle Breweries from a takeover by Carlton and United Breweries in Australia. I hope that, in the same way, some consideration can be given to the way in which the smaller banks in this country are able to provide the very substantial service that they provide for their customers without being consumed by much I wanted to say something about the contribution of the honourable member for Maranoa ( Mr Ian Cameron) but, as usual it was contradictory and almost impossible to With time running out, I do not have the opportunity. But I want to say that this is important from the Governpoint of view because it provides furevidence of the fact that we are serious becoming internationalised, about havan open, flat playing field for our banking and financial activities, and about the way in which the economy is adjusted and run. It is my hope that this legislation will a pass, unamended, through the House. I hope that honourable members on the other side proof the House will be able to support it.",97
109,Mr RUDDOCK ,BANKING LEGISLATION,Dundas) (6.46)-The and Banking Legislation Amendment Bill which is before us is an omnibus Bill of sorts and it relates to the Banking Act. The purposes of the Bill are quite numerous. I mention that it is an omnibus Bill because I think that is the very basis upon which the broadranging comments that we have heard in this debate have been addressed. Mr Dawkins-Do you want to talk about,97
110,Mr RUDDOCK,BANKING LEGISLATION,"I can assure the Minister for Employment, Education and Training that the very capable Chair would be quick to intervene if I wanted to extend this debate cover issues relating to immigration.",97
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,BANKING LEGISLATION,Mr Mountbids. The ford)-Most decidedly.,97
112,Mr RUDDOCK,BANKING LEGISLATION,"In that case, I will not trifle with the Chair. I take this opportunity into address some of the issues th-t have been canvassed in the course of this debate. One of the reasons thatÂ· I wanted to canvass the wide ambit of the legislation in my introductory comments was to put it in perspective. The principal provisions of the Bill are to remove all references in the present Banking Act to trading banks and savings banks, to replace them with general references to banks and to facilitate the removal of the distinction between such banks. That decision was announced by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) in the last Budget. The removal of that distinction is not of great moment because I gather that many of the banks already have their operations fused. But the way in which they keep their accounts has meant that their operations have been separated in the past. The Minister for Industrial Relations ( Mr Peter Morris) in his second reading speech pointed out that the removal of the distinction between trading and savings banks would enable them to make better use of the allocation of funds, adopt more simple funding and accounting arrangements and provide greater flexibility in serving customers. Of course, that does not overcome the problem that the banks might have suffered if they had fused their accounting arrangements and were liable for stamp duties and the like. I gather that no protection has been given in relation to this. So, in that sense, if there is to be a cost in doing it, not many will move in that direction until they are given some further assurances in that regard. The next matter dealt with in the legislation is the removal of division 3 of the Act concerning statutory reserve deposits (SRD) and the insertion of a new division 3 concerning non-callable deposits and to facilitate the phasing down and replacement of these statutory reserve deposits, as was announced by the Treasurer, again in the 1988-89 Budget. Of course, we are all familiar with the system of statutory reserve deposits. In the past it was one of the principal mechanisms whereby government was able to control monetary supply and it was an important arm in the regulatory system that we operated for government. Of course, it had been the subject of a good deal of comment, particularly by the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System 'and the Martin Review of the Australian Financial System which looked, amongst other things, at our banking and financial system and offered some comments. They were seeking a more market-orientated approach to monetary policy. In its response, the Government looked at the SRD arrangements, which had very largely lapsed as a tool of monetary policy. This new mechanism of non-callable deposit arrangements has been developed as an alternative. The banks might retain a certain deposit relationship with the central bank, the Reserve Bank, as part of their overall relationship while the statutory reserve deposit arrangement is phased down. At the end of the three-year transitional period, the banks will hold noncallable deposits with the Reserve Bank equivalent to one per cent of their liabilities. It is envisaged that the change will involve a cost to revenue, but it is an important part of freeing up our financial system and an important part of the reforms which we on this side of the House have supported. The next matter was to provide specific powers for the establishment of prudential requirements concerning the manner in which banks conduct their business and the administration of such requirements for the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank has a statutory obligation under the Banking Act to protect those who deposit funds with banks. At present neither the Banking Act nor the Reserve Bank Act give the Reserve Bank specific powers to establish or enforce prudential requirements as to the manner in which banks conduct their business. The existing arrangements principally involve consultation and cooperation. It seems to the Governmentin this it is supported by the Oppositionthat prudential arrangements should be related to specific powers in the Banking Act and the role of the Reserve Bank as a prudential supervisor should be recognised formally. Coupled with that is the next major provision, to provide the Reserve Bank with powers of investigation into the books, accounts and transactions of banks, including the ability to obtain information from banks concerning individual customers where required for prudential purposes. As I mentioned the prudential aspects, it is part of the Government's responsibility to ensure those arrangements are properly observed and some power of investigation is needed. These provisions enhance the power which requires the Auditor-General to investigate the affairs of banks periodically and replaces it with a new section 61 to provide power for the Reserve Bank to arrange for an investigation of the prudential powers necessary relating to a bank to be undertaken where it considers it necessary. Our view in relation to that is that on balance it would appear that these provisions serve a useful purpose, especially in the event of an episode such as we saw recently with the stockmarket crash where the exposure of banks to high risk clients needs to be more readily identified. We saw that with the Rothwells matter in Western Australia, in particular, and we have seen situations before in which the Reserve Bank has needed to be able to intercede when banks were overexposed. The problem also came up with a major South Australian bank. More informal arrangements were needed at that time. Obviously it would be useful for the Government, through the Reserve Bank, to be able to look at these matters before problems arise. It is interesting, however, in the context of what is happening in the community at the moment, that clients of the banks are very concerned that the banks act properly in relation to them. I warn the Minister that my experience in my electorate office of late has been that numbers of people are very much concerned about the high levels of interest rates that they are being asked to pay. They are concerned to watch the way in which their accounts are being managed. In some cases, when people have been unable to obtain the sort of review they thought was necessary in relation to some of the charges that have been imposed, they have wanted some external review. Obviously most of these matters are looked at on a contractual basis between the bank and its clients, but if power is given the Reserve Bank-as is proposed in this legislation, albeit in tion to prudential requirements and prudential supervision in particular-to investigate the banks' affairs, it seems to me that there will be some who would seek to examine the legislation to find out the extent of the power and seek that the Government and the Reserve Bank carry out investigations that might enable their particular difficulties to be addressed. I find that somewhat inconsistent with the deregulatory approach that we see as being desirable. Obviously, if the banks have difficulties, some of the more normal consumer affairs protections contained in appropriate State legislation or perhaps even in the trade practices area should be looked at as being the appropriate mechanism for investigation, rather than holding out another avenue of possible inquiry. Next, the legislation provides the Governor General with the power to revoke a bank's authority to conduct a banking business where the bank requests it and he is satisfied that it would be appropriate. It is clear that in the very competitive banking environment that we have now, particularly with the new entrants whose expectations may have been high and perhaps unrealised, there may well be requests of that sort and a capacity to be able to let out those who have entered into banking arrangements might well be needed. We see later the provision to repeal and replace part VI of the Act relating to statistical returns which the banks are required to prepare and deliver and updating of the penalty provisions throughout the Act. There is an amendment to section 66 concerning the use of the word 'bank' to provide further a specific power to control the establishment of representative offices of international banks in Australia. There are also provisions to update the first schedule which lists the banks authorised in accordance with the Banking Act, to make amendments to a number of other Acts on matters of a technical nature and to remove references to savings and trading banks. I canvassed the matter in that way to indicate the breadth of issues in the Bill and to put into perspective matters that were addressed by the honourable member who spoke before me the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), the honourable relamember for Mayo ( Mr Downer), whose contribution was excellent, and honourable members who spoke earlier in this debate today. Regrettably in recent months we have seen a desire on the part of some to make scapegoats of the banks for the high levels of interest rates that are being forced upon the Australian community at this time. Occasionally we get a glimmer of light such as we saw from the honourable member from Perth who accepts that interest rates, as a product of monetary policy, are an instrument used by government when seeking to influence our economy and its direction and the Government, in effect, takes the responsibility for the high level of interest rates. I have found it most unedifying of late to watch some of the television programs or to listen in this House to the Treasurer attacking in a personal way the managing directors of certain banks and suggesting that their comments on economic policy are related to the level of bank performance, the way in which their loan portfolio is held, or the like. I also regret each time public comments suggest that the high level of interest rates being incurred at the moment might be subsidised by the banks, in effect taking reductions in their profits in order to deal with the problem that is really one of the Government's making, one of its own purpose and design. It seems to me that the question of bank profits needs to be looked at in the way that the honourable member for Mayo did. One needs to look at whether or not those bank profits are extraordinary, having regard to the banks' capitalisation, the amount of money put into making loans and taking funds from clients and the margin that banks have for their own profits as a result of that banking activity. One of the unfortunate aspects of life that we have seen in recent times is an inability to explain the fundamental problems we face as a nation and to get across to the community the changes that need to occur. I think we saw, before the last election, a willingness on the part of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) to state in a very practical way that they were dealing with the difficult deCisions that we, as a nation, faced. They wanted to deal with these issues in a responsible way. In that sense, they were very critical of those of us on this side of the House in respect of some of the solutions that we were advancing. I think, since then, the climate has changed significantly. The Government is unable to argue now that the decisions it is taking in this area are responsible. It recognises that there is a good deal of hurt in the community. But rather than try to explain these issues and the changes which need to occur in Australia, we have seen an effort by the Goverriment to scapegoat the banks, and almost anybody else who can be blamed for the problems we face as a nation at this time. The problems we face are quite dramatic. The level of debt is extraordinarily high. I wish to refer to the comments of the honourable member for Perth. He suggested that the debt problem had been a long time coming and that the Labor Government ought not be held particularly accountable for the problems we now face after seven years of Labor government. While I do not have the precise figures before me, I recall that the level of debt, when the previous Government left office, was something of the order $30 billion. I recognise that today the net debt-government debt, State debt, local government debt, private company borrowings abroad, and the like-is something of the order of $100 billion. This is the first time that it has ever reached this level. That is a problem of very significant dimensions. I do not think the Government would seek to deny that we face a significant problem. Nevertheless, it is a matter which needs to be addressed. Indeed, independent economic commentators tell us it needs to be addressed. It is relatively simple to understand why we face the problem we now have. The problem is related to the negative balance of payments that we, as a nation, have faced over recent years. This negative balance of payments problem is of the order of $1,OOOm per month. The amounts are well in excess of that which the Government, in the last Budget, forecast that we were likely to face. Let us make some comparisons between individuals and the nation. If I were an individual looking at my personal affairs, if I were spending each month more than I earned, I would have a problem. That is what the nation is facing at this time. The nation is spending more overseas than it is earning. That situation has to be turned around. But it is not easy to do so. There is only a limited number of solutions. On an individual level, one could reduce one's costs or one's standard of living. On a national level, the nation could reduce its expenditure. An individual could increase his income-in that sense, the nation could increase its income. If one did not do either of those things, one would have to balance one's own books each year in a number of other ways. One could do it by borrowing; an individual borrow and a nation could borrow and that is what we have been doing, as a nation. One could sell off some of the family assets, maybe the antiques. Mr Donald Cameron-Clocks.",97
113,Mr RUDDOCK,BANKING LEGISLATION,"The honourable member notes clocks. In a ,national sense, we could sell off the farm; some of our assets as a nation. These are the problems that we face at this time. They are clearly before us. The Government is unwilling to address the fUJ;ldamental structural changes which need to occur in Australia at the pace necessary to bring about the change in our balance of payments. Most economic commentators have observed how this could be done and they all recognise that the pace of change needs to be quickened.",101
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,BANKING LEGISLATION,Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,101
115,Mr LES SCOTT ,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Oxley) (7.06)-I am very pleasf:d to be able to speak to the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill, because I have had a vested interest in this industry for many years and, as such, I have been following this debate with interest. This legislation has certainly created a new set of rules in the banking industry. The banking industry has seen rapid changes over recent years. The first was the introduction of new technology. Then there was deregulation, which is what this Bill is all about, and the introduction into ,the industry of new foreign and domestic banks. All of these changes have assisted the banks to increase their profits. In, fact, Australia's banks are some of the most profitable in the world. The Australia New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, the National Australia Bank Ltd and Westpac Banking Corp are all in the top 10 most profitable banks. That brings me to the point raised by the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer). When one compares profitability of companies, it is important that one compared them in like industries. The Australian banks have been very profitable over many years. On a world standard, the three banks that I have mentioned are certainly among the top performers. The freeing up, of the banking industry was welcomed by the banks as they saw it as an opportunity to expand their operations, both domestically and internationally, thereby increasing their profits for the shareholders. I suppose that is what they are there for. I am not being too critical of that, but I think we need to make sure that banks are responsible in their attitudes. The freeing up of the banking industry also gave banks the opportunity to move into new, innovative services. To date, we have not seen many innovative services. Perhaps one area which banks may like to look at is the development of housing packages, particularly for new and first home buyers. I am sure that if banks came up with an innovative package which let the free enterprise system flow there would be a tremendous response from the public, particularly young people who are buying their first homes. I think the banks need to address this area because they are continuing to operate as they did before the banking system was freed up. The Bill before us is a further step in the deregulation process. It has three essential objectives. Firstly, it removes the distinction between trading and savings banks. For some time there has been no real physical distinction between the trading and savings operations of our major banks, save that of separate account records under a deregulated environment. It serves no purpose to continue this distinction. Secondly, the Bill will replace the statutory reserve deposit (SRD) requir-ment with a system of non-callable deposits' The SRD requirements apply to i trading banks arid have the effect of increasing the cost of lending by those banks, thereby diverting business to savings banks and other financial institutions and encouraging the use of offshore borrowing and foreign currency deposits to fund trading bank operations. At the end of 'the three year phasing-in period, all banks will be required to hold non-callable deposits. This new arrangement should generally reduce the burden on banks and their customers. The third point of this Bill is to provide for the introduction of a statutory basis for the Reserve Bank's role in supervising, monitoring and investigating certain aspects of banking operations. In my view this is a very important aspect of the Bill. To date the Reserve Bank's supervisory role of the banking industry has relied heavily on the cooperation of the banks. While this system has worked well in the past, it is timely and appropriate that this function be given a firm statutory force. During this debate much has been said about the profits of the banks, and understandably so, for, as I have already said, Australia's largest banks are amongst the most profitable in the world. The record half-yearly profits announced recently, when we saw the combined profits of the ANZ, National Australia and Westpac banks ex-' ceeding $1. 5 billion as at 31 March, do not sit well with the people paying high interest rates, and more and more bank charges. Bank charges seem to be one of the new initiatives taken by banks. I do not oppose the banks making profits for their shareholders, as it is essential for Australia to have an efficient, profitable banking sector to serve not only the needs of the Australian people but also the needs of the industry. It is essential that we see real competition in the banking industry, and that was one of the main purposes of deregulation. We still see banks acting in a tight club situation where, if one bank puts on a new charge or increases interest rates, others soon follow. That does not seem to me to be real competition. They appear to take turns at making the announcement of new charges or increased rates so that the flak from these decisions is shared across the industry. We often see chief executives who are the flavour of the month putting their foot out first, and hence the public, understandably, reacts to them. Banks, as large corporate organisations, have a responsibility to the community to act as responsible corporate citizens and not portray the image of large predatory, profit oriented, non-caring organisations. Deregulation gave the banks the opportunity to provide effective competition by developing new and innovative services to meet the needs of the community at large-not just the large corporate customers, but especially the small individual customers. What have we seen instead? We have seen an extension of bank charges on traditional savings accounts, which have always been exempt from such fees. These charges have been directed at those who can least afford them-the low to middle income earners and social security recipients who cannot afford to hold any deposits in their bank accounts. In many cases these people live from day to day and cannot hold substantial deposits. In most cases where these charges apply an exemption from the charges is given to people who hold deposits of $250 or $500, for instance. In effect, this means that the poor are subsidising the rich. It is like the reverse of Robin Hood, is it not? Not only does the account holder with larger balances get an exemption from the charges, but quite often he also receives a higher interest rate on his savings. It must also be remembered that the banks encouraged and promoted the advent of workers having their wages and salaries paid directly into bank accounts. The second tier wages package of 1987 was an extra bonus to the banks in the pursuit of this objective, as one of the regular tradeoffs during negotiations on this matter was for the payment of workers' wages or salaries directly to their bank accounts. The banks had aggressively marketed these services, often along the line that no fees would apply to these accounts. The widespread introduction of this system involving the direct deposit of salaries and wages must have been an enormous bonus for the banks, with a large increase in low cost deposits on a regular basis. What did we see as soon as the agreements were in place and the funds began to flow into the banks' coffers? On came the charges. The banks could have come up with an acceptable package to reduce costs if they needed to limit the number of transactions. I can understand why they need to limit them as it is a cost to them, but to limit the transactions and have a certain number free would be a better way to go. In fact, in some cases this has been done. I welcome the initiative of the banks which have done that, but they are the exception rather than the rule. Banks would be well advised to accept the profits they make from interest payments and investments instead of applying additional charges to small account holders, as it appears that low income earners and those who can least afford it bear the brunt of those charges. The banks must accept their share of responsibility for the high interest rates. It is well known to members in this place that the necessity for tight monetary policy at present means that interest rates will have to remain high until there is clear evidence that demand is slowing and the current account deficit is trending down. However, as responsible corporate citizens, the banks should be responsible when considering increasing interest rates and exercise restraint, as the broader community has done in these difficult times. The banks certainly appear heavyhanded with the latest housing loan interest rate increase of one per cent when the bond rate increased by only 0.3 per cent. The average Australian's major involvement with the banking industry is through housing loans. It is important to note what the freeing up of the banking system has meant to housing. There is little doubt that the freeing up of the industry has meant an increase in the availability of funds for ing. I can recall very well from my own experience when working in the banking industry the limitations placed on banks for lending for housing. This was in the time when the now Opposition was in government and was not prepared to face up to the tough decisions and look at alternative measures to ensure that funds were available for housing to the average Australian. These limitations led to what became known as the cocktail loan. Home buyers would take from the savings banks the limited funds available on a first mortgage and then take a second mortgage in the form of a personal loan from a bank or a finance company loan, at considerably higher in-erest rates. The cost of the total loans for the house was then well above the bank housing loan interest rate. Whilst interest rates are high at present, with the economic measures the Government has in place they will decrease in time. In the cocktail loan situation, the second mortgage loans were generally at fixed interest rates which meant that borrowers did not receive any benefits from downward movements in interest rates. The second mortgage loans were generally from finarice companies which charged much higher interest rates than normal, so the borrower did not get any benefit at all from those downward movements. The freeing up of the banking industry now means that the cocktail loan is no longer a necessity. Home buyers can now obtain on a first mortgage one loan to cover their lending requirements to purchase their home, and on a collective basis at a lower interest than the average charged on a cocktail loan basis. In effect, there is no longer a necessity to have separate savings banks, hence this aspect of the Bill. The report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System indicated that the distinction between trading and savings banks would not be necessary because of the limitations being lifted. This should be a cost saving to banks and this Bill will remove the distinction between the trading and savings banks. In addition, this Bill replaces the statutory reserve deposit and puts in place a new system of noncallable deposits which apply to all banks. With the elimination of the SRD more funds housare available now and banks are much freer to operate in the open market and lend more heavily for housing than they have done for many years. The third part of this Bill, as I have mentioned-it is a very important aspect-introduces a statutory basis for the Reserve Bank to supervise and monitor the operations of the banking industry. Having had many years of experience in the banking industry and as an active unionist in that industry, I am well aware of the necessity for the Reserve Bank to have this important role. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Maranoa ( Mrlan Cameron) oppose the role of the Reserve Bank. Clearly, the community would see this role as essential to maintain accountability by the banks. There has been a lot of discussion recently about an ombudsman. I welcome the suggestion by the Australian Bankers Association that it will be placing an ombudsman in train very shortly. It is essential that the ombudsman be completely independent and not be seen as an arm of the banking industry. I think that that matter will need to be addressed very clearly. Let us look at the image of the banks. There is not much doubt that they have a poor image at present. We need to look at that question and highlight a few reasons for this. Having had experience in the banking industry and having many friends who still work in it, I feel rather sorry for those at the coalface, so to speak, or at the counter. The managers and staff in the bank branches often get a lot of criticism for the decisions that are made by senior administration. This is an opportune time to dwell on this point for a moment. My good friend Len Hingley, the Federal Secretary of the Australian Bank Employees Union, and Dawson Petie, the Queensland State Secretary also of the Australian Bank Employees Union (ABEU), recently put out a couple of press releases. They highlight the concerns the staff have. I think that generally the public could show a little more concern for the people who work in banks. I suppose that members of the public like to express their concern to someone, but it is usually the poor teller behind the counter. In relation to this matter, the Federal Secretary of the Australian Bank Employees' Union, Len Hingley, issued a press release recently, headed 'Use profits to improve customer service'. These comments highlight the difficulties in relation to customer service at the moment. The press release stated: The general level of counter services provided by major Australian banks was in decline, despite the consistently strong profit performances recorded this year. According to Len Hingley, Federal Secretary of the Australian Bank Employees' Union, ""Public frustration with interest rates, service charges, high profits and poorer service, was being vented on counter staff, who themselves are also not benefiting from increased profits"". ""The morale amongst many of our members is as low as their salaries"" he said. Mr Hingley blamed the banks for cuts in branch staffing, and their failure to adequately train their employees at the customer interface. ""This was all part of an ongoing productivity drive, to lift short term profits even further"". Long term profits will only be generated by improved training at all levels accompanied by more appropriate and motivating pay levels. Certainly, the banking industry particularly needs to lift its game in relation to industry training. This relates to another area, but I am hoping that the banks will pick up this matter. I know that the ABEU is certainly maintaining a lot of pressure on the banking industry to do just that. A cartoon in the Courier-Mail of 19 May depicting a bank teller actually holding up two customers led Mr Dawson Petie, the Queensland Branch Secretary of the Australian Bank Employees' Union, to write a letter to the editor. This cartoon was offensive to bank tellers, and EmptyHere as follows: My members-who include the tellers depicted in Leahy's cartoon-have asked me to paint the real picture regarding bank interest rates and profits. Ordinary bank employees have become the cannon fodder in the battle being fought by the banks for international prestige and market share. The battle plans mapped out in the banks' boardrooms require high profits to fund the acquisition programs necessary to make big Australian banks into big international banks. Far from sharing in the high profitability of their bosses, bank employees have been squeezed by demands for higher productivity and lower staffing levels. Lower staffing levels mean poorer quality service to customers. My members share the concerns, anger and frustration of bank customers about high mortgage interest rates, inequitable bank cheques, unreasonably high profits and poor quality service. The union is handling a record number of stressrelated workers' compensation claims as a re-ult. To paint the real cause of customer resentment, Leahy's cartoon should have drawn the global ambitions in the heads of those occupying the boardrooms of Australian banks. Reference was made yesterday in the Courier-Mail to a media release put out by EmptyHere press release stated: Bank customers are not alone in voicing their concern about the banks' current policies and practices. Bank workers are also bearing the brunt of the banks' insatiable thirst for higher and higher profits according to the Australian Bank Employees Union. ""Record bank profits have been helped by worsening conditions for bank staff"", Dawson Petie Acting Secretary of the ABEU said today. The Union has handled a record number of disputes resulting from the bank's ruthless drive for higher profits"". So far this financial year, the Union has been involved in 200 disputes with bank management in Queensland. Over $200,000 has been recovered on behalf of Union members in unpaid overtime, wages, meal allowances etc. The Union is also handling a record number of stress related workers' compensation cases. Profits for the major private banks (ANZ, NAB & Westpac) exceeded $1.5 billion for the six months to March 31 st. ""Bank employees are being faced with unreasonable demands to continually increase their workload by reduced staffing levels and other cost cutting EmptyHere Australia's wealthiest employers can afford to treat their staff better than the ""Scrooge""Â· approach that they are taking now"". The Union will be campaigning to improve bank working conditions at a local level and also to ensure that bank unionists get a fair deal from the new wages system. They are the concerns that are being expressed by people who are very closely associated with the industry in relation to their own union members. It is the staff who are at the coalface, and obviously the public's reaction to them is of great concern to the senior officials of the Australian Bank Employees Union. I welcome the opportunity to refer to this matter here tonight. The concerns expressed by the ABEU certainly support what I am saying. I am particularly pleased to be able to indicate my support for the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill. I have raised these matters because of the concern of the public that it is not getting a fair deal from the banks these days. More and more services are being forced on the banks but the staff are not being properly trained to enable them to sell or explain those services to the public. I think it is high time that the Australian banks lifted their game and tried to improve their public image. I am pleased to be able to offer my support for the Bill.",101
116,Dr HARRY EDWARDS ,BANKING LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (7.24 ) - The Banking Legislation Amendment Bill is an important measure. As has been made clear in the debate, it has three main purposes. The first is to remove all reference in the Banking Act to trading banks and savings banks and to replace them with general references to banks; in other words, to remove the distinction between trading and savings banks-as announced by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) in the 1989-90 Budget. Secondly, the Bill provides for phasing out statutory reserve deposits and replacing them with non-callable deposits. Thirdly, the Bill provides specific powers for the establishment of prudential requirements in respect of the banks and their administration by the Reserve Bank. That is the most important part of the Bill. The Opposition has in fact proposed an amendment which addresses a particular aspect of this matter, namely, the provision in clause 17 of the Bill enabling the Reserve Bank to seek information about an individual customer of a bank, if required, for prudential purposes. The Opposition sees the need for extra precautions, going beyond what is prointends vided in the Bill at the moment, to ensure adequate privacy protection in that context. Rather than going on to enlarge on those points at this stage, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Italian Invalid Pension-Banking Industry-Report of Australian Delegation to Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe- Mr John Day--Surf Life Saving Association of Australia-Tax File Number System-Fiji-Environment Motion (by Mrs Kelly) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",105
117,Dr WOODS ,ADJOURNMENT,"Lowe) (7.29)-This evening I wish to address the House on what is a series of long-running injustices towards Italian pensioners and taxpayers which I believe the Government deliberately chooses not to remedy. It is with great concern that I have learnt that dozens of my Italian constituents, in particular, are being treated heartlessly by this Government. Despite a long-running campaign waged by the Italian patronati and other Italian welfare groups, the Hawke Labor Government taxes the Italian invalid pension received by former residents of Italy. Whereas invalid pensions received by Australian citizens are exempt from income tax under section 23AD of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Italian invalid pension, however, is not extended the same exemption. It is particularly unfair because, unlike the Australian system, Italian residents receive the invalid or age pension only after they have contributed to a special fund for 5 or 15 years, respectively. A significant proportion of their pension is, in fact, their own money being returned to them. There is no other significant difference between the Australian who receives an invalid pension and the former Italian resident who receives an invalid pension, other than their country of origin. I ask the Government: why are Italian invalid pensions taxed and Australian invalid pensions not? This applies to several other countries also. Another example of problems confronting members of my Italian community is in the Australian Government's calculation of what level of Australian age pension former Italian residents are entitled to in Australia. The Government, in calculating the level of entitlement, takes into account the whole amount of any age or invalid pension received from Italy. This is contrary to the recent agreement between Australia and Italy which stipulated that the Australian Government would reduce the Australian age or invalid pension by only the amount of the former resident's own contributory part of the pension, not the amount of the Italian Government's supplement as well. The Australian Government justifies its actions by saying it is awaiting notification from the Italian Government of a letter to advise of the amount of the pensioner's contribution. This, however, is quite clearly nothing more than a smokescreen to disguise the Treasurer's glee at reaping such a nice, profitable windfall. It is obvious that no thought has been given to the grim reality that it is at the expense of pensioners-those who can least afford it. It is blatant greed and opportunism by the Hawke Government which has to be stopped. Another problem for members of the Italian community which the Hawke Government has failed to address adequately is that of double taxation on Italian pensions by both the Australian and the Italian governments. Under the bilateral agreement between Italy and Australia, as from 1 July 1987 tax should have been paid only to the Australian Government. Because the Italian tax year follows the calendar year from January to December, rather than the Austra lian fiscal year from July to June, for the six months from July to December 1987 pensions from Italy were taxed by both the Australian and the Italian governments. Pensioners were thus subject to double taxation. Unfortunately, hundreds of Italians are still waiting for reimbursement by the Italian Government of tax paid during that sixmonth period. This is beyond our control. The most serious result of this, however, is that there are a number of Italians who did not, and still do not, realise that they are required to fill out a special exemption form and have it forwarded to the Italian Government in order to obtain their reimbursement. These people are not only still awaiting reimbursement of tax taken during that six-month overlap period, but also in fact still paying double tax on the pensions they receive. I believe that reflects the failure of the Government's efforts, which are very puny, to reach all members of the Italian community and advise them of these problems which were the making of the respective governments. I am sure that if the boot were on the other foot and the Governme.nt was making double payments when it did not have to, it would act differently and more quickly. The last issue that I wish to raise with this House tonight is the activities of the Tax Office, which imposes a 20 per cent late payment penalty on all 1987-88 tax assessment returns not paid by the due date. Mr Donald Cameron-You can't make a mistake or they have got you.",105
118,Dr WOODS,ADJOURNMENT,"If you make a mistake they have got you, as the honourable member for Moreton says. Whatever anyone might think about this-I know what the honourable member for Moreton thinks-for some members of the Italian community this is particularly unfair. Because Italian pensions did not become subject to Australian income tax until the first of July 1987-that is, this is a new tax-many Italian pensioners had not been able to set aside sufficient money throughout the year, bearing in mind that these are pensioners who have very restricted income. This, coupled with the double taxation they were incurring, meant that many were unable to meet their tax assessment bills within the given time. They have now been issued with a 20 per cent late payment penalty. I believe that the Hawke Government should exercise some understanding, constraint and compassion and lift the 20 per cent late payment penalty and extend the time for payment for these people who, it should be remembered, are all pensioners facing enormous problems. The Government should move quickly to resolve these problems that are causing inconvenience and great distress to thousands ofÂ· Italian Australian pensioners across the nation.",106
119,Mr LANGMORE ,ADJOURNMENT,"Fraser) (7.34)-The major banks have promoted a furious campaign to obscure the link between their enormous profits and their relentless increases in interest rates. In seeking to avoid any responsibility for the suffering they are causing to much of working and middle class Australia, the banks have pointed the finger at governments and have rattled their voodoo charms of rediscount rates and professional market rates. While most Australians are confused by all this they still can see the link between high interest rates and the banks' enormous profits. The banks have left themselves wide open to criticism by the misinformation they have used in an attempt to blame others for their actions. A glaring example is their claim that they must raise home loan interest rates because the professional rates at which they borrow have risen far above home loan rates. Some spokesmen have even gone so far as to claim their banks are making losses on new loans. This is nonsense. The banks have huge funds in low interest savings deposits from the pUblic. In 1987-88 these deposits were about $60 billion and paid an average interest rate of around 10 per cent. In contrast the banks lent only $40 million for owneroccupied housing and charged an average of 14.5 per cent. This gave the banks a margin of 4.5 per cent on those housing loans. The recent increases have made this worse by raising home loan interest rates by much more than interest rates of savings deposits. In the last few years the margins of interest rates paid to interest received have varied around 25 per cent to 35 per cent for the major banks. Deregulation of the financial markets does not appear to have dented their profits; quite the contrary. The banks have benefited from deregulation and will benefit further from the recently announced changes to their reserve requirements. This deregulation puts the onus on the banks to behave responsibly. If the banks take every opportunity to extract maximum profits from their dominant market power the Australian people will repudiate deregulation. They will look to government to introduceÂ· new regulations to limit the banks' predation on their small depositors and borrowers. The banks' lack of responsibility is clear in their proliferation of new fees. on a wide array of services they offer to their small depositors. The banks have a special ability to set the price they receive for their products-the interest rate they receive, as well as the cost of the major input they use-the interest they pay depositors. Because most depositors and borrowers are individuals with small deposits and loans they have no control over bank interest rates. This gives the banks enormous market power to raise their profits by depressing the interest paid to their depositors and raising the interest chargedÂ· to small borrowers. The irrelevant excuses the banks have used for raising their interest rates on home loans clearly show how they have attempted to mislead the public and sought to blame others for their actions. Every disappointing economic statistic is publicised by the banks as a cause of rising interest rates. This is ridiculous and, at worse, involves the banks in attempting to introduce their own economic policies on the Australian economy. The recent small rise in the Reserve Batik determined rediscount rate was part of the Government's responsible policy of firm monetary control. However, the banks' very much larger rise in home loan interest rates was a gross and greedy over-reaction. Similarly, an adverse balance of payments figure does not directly affect the banks' balance sheets. It does not require any direct response from the banks. It is the Government's responsibility to determine Australia's response to economic problems. By misusing public information like this the banks open themselves to questions about how they really set interest rates. There have been calls for a public investigation of the banks' financial policies. The Prices Surveillance Authority, or a specially appointed inquiry, could undertake this task. It is perhaps also time for a public reassessment of the balance of the benefits of financial deregulation and of the costs so that remedial measures can be considered. Public concern requires more public information if the current furore is to be calmed.",106
120,Mr GOODLUCK ,ADJOURNMENT,"Franklin) (7.38)Madam Speaker, I am pleased that you are in the chair, of course. Mr Donald Cameron-Oh, come on!",107
121,Mr GOODLUCK,ADJOURNMENT,"No, Madam Speaker, you are one lady who has always wanted this Parliament to be a fair and decent place where members can carryon their business in an honourable way. I am afraid I have to say to you that there has been a bit of a smell about the place of late that I do not like-I am sorry to have to use those termsand that many other members do not like either. I believe that if a member wants to attend a private meeting-I do not care what it is about; communism or anything he li.kes-he does so in privacy. Today I read a copy of Hansard from the Senate in which Senator Schacht repeated word for word what had been said at a private meeting of the Right to Life organisation. I was appalled. I know the matter is to be referred to the Privileges Committee or wherever is the appropriate body. Tonight, I am wild again, and I am told I am not allowed to get wild. I have here the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. It is to be tabled tomorrow. I was the deputy chairman of that delegation. I also received a document entitled, 'Opposition Policy on Africa to be Tested'. It states: The Federal Opposition, and especially the shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ian MACPhee, could be embarrassed again in the Parliament on Thursday when the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe is tabled. The Opposition members of the delegation, Michael Baume, Michael Cobb and Bruce Good luck, have submitted a dissenting report. What is the place coming to? I do not care a boot whether the honourable member for Goldstein is embarrassed or not. That does not worry me. The point is that, before the report has been tabled, a press release has been issued, without having been signed, to Fairfax editorial, Sydney. I ask you, Madam Speaker, where are we going? I am afraid to walk from my room because somebody might be trying to find out where I am going. Mr MCGauran-It is a matter of privilege; refer it to the Committee.",107
122,Mr GOODLUCK,ADJOURNMENT,"It will be referred. When the report is tabled tomorrow-I will have about 2t minutes-I am going to ask the person or persons involved who issued that press release. They will have to tell the Parliament-not me. We are all under suspicion as to how a report, before being tabled, can be issued to the press. Mr MCGauran-It was issued yesterday.",108
123,Mr GOODLUCK,ADJOURNMENT,"Issued yesterday, was it? I ask all honourable members, Labor and Liberal: what is this place about? We are afraid even to go to our rooms. I turn to another matter. I have made friends with many of the attendants and people in the cafeteria in the past 14 years. They have always treated me with the greatest of respect and I treat them with the greatest of respect. I watched one poor fellow, Selwyn John Day, deteriorate. When one sees somebody who looks a bit sick one asks, 'What's the matter, mate?'. He kept saying to me, 'I've got a bit of a worry, Bruce'. After a long time. I prompted him and said, 'What is the matter with you?' He told me. He said, I will give you some documents, Bruce. You might be able to enlighten me on what to do about them because you may have friends in the legal fraternity'. Well, I have a lot of friends in the legal fraternity. I cite the ex-member for Denison, who will be back again, Michael Hodgman. I said I would refer it to him. I was astounded! John Day-a decent bloke, and always nice to everybody around here-told me an incredible story. He bought a unit and left $500 in security because the pergola on the back of the unit was not passed by one of the authorities. After a long time his health and his wife's health deteriorated because of the actions of a firm of solicitors. I do not know much about these solicitors so, even though I am under parliamentary privilege, I do not want to defame them. I have referred to a few solicitors the details of this case. Because of a stinking rotten $500, the health of a man and his wife deteriorated bringing them down to the lowest common denominator. In a letter Mr Day found it necessary to make statements like 'Your browbeating phone calls to', 'ugly letters to us' and 'a complete bungling effort on you part'. This legal firm's actions have reduced this man, who treated me nicely, who is a nice and respectable fellow, to a mental wreck because of a stinking $500. I ask the firm of solicitors, which I will name on the next occasion when I get an expert opinion-MONICA",108
124,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,108
125,Mr LEE ,ADJOURNMENT,"Dobell) (7.43)-Tonight I wish to make some comments about the Surf Life Saving Association of Australia. Firstly, I want to place on record the great esteem in which I and I am sure most members of this House would hold the Surf Life Saving Association. I have its most recent report, the 1987-88 report, in which the Association points out that in that year it performed 10,557 rescues. While not all those 10,557 people may have drowned had people from the Australian Surf Life Saving Association not been 'present, a significant number would have had their lives places at risk. That is why I am proud that the Federal Government in 1987-88 provided a grant of $875,000 to the Surf Life Saving Association. I know that the former Minister for Sport, the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown), argued very successfully and heatedly in the Cabinet for the Surf Life Saving Association of Australia to receive significant funding from the Federal Government. During his term as Minister for Sport the extent of that grant increased. I pay tribute to him for his success in that area. What is of concern to me is that of the $875,000 provided to the Surf Life Saving Association, $180,000 gets back to the local surf clubs in the form of dollar for dollar life saving subsidies for equipment and other matters. An amount of $255,000 is spent on national field officers and the life saving rector program, and another $350,000 is spent on administration. I wish to explain how little of that $875,000 provided by the Federal Government is getting back to these clubs in my electorate. The Soldiers Beach Surf Life Saving Club and the Toowoon Bay Surf Life Saving Club in my electorate received no assistance this financial year. The other five surf life saving clubs in my electorate-those at North Entrance, Shelly Beach, The Entrance, the Lakes and Wamberal-received a total of only $6,095 out of a total of $875,000. I am not saying that the Surf Life Saving Association does not need money for administration and for national field officers, believe that more of that $875,000 should go to the local surf clubs. Many of the surf clubs need to update their equipment so that it is modern and up-to-date and is able to be used immediately if someone's life is threatened. Like many other volunteer organisations, surf clubs are finding it increasingly hard to raise funds from the public. I believe that the Federal Government's grants should be directed chiefly to those local surf clubs. If the national office of the Surf Life Saving Association says that it needs the money from the local surf clubs, it should place some form of contributory levy on its member surf clubs so that it has to stand up and justify to the member associations why it has seen fit to use over half a million dollars on administration and national field officers. It should have to make it clear how much it is taking back to the surf clubs and where that money is being spent. The Federal Government does not want to have to be the body which decides how much the surf clubs in my electorate and those in Brisbane and other parts of Australia receive. But we have to make sure that more of the funds go to the local surf clubs and the people who, as you would know, Madam Speaker, seem to spend so many hours on street corners, at traffic lights and on the beaches seeking to raise funds. I pay tribute to them. I seek to encourage the Federal Government to try to ensure that more of these funds get to the local surf clubs. They are the ones who need the money; they are the ones who are saving di- lives. In my electorate they are the ones who are making a great contribution to Australia.",108
126,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,109
127,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,ADJOURNMENT,"Moreton) (7.48)-1 would like to associate myself with the comments made by the honourable member for Dobell ( Mr Lee). During Question Time today I had cause to ask a question of the Acting Treasurer, the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Dawkins), in relation to the inconsistencies of evidence offered before a Senate committee of investigation into the maladministration of the tax file number system and the submissions of the Commissioner of Taxabut 1 tion, Mr Boucher, and the Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor. That was only the beginning. I regret that this session is coming to an end because of my interest in this particular subject, which commenced by my moving a motion in this House in early April in a bid to set up a committee of this chamber to investigate the maladministration of the tax file number system. Unfortunately, the Government used its numbers to stop that happening. I do not think you were here on that day, Madam Speaker. It was only after the matter got to the Senate that the Senate decided to have this investigation. In Australia we have been advised in recent weeks, since the posting out of tax file numbers, that the error rate at worse was 5 to 7 per cent in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory and one to 2 per cent in the southern States. It was interesting the other night to sit in on the Senate investigation; for three hours I heard evidence being presented by the Australian Taxation Office and the Privacy Commissioner. I have the transcript of that night's proceedings which covers some 132 pages. An examination of that transcript indicates how the Taxation Office happily clung to the error rate figure of 5 to 7 per cent. Despite a lot of questions, it was happy to allow senators to continue to believe that that was the rate. At one point Senator John Coates from Tasmania said: I must say that I would have thought that, given the computer error on the first mail-out, I am surprised that it was only 5 to 7 per cent. The Privacy Commissioner went on to explain that perhaps that was because community understandings of the rate of movement of people is not as it really is. Within about half a minute, at the end of the evidence by Mr O'Connor, the Taxation Commissioner was brought back. Chairman Coates asked: Was there anything that you felt the need to comment on arising from the Privacy Commissioner's comments? Mr Boucher said: No, I do not think there is anything significant enough for me to seek to draw out. I wish I had more time to deal with this matter. It transpires now that the Senate Committee was lulled and mislead into believing that the error rate is nowhere as great as it really is. Yesterday in this chamber, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr MACKellar) asked the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) a question and the Prime Minister's response revealed some very interesting information. To give honourable members an idea of the error rate, the Taxation Office is admitting-and I put a question mark over its admission-40,000 mistakes in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. But it has come out today admitting that the error rating in Queensland and Western Australia is 12.65 per cent-thus about 140,000 letters were returned unclaimed. If we add those figures, we see that a total of 174,000 letters were returned unclaimed. I have checked it out. We have not been told that the error rate is based on the number of letters sent back to the Tax Office. My information is that, if the Taxation Office is lucky, it will have received back only half the number of letters that were sent out to dead people or to those people who had changed their address. Right now there are probably 150,000 to 200,000 tax file numbers still floating around out there as well as the 174,000 included in the error rate.",109

129,Mr JENKINS ,ADJOURNMENT,"Scullin) (7.53)-The fourteenth of this month marked the second anniversary of the initial military coup in Fiji, an event which demonstrated to all in our region the fragility of the democratic system of government, especially in the postcolonial world. The democratic tradition in Fiji was in its infancy when it. was snuffed out by a military adventurer. The governmenf of Dr Timoci Bavadra was removed from office at gun point a mere 17 years after Fiji's declaration of independence in 1970. To appreciate the crisis in Fiji, we need look no further than the draft constitution which has been released by the so-called interim government. A constitution inquiry and advisory committee has been established to examine the appropriateness of this draft and to canvass public opinion, but it is hard to see that this is anything more than an attempt by the interim government to muster a degree of spurious legitimacy to obscure the fact that it derives its mandate from the barrel of a gun. The draft constitution is a codification of authoritarianism and racism. This sham document has been quite rightly rejected by the Fiji Labour Party coalition, the Fiji trade union movement, various religious bodies and other community organisations in Fiji on the grounds that it runs contrary to the principIes of. democracy, social justice, multi-racialism and religious tolerance. The deposed Prime Minister, Dr Bavadra, has said on behalf of the National Federation PartyLabour Party coalition: The draft Constitution. . . is profoundly authoritarian, undemocratic, militaristic, racist and istic. It would be divisive and sow the seeds of terrible violence. It would retard our social and economic development. It would isolate us from many of our valued neighbours, the Commonwealth and the international community. It should be remembered that the two coups were perpetrated in the name of the rights of indigenous Fijians and the traditional system of tribal authority-rights supposedly under threat from the Bavadra Government dominated by Indian Fijians. According to the President of the Interim Government, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau: The draft constitution is the best safeguard for the Fijians. The fact is that the interests of native Fijians were guaranteed under the 1970 constitution. This guarantee was reflected in the composition of both Houses of the Parliament. The 52 seats in the House of Representatives were reserved for racial groups-22 native Fijian, 22 Indian Fijian and eight general seats reserved for Europeans, Chinese or people of mixed race. No matter what the composition of the government and opposition in the House, the racial balance was guaranteed. So, too, with the composition of the Senate. The Senate consisted of 22 members, all appointed by the Governor General, including eight appointed in accordance with the advice of the Great Council of Chiefs. Fijian interests were further guaranteed under section 68 of the Constitution which states: Any provision that affects Fijian land, customs or customary rights shall not be. passed by the Senate unless it is supported at the final voting thereon in the House by the votes of not less than six of the members of the Senate . . . appointed on the advice of the Great Council of Chiefs. Fijian interests were not in danger from the Bavadra Government. The Constitution did not require alteration to protect Fijian interests. The draft Constitution, in contrast, protects the rights of native Fijians selectively, as the electoral rights of urban Fijians are severely prejudiced by not only the boundaries but also the method of franchise. Unfortunately, stories about Fiji no longer capture the imagination of the Australian media except for the stories surrounding alleged gun runners. Australians should be aware that the lives of ordinary Fijians, Indian and native, have worsened drastically feudalsince the coup. It is estimated that since the coups the cost of living has increased by 13 per cent. Mahenra Chaudrey, Secretary of the Fiji Council of Trade Unions, has estimated that more than a third of the country's 700,000 people are now living in poverty. As in the republic of South Africa, under a facade. of order and discipline, lawlessness and violence are increasing. Fiji will continue to sink into crisis as long as the illegal regime remains in power. To quote the Indian High Commissioner's criticism of late March: Anything which gives sustenance to the illegal regime in Fiji doesn't help the cause of restoration of democracy. The Australian Government must closely monitor its aid program to Fiji. We must ensure that Australian dollars are not used to entrench dictatorship and racism. We have a duty to support and sponsor the principles of democracy, social justice and tolerance as basic human rights not only in Australia but also in our region and in the international community. The violence done to democracy in Fiji is surely not irreparable, but the restoration of national unity and racial harmony in Fiji is incompatible with continuation of the current regime no matter how much false legitimacy it manufactures. In 1787 Thomas Jefferson, the architect of American democracy, contended that ""men may be trusted to govern themselves without a master."" In Fiji, the people have a master who wields a machine gun and there can be no future while he continues to brandish it in the face of legitimate aspirations of all Fijian people. EmptyHere short time available to me tonight I wish to say something gracious and I am sincere in saying it. I do welcome you back, Madam Speaker, and I hope that I will have a chance to continue with those remarks at a later time. Probably nothing will have more impact on Australia and the world than the environment. It is more important than all the other issues we touch upon, ranging through all of the community services, health, veterans' affairs and education. I think we will have a general bipartisan attitude to the environment. It.is something with which I am pleased to be associated. With a little light-hearted banter, the honourable member for La Trobe ( Mr Milton), thought it was quite strange when I spoke on this matter for the first time. I draw to his attention my reference in my maiden speech to my belief that the rural people of Australia are among the great conservationists of the world. I say this as a former farmer. I am most impressed with the work done by Jon Womesley of the Worrawong National Park, which is in the Adelaide Hills. It is not in my electorate. That great gallery purveyor, Ian Warden, has talked about the long-footed potoroo. Well, Jon Womesley is responsible for having the only captive bnishtailed bedong, a nocturnal animal which can be viewed by walking through his national park. It is an endangered species. There are great organisations to join such as the Men of the Trees-MONICA",110

The following answers to questions were circulated: East-West Airlines (Question No. 883) Mr Macphee asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 14 April 1988: (I) Did the Trade Practices Commission (TPC) in 1987, following the takeover of East-West Airlines by TNT-News Corporation, rule that Ansett Airlines had to divest itself of a number of East-West routes. (2) Did the TPC expect the process of divestment to take one month. (3) Does TNT News Corporation through Ansett Airlines still retain some East-West routes which the TPC hoped Australian Airlines would take up. (4) Is he able to say for what reasons Australian Airlines decided not to buy the divested East-West routes. (5) Is he able to say why the divestments ordered by the TPC have not taken place. (6) What are the TPC's reasons and explanations for the delay. (7) Will he or the TPC take any action against TNT-News Corporation to ensure that it complies with the TPC's 1987 ruling so that Australia's aviation industry is competitive; if not, why not. (8) If buyers are not forthcoming for the divested routes of East-West Airlines, what action will the Government take to ensure commuters are not disadvantaged because of the East-WestjTNT-News Corporation takeover.",112
131,Mr WILLIS ,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The answer to Question No. 882, which asked the same question as No. 883, was given by the Attorney-General on 22 August 1988. The prepared answer, to be identical for both Portfolios, was agreed to in mid-May 1988. Due to a misunderstanding bet ween liaison officers of the two Departments, the answer to Question No. 883 was not lodged at the same time as that of No. 882. Since that time the situation has changed in relation to the takeover of East-West. These changes are reflected in the answers to No. 883 following. (I) Arising out of discussions between the TPC and TNT jNews interests, agreement was reached regarding basic principles for the divestiture of certain parts of the operations and assets of East-West Airlines. Details of these principles were published by the TPC in a media release dated 10 November 1987. NA (2) In its media release of 10 November 1987, the TPC expressed the hope that Australian Airlines would be the purchaser of the Western Australian and New South Wales operations and assets to which the divestiture agreement related and indicated that if Australian Airlines did not agree to acquire these assets and to assume relevant routes within an agreed period, the TPC and the interested parties would discuss the question of an alternative purchaser. It was agreed that Australian Airlines would have one month in which to decide whether or not to acquire the relevant operations and assets. (3), (5) and (6) The TPC, in a media release dated 28 September 1988, announced that its involvement in the investigation of the TNT jNews acquisition of East-West Airlines had concluded. The situation in relation to the divestiture of relevant operations and assets is as follows: Routes previously operated by East-West Airlines in New South Wales and agreed to be divested have been divested. The New South Wales Government has licensed Eastern Airlines to operate services to Grafton, Taree, Kempsey, Inverell and Glen Innes, Armidale and Port Macquarie. East-West Airlines shareholding and associated interests in Eastern Airlines have been sold, the buyer being Australian Airlines. Hazelton Airlines has negotiated with Australian Airlines to move from Ansett hosting to Australian Airlines hosting (which involves on-carriage and associated arrangements such as reservations and ground handling). East-West Airlines' regular public jet services in Western Australia were discontinued in April 1988. As no buyer had been found, in accordance with the TPC's determination, the service was closed down. The TPC has decided not to insist that TNT j News sell the Western Australia regular public transport operations of the Sky west Aviation company. The TPC announced that after more that 12 months of intensive negotiation and discussions the possibility of a viable buyer emerging still seemed remote and a likely end result of insisting on the sale would be the shutdown of Skywest. This would obviously not be in the public interest. (4) The decision by Australian Airlines not to purchase East-West Airlines routes identified for divestiture was made on commercial grounds by the airline. (7) and (8) The TPC has concluded its involvement in this matter and regards the divestitures achieved in New South Wales and Queensland as satisfactory. In regard to Western Australia operations, the TPC hopes that in the longer term the Western Australian Government will grant additiona I licenses to suitable new operators who will at least partially restore competition in this market. The Western Australia State Government holds wide powers over intrastate air services while the Commonwealth's powers are limited to matters of safety.

Sydney Airport (Question No. 1486) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Have feasibility studies been undertaken on the possibility of constructing a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport parallel to the existing north-south runway; if so, (a) when were those studies undertaken and (b) what were their conclusions. (2) What runway development options are open for the expansion of the airport. (3) What is the Government's intentions for the development of the airport. (4) Does the Government accept claims made by air traffic controllers that delays at the airport are threatening safety standards; if so, what action does the Government propose to take. (5) If the Government does not accept this proposition, why not. (6) When was the approach radar at the airport installed. (7) Is it a fact that this radar is now obsolete and unreliable. (8) What service difficulties have been encountered. (9) When this radar is unserviceable what proceduresare adopted. . (10) Why has the Government not installed a new radar. (II) When will a new radar be installed. (12) What is the reason for this delay. (13) What is the cost of installing a new radar.",114
134,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,":-The answer to the horiourable member's question is as follows: (I) In 1989, Bechtel Civil Inc Aviation Services prepared a conceptual estimate of the cost of constructing a medium spaced parallel runway (ie a runway 1050 metres to the east of, and parallel to, the existing north-south runway) at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Such a runway was estimate to cost in the order of $185 million. (2) A medium spaced parallel north-south runway was considered by the Government to be the only runway option which provided a significant increase in capacity at reasonable cost and without the need for resumption of private properties and community facilities. (3) The Government has decided to develop a medium spaced parallel runway subject to the satisfactory completion of normal Environmental Impact Statement processes. (4) No. (5) Necessary safety standards are being maintained by the air traffic control system. This results in delays to some flights, when demand exceeds the rate at which traffic flow can be safety handled, and must be regulated to meet stringent safety standards. (6) 1971. (7) No. The radar equipment has been progressively upgraded to meet traffic demands. (8) The approach radar system performance has met CAA design criteria and system performance requirements for a radar service. System faults encountered have been varied in nature and are typical of electronic equipment of this complexity. The most recent fault of significance was the failure of the aerial drive mechanism after 16 years continuous service. (9) When the approach radar is itot serviceable the long range route surveillance radar is used for approach and the separation standard of three miles is extended to five miles. (10) The approach radar has given good service and been upgraded to meet changing demands over its life. A 15 to 20 year life is normal for equipment of this type. (II) Replacement of radar sensors is planned for 1990-91. Concurrent action is being taken to replace the processing and display system to the same timing. (12) The schedule for replacement meets all identified requirements. (13) The cost of a replacement approach radar sensor is approximately $6 million. Replacement display and processing equipment is expected to cost in the order of $ t 5-20 million. Sydney Airport: Safety Standards (Question No. 1489) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Has her attention been drawn to statements EmptyHere are placing safety standards under stress.

(3) If the statement is correct, will she apologise to the NSW Premier for the attack on the Premier's statements that safety standards at the airport were on the edge of acceptability. (4) Are the NSW Premier's statements on safety standards at the airport not without foundation.",115
135,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) These statements were draw to the attention EmptyHere (2) The CAA will not compromise safety standards even where this may lead to possible delays to aircraft movements during peak periods. (3) See Answer (2). (4) See Answer (2). Airline Flights from United States to . Australia (Question No. 1490) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Transport and ComqlUnications, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (1) Is he able to say whether North West Airlines is seeking approval from the US Department of Transportation to introduce 3 flights each week between Los Angeles and Sydney; if so, what is the response of the Government to this application. (2) Is he able to say Whether North West Airlines has sought approval from the US Government for daily flights from the US to Sydney via Tokyo; if so, what is the Government's response to this proposal.

(4) Are any of those airlines associated with an Australian airline, if so, (a) with which airline, (b) what is the association and (c) would that affect the Government's response. (5) Could Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and the existing international passenger terminal cope with those extra flights. (6) Do the inadequacies of the Airport at its international terminal affect the Government's response to those applications.",115
136,Mr WILLIS ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the)wnourable member's question is as follows: ( I) Under the terms of new air service arrangements agreed between Australia and the US in August 1988, each side may designate one new passenger carrier during the next three years to operate scheduled services between the US and Australia. Northwest Airlines is one of four airlines who have applied to the US authorities to be so designated by the US Government. Proceedings by the US Department of Transportation to determine the new carrier are still under way. No application can be made to the Australian Government until these proceedings are complete and a new carrier is formally designated by the US Government. (2) Yes. Northwest Airlines filed an application with the US authorities on 15 September 1988 to operate daily services from a variety of points in eastern US states to Sydney via Tokyo (and viceversa). This application was dismissed by US authorities in November 1988 when United Airlines was granted authority to operate on this route. (3) Yes. American, Delta and America West Airlines are the other three airlines who have applied to the US Government for designation, subject to (I) above. (4) Yes.

Securi ty checks, for the purpose of assessing a person's suitability for a security clearance, are conducted on people selected to occupy Designated Security Assessment Positions (DSAPS) or Positions of Trust (POTS). Requesting ASIO to provide a security assessment forms part of the security clearance process for DSAPS-i.e. where access is required to National Security information classified CONFIDENTIAL and above. (2) (a) For Positions Of Trust the Commonwealth Personnel Management Manual requires the Department/ Authority to assess the general suitability of individuals to occupy a position which may allow the occupant access to sensitive, non-National Security information or to valuable assets. The process involves: a check of the person's identity; requesting a check of police records; an assessment of the person's loyalty, trustworthiness, reliability and character. An ASIO security assessment is not required for POTS. For DSAPS, in addition to the above requirements for POTS, the Commonwealth Protective Security Manual and Personnel Assessment Manual require that a security assessment be requested from ASIO, but only after the Secretary/Authority Head is satisfied as to a person's general suitability to occupy a DSAP. Where it is determined that, on, general suitability grounds, a person is unsuitable to occupy a DSAP a decision is taken to cease further clearance action and a security assessment is not sought from ASIO. (b) Where the Secretary/Authority Head decides not to grant a security clearance, or ceases further clearance action, based on general suitability grounds, the following avenues of appeal are available: under Division 3, Part III of the Public Service Regulations; The Merit Protection and Review Agency for Commonwealth employees; and the Commonwealth Ombudsman for non-Commonwealth employees.
