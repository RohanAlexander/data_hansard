CAMERON - I - wish to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs a question arising out of the following telegram I have received from the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce:Tariff representations made this chamber hardship to merchants through cargoes being held up - southern porta owing strike. Collector Customs states all cargo not entered at Customs yesterday must pay new duties. you please make representations Minister tiug out extreme hardship? I ask the Minister whether anything ean be done to alford relief to merchants in the circumstances disclosed hy that telegram ?  rule of the Department of Trade and Customs to charge the duties current on the day when the goods are cleared for home consumption, wherever they may happen to be, whether in Queensland, in Western Australia, or on ships between port and port along the coast. The duties tabled yesterday are payable this morning, and only those duties can be charged. The reductions in duties proposed will not come into operation until approved by this House. NA SHIPS.",12
2,Mr WATKINS,CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ENEMY,"I ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact that the Commonwealth Government has received about £100,000 from the British Government for the sale of captured German ships, it cannot settle claims made by Australian firms for work done upon such vessels, instead of compelling them to go to prize courts .for their settlement. For the capture of some of those vessels the claimants were themselves responsible?",13
3,Mr BRUCE,CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ENEMY,"There are many complications with regard to the claims arising out of war proceedings during the period of active hostilities. I think I know the case to which the quostion refers. I am looking into it, and I think it would be better to refrain from expressing any opinion upon it until I have completed my investigation. NA SOUTH WALES. QUEENSLAND RAILWAY STRIKE.  the Postmaster-General a question about the carriage of mails in Queensland, and he said that he would communicate with the Queensland Government, asking if it would assist in the matter. In view of the fact that many districts in my elecWill torate-whic h is in New South Walessetreceive most of their mail matter, including some from Queensland towns like Stanhope and Killarney, by railway, from Queensland, will the honourable gentleman see what can be done to provide postal facilities for the northern districts of New South Wales whilst the railway strike in Queensland continues )",13
4,Mr GIBSON,MAILS FOR NORTHERN NEW,It is somewhat difficult to answer the honourable member's question. The Government is doing all that is reasonably possible to facilitate the transport of mails. I assure the honourable member that wherever mails for the districts to which he has referred can .be delivered through New South Wales that will be done. DUTY ON WOOD PULP.,13
5,Mr OKEEFE,MAILS FOR NORTHERN NEW,"In view of the fact that there is no reference to wood pulp in the tariff proposals tabled yesterday, and a promise was made by the Minister for Trade and Customs to Tasmanian members that a decision of the Government on the question of a duty on wood pulp would shortly be made, I ask the honourable gentleman whether we may expect that within a few days the Government will have arrived at a decision on this question, which is so vital to Tasmania?  able member is aware that the matter to which he refers is not so urgent now as it appeared to be a few weeks ago. I can only repeat what I told the House yesterday, that it will have the consideration of the Govornmont within a short time. NA HOBART AND MELBOURNE.",13

13,Mr ATKINSON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Some time ago questions concerning the eradication of tick in Australia were asked by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charland the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green). The Minister for Markets and Migration has now Commonsupplied the followiug information:In January, 1918, the Commonwealth convened a conference in Brisbane at which were present representatives of the Commonwealth - and the States of New South Wales and Queensland. That State considered it desirable that a co-operative campaign should be launched throughout the tick-infested'areas in New South Wales and Queensland; that this campaign should be carried out by the application of the Commonwealth's legal powers and its administrative and financial resources, in conjunction with the application of similar resources provided by the States to an extent mutually agreed upon by the Commonwealth and the States concerned. The conference also recommended that the details of the work and expenditure of funds allotted for the purpose should be settled by a conference between the Commonwealth Director of Quarantine and INSURANCE. the Chief Inspectors of Siock for the States of New South Wales and Queensland, and that the Commonwealth should supplement the funds expended in the areas affected. Unfortunately, the Queensland representatives withdrew from the conference prior to the drafting of the report and recommendations, as they dissented from the principle of Commonwealth intervention or co-operation in any form other than merely granting a financial subsidy. Despite this failure to get concerted action, the Commonwealth Government in May, 1919, asked Dr Gilruth to proceed to America to investigate the methods of preventing and eradicating ticks, and his report was subsequently made available to the States. Nothing further was done by the State Governments until the 8th August, 1923, when the Premier of New South Wales, Sir George Fuller, asked for Commonwealth aid to the extent of £25,000 a year for two years to enable them to eradicate the tick in New South Wales. The Commonwealth Government replied that the matter should be approached from a national point of view, aiming ultimately at eradication without reference to any State boundaries, and that failure to do so, no matter how successf u l the campaign in New South Wales, would leave a risk of re-infestation from Queensland, and urged the New South Wales Government to obtain unity of purpose between the States of New South Wales and Queensland as to the direction in which the Commonwealth could most effectively assist in the eradication of the tick pest. The Commonwealth Government would then be prepared to discuss any proposals in a sympathetic attitude. Despite the Commonwealth Government's reply, the New South Wales Government, still persisted during the early part of 1924 in asking for £25,000 a year for two years, which it intended in addition to their own expenditure of £100,000, would be sufficient to completely eradicate the tick in that time. On the 17th February, 1924, the Commonwealth Government pointed out that the Commonwealth had been trying for years to get the States of New South Wales and Queensland to fall into line in a comprehensive scheme to completely eradicate the pest, and that it was prepared to go on with the. work at once, and amply subsidize it if the States' would only agree to a scheme which the Commonwealth Government would approve. The attitude of the Commonwealth Government towards the request of New South Wales for a subsidy of £25,000 a year for two years was governed by a proper appreciation of its legitimate functions, and a. sound knowledge of the situation!,, and the practical steps necessary to cope with it. Cattle tick will be eradicated more readily by co-operation between States than by independent action by individual States'. '.Che matter must be approached from a national point of view aiming at complete eradication without reference to any State boundaries. We could subsidize New South Wales for years, but without the co-operation of Queensland, from which State the disease first spread, there would always be a risk of re-infestation, and the problem from the CominonweUtih stand-point would be practically where i i was.. The increasing expenditure of New South Wales is a sufficient proof that the task' nrnst be' approached in some better way. As a result of Commonwealth pressure, finally an effort was made by. New South Wales to get Queensland into line, and a committee met in September, 1924. This committee submitted a plan which involved the expenditure of £174,000 a year, to which the Commonwealth contribution would be £58,000. main proposals agreed upon, and which were subsequently adopted by the New South Wales and Queensland Governments, were briefly :1 (a) That co-operative effort in the. matter was desirable and necessary. (b) The first period of co-operation to be for six years. (c) The estimated expenditure for the first year to be as follows :Commonwealth Government New South Wales Government ... Queensland Government... 25,000 Of this amount £149,000 (the Commonwealth and New South Wales contributions).,, to be spent in New Soutli Wales, and £25,000 Queensland. The Commonwealth contribution to be for six years, and always one-third the total annual expenditure, but never to exceed £58,000 per annum. (This suggested tribution is more than double the £25,000 fox by New South Wales a few months previously). This greatly increased expenditure is proposed with apparently little alteration in methods, which,. up to the present have, during 25 years of New South Wales action, perPart 2. Business undertakings mitted the pest to encroach on districts miles south of the Queensland border where it wasat the beginning of the century. The New South Wales Government, while admitting that its-past methods have been unsatisfactory and ineffective, now maintain that it has an effective method. On this point the Common- wealth must be satisfied that the expenditure is properly justified before granting subsidies passed to State efforts. Tl-e Institute of Science Mr Atkinson. Industry, has never been fully supplied with the details of the proposed expenditure, nor with a complete outline of methods proposed to be followed. The Commonwealth Government recognizes the importance of evolving a thoroughly practical and comprehensive scheme, and, in view of the unexplained additional expenditure, has. decided to submit the whole ojuestion to the Institute of Science' and Industry,, when reconstituted, to investigate, and, if possible, suggest a method for the co-operation of all governments concerned, in which the nature of the outlay, and. the reasons for the outlay involved, will be precisely defined. The question of the reconstitution of the Institute is under the consideration of the Government, and it is expected that a bill to amend the Institute of Science and Industry Act will beintroduced very shortly. As, however, it is realized that some time may elapse before the reconstituted Institute will be in a position to deal with this question; the Commonwealth Government is approaching the Go1 vernments' of News South Wales and Queensland with a view to coming, to some temporary arrangement which will enable a start to be made with the handling of this important national question during the present seasdn.

14,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Cowper-Trea surer) [2.48] - I move- . That there be granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the services of the year £58*000 1925-26, a sum not exceeding £3,322,820. Towards the close of the last financial ... 91,000 year, Parliament granted Supply for the ordinary purposes of government, to cover a period of 'two months. That grant is in now exhausted, and I am therefore submitting a bill to provide Supply for a of further two months. The total of the bill conis £3,322,820, made up as follows: asked Part 1. Departments and services-other than business undertakings and' territories of the Commonwealth - £1,353,530 1,721,82,0 many Part 3. Territories of the Commonwealth ... ... 47,470 Refunds of revenue .. 200,000 £3,322,820 As the previous Supply Bill was before the Estimates for and the current year had been prepared; the schedule was framed according to th& form of the Estimates for 1924-25, and was not divided into the three parts shown above. Therefore a comparison of the first grant of Supply with the present proposal, to cover a similar period, can be made on totals only. The total of the Supply previously granted is £4,459,235, as compared £3,322,820, the total of the present bill. It is only fair to state, however, that the first bill container}, under Treasurer's - Advance, an amount of £1,000,000 to provide for the continuation of works, pending the passing of the revenue and loan works bills, whilst no such provision is necessary in the present measure. In addition, a larger amount was included in the first bill for refunds of revenue, to provide for special refunds of direct taxation, following on High Court judgments and amendments in the law. Omitting the Treasurer'sAdvance and refunds of revenue, the total of the present bill is £3,122,820, whilst the amount of the first Supply was £3,109,235. This slight increase of £13,5S5 is unimportant when it is remembered that many thousands of pounds will be expended in quarterly and half-yearly contract payments, which fall due in . the period covered by the Supply. The total of the two Supply Bills, which cover four months' expenditure, excluding the Treasurer's Advance and refunds of revenue, is £6,232,055, whilst one-third of the total expenditure provided for in the main Estimates is £6,358,780. In other words the two bills total £126,725, less than one-third of the total estimated expenditure for the year. When it is remembered that in the four months covered by Supply there are tern pay days, the requirements for which are considerably in excess of one-third of the total salary provision for the year, it will be seen the proposed expenditure is well within the programme for 1925-26. No provision is made for services of which Parliament has not already approved. This fact, in conjunction with the moderate' amount for which I am now asking, shows that Parliament's right of criticism of the Estimates and its control of the public purse are in no way curtailed. Question, resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported.. Standing Orders suspended;, resolution adopted. Resolution of Ways and Means, founded on resolution of Supply, reported and adopted.

Motion (by Dr EARXH PAGE) proposed - That the bill be now read a second time.",15
15,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Hunter) [2,56] The practice of delaying the discussion of the budget and the consideration of the Estimates, and applying repeatedly to Parliament for Supply, is not a, wise one. Some weeks have elapsed since the Treasurer delivered his budget speech, and I hope that the House will have an opportunity to discuss it in the> near future. My only purpose in speaking at this stage is to complain of the inaction of the Governmenit in regard to the business of the League of Nations. Quite recently, and almost twelve months, after the meeting of the Eifth Assembly, the Australian delegates submitted their report to the HouseLast week, the Prime Minister, in replying to a question promised that an opportunity would be afforded to discuss the report in conjunction with the agenda paper for the Sixth Assembly. I understand that the Sixth Assembly will meet on Mondaynext, but this House has not discussed either the report of the last delegation or the agenda paper. Now, such a discussion will be a waste of time, in so far as it is too late to fortify our 'delegateswith the opinions that of this House. Whether Parliament approves or disapproves of the Protocol, it should have considered the report of the delegates, to the Eifth Assembly and the agenda paper fos the Sixth Assembly, ao that those who will' shortly be required to voice Australian sentiments there may be guided by authoritaitiye. opinion.. Unfortunately, they will be in the same invidious position as was occupied by their predecessors; they will attend the Assembly without having the. support of .the expressed opinion of the Australian Parliament and people, and must be guided entirely by the proposals placed before tliem by otlier representative men. In tbese circumstances, the leader of the British delegation will probably expect the Australian delegates to acquiesce in what he says or does. If Australia is to continue to be a member of the League, this Parliament must deal with the League business seriously and methodically, and we should endeavour to so inform our delegates that they will be able to represent intelligently the views of our people. Representatives of fifty nations will be gathered at Geneva; and there is bound to be much diversity of individual opinion. The Australian delegates do not know the opinion of this Parliament. I doubt if they know the opinion of the Government in regard to the business appearing on the agenda paper. It is useless for us to expend money in sending delegates to Geneva unless we intend to deal thoroughly with the business of the League. Year after year we send people to represent us at that most important gathering, and some timelater at the convenience of the Government their report is submitted' to this House, but no adequate opportunity to discuss it is afforded. Little wonder that people are saying that attendance the meetings of the Assembly is merely a picnic for representative men. The time has arrived when Parliament should deal with this matter in a deliberate way. If a decision is come to within the next couple of weeks, our representatives should be advised of if . It is not possible, by cable, to fully and adeqtiately acquaint those representatives of the views of this chamber. Members of the Parliament who are on the delegation should be present whilst these discussions are taking place, so that they may know the views that are expressed. Their hands would then be strengthened when they attended the Assembly. Under existing circumstances they leave Australia without any fixed opinions, and are likely to be influenced by some domineering individual who represents, perhaps, Great Britain. happenings of the last three of four months on the other side of the world are bound to have their effect upon them. If au alteration in the procedure is not made Australia should withdraw from the League of Nations. The expenditure of money annually to defray the cost of sending a delegation from Australia will be wasted unless matters are placed on a Mr Charlton. proper basis. If our present delegates were acquainted with the view of this Government and Parliament, they might be able to exert an influence on the British delegation before attending the Assembly of the League of Nations. By that means an agreement might be arrived at under which a uniform .course could be adopted by Great Britain and the dominions. At present, concerted action is not possible, and frequently the Australian delegates must follow the lead that is given by other representatives who are not in touch with Australian sentiment. A grave injustice is being done to the League of Nations. The Government as not justified in its refusal of an opportunity to discuss the report of the delegates to the last Assembly, and it ought not to have rejected the Protocol before consulting Parliament. If honourable members permit the .business to be carried on in that way they must accept the responsibility of their action. I , at any rate, conceive it to be my duty to inform the Australian people of my dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Government is proceeding. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. at In committee: Glauses 1 - to 4 agreed to. Schedule.",16
16,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Hunter) [3.6] - I move That the Vote, "" The Parliament, £12,235,"" be reduced by £2. I move this amendment as an instruction to the Government to make arrangements for the payment by 15th September, 1925, of £ 1 per week to old-age and invalid pensioners. I desire to do justice to the old people whom the Treasurer, in his budget speech, promised will receive an increased pension simultaneously with the passage of legislation giving effect to the findings of the National Insurance Commission. It is difficult for me to understand the reason for the .bracketing of those two The matters. I can only conclude that the Government wishes to procrastinate still further. The commission have clearly pointed out that old-age and invalid pensioners are entitled to a pension of £ 1 a week, without having.to make any contribution. The other scheme suggested by the commission relates to sick and accident benefits, which, no doubt, will involve provision regarding contributions. Honourable members must admit that that inatter is entirely separate Ironi the proposal to increase the old-age and invalid pensions. There can be no reason for withholding that increase, Ample funds are available to enable the Government to discharge the additional obligation. The increased payment could have been made during the last three years from the huge surpluses that have been returned. It is well known that at the last election the Labour party promised that, if returned to power, it would pay the old age and invalid a pension of £ 1 a week. Had we been returned, that amount of pension would have been paid during the last two and a half years. Now, on the eve of an election, the Government, 'for political purposes, has decided to grant an increase. It is evident that the Government does not intend to give it u n t i l it can no longer delay the matter, so that it can boast of its generosity during the forthcoming election campaign. If ever there was a bid for votes, this is one.",17
17,Mr BKENNAN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,An eleventh hour repentance.,18
18,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"That is so. We oil this side have agitated for an increased pension ever since this Parliament assembled. Numerous attempts have been made by honourable members to get the Government and its supporters, who claim that they are in sympathy with the old people, to agree to an increase of the pension. Yet, although the Treasury was overflowing, it was impossible to get them to concede this meed of justice to the old and infirm of this country.",18
19,Mr LISTER,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,Not all of them.,18
20,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"No . I know the attitude then adopted by the honourable member, and he shall not suffer any in justice at my hands in regard to this question. On the 10th August, 1923, recorded in Hansard, page 2490, Mr Coleable man movedThat the division, No. 22, "" Invalid age Pensions Office, £84,588"" be reduced £1 "" as an instruction to the Government to crease the pension to £ 1 per week. On orable members. that occasion, Messrs. F . Francis, Gardner, Lister, Maxwell, Watson and Whitsitt supported the amendment. On the 24th August, 1923, as recorded in Hansard, page 3564, I moved that the amount of the pension be increased by 5s., instead of by 2s. 6d. It appeared that some of the Ministerial supporters were in favour of the increase of 5s., but the Prime Minister rose and stated that the carrying amendment would be taken as an indication that the Government did not possess the confidence of the House. Thereupon, those Government supporters commenced to make apologetic speeches, stating that while they favoured the rate being £ 1 per week, they would have to vote against the amendment. It is interesting to re-' cord the observations of honourable members on that occasion. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) said that he was in favour of a pension of £ 1 per week, but, in view of the attitude adopted by the Prime Minister, he could not vote for the amendment. The honourable member for Henty (Mr F . Francis) spoke in a similar strain, claiming that he had the interests of the pensioners ab heart. Nevertheless, he did not vote for the amendment.",18
21,Mr BRENNAN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,A man cannot do more than be on both sides.,18
22,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green), who on that occasion said I do not hold with the doctrine that all sense of filial duty should be allowed to die out, aud that the Government should do what children ought to do to assist their parents also voted against the amendment.",18
23,Mr R GREEN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Naturally , in view of the sentiments I then expressed.",18
24,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"The great majority of the people of this country are unable to support their parents, as they have sufficient to do to support their own families.",18
25,Mr R GREEN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"If it were not that strikes are so numerous, people today would be in a better position to support themselves and their families.",18
26,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"My amendment was defeated; the only Government supas porters of it being the right honormember for No r th Sydney (Mr . Hughes), the honourable member for and OldCorio (Mr Lister), and the honorby able member for Fremantle (Mr Watson). It is interesting to read what in the Bulletin thought of the action of honN o one will contend that the Bulletin is a supnorter of the Labour party, yet, on the 13th September, 1923, dealing with the spineless attitude of certain Government supporters, it saidFor two hours he (Mr Bruce) wrested with the recalcitrants, and then overcame them by fish a threat of resignation. The number of jellyin the subsequent division made the House of the look like an aquarium. That is the impression conveyed to the press 'by the action of the Government and its .supporters. Again, on the 1-Oth .September, 1924, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Eorde) moved that the amount of .pension be increased to £ 1 per week, hint not one anti-Labour member voted for it . Now, on the eve of an election, the Government grants an additional Ss. 6d. per week. It is * good thing .for the old people that an election is pearling, as had Parliament been elected foT six years instead of thiree years their position would be much worse.",18
27,Mr JBBUCE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"This Government, within a year of assuming office, increased the pension by 5s. 6d. per week. Mr Charlton. - I am referring to the attempt to increase the pension to £1 a week. Actions of this kind demonstrate clearly that it TTOuJd be unwise to extend the period for which a Parliament is elected. It - would be better for the old and infirm in onr midst if there were an (election annually, as they would then have a chance of obtaining justice. I think that I have made it clear that the Labour party in this House has consistently advocated that the pension be increased to £.1 per week. In doing that, we have only endeavoured to fulfi l our promise to the electors. That the old people have not received £1 per week is no fault of the Labour party. I wish now to refer to the treatment meted out to those old-age pensioners who become inmates of pabtie hospitals. On many occasions, I have sought information regarding their treatment, and on the 10th July last, I ascertained that after 28 days in a hospitalOTIold-age or invalid pensioner who, before entering the institution, receives 17s. 'Cd. a week, has his pension reduced to 5s. a week. The sum of 10s. 6d. a week is paid to the hospital authorities, which, witk the 8s. a week paid to the pensioner, makes the Government's weekly contribution 13s. 6d. onily, .or a. .'saving of 4s. & week in raspeet of each old-age or invalid pensioner ""wfo-o is an inmate ef a public hospital. . The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) then said that it was uot intended to increase the payment to the hospitals because they were State institutions, and should be maintained by the States. When I asked him what the saving of 4s. a week represented, he replied that it would be about £2,000 per annum. In a letter which he subsequently addressed to me, the Treasurer saidAs the amount of pension which may ba paid to Inmates of institutions is fixed by law at 3s. per - week, it will be seen that it is not possible to authorize the payment of an additional 4s. per week. If such payment wore authorized, the Commonwealth would be involved in an additional liability of approximately £50,<000 per annum.",19
28,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,That reply referred to the State institutions- a different matter altogether.,19
29,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"How would it in volve the Commonwealth in an additional £50,000 per annum if the pensioners were paid while in hospital the amount paid to them in ordinary circumstances ? Dr EAELE PACHS*-There were two classes of pensioners-thos e who were already in institutions, and those who were not. To have granted all (he inmates of institutions £1 per week would have considerably increased the Commonwealth burden. This Government was the first to pay anything to the inmates of hospitals who were not already old age pensioners. That action was taken by the Government in 1923. Mr Charlton"" - I am referring to those old-jage pensioners who become inmates of hospitals, and submit that at that time particularly they require a little additional money to obtain certain necessaries of life to supplement those supplied by the institution. I do Jiot stand for paying them 3s. a week only in order to .save ourselves 4s. a week; T am prepared to .grant them the full .amount of the pension. If fclie hospital receives 10s. 6d. per week in respect of - each of them, the pensioners should get the remaining 7s., in order to make it possible for them to obtain a few additional comforts. This thing cries aloud for redress., and, if members of the Government had a spark of humanity in thera. they could mot iailow it to continue. There is a phase of the invalid pensions administration to which I wish to refer. A person has to be totally incapacitated before he is eligible for an invalid pension. If it is proved by medical evidence that a man is partially incapacitated to the extent of being unable to do a fair day's work, he should not fee entirely deprived of a pension, although he caa earn, perhaps, 7s. or 8s. a week. These anomalies in our pension laws should be removed. If man who is partially incapacitated can earn anything, he should receive from the Government an amount that will terests make his income equivalent to a full penGovernment sion. To allow pensioners to earn someto pay pensions. thing without becoming ineligible for pension would relieve the Commonwealth Government of a certain amount of liasince bility.",19

The responsibility should be carried tirely by the Commonwealth. I conceive it to be my duty to take such action as will give honourable members an opportunity todirect the Treasurer to pay the creased pensions as from the 15thof present month. That will give the vernment a fortnight in which to pass necessary legislation through Parliament. I should like to say "" forthwith,"" the pensions cannot be paid until the necessary bill has been passed. having promised these old people an. crease in their pensions, there is. no tification for withholding, it until next year.

History discloses that old-age and invalid pensions were first put into tangible shapein Australia at an interstate conference of the Austracognizing r 2181 a lian Labour party;. It was. because Labour held thebalance, of power in Parliament, and used that power in the. inof the aged and infirm,, that the first introduced the proposal Had not the Labour a party demanded that pensions should be paid,, they would not have been paid, and then the Labour party has been, responsible, by creating a public opinion could not be disregarded even by an anti-Labour Government, for the. in that have been obtained. Now. in the dying hours of a Parliament^ the Government has promised certain inencreases conditionally upon other things being done, but we are not satisfied! that old-age pensions should be made the catspaw of a Government which has been disincredited in its legislative and adthe ministrative fmictions, or that the GoGovernment should be allowed, by the a deathbed repentance, oir the promise of ai deathbed repentance, te but withhold the increase any longer. We have been told by the Government that After when a certain bill dealing with national ininsurance has been passed, the old-age jusand invalid pensions will be increased to £1 a week. Honourable members on. this side say that the increase in the pensions heen too long delayed, and. that there is no occasion to ask the pensioners to for the increase until a date which is unknown even to the Government. A sufcommission has recommended, and the my people have demanded, this increase, but othe Government is apparently, content even to go to the electors without, paying If the increase is not paid, before the the Government will, no doubt, I make the excuse, that the Labour party held upthe business of the Parliament, to and prevented the Government from Honpassing the necessary legislation. When one considers the presents, the prizes, ancl quid pro qusos that, have been handed to influential and wealthy sections of the Parcommunity, the withholding of old-age invalid pensions becomes-, even more By the scandalous. When we. asked a few months ago for an increase from 15s. to £1, we were, informed by both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister that, owing to financial stringency, it was impossible to increase the pensions by that amount, and therequest, was curtly refused, until even the tory press of this country,, rethe justice of the claim.. brought sufficient pressure to bear on tain honourable members, who revolted against the Government, and compelled it, reluctantly, to give way. On that occasion, the pensions were increased to 17s. 6d. Although the Government told us that the financial stringency was so great that pensions could not be increased to £1 a week, a few months afterwards it promised to increase them to £1 a week: ancl it handed to the Inchcape combine, in the form of reduced taxation, over £100,000 a year. More than 90 per cent, of the concession on shipping tonnage will be enjoyed by the Inchcape combine. It also made a present of the Commonwealth ""Woollen Mills, valued at over £400,000, to a syndicate of woollen merchants and importers of Flinders-lane, and senators and friends of members of the House of Representatives, who put into the concern only a small deposit, and are relying on the profits to pay for it. It was this same Government that presented leaseholders and freeholders with many thousands of pounds a year in remission of taxation. It attempted to pass a bill remitting taxation on leaseholds to the extent of £1,300,000. Then it has the effrontery and impudence to inform the people of Australia that the financial position of the Commonwealth is such that it will not permit of an increase of 2s. 6d. or 5s. to the old-age and invalid pensions. I could refer to several cases of hardship which have occurred under the admini-» stration of the act. There is the case of an unfortunate girl at Broken Hill which was responsible for much correspondence from the Barrier District Assembly of the Australian Labour party. This girl was for three years either an inmate or an outdoor patient of the Broken Hill hospital. She went to Adelaide for treatment at the hospitals there, yet she is told that, because she is not absolutely incurable, she is not entitled to receive the invalid pension. Although she has been told by the medical referees that she is not incurable, they have not been able to cure her, and do not appear to know just what is the matter with her. I think that, not only should the invalid and old age pensions be increased, but the increase should be paid from the date suggested in the amendment. Further, it should not be made so difficult for inMr Blakeley. cer- valids and elderly persons to obtain pensions. Inmates of hospitals, benevolent asylums, and such institutions throughout Australia. entitled to the invalid or old-age pension are allowed only 3s. per week. If the Government do submit a proposal for the increase in the pensions, it is to be hoped that 5s. 6d. at least will be made payable to the inmates of such institutions as I have referred to. The present allowance of 3s. to an inmate of these institutions is not sufficient for an old man who may be a heavy smoker or desires some other little comforts of life, or for old people who desire alcoholic liquors and some small luxuries to make their lives a little happier. When men and women become old their need for beer, wine, whisky, and especially brandy, increases. Alcohol is, in their case, not a stimulant, but a medicine, and to obtain this medicine they require more than the 3s. per week at present allowed them. I urge upon the Government that the allowance to people in these institutions should be increased. I speak, of course, of the present Government, because the increase of the allowance will iriost certainly be granted by the Government in power after the next elections, when the act will be sympathetically administered by people who understand those who are entitled to these pensions and are much closer to them than are the members of an anti-Labour government ",20
33,Mr LAZZARINI,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Werriwa) [3.35] I intend to support the amendment. One wonders why, at this stage of this Parliament, there is only a promise of an increase in the old-age and invalid pensions. I regard the promise as a placard io be put before the electors. I am not satisfied that the Government is sincere in the promise that has been made. It is, I consider, purely a political trick. It will be said that, owing to unforeseen circumstances, the Government had not time to carry out the promise, and it will be held over for the next election. If that is the course to be adopted by the Government, it will be one of the meanest political, tricks that has ever been played or could be played by any government. We were told, in the Treasurer's budget speech, that the recommendation of the National Insurance Commission showed the necessity for increasing the invalid and old age pensions. Honourable members on this side do not need to he asked the question, but I ask honourable members opposite whether they really required a royal commission to tell them that a pension of 17s! 6d. a week is not enough for invalids and old people. The fact that the commission dealt with the matter may have whipped honourable members opposite into action, but surely they did not require a recommendation of that commission to learn that invalid and old people require something more than a pension of 17s. 6d. a week. Those entitled to these pensions are told that they must wait until this and that are done before their pensions can be increased, but when, last week, the Government wauted to serve its own purpose, the whole machinery of Parliament was thrown out of gear, and we had to sit on Friday night and Saturday to push through legislation. The Government cannot adopt that course to relieve old and infirm people! It would not require an all-night sitting to pass a measure providing for an increase in the invalid and old-age pension. So far as the party on this side is concerned, the Government could pass such a measure in five minutes. The Government is going to increase the pension, but the people entitled to it must wait a few months in order that the Treasurer may rob them of a few more pounds to swell his surplus. I understand that the Prime Minister, on a previous occasion, practically consented to the increase of the pension from 15s. to 20s. being left to the Parliament to decide: but when one honourable member after another on the other side spoke in support of the proposal, and the right honourable gentleman saw that he was losing the majority which, up to that stage, he thought he had in his pocket, the whip of the party was sent round to inform the followers of the Government that it would regard the carrying of the increase as a vote of want of confidence. We were told on that occasion that the financial position of the Commonwealth would not warrant the increase. Treasurer stood up proudly, and spread out his chest when announcing the surplus he had made; but the people of Australia do not desire that surpluses should be built up by robbing invalids and old persons of the means of obtaining some of the comforts of life to which they are entitled. One might speak for a long time on this matter, but the facts are clear, and they have been set down by the Leader of the Opposition, who showed the insincerity of the Government in this matter. If the promised increase is granted, there will still remain some anomalies in the administration of the act to be rectified. Invalids who earn 4s. or 5s. a week are told that they are not incapacitated, and cannot be given a pension. In the case of inmates of benevolent institutions; 10s. 6d. is paid out of their pension to the institutions, and only 3s. to the pensioner. In this way the Government pares off 4s. from the pension which should be paid, in order to swell the Treasurer's 'surplus. If the pension is increased to £ 1 , all in excess of the 10s. 6d. paid - to benevolent institutions should be paid to the inmates of those institutions. I should like to see some members of the Government living in institutions for the aged and infirm, experiencing the conditions there, and receiving a pension of 6s. a fortnight. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), the other day called the bluff of the Government by throwing out a challenge to the Prime Minister. He has now called the Treasurer's bluff, on behalf of aged and infirm persons. The Treasurer should be sincere, and refrain from misleading the old people and invalids who cannot speak for themselves, and who have no organization to act for them. If the Treasurer will give an assurance to bring down a bill to give effect to the old-age pensions, he will have no trouble in passing the Supply Bill. If the Government is honest it will accept the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, and thus confer a great benefit upon the aged people living in institutions as well as those outside them.",21
34,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Cowper-Trea surer) [3.47] - I am very glad that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has mentioned the old-age pensions today, The because it enables me to put this matter in a very clear light before the House and before the country. The public generally are getting sick and tired of hearing the promises of the Opposition, especially when they recollect the record of the Labour party in regard to pensions. We hear a great deal from the 'members of the Opposition about - what should be done, and What they - would do if they had the opportunity. I propose now to tell the committee the history of the old age and invalid pensions in this Parliament, and to point out the difference between the attitude of this Oo vernment, which has definitely improved the position of the old-age pensioners, and that of the Labour party, which, comparatively, has done nothing at all for tthem. In the first instance, a royal commission, whose chairman was the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Sir Austin Chapman), brought down a report to this House.",22

37,Mr MATHEWS,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,Who forced it to do sol,23
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"All we get from the Labour party is talk, not deeds. What action did the Labour Government take to raise the old-age pension rate when it had a majority o$ fourteen or fifteen in the House? It did nothing at all, and yet the Opposition talks about forcing the Deakin Government to act. In 1908, Sir Littleton Groom brought down to this House a measure dealing with old-age and invalid pensions. was congratulated by the then Leader of the Labour party, who expressed his astonishment that it was possible to bringdown such a comprehensive and liberal measure. To use his actual words, he thought that it would not have been possible to introduce such a bill for years. The Labour party came into power in November of that year, and remained in office for six months. It paid not one shilling of the pension. The Deakin Government regained office, and through the action .of Sir Wilfiam Lyne, the Treasurer in that Government, the first pension payment was made on the 1st July, 1909. Although the Labour party was in office fox six months, it did nothing. In 1910 it returned ito power, and remained in office for three years. During that time it did nothing at .all to raise the pension rate, which was then 10s. a week, despite the fact that it had imposed the land tax, and thereby gained an additional revenue of nearly £2,000,000. This increased the cost of living, and decreased the purchasing power of the pound. The .sum of 24s. in 1913 was equivalent to £ 1 in 1909. The Labour party was returned to office is IS 14, and it did nothing at all to increase the pension, although price levels had jumped considerably. It did nothing until 28s. was comparable with £1 in 1.909. In 19.16 the Labour Government was still in power. It remained in office for five and a half years, ancl then its ranks were threatened with disruption. In September, 1916, the conscription issue was splitting the party to pieces. The Labour Government feared that an election was imminent, and two months before it left office it increased the old-age pension. The record of the Labour parity respecting the old-age and. invalid pensions is this: After five and a half years of office, and on the eve of aa election, it increased the old-age pension from 20s. to 25s. a fortnight. Those who were responsible for that increase-me n like Higgs and Hughes-hav e now no connection with the Labour party. Yet honourable members opposite talk about anomalies. They weep crocodile tears on the floor ©f th® House in respect - of the terrible things which they say exist in our midst. Did they do anything to alter them? No; they did not. I pay the honourable member for Melbourne He (Dr Maloney) the tribute that he has been consistent throughout his parliamentary career in his support of the old-age pensioners. But other honourable members of the Opposition are like dumb, driven cattle. They ha<re done nothing to bring about a real improvement in the conditions of the old-age pensioners. Their attitude is nothing but .absolute sham and hypocrisy. Let w look at what has been done by this side of the House. The Deakin Government, through Sir Littleton Groom, brought the first old-age pensions bill down to this House, but, before it could be given effect, the Government was defeated. Tke Labour party did nothing until 191(6, when, without any budget statement at - all, it granted, in a haphazard way, an increase of 2s. 6d. a week in the pension. This is all on record in Mansard and in the public press of this country. Honourable members' votes and speeches are on record permanently and indelibly. Governments oa this side have continuously increased Uhe pension rate. First of all, the Deakin Government introduced the old age and invalid pension. In 1916 a panicstricken Labour party granted an increase of 2s. fid. a - week. In 1919 the then Treasurer of the first National Government {the Right Hon. W. A. Watt) increased the pension to 15s. a week. This Government, in its first budget, increased tke pension to Its. 6d. a week. It did not Tvait until the eve of an election. The public know that the statements of members of the Opposition are nothing - but twaddle. This Government, three years before it had to go to the country, increased the pension to place it upon its original basis. At that time 34s. was equivalent to £1 in 1909. This Government, in 1923, increased the fortnightly rate to 35s. That was part of the hudget proposals and the National financial programme. Having done that, wo examined the whole position. In view of the progress that the National In surance Commission has made in its inquiries, the Government has decided to increase the pension to £1 a week at the same time as the national insurance scheme comes into operation. Honourable members opposite view old-age pensions as a political placard, to be used on the eve of elections. This Government deals out even-handed justice, and attempts to rectify anomalies. We are prepared to grant an increased pension as part of our considered national plan of finance. In 1917 Lord Forrest made substantial additions in his budget to the old-age pension by making it independent and exclusive of payments for war pensions and contributions by the children of old-age pensioners towards their maintenance. In 1919 the then Treasurer (the Right Hon. W.. A. Watt) increased the pension to 15s. In 1920 . Sir Joseph Cook, the Treasurer of the second Nationalist Government raised the amount that the blind could earn from £65 to £221 per annum. Finally, this ^Sovei'nment two years ago increased the pension to 17s. a week. It now proposes to increase the pension to £1 a week. I should like to point out to honourable members that this Government is able to make this increase at a ' time when it is - reducing taxation and carrying out a general policy to enable the cost of living to foe reduced, thus increasing the purchasing power of the pension. Although the Labour Government in 1913 did not increase the pension, yet it enormously increased taxation. In its first year of office it took from the States £3,000,000, representing the difference between the per capita paynients and l i e payments under the Braddon section. It imposed a land tax as well. Altogether, the taxation was increased by that Government by approximately £5,000,000, because the States had to impose additional taxation, and this was reflected in the high cost of living throughout the country. The Labour Government increased the taxation, but did nothing to increase the pension. This Government has decreased taxation and increased the pension. The Labour party makes only haphazard propositions; this Government is evolving a considered and definite scheme that will let the old people and everybody else in the community know definitely what the future holds in store for them. What has been ike history of the removal of anomalies in connection with pensions administration? While the Labour party was in office it corrected two anomaliesthe value of a pensioner's home was exempted from the computation of property, and the contributions by children were exempted from the computation of income. Mr Socr-Liif - The Treasurer stated previously that the Labour party did nothing.",23
39,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"I said that the Labour party did nothing in relation to the raising of the rate of pension, and that statement is absolutely correct. Although the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act was then on die statute-book, not one of the three Fisher administrations did anything towards increasing the rate of pension. The amendments effected by Lord Forrest, when Treasurer of the first National War Government, included the >6d. exemption from the computation of income of any payment by the Commonwealth to a. person by reason of his dependence on a member of the Commonwealth Naval or Military Forces within the meaning of the War Pensions Act 1914-16,. and allotments made by members of the forces, and ""war pensions to dependants of members of the forces. Contributions from children were exempted from the computation of "" adequate maintenance"" for invalid pension purposes. Sir Joseph Cook, as Treasurer, in the second National War Government, raised the income limit for blind pensioners, as I have already indicated. Two years ago the present Government investigated this matter in a systematic and methodical way, and altered eight anomalies-(1 ) We increased the rate of pension from 15s. to 17s. 6d. per week; (2) we increased the amount which the pensioner could earn, without affecting his pension, from 10s. to 12s. 6d. per week; (3) we advanced the limit of the pensioner's income, including pension, from 25s. to 30s. a week- a very substantial concession; (4) the statutory limit to the amount of property that a pensioner might own was increased from £310 to £400. Previously a person owning £310 worth of property was not eligible for a pension, but, as a result of our amendment, such a person would receive a pension of 7s. 6d. per week. (5) The payment to inmates of benevolent asylums was increased from 2s. to 3s. per week. (6) We made provision for au allowance of 3s. per week to be paid to all inmates of benevolent asylums who would have been eligible for pensions if they had resided outside an institution. Prior to that, a pension could be paid only to such inmates as were pensioners or claimants for a pension at the date of entering an instiproduction tution. Honourable members opposite talk as if the Government, by paying 3s. per week to inmates of institutions, were doing something scandalous, but before we came into office those people received no payment at all, notwithstanding that the Labour party had been in office for five years. (7) We also made provision for the payment of 3s. per week to pensioner inmates of hospitals after 28 days' residence therein. Prior to that no pensions were payable to inmates of hospitals. (8) Finally we provided for the grant of pensions to persons suffering from congenital complaints after twenty years' continuous residence in Australia. That is a record of progressive relief which we can confidently place before the people. It is not an election placard; it is part of a definite aud constructive national policy, covering old-age, invalidity, sickness, and unemployment. TheLeader of the Opposition 3poke of peo23le who are partly incapacitated. It is for the benefit of, such people that the Government proposes to introduce a system of national insurance. The problem must be dealt with in a comprehensive way. The Government is endeavouring to do that, and it will not be stampeded into any course of action that cannot be approved by everybody who considers it with au unprejudiced mind. Much has been said of the anticipations that have been raised in the minds of the old-age pensioners on account of the Government's announcement of its intention to increase the pension to £ 1 per week. The Government's intentions are dear and unmistakable. This Parliament will not terminate without legislative effect having been given to that promised reform, and in such a way that its benefits will be continuous and permanent. . We are not proposing haphazard and momentary relief that may be subsequently taken away. After what has taken place, during the last couple of weeks, one must recognize that , the only way to ensure that this pension will be continuous is to keep out of office members of the Opposition, who, by advocating strikes, job control, and a 44-hour week, are endeavouring to lessen production. How can we raise the standard of our humanitarian legislation and make £1 per week continuously available for the aged and invalid unless we stimulate ? The men who are fit and well must work honestly and efficiently in order io enable the old ancl infirm to be helped from the public treasury. Australia cannot continue for ever borrowing from people overseas, using the savings of other people in order to carry out a policy of humane legislation. The work of the country must* be done efficiently and continuously in order to increase the surplus of wealth, maintain our standards of living, and extend help to those who are unable to hold their own in the battles of life. The solution of the problem is to be found, not merely in raising the rate of the pension, but also in enhancing its purchasing power by increasing the production of wealth. I hope that the committee will reject this proposal to take the business out of the hands of the Government. The budget is a definite and considered statement of the policy of the Government, and I am satisfied that, when it is put into operation it will meet with the approval of the majority of the people. Mr E. EILEY (South Sydney) [4.9] - The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) has been engaged in throwing a smoke screen about the issue raised by the amendment .before the committee. We can imagine how jubilant the old and in valid people will be when they read the Treasurer's, speech about producing wealth and keeping the wheels of industry going. The Governor General's Speech contained the announcement that the Government intended to increase the old-age and invalid pension. Honourable members on this side were pleased with that announcement, and say, "" Why not do it now VI f the Government is sincere, the Prime Minister has' an opportunity to assure the committee that a bill for the payment of the increased pension will be introduced within a week or a fortnight. No such assurance has been given: in stead, the Treasurer has made a rambling, statement about what the present Government has done, and what the Labour party did. The only issue before the committee is whether or not the old-age pensioners are to get an increased payment immediately. If the Government will introduce at once a bill for the payment of £ 1 per week, honourable members on this side will unanimously support it . We have no desire to make political capital out of this subject; our only object is to get the increase paid at the earliest possible date.

But, despite that fact, conthe Labour Government raised the old age pension in 1916. The Treasurer has meanly said that that action was taken only because an election was imminent.

That was slightly amended, at the subgestion, I think, of the present hchorable member for Kennedy (Mr C. MCDonald). At page 9352 will be found the following statement:Question, as amended, resolved in the uflirmative. ItesolvcdThat, whereas the electors have thrice returned a largo majority of members of the Commonwealth Parliament pledged to provide a Federal system of old-age pensions, and whereas the Statu Parliaments of Queensland, Soutli Australia, AVestern Australia, and Tasmania have made no provision for the payment of old-age pensions, this House is of opinion that the passing of a measure to give effect to the expressed will of the people is an urgent public duty; and further, this House is of opinion that the Government should take steps towards giving effect to such expressed will of the people during this session. Those quotations show the power that was behind the throne, and was responsible for the placing of old-age pensions legislation on the statute-book of Australia. At nearly every turn in the corridors of this house, Mr Deakin was informed that, whatever the consequences might be to his government, the Labour party would no longer support him unless he passed that legislation. Mr BBEKNAJ.;'- Does the honourable member remember the phrase, "" Yes, Mr. Watson""? Mr Fenton' -1 "" do not wish to say anything disrespectful of the late Sir George Reid, but the older members of this House can never forget the gibes that, day after day, he threw at the Deakin party from the Opposition bench. How well he caricatured the then Leader of the Government with his "" Yes, Mr Watson "" ! He kept the members of the Government on the gridiron day after day, because they had to do the bidding of the Labour party if they wished to retain office. You, Mr Chairman, were a strong supporter of Mr. Fisher in those days, and you assisted him, by voice and vote, to pass the Old-age Pensions Bill motion, which never would have been passed but, for /the pressure that was exerted by the Labour party. Yet we have all this camouflage from the Treasurer, this late arrival in the political arena of Australia, this man who, whenever he quotes history, somehow manages to misread it ! If he correctly quoted the history of old-age pensions legislation he could not refrain from giving credit to the Labour party. I am extremely glad that he opposed the amendment, because it has given us an opportunity to turn up the records and show truthfully the genesis of old-age pensions legislation and its parliamentary history. The resolutions that I have quoted will play a part in the campaign that is to be embarked upon very shortly. If the younger generation do not remember what was done in the days of Andrew Fisher, the present day Labour party, which is the rightf ul inheritor of the best traditions of the old Labour party, will tell them. I could quote numbers of speeches of a similar character. Regarding finance, I point out that, by establishing the Commonwealth Bank and taking over the note issue, the Labour party has proved its ability to conduct the finances of the country on a sound basis. Mr E. RILEY - The profits from the note issue are greater than the amount paid in pensions.",28
65,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Si r Joseph Cook, who, when Treasurer, was confronted with the necessity for redeeming a loan of nearly £8,000,000, was greatly relieved when informed by an official that there would be no difficulty in redeeming"" the loan, because the accumulated funds in connection with the note issue would meet the liability. The present Treasurer, if he lived to be as old as Methuselah, could not do what the Labour party has done in matters of finance. He must now regret that he has raisedthis question. If the motion moved by a member of the Labour party in 1923 had been carried, the old-age pensioners, in the time that has intervened since then, would have received £1,200,000 more than has actually been paid to them. In 1910, when a Labour government assumed office, the number of old-age pensioners was 65,000. There were then no invalid pensioners; but. in 1911 that government brought into operation the sections of the act which provided for invalid pensions, and, in addition, liberalized the conditions; with the result that the number of pensioners increased to 75,502 in the following year. In. 1918, the number of persons enjoying the provisions of that beneficent legislation was 79,912. The Treasurer, in purporting to give the history of old-age pensions, was not manly enough to state the facts. He purposely evaded all reference to the action of the Labour party in bringing into operation those sections of the act dealing with invalid pensions. Fair-minded men who know the facts, although politically opposed to the agree Labour party, give that party credit the introduction of a scheme to provide for old-age pensions, because they know that the resolution making it mandatory for the Deakin Government to bring in the scheme could not have beencarried without the support of the Labour party. Tho present Treasurer, who is a new arrival in the political arena, is a pigmy compared with Andrew Fisher. What right has he to criticize the attitude Labour party towards pensions? I do not say that all honourable members opposite are opposed to fair treatment being meted out to old-age pensioners: but when the Treasurer speaks in the 3train in which he has done on this occasion, it time that the facts were made known. the day. The Treasurer has told half-truths only, which, it is generally agreed, are worse than lies. Why did he omit all refernot enco to the motion moved by Mr Andrew Fisher, the then Leader of the Labour party, which made necessary the intropermanent duction of a scheme to provide for oldDoes age pensions? Unless honourable mem-, bers opposite are desirous that the penpensioners of their pensions? sioners shall, for an even longer period, be deprived of the additional pension, they should vote for the amendment.",29

74,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"The honourable member knows that the original meaning of is not necessarily their meaning today. Some people call the maternity allowance a '''baby bonus,"" and others a "" bangle bonus "" ; but the proper name it is a maternity allowance. Thousands of women have been thankful that the Fisher Government provided that allowance. Hansard is a true record of the actions of the Government, and extracts from its volumes, attractively reprinted in a form that those who run will be able to read, will be circulated among the people, so that they will learn from official records whom to thank for the invalid and old-age pensions. Mr E. GEEEN (Richmond) [4.47] The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Eenton) asked for a new name for old-age pensions. I suggest the term used by the Royal Commission on National Insurance- "" Superannuation benefits."" The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) said that the Treasurer had attempted to draw a smokescreen across the real issue, but what the. Treasurer actually did was to rend the veil of lying, misrepresentation, and hypocrisy that has characterized this debate. I can describe some of the speeches I have heard this afternoon in no other terms. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), who moved the amendment, said he would like to see an election every year, so that the invalid old-age pensioners could get an increase in their pensions every year. afraid that he is only acting up to the creed of his party by making promises in the hope of gaining votes at the forthcoming election. The action of his party in 1916 was similar to his action today. His promises to the invalid and old-age pensionersare made with the object of inducing them to vote for him and his party. Promises are easy to make, but difficult to fulfil. The "" sob stuff "" we heard when the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) turned on the sentimental tap towards the end of his speech is further corroboration of what I say. He and other members of his party have said the same thing in different words. The Royal Commission on National Insurance, in the course of its inquiries into superannuation benefits, ascertained that of the people born in Australia 50 per cent, reached the age of 65 years, and of that 50 per cent. 32 per cent, became claimants for the old-age pension. Those figures should give every honourable member cause for deep thought. Of the total number of people born in Australia, one in six becomes a claimant for the old-age pension. Of those Australian-born, who reach the age of 65 years, one in three becomes a claimant. That is a very bad state of affairs, for which we should seek an explanation. No doubt the ordinary ills to which human flesh is heir are .responsible for it to some extent, and another explanation is to be found in adverse circumstances, over which people have no control. Either or both of those causes prevent them from earning sufficient during their life-time to make provision for their old age. But leaving out of account the causes over which individuals have no control, there remain other causes which are capable of being if not abolished, at least ameliorated. I shall refer to some of them. Two of them affect the policy of the trade unions of this country. The trade unions, by refusing to allow a man to do piecework, restrict his earning capacity, and consequently his ability to make provision for his old age. That policy tends to keep men on the basic wage all their lives, and to prevent them from putting anything by for a rainy day. The man and on the basic wage can make some provision for doctor's expenses, but he has I am very little opportunity, even with good luck, of providing for his later years. The restriction imposed by the unions on a man's earning capacity contributes to the large number of claimants for old age pensions. Another factor is the restriction placed on apprenticeship. The royal commission is at present taking evidence in public on unemployment, and I am not disclosing a secret when I say which that unemployment occurs mainly among the unskilled workers. By restricting apprenticeship the unions limit the number of skilled workers, and thus increase the number of unskilled workers, from which class the bulk of the unemployed come. The unemployment that is forced upon the unskilled worker decreases his earnings and lessens his chance of making provision for his old age. I am not now discussing the rights and wrongs of the policy of the unions; I am merely pointing out the effect of it. There is another factor, however, the wisdom of which I shall discuss. The earning capacity of the workers is seriously curtailed when they are forced out of employment by strikes. For most strikes members of the Labour party are to a large extent deliberately responsible, and I - make that statement fully knowing the meaning of it. There have been some industrial disturbances recently in Australia. Five gentlemen in New South Wales-the Premier of the State, two Cabinet Ministers, Messrs Willis and Baddeley, and the president and vice-president of the Australian Labour party, Messrs. Tyrrell and M'agrath-ar e directors of the Labour Daily newspaper. The managing director of that journal and his co-directors are largely responsible for its policy, and in that newspaper they have been deliberately fomenting strikes for some months past. MT.

76,Mr R GREEN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"I am dealing with the question of old-age pensions, and I said I would link up the remarks I was making with that question. I do so in this way: Strikes prevent a man from saving, and as a result he is unable to make adequate provision for the evening of his life, and is obliged to call upon the Government for assistance. That is why the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was passed, and why such pensions are deemed to be necessary. I think, in the circumstances, it must be admitted that my remarks have been relevant to the question before the Chair. .As a result of the strikes fomented by the Labour Daily, aided by its managing director and four other directors, of New South Wales",32

79,Mr R GREEN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"I am sorry, sir, if , in your opinion, I wandered from the question before the Chair, but the interference of honourable members opposite shows how unpalatable to them is a statement of the truth in this matter. They claim to be great sticklers for the truth, but when they are faced with it in this connection we find them howling as a dog does when it is kicked. I still hold the opinion which I expressed two years ago, when a proposal was under consideration for the increase of the invalid and old age pension from 15s. to 17s. 6d. per week. I then said that old people had a right to look to their children for a certain amount of help. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act lays it down quite distinctly that an invalid child must be supported by its parents if they are in a position to do so. There have been very strange interpretations of that provision. A case came under my notice of parents who were nearly 70 years of age being called upon to support a man 42 years of age because he was their ""child."" Parliament, in passing the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act, recognized that parents owe a duty to their children, and I ask Parliament to recognize also that children owe a duty to their-parents. I should like to correct an impression which has gone abroad, and under which the Leader of the Opposition appears to labour, that the Royal Commission on National Insurance distinctly reported that the Government should pay an old age pension of f l per week. The commission did nothing of the sort. At page 23 of the report of the commission upon which the Government is acting, to a certain extent, under the heading of "" Superannuation Benefits,"" the commissioners sayYour commissioners recommend that superaiumation benefit of 20s. per week be payable to male insured members after attainment of age 65, and to female insured members after attainment of age CO. I particularly draw attention to the words "" insured members."" The commission recommends compulsory national insurance, and sets out in its report a scale drawn up by the Commonwealth Statistician of contributions from the age of entry to the payment of superannuation benefit. According to this scale the contributions for males at age 16 years should be 9.4d. per week, and at the age of 45 years should be 4s. 7.8d. to secure a superannuation benefit of 20s. per week at 65 years of age. For females to secure a superannuation benefit of 20s. per week at 60 years of age the contribution proposed is Is. 7.3d. at 16 years of age and 10s. 8.4d. at 45 years of age.",32

83,Mr R GREEN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"The superannuation benefits recommended by the commission are linked up with quite a number of matters, such as casual sickness, and so on. I need not refer to them in detail, as the report of the commission is available to honourable members, and I have no doubt that the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) has read it witli great interest. The Government has promised that a comprehensive scheme of national insurance will be brought down during the present session providing for superannuation benefits, casual sickness, accident insurance, and various other matters dealt with' by the commission. In my opinion, the Government is doing right in proposing to include the invalid and old-age pensions in a bill to give effect to a comprehensive scheme of national insurance.",33
84,Dr MALONEY,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Melbourne) [5.9] - I shall not endeavour to traverse the arguments of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, because I do not think an angel from heaven could do so. It has been my privilege to be connected with every measure introduced in the Victorian Parliament and in the Federal Parliament pertaining to the question now under consideration. History, will show that there would never have been an Old-age Pensions Act passed if it had not been for the driving force of the Labour party. I was glad to hear the Minister make that admission in connection with the invalid and old age pensions. I suggest to the Government that in considering an amendment of the existing act, it should see that it is absolutely idiotic to provide that an old person who has saved £310, and has that amount in cash, is not entitled to an old-age pension, whilst an old person who has a home worth - £5,000 can draw the full pension provided he does not let rooms at a rate which will earn for him more than 12s. 6d. per week. I suggest that men who have reached the age of 65 years, and women who have reached the age of 60 years, should be permitted to draw the f u ll pension, even though they may be millionaires. Such a provision would remove the stigma of poverty that formerly was hurled by the forerunners of honourable members on the Government side at persons who accepted the old-age pension. The office in which I meet my constituents every day of the week, except Sunday, is directly opposite an office in which old-age pensions are paid. If I walk up the street on the side of the office in which the pensions are paid, numbers' of men and women ask me when they are to receive the increase in their pensions. As an old politician, I may remind the Government that the party responsible for the increase of the pensions will be given a great deal of credit by the people. Honourable members will remember that when a division was taken on the proposal to increase the invalid and old-age pensions last year the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Sir Austin Chapman) voted 1 against his pledge and his. convictions, because he was a supporter of the Government. Subsequently, he gave notice of a motion proposing an increase in the pension, possibly in order to prevent others from submitting such a motion. As soon as the honourable member gave notice of that motion I was inundated with letters from, all parts of Australia asking me to give him my support. I did not like to reply that the honourable member when he had the opportunity of increasing the pension voted against an increase. If the people had the power, as they should have, of recalling "" Bill "" Maloney, General Ryrie, or any other member of this House who has broken a pledge, honourable members would think very seriously before they voted against their pledges and convictions. I ask the Government for the sake of the old people, and to fulfil the hopes that have been raised, to bring in a measure to provide for the proposed increase in the invalid and old-age pension. I am satisfied that if the Treasurer would undertake to do so at once the Leader of the Opposition would be prepared to withdraw his amendment.",33

86,Dr MALONEY,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"The Treasurer will see that the adoption of the course I suggest would save time. A bill introduced for the first time in Australia to give effect to a national system of in -' surance must give rise to great debate, and take a long time to pass. The Government should in this matter take time by the forelock, accept my suggestion, and enable old men and women in the Commonwealth to receive immediately a little more than the pittance they are now getting.",34
87,Mr OKEEFE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Denison) [5.15] It is not my intention to argue as to was originally responsible for the introducpension. tion of the invalid and old-age pensions. but It is generally known throughout Ausfor tralia, and was clearly shown in the excelto lent speeches made by the honourable memresidence ber for Yarra (Mr Scullin) and the orable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton), that, although the Labour party did not actually introduce the pensions guards under the act. scheme, it compelled a Liberal Governwoman, ment to do so. I was a' member of this New Zealand to earn her living. Parliament at that time, and I know perlived fectly well that the Labour party - told the Government then in power that unless it introduced a scheme of Federal invalid and old-age pensions it would be thrown out of office. I was glad to hear the Treasurer admit, when the honourable member for Yarra was speaking, that the payment of the invalid pension was entirely due to the Labour party. It is not widely known that al- \is though the original Invalid and Old-age country respecting Pensions Act provided for the immediate payment of the old-age pension, the invalid pension was not to be paid until a date to be proclaimed. act was, therefore, absolutely useless to our infirm people.. The Labour party was returned to power in 1910, and took immediate steps to pay the in valid pension. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that quite a number of anomalies under the act should 'be removed. W it h in the last few years I have come into contact with a number of oldand age pensioners in hospitals. ""While receivstantly ing the benefits of those institutions, their pensions are stopped, with the exception a paltry pittance of 3s. a week. Only payment recently If o u n d in a hospital on west coast of Tasmania, an invalid penrecommendations sioner who, before becoming an invalid, had spent most of his life in the out-back country prospecting and trying to develop our mineral areas. Through no f a u l t of his own he is now in hospital receiving the invalid pension. He has no relatives in the district, and consequently is given no luxuries such as tobacco, f r u it , or, at times,' a little alcoholic stimulant. If i such a case as this the invalid pensioner receives 3s. a week, and the hospital 10s. a week. There is, consequently, a saving of 4s. 6d. a week effected by the department for each individual so situated. I do not think that that was intended. Several cases have been brought under my notice of aged and invalid persons who are who not receiving the old-age and invalid They are Australian-born, because they left this country two or three years and then returned it , their continuity of twenty years' i u Australia has been broken, honand they are therefore denied a pension. I admit that these are difficult cases to deal with, because there must be safeI n one case a a native of Tasmania, went to She there for about three years aud then returned to Tasmania. She was refused an invalid pension because the doctor who examined her declared that on the evidence before him her invalidity had its source in New Zealand. In view of the fact that New Zealand has an old-age and invalid pension scheme in operation, and that similar cases of hardship may occur there, it would be an excellent thing for to have reciprocity with that the payment . of old-age and invalid pensions. I should like the Treasurer to consider that suggestion. The Leader of the Opposition The stated definitely that he would withdraw his amendment if the Government would promise to pay the increased pension within a week or two. The Labour party is, - therefore, not viewing this matter from a party aspect. Ever since the announcement was made in the'press that the Government intended to increase the old-age invalid pensions, we have been conasked by pensioners when the in crease will be paid. It is a bitter disof appointment to them to find out that the is to be delayed u n t i l such time the as the Government can give effect to the of the royal commission t on national insurance. If the Government is sincere, it should accede to the request of the Leader of the Opposition.",34

90,Mr FORDE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Capricornia) [5.51] The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) providing for the payment of a pension of f l pei"" week from the 15th of this month deserves the support of all honourable members. That reform is long overdue, but the Government would not have made any move to give effect to it had it not been for the strong advocacy of honourable members on this side. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) said that parents should look to their children for support in their old age. What chance has any married man, to support his parents if he is earning; say, the Victorian basic wage of £3 18s:, and' having a wife and four children 1 It is quite possible that he pays f l per week for rent, and there is left £2 18s. to provide food and clothing for - six people, in addition to schooling for the children, and medical expenses^ for which, even if he belongs to a lodge, he must contribute ahout 2s. per week. In those circumstances a man cannot reasonably be called upon to maintain his parents. He has only 9s. 6d'. per week each for the six members of his family. It is the duty of the Government to provide an adequate pension, for the old people who in their younger days pioneered the Commonwealth, and did their best, when working for a weekly wage, to rear a family. It was impossible for them to put sufficient aside to keep them ' in their old age. The honourable member for Darwin (Mr Whitsitt) said that he would not vo.te for the amendment, the effect of which, if carried, he said, would be to take the business out of the hands of the Government. The honourable member could not have been sincere in that objection, because in the Tasmanian Parliament, and in this House, he has often voted independently, and if he honestly desired to give relief to the old-age pensioners he would not be deterred by the consideration he mentioned, from voting with the Leader of the Opposition. It is all very well for the Treasurer to offer excuses for further delaying this reform. What Governments did eight, ten, or twelve years ago is not pertinent to the issue. Having entered this House at the last general election, I am concerned only with the present. Since I have been a member of the House, Government members have on three occasions voted against amendments moved by honourable members on this side to increase the old-age pension. No election was impending then, 'and Ministers thought that if they granted an increase it would be forgotten by the old people before pollingday came, but if they deferred the relief until the eve of the election they could use it as a political stunt. The promised increase,' like many other reforms introduced by Conservative Governments, haa been forced from the Ministry by the Labour party. On the 10th August, 1923, the honourable member for Reid (Mr . Coleman) moved that the old-age pension be increased to £ 1 per week, and he supported the motion with a very eloquent appeal. Ministerial members, with a few exceptions, whose conduct was explained by the Leader of the Opposition, voted against the motion. Later in the same year the Leader of the Opposition moved that the pension be increased to £ 1 per week, and again honourable members opposite voted against the On the 10th September last I moved that the pension be £ 1 per week, but could get no help from Ministerial supporters. All the Labour members voted for my amendment. Yet the Labour party is charged with not having done its duty towards the old-age pensioners. On the 8th August, 1923, the honourable member for Boothby (Mr . Duncan-Hughes) said I come now to my second point, which is to the effect that our financial position does not justify an increase in these pensions at the present time. It is an easy matter to increase the old-age pension, or any other pension, but it is a very much more difficult business to take off the increase granted. I do not think any one will deny that once we make an increase in the old-age pension it will be about the last thing that will be taken off - It would be taken off only in a caBe of extreme, financial stringency. therefore wish honourable members would take into very careful consideration any proposal to increase the existing pension, realizing it must bo a permanent increase, and not one that can be taken off at any time. Honourable members should realise, also, that if an increase is given, we are likely to go further in the future. Honourable members opposite arc already in favour of an increase of 2s. 6d. in advance of the increase proposed by the Government. . . . This increase is likely to lead to further increases; Indeed, it grettable encouragement to them. The honourable member for Boothby had the courage to express an opinion which is held by other honourable members on the Government side. I wonder what the old-age pensioners and their relatives in the Boothby district will say to the honourable member at the next Election. Honourable members on this side of the House have consistently advocated the increase of the pensions to £ 1 per week. It was one of the prominent features of our policy before the last Federal erections, and had we been returned to power the larger payment would have been paid to the old people immediately. The Trea2197 surer may argue as he pleases about what happened ten or fifteen years ago, but he knows that but for the conditional support given in 1908 by the Labour party to the Government of the day, in valid and old-age pensions would not have been introduced until some years later. Honourable members opposite often assert that the Labour members who supported the Hughes Government years ago were very much superior to the members of the Labour party today. But in connection with the matter of old-age penincrease. sions, Government supporters seek to year, protect themselves by quoting the sins of omission of the Labour party of the Hughes period. The present Labour party cannot justly be blamed for any short-comings of the Hughes Government. The Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act requires liberalization in many ways, and if the Government will introduce within the next fortnight an amending measure, it will be given by honourable members on this side a quick passage. The conditions governing the payment of old-age pensions should be made less harsh. For instance, there are in my district a number of invalid pensioners who, finding it impossible to live on 17s. 6d. per week, take a job for a few weeks in order to earn money for the purchase of clothing and other necessaries. Because of that, their pension is discontinued I on the ground that they are not totally or permanently incapacitated. The act should be so amended as to allow a penthat sioner to earn a good deal more than the l i m it now prescribed. The same argument applies to the old-age pensioners. It is difficult to understand how the old people can live on 17s. 6d. a week. They cannot out of that amount provide themselves with clothing, and they almost in Is a re- variably depend upon relatives and charitable neighbours for assistanoe. Sometimes they have to take a job in order to earn a few pounds for the purchase of clothing, and for that their pension is either stopped or considerably reduced. They are allowed to earn up to 12s. 6d. per week, which, with a pension of 17s. 6d., makes their maximum income 30s. per week. If they earn more than 12s. 6d. per week, their pension is reduced proportionately. The act should be more generously.administered, so that they may be able to earn a f a ir income for at least a couple of months in the year in order to provide themselves with clothing for the winter.  allowed to earn twice as much.",35
91,Mr FORDE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"A married man is allowed to earn. 25s. per week, in addition to the pension drawn by himself and his wife. In that respeot, also, the law requires liberalization. At present, a person must have resided five years in Australia before he is eligible for an invalid pension. I know a number of very deserving people who, after coming to Australia, were stricken down either by disease or through accident. They are unable to earn a livelihood, and because they have not been here for five years, they cannot obtain an irvalid pension. That is a wrong policy. The Government should reduce t-br period from five to say, three years. No man or woman can receive the old-age pension unless he or she has been in Australia for twenty years. There are persons with whom I am acquainted who have been here for anything from ten to fifteen years, but are unable - to obtain a pension. They have no one to whom they may go for sustenance, and they appeal to the Government in vain. A burning grievance is the small amount that is paid to those who are compelled to go into charitable institutions. The institution receives 10s. 6d. a week, whilst the pensioner is given only 3s., the Government retaining the balance of 4s. The Government should not benefit by the fact that a pensioner finds it necessary to become an inmate of an institution. The same procedure is adopted when a pensioner enters a hospital. If the amount paid in these circumstances were raised to 7s. a week, these people would be able to purchase necessaries which would enable them to have some degree of comfort when they left the institution. The secretary of the Rockhampton Benevolent Asylum has written to the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) complaining that the Government's allowance is altogether inadequate, and pointing out that the maintenance of these old people costs the institution 15s. a week. Government has turned a deaf ear to the plea that it should assist the philanthropic body of women who are conducting that institution. A visit was paid to it by the Treasurer during his tour of Queensland, and he is seemed to be favourably impressed with what he saw, but he has not since taken any action to lighten the burden that is cast on Mrs Woolcock, the president, and the committee, who are carrying on a noble work. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) is doing a great service for the old people when he endeavours to have the increase made available immediately. The Government would act with promptitude if it were dealing with a highly-paid public servant, like the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth. ""We know what happened when Sir Samuel Griffith was retired. A pension of £1,500 was paid to him without delay. Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, as a member of the Executive Council of Victoria, also enjoyed a pension. We know that Victorian judges have been given pensions amounting to £1,500 per annum, and have lived in England for the remainder of their days. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) opposed the granting of a pension to Sir Samuel Griffith - I ask him now to show his sympathy for the aged people by voting for the amendment. Every week that passes increases the difficulty of the pensioners, who are striving to make ends meet on a mere pittance of 17s. 6d. a week. If the Government wishes to prove its sincerity it . will make the payment retrospective to the beginning of the financial year; that is, from the 1st of July. Honourable members cannot realise the hardships of these old people, or they would support the amendment. It is of no use to hold out a promise, like a bunch of carrots, on the eve of an election, and say, "" If you vote for us you will get the increase."" What is wanted is, not a torrent of words such as we heard from the Treasurer this afternoon, but definite action such as that asked for by the Leader of the Opposition. If the Treasurer wishes to prove that he did not make this promise on the eve of an election for vote-catching purposes, let him make the payment applicable from the 1st July, or, at the latest, The the 15th September. This increase is long overdue,. and it has been promised now only because of the consistent advocacy ofhonorable members on this side, who have continually urged that more generous consideration should be shown to the old people of Australia.",37
92,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Lang) [6.58]. - I have listened with interest to the speeches of honourable members of the Opposition. Whilst they claim to have practically a monopoly of humanitarian feeling, it is a remarkable fact that the Pensions Act was not introduced by the Labour party, the rate was not increased by the Labour party, and no material advantage was received by old-age pensioners during Labour's occupancy of the Treasury bench that was not originated by our party. Mr Andrew Pisher and the members of the Labour party maintained an absolute silence for seven years, during which Australia practically had money to burn, as it was not expending anything approaching to the amount that it was collecting, and was returning to the States very much more than they were entitled to receive. During those years no mention of old-age pensions was made by any member of the Labour party, nor was the Labour party in office in three of the' States concerning itself in the slightest degree with the matter. Honourable members who were in this House at the time will, perhaps, recollect. that Mr . Pisher suddenly sprang a motion upon honourable members when Mr Deakin was Prime Minister. He moved that the question of the payment of old-age pensions should be taken into consideration by the Government as an urgent matter. Mr Wilks, then member for Dalley, with the concurrence of the Opposition, which comprised members of the L i beral party, supported the proposal, and wanted the scheme brought down at once. He moved an amendment providing that the Government should, without delay, introduce a bill to give effect to the proposal. The majority of the Labour party, including its leader (Mr Eisher), voted against that amendment. Whenever the pension has been raised, or other advantages have been given, those responsible have not been confined tomembers of the Labour party, but the opponents of that party have done most in the direction of treating pensioners more liberally.",38
93,Mr FORDE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"What about the increase of 2s. <kl. a week in 1916? Was not the Labour party also responsible, in the first place, for the payment of the invalid pension? 3hE LLIOT JOHNSON - The truth is tiwt there is no party opposed to the pensions. If honourable members w i ll turn to Kansawd, page 9140, they will find the report of a debate relating to the position of hospitals. Mr . Higgs was then . Treasurer in a Labour Government. Mr Rodgers, the then member for Wannon, drew attention to the disabilities under whioh old-age pensioners laboured when they were compelled to enter a hospital. Replying to Mr . Rodgers, Mr Higgs stated that financial considerations prevented the Government from placing hospitals in the same position' as benevolent asylums. That, from a Treasurer's point of view, was a perfectly legitimate argument, which, no doubt, other Treasurers have since found it necessary to use when increases have been proposed. Mr Rodgers askedWill the Treasurer, under the bill, place hospitals in the same position, as benevolent asylums, for, if so, any objection I have is removed? At .present hospitals are the repository for old-age pensioners just at the very time they require most assistance; and it is proposed to compromise the inatter by giving each pensioner 2s., leaving the hospital high and diy. There are many hospitals, for example, in old mining districts, that cannot be conducted without assistance. Dr Maloney. a member of the Labour party, supported Mr Rodgers's proposal, and ultimately it was agreed to. That liberalization of the old-age pension was due, not to the action of any member of the Labour party, but to one who sat in opposition. Mr Rodgers later saidUnder section 45 of the act, if a pensioner becomes an inmate of an asylum for the insane or of a hospital, his pension is suspended. When he is discharged the payment of the pension is resumed, and he is entitled to four weeks' instalment of pension in respect of a period of suspension if that period has continued for four weeks. Under another provision, a magistrate may commit a pensioner to an institution, in which case the institution benefits. Further on in the speech he saidOur public hospitals are kept going only through the efforts of those who undertake their management without charge, and are Supported by public contributions and small State subsidies. What I ask is that hospitals may he placed in the same position as benevolent iisylums. He moved the following amendment:Provided that, out of the amounts so suspended and not paid to the pensioner by this section, a sum equal to 10B. 6d. per week shall be paid to the treasurer of any hospital in which such pensioner was an inmate, for the term during which the pension was not paid to the pensioner.. That amendment of the Liberal member was agreed to . I then moved an amendment dealing with another aspect of the question, with which I am still in sympathy.. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has contended that the pensioners should be allowed to supplement their pension to a greater extent than is now permitted, by the amounts which they earn. When I made a similar proposal to a Labour Treasurer (Mr Higgs), he and his party opposed iti n 1916, after I had actually carried it , and they struck it out. A pension should not be regarded as a charitable dole, but as a recognition of good, service f a it h full y rendered. I when the cost of livin g was not so great as at present, in order to overcome the difficulties under which the pensioners were then labouring, I movedThat the following new clause, to clause 7, be inserted:-""Notwithstandin g anyLiberal party thing contained in this act, persons in receipt of pensions shall be entitled to supplement facts. their income by earnings up to £52 per annum without being subject to any deductions in the pension paid. That amendment was agreed to ; but Higgs, the Labour Treasurer, recomnothing mitted the clause, and the Labour party the committee. voted against it , and struck it out. sire to emphasize that it was not moved a member of the Labour party, but by member of the party to which honourable members opposite, for political purposes, have frequently referred as being com Sir posed of men without bowels of compasshould sion or humanitarian instincts.

The time has arrived, not only for an increase of the pension and of the amount the pensioners may earn without any portion of their pension being liable to forfeiture, but for the maximum amount which they are permitted to have on posit in a bank, or invested in property, to be increased also. A f t e people have not a great many years left, and their earning capacity cannot be Sir Elliot Johnson. great. We should make their declining years as comfortable as possible, and not regard them as objects of .charity. Their savings bank deposits are in most cases the result of t h r if t , or the proceeds of the sale of some small property which they at one time held. Generally, the principal sums are small, and the interest received insufficient for their requirements. They therefore require the assistance which the pension provides, as otherwise - they have to draw on their principal, which soon becomes depleted. I hope that the Treasurer will give serious consideration to this aspect of the question, and see if it may not be possible to amend the act n 1916, during this session, to grant some measure of relief along the lines indicated.",38

These forms trouble them a great deal, deas many of them are unable to read. In one day recently in Ballarat I filled in r all, these, 150 of these papers.

Moreover, their signatures must be witnessesd by a member of Parliament or a justice of the peace. should not be necessary. I believe that by using these forms, instead of gaining money, the department is losing revenue, because a big clerical staff must be required to deal - with them. One of the questions which has to be answered is whether the pensioner owns his home. In one case which came under my notice, in stead of writing the word "" No "" in the space provided, the pensioner drew a stroke. The form was returned, with a blue pencil direction that the question was to be answered "" Yes "" or "" No . "" In many cases pensioners receive 15s. per week only,, instead of 17s. 6d. While 1 make these criticisms, I think that every honourable member will agree that the department administering the invalid and old-age pensions legislation is the most sympathetically administered department in Australia. The magistrates when dealing with applicants treat them as citizens worthy of respect and consideration. There is only one thing in connection with these examinations which, in my opinion, should be altered. Ballarat the pensioners are quired to attend at the court. I admit that the examination is in private, but many of the applicants have never previously been inside a police court, and they object to being examined in a police court building. There are anomalies also regarding the amount paid to the hospitals in respect to pensioner inmates. In one hospital in my constituency I found that the 3s. which was supposed to have been paid to the pensioners had not been paid to. them, but had been retained by someone else or paid into the hospital funds. In this connection I should like to say that I regard the present payment of 10s. 6d. per week to the hospitals as altogether too small. It is not sufficient to maintain a patient while in the institution. Moreover, it is not right that the Government should save 4s. a week because a pensioner is unfortunate enough to require treatment in an institution. While there are scores of anomalies in connection with the working of the Act , I hope that the Treasurer will rectify those which have been mentioned. Payments for incapacitation should be made on a different basis. At present a man may be totally incapacitated for a period of six months, and be unable to earn a penny; but because he is not permanently disabled the That doctors cannot certify to that effect, and he therefore is not entitled under the existing law to a pension. Probably this anomaly will be rectified in a bill to deal with national insurance.",40

100,Mr MCGRATH,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"I suggest tb the Treasurer that he agree to the amendment without a vote being taken. Let him take all the credit foi* the increase, especially in view of the approaching elections. In my constituency there is a great deal of poverty. The old-age pensioners, with their 17s. 6d. a week, have not been able, this winter, to buy firewood. Many of them have to pay from 6s. to 8s. rent a week, and how can. they possibly buy the necessaries of l if e on the remaining 9s. 6d.? The winter has not passed yet, and there are in Australia many colder places than Melbourne, where firewood is an essential. I appeal to honourable members opposite to accept the suggestion of my leader, to pay the in ereases forthwith, and to go to the electors In with that to their credit. My attitude is renot dictated by a desire to gain votes, police but by the knowledge that people are suffering distress,, that they have not sufficient clothes, and that they are unable to buy fuel and the necessaries of l if e . Australia is probably one of the most prosperous parts of the Empire, and surely no one is content that old-age pensioners, some of whom, were the pioneers of this country, are denied the necessaries of life.

My understanding of parliamentary procedure is that the defeat of a government on a money bill is tantamount to a vote of no confidence. Therefore, if the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition is carried, the Government must resign, ancl the subsequent delays that would take place would probably mean the postponement for a considerable time of the payment of the larger pensions.",41

I submit this amendment as aprotest against the action of the Government in appointing Mr J. J. Garvan a director of the Commonwealth Bank, having regard to the fact that (1) Mr Garvan was at the time of his appointment as director also managing director and chief shareholder of the Mutual L i fe and Citizens Assurance Company Limited , which was The then a borrower from the bank; (2) that preferential treatment was accorded to Mr Garvan through his company, in that it was given an overdraft for an extended term at a lower rate of interest than that 10 applicable to ordinary customers of the bank: (3) that the appointment was out of harmony with the relevant provisions of the Commonwealth Bank Act, and the well-established principles governing the conditions of persons in the employ of the Crown. I base my amendment on the reply. I received to certain questions I asked the Treasurer. On the 20th August I asked the Treasurer the following questions :-=1. Whether it is a fact that the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance - Company Limited, of which Mr J. J. Grarvan, chairman of directors of the Couunonwealth Bank, is managing director ancl chief shareholder, obtained an overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank of approximately £2,000,000 at the low rate of 5 per cent, at a time when ordinary bank customers were being charged 7 per cent. ? 2. If so, why has this apparently favoured treatment been allowed in this instance? The Treasurer replied to this question on the 21st August, by stating that he had telegraphed for the information to the chairman of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and had received the following reply from Mr Love, secretary to the board of directors:Replying to your telegram of today : Under section 15A of the Commonwealth Bank Act, members of the board are prohibited from disclosing the business of the bank or its customers. Mr Grarvan informs us he is furnishing you with a statement. For your informotio'n, advances were made by all banks to enable subscriptions to be made to early war loans at one-half of 1 per cent, less than the rate the loan was floated at. For instance, all banks were advancing to the general public at 4 per cent, to enable subscriptions to be made to the 4£ per cent, loan, and these overdrafts were arranged for eighteen months, or in special cases longer. The general overdraft rate for the Commonwealth Bank was never more than 6 per cent, during the period of the Mutual Life and Citizens subscriptions to the loans. And which I had commenced to read when I was interrupted on a matter of order. . The Treasurer also' stated that he had received the following telegram from Mr John J. Garvan, chairman of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and managing director of the Mutual L if e and Citizens Assurance Company L i m i tedReferring to your telegram to the bank on the subject of Coleman's question, as managing director of the Mutual Life and Citizens, I desire to make the following statement:In 1015, nine years prior to my becoming a director of the bank, the Mutual Life and Citizens made an arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank to overdraw its account to unable it to subscribe to war loans. This arrangement was common to all banks, and all loan subscribers, except that in the case of the Mutual Life and Citizens the amount subscribed has been £12,000,000 sterling, and that' it has involved the appropriation of all the company's accumulations for a period of nearly ten years, during which the company was perforce compelled to abstain from carrying on its ordinary business of lending money. When I joined the board last year the overdraft was £350,000. This amount has since been paid off nnd the bank is indebted to the company in the sum of £50,000. Qn 11th instant the bank was informed that no further accommodation would be required, and that the account would be closed. In connection with that statement. I should like to point out that Mr Garvan. was somewhat evasive in replying to my question, and went to a lot of trouble to explain his transactions with the Commonwealth Bank in his capacity as a director of an insurance company, but he did not answer the question. It is clear, however, from his admissions that the Commonwealth Bank did give an overdraft to the company. Mr Garvan and the bank do not deny that an overdraft was ' allowed to his company at 5 per cent, for interest. Mr Garvan admits that when he joined the Commonwealth Bank Board his company had . an overdraft with the bank of £350,000, at the rate of 5 per cent, when the rate to all other customers of the bank was 6 per cent. It may well be asked: Who is Mr Garvan ? Besides being chairman of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, he is managing director of the Mutual L if e and Citizens Assurance Company Limited. The capital of that company is £200,000, in 200,000 shares of £ 1 each. The shares standing in the name of "" Garvan,""-and held by him jointly with J. W . Power, of England, total 56,850. The market value of those shares at the present time is £ 1 5 each, but they are not obtainable on the exchange because of the profit they yield. Mr Garvan's controlling interests in the company is valued at £852,750. He was a member of the Notes Board from 1920, when he was appointed to the position by the Nationalist Government. Prior to that he was a financial adviser of the Government, and became chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board of Directors by appointment of the Government in 1924. Let me make at this stage the important point that in that capacity he was expected to work in the interests of the Commonwealth Bank and the national currency of Australia, just principle which as the bank in turn is expected "" in the interests of the people of the Combers of this House. monwealth. Amongst the principal obprinciple jectives of the bank are the lowering the rate of interest and the stabilizing exchange. Every one will agree that is so. The gaining of these objecsire to say on this subject. tives is in entire opposition to the business interests of Mr Garvan in capacity as managing director of an infor surance company. I shall elaborate statement at a later stage. I have disin Sydney recently. tinctly stated that I consider Garvan's acceptance of his appoint of. ment as a director of the bank contrary to the law, and the ciples which should govern the conauction, duct of public servants. For the formation of the Treasurer, let me say that the Commonwealth Bank Act, section 17, prescribes that the directors officers of the bank shall not borrow money from it. Let me emphasize the fact that that provision was inserted bill last year by the Treasurer himself. fine, Again,'section 15B of the Commonwealth technical one. Rank Act provides .that a director or officer of any corporation the business which is mainly that of banking shall be capable of appointment as a director of the Commonwealth Sank. The finandirectors cial transactions of Mr Garvan's surance company have been very largely in the nature of banking transactions.

To ensubscriptions to be made to war loans, Every advances were made by the bank subat rates lower than the ordinary bank rate of interest. Those advances were for a period of eighteen months and, Goaccording to Mr Love, secretary of the bank, "" in special cases, longer."" I want and the Treasurer to inform Parliament, and in the public generally, whether there was than one special case in which a priof vate individual or corporation secured preferential treatment in regard to overdrafts, and also in regard to atrates of interest. Every one knows being that advances were made during a limited period of great financial stringency and stress-abou t 1918-whe n the British Empire was on its knees and money to carry on the conflict hard to get. We were taking money out of ordinary economic channels and putting it into war loans, which meant, to a great extent, the starving of our industries of the capital they required. At that time some one conceived the idea of encouraging the citizens to save money and put their savings into loans, and for this purpose Government arranged for overdrafts, for a limited period of eighteen months, at a slightly lower rate of interest than that ordinarily charged. At the end of eighteen months the bank iusisted on the ordinary rate of interest applying to its overdrafts. The preferential treatment in the way of lower rates of interest immediately ceased. Was this done in the case of Mr Garvan's company? I say advisedly Mr Garvan's company, because I have told honourable members of the enormous number of this company's shares which he possesses. He has actually a controlling interest in the Mutual L if e and Citizens Assurance Company, and therefore for my purpose I call it Mr Garvan's company.. In reply to my question it was not denied that Mr Garvan s company received £2,000,000 at 5 per cent, when the bank rate to the ordinary customers was 6 per cent. It was further admitted that this loan was not paid off at the time when Mr Garvan was appointed a. director of the Commonwealth Bank in 1924. He then owed the bank £350,000. This admission I did not expect, but I am duly grateful for it , because it helps to prove my case. In addition the period of his loan at 5 per cent, must, on his own admission, have extended for nearly ten years. As other subscribers were charged the lower rate of interest for eighteen months only, it is obvious that preferential treatment was given to Mr . Garvan's company. The intention of the Commonwealth Bank Act has been violated not only by the appointment as a director of the Commonwealth Bank of one who manages a company and is its principal shareholder, but also by extending to Mr Garvan better treatment than that given to other customers of the bank. The advantage of receiving a loan at 1 per cent, below the ordinary interest rate, when applied to £2,000,000, represents a considerable sum. This concession over ten years would mean £200,000 to the lucky company, and that sum actually represents the total subscribed capital of the company. This comparison takes no account of the advantage of investments in tax-free loans, which show a considerable profit. I have said that the financial transactions of Mr Garvan's company are largely in the war nature of banking transactions. It is the well known that one of the most profitable departments of banking business is dealing in bills of exchange. Banks have made huge profits out of abnormal rates of exchange, which, ""it is hardly necessary for me to say, h it very hard the primary producers and manufacturers of Australia. This allegation against Mr Garvan is all the more serious in the light of the very tragic economic position which faced our country during the year 1923-4. Mr Garvan had huge sums of money to juggle with through the Commonwealth Bank during the exchange block in 1923-4. At that time the banks declared that they had millions of pounds in London, but not enough to finance Australian trade and industry. They paid as much as £102 10s. for every £ 1 0 0 which a customer would lodge in Sydney to purchase a d r a f t payable in London Taking advantage of these conditions Mr . Garvan's company, with accumulated Australian funds, commenced buying exchange on London in hundreds of thousands of pounds. The Commonwealth Bank must have known that Mr Garvan's company could not want those funds in London for the ordinary business purposes of an insurance company, and yet the bank allowed Mr Garvan to use it for the purpose of conveying his credits. At the time Mr Garvan was on the Notes Board, and no immediate measures were taken to relieve the exchange block, although our newspapers were full* of complaints from primary producers, manufacturers, and others, and Australian industry was suffering. Honourable members made many complaints in this Parliament. Mr .Garvan's company profited by the situation, for in the six months from 1st January to 30th June, 1924, the Commonwealth Bank paid it nearly £40,000 in hard cash on these exchange transactions. While Mr Garvan was playing with this money, he owed the bank, on his own admission, hundreds of thousands of pounds, which should have been repaid within eighteen months the time at which it was borrowed. did he not use those funds to discharge his overdraft, and why did not the bank insist upon his doing so? He was borGarvan's rowing money at 5 per cent., and utilizing funds to make 2^ per cent, on every £100 in, say, two months, by manipulaof tion of finance within the bank itself. was anticipated by every one that Garvan would be a member of the Comcontrol, monwealth Bank Board. It was stated in this Parliament that vernment intended to appoint him to the board. In his position on the Board, he understood the economic and financial situation. It can be said that he was in the confidence of the Government, and knew the trend of exchange, the rate and this fact, together with his ripe busisecurities ness experience, enabled him to take advantage of peculiarities in the financial situation that might be missed by others. The screaming farce of the whole ness is that the main banking of Mr Garvan's company was really done at the Bank of New South Wales, and should have carried out change business there. viously, the shrewd men running the private banks would not have rated his exchange .speculations. Commonwealth ""Bank was a good milch cow to him in this instance. It was stated that Mr Garvan's company into the bankers' business in this direction, and made very large profits. vised that in twelve months the company cleared through the Commonwealth a profit on exchange of approximately £100,000. It was not bad business for a Commonwealth Bank. company whose entire subscribed was £200,000. My point, however, that while Mr Garvan's company was in the forturiate position of having sums of money in Australia with which take advantage of the abnormally rates of exchange, it had an from the Commonwealth Bank at cent. Upon that admission, I base principal charge. The other facts subsidiary. Instead of allowing overdraft to continue for nearly ten. years at 5 per cent., the Commonwealth itself could have utilized this money, and to deny that statement. made the profits on the exchange that the company made, or it could have used it Mr Coleman. to assist the struggling primary proof ducers to market their produce, and Why the manufacturers to overcome the economic difficulties brought about by the financial situation. It did neither. Mr . company enjoyed concessions from the bank at the bank's expense, that is, at the people's expense, and as one the financial advisers of the GovernIt ment, and as a member of the Notes Mr Board, Mr Garvan largely influenced the of credit, which, in turn, in freely fluenced the rates of exchange out of the Gowhich his company was making large profits. One thing fits into another. My Notes case is' a matter of logical deduction from the facts. An insurance company depends for its success, to a great extent, on the return received from its investments. Therefore the higher of interest on gilt-edged the greater its profits. full Mr Garvan, as managing director and chief shareholder of the insurance company, naturally desired high rates of in busiterest. All his business interests were business served by high rates of interest. The higher the interest the higher the profit he and the bigger the business. He took his exadvantage of increased* interest rates But, obwhenever opportunity offered, by converting his loan securities. He prided himself toleupon his business acumen in doing so. The On the other hand, Mr Garvan, as chairman of directors of the Commonwealth freely Bank, acting for the Government, which cut is faced with the flotation of huge loans, should endeavour to keep down interest I am ad rates. In this conflict of interests, which side should win and which did win ? One Bank can only be guided by Mr Garvan's actions as chairman of directors of the He certainly is capital only one of the directors, but he is the is man who largely directs the financial policy of the bank, and he, therefore, must aclarge cept responsibility for the actions of the to Board. One of the first actions of the high .Bank Board, almost immediately after overdraft Mr Garvan's appointment to the director5 per ate in October, 1924, when on his own my admission he owed the Commonwealth are Bank £350,000 at 5 per cent., was to that raise the bank's rate of interest to every one else to 7 per cent, as from the 1st Bank January, 1925. I ask the Government The boast that Mr Garvan's company invested £12,000,000 in war loans throws the cloak of patriotism over his transaction. In hia report to the he refers to the profitable character of the war loan investments. Hie prides himself on the fact that these are gilt-edged securities. The various laws regulating insurance companies limit the securities in which they can invest their capital to such as are regarded as gilt-edged. Mr Garvan stated in his report that he had exchanged shortdated tax-free loan scrip, which he took up in the early stages of the war, for loan scrip bearing higher rates of iuteresr. The extent of his patriotism therefore may be seen by a perusal of the company's balance sheet. The dividends and bonuses on a subscribed capita] of £200,000 amounted to £79,968 in 1915, or 40 per cent, on the capital, whilst for the last five years- I quote them because during that period and in the years immediately preceding. Mr Garvan's company had this concession from the Commonwealth Bank-the y were : For the year ended December, 1920, £105,000, equal to 52.5 per cent, on the paid-up capital: 1921, £115,000. or 57.5 per cent.; 1922, £150,000. or 75 per cent.; 1923, £160,000, or 80 p e r ' c e n t . ; and 1924, £160,000, or 80 per cent.",41
108,The CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE, The honourable member's time has expired.,46
109,Mr COLEMAN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"W it h your permission, sir, I shall take my second period now. Other insurance companies, notably, the Australian Mutua l Provident Society, operating under less favourable conditions, invested as much money in. Government loaus as did Mr Garvan's company; therefore, he has no reason to prate about his patriotism in putting all the accumulated"" funds of his company into war loans. Anyhow, what does this business patriotism amount to when compared with the sacrifices which the soldiers made during the great war? Garvan's boast makes one disgusted. I suppose that in accordance with that conception of business and political morality which usually characterizes its answers to the charges made by honourable members on this side, the Government will attempt to explain away the transactions of Mr Garvan witli the Commonwealth Bauk. I anticipate that my action in bringing these facts' before the committee will be deprecated. I could give in adcompany, vance, almost word for word, the speech which the Treasurer will make in reply. Bur the Government cannot escape its responsibility in this matter. Last year, when the Commonwealth Bank Bill was before the House, the Government "" gagged"" honourable members and prevented the discussion of v it a l clauses. The various sections I have been quoting-sectio n 17, which prohibits directors of the bank from borrowing fro m the bank; and section 1 5 B , which excludes from the Commonwealth Bank Board directors of corporations whose business is mainly that of banking-were by the operation of that delightfu l instrument, the guillotine, got through committee without discussion. Some of the facts I have mentioned should' have been known to the Government, because the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey), during the debate on the bill, and subsequently by way of questions, referred to the exchange speculations of the Mutual L if e and Citizens Assurance Company, and specifically mentioned Mr Garvan in his capacity of managing director. The honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) trenchantly criticized the operations of that company and Mr . Garvan, an'd asked whether it was the Government's intention to appoint, 'him to the Commonwealth Bank Board. During the hectic passage of the Bank Bill we had no adequate opportunity for the calm and considered explanation of its various clauses. The only information vouchsafed by the Treasurer was a very long speech dealing with banking in every other country except Australia. Everybody must be convinced that the broad intention of section 17 was to prevent doubtful transactions such as those in which Mr Garvan, as managing director of au insurance company, has engaged. Ordinary common sense would dictate such a precaution, Mr and the Treasurer, in his second-reading speech, s a i d Provision is also made in the bill that directors or officers of the Commonwealth Bank shall not be eligible to receive overdrafts or advances from it. The bill refers merely to "" advances,"" but. the Treasurer's speech elaborated the intention of the Government by mentioning overdrafts also. That section, however, has been absolutely disregarded. The Treasurer also emphasized the fact that section 15B prohibited directors of corporations, whose business was mainly that of banking, from beinfif appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board. A corporation includes a company. Was not the Mutual Life and Citizens surance Company a "" corporation,"" and was not Mr Garvan its managing director, its controlling and the m aster-mind that directed its' administration ? And was he not also the chief shareholder in the company, and as such able by the exercise of his voting strength to direct its policy? If the bill was intended only to prohibit directors of other banks from occupying a seat on the Commonwealth Bank Board, why did the Treasurer add a provision that included the word "" corporation "" ? If the prohibition was intended to apply specifically to bank directors, the section would have said that directors of "" banking corporations"" were prohibited from being appointed to the Commonwealth Bank directorate; but the qualifying word "" banking "" is not in the section, and my interpretation of its meaning is endorsed by legal authorities otter than the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), than whom I know of no one better qualified to express an opinion. The Government cannot plead ignorance, because all the members of the Opposition warned it against handing the bank over to ""big business."" We asserted that the Government was strangling the bank by delivering it, bound hand and foot, to private enterprise. No matter how the Treasurer may attempt to palliate them, my charges are proved conclusively. Viewed even in the most favourable light, the actions of Mr Garvan, in his dual capacity, have been most improper and regardless of those delicate considerations that usually affect transactions involving the probity of Ministers of the Crown and members of Parliament and public servants. Mr Garvan, in reply to my question, admitted by implication the impropriety of his dual position of managing director of an insurance company having an overdraft with the bank and chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, by stating that on the 11th August last, "" The bank was informed that no further accommodation would be required, and that the account would be closed."" Was not that action Mr Coleman. induced by press criticism? It was, apparently, not an uninfluenced action, because on the 15th July, three weeks before Mr Garvan stated that he had intimated that the account would be closed, an attack was made in the Sydney Labour In- daily upon his dual position of managing director of the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company and chairman of the genius, Commonwealth Bank Board. The newspaper strongly criticized the incongruity of Mr Garvan's position, and said, amongst other thingsThe fact is as plain as the noonday sun that those entrusted with the control of the Commonwealth Bank should have no personal interests that rim so palpably contrary to those of tha public. On the 11th August, ten months after Mr. Garvan's appointment to the bank direc-. torate, and three weeks after the publication of that article, he gave notice that the account with the Commonwealth Bank would be closed. All the statements I have made to-night require close investigation. I do not intend to apologize for anything I have said. I have acted in the public interest, because any transaction in connection with a national institution which is in its nature suspicious should be exposed to the light of day. After all, the Commonwealth Bank is the people's bank, and it is our duty as their representatives to see that its administration is above suspicion. Only if we ensure that that is so will the institution be respected and enjoy the confidence of the public. No doubt these big business men are acting in accordance with their conceptions of business morality, but the ordinary political morality of the citizens of the Commonwealth requires that the circumstances I have related shall be definitely aud clearly explained. ""Bigbusiness "" attempts to throw the cloak of patriotism over its predatory capitalistic policy in much the same way as in olden days a pirate, when he held the King's commission, applied to himself the more genteel name of privateer, although his occupation was still piracy. It is an interesting fact that on the share list of this company is the name of another director of the Commonwealth Bank, Sir Samuel Hordern, who holds over 9,000 shares. There are quite a number of other interesting names, .in-, eluding those of Nationalist politicians in the Federal Parliament and the Parliaments of the States, and officers of the bank. I mention that fact for what it is worth, in con junction with the other matters to which I have referred. could have elaborated this case very considerably, but I think that "" I have said sufficient. I feel sure that the Government's lamentable lack of vision in its administration of the affairs of big undertakings such as the Commonwealth Bank, the character of its legislation and administration in connection with the land tax, and the bitter class nature of its recent legislation, that has abrogated our most cherished constitutional principles, will result in its being tried in the balance and found greatly wanting:",46

If there is one thing that must be maintained, it is confidence between a banker and his client. Should honourable members of the Opposition succeed in having every account in the Commonwealth Bank dragged into the glare of parliamentary debate, no reputable citizen will dare to keep his account there. This Government will at all times refuse to ask from the administration of the bank details regarding its internal business. That is the way in which the operations of the bank wore carried on whilst a Labour Government was in office. The late governor of the bank, Sir Denison Miller, would not for a second have tolerated such an inquisition into the business of the bauk. I desire to see the Commonwealth Bank become a really national bank, exerting an influence for the good of every interest in the community, and controlling the nation's financial operations. I very much regret, firstly, the question that was asked by the honourable member for Beid (Mr Coleman), and, secondly, the debate which he has 'precipitated. I am pleased, however, that he has given me an opportunity to place on record, indelibly and permanently, the Government's recognition of the very great services that were performed in the public interest by Mr. Garvan, by other directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and by the Council of Finance during the war period. I challenge anybody to deny that cjvcry Treasurer of the Commonwealth, who has held office I since 1914, no matter to which party he was attached^- Mr Fisher, Mr Higgs, Mr. ""Watt, Sir Joseph Cook, and Mr Brucewould bear witness to the magnificent services that have been rendered to the Commonwealth by the men to whom I have referred. I intend to place on record my appreciation of the services of these men, and then to blow away this murky smoke, this dirty, filthy insinuation, that is continually being levelled at men who give public service gratuitously.

111,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"All that they receive is base insinuation and innuendo such as we have heard in this chamber to-night. Let us examine the train of these operations. The honourable member for Reid did me the justice to say that I was completely frank in the answers that I gave. Mr Garvan also has been perfectly frank. What was the commencement of this "" hideous"" arrangement that is now paraded before honourable members? It started in 1915. It was made between the then Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, Sir Denison Miller, and Mr Garvau for the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company.",48

113,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Nothin g of the sort. The honourable member does not know what he is talking about. It was made whilst a Labour government was in office. According to honourable members opposite, when a Labour government makes any arrangement, it is a good one, but it is an altogether different matter when another government continues it to its conclusion. This arrangement was to be for the duration of the loan.",48
114,Mr BLAKELEY,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,It was to be for no longer than eighteen months.,48
115,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"I give the lie direct, to that assertion. It was to be for the duration of the loan. That loan, it may be remembered, is the very one that .is now being converted. It was the first big'-war loan,, amounting to something over £60,000,000. The arrangement provided that if Mr Garvan would agree to put into that loan all the income of his company, he-would be given certain concessions by the bank.",48
116,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,Ove r what period?,49
117,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"He has been putting money into Commonwealth loans ever since. The loan limited period. That loan is not yet due. At the present time the Mutua l L if e and Citizens Assurance Company £2,800,000 worth of stock in it . It is worth noting that the other directors of the Commonwealth Bank thought so highly of Mr Garvan that they elected him Chairman of Directors of the Bank. Even though he then held £2,800,000 worth of Commonwealth stock, he owed the Commonwealth Bank only £350,000. In the ordinary course of business he has f radually wiped out the indebtedness of . is company. The foul insinuation that the Labo w Daily or some other rag has been responsible for bringing the matter to light will be assessed at its proper valuation by the people of Australia. Everybody remembers what took place in connection with the raising of war loans. The first, suggestion was thai £5,000,000 should be raised in Australia. That was considered a tremendous amountto raise locally. A certain company, which is stronger than the Mutual L if e and Citizens Assurance Company, took up £250,000 worth of stock. Mr Garvan showed his courage and patriotism by taking lip £1,000,000 worth of stock. In every subsequent war loan that the Commonwealth floated he took up his full share. Honourable members have asked for evidence of the patriotism of that company. It is well known thatat the termination of the war it restored the excess premiums that had been collected from the soldiers. This "" h i d e o u s ' arrangement, which honourable members say ought-to be condemned, and which should make it impossible for these men to serve in any Commonwealth institution, was entered into whilst , the Labour party had control of the Commonwealth Bank. The annual reports of the company have referred to it . The able member for Reid read certain statements purportiug to set out. the present position. The Government does not seek to disguise its position. In fact, it puts all its cards on the table. . Secrecy dwells only in the mind of the honourable member: there is no sign of it anywhere else.

In one breath he says that the Government went holds to a great deal of trouble to insert in the bill clauses designed to prevent the appointment of directors from amongst certain persons. He is so stupid as to suggest that the Government then straight way appointed a man who was prohibited. Could a more nonsensical statement be made? This is merely a mare's nest that the honourable member has discovered. It is said that this is a preferential arrangement. I point out that it was entered into by the Governor of the Bank, as a business arrangement, and not by the Treasury. Sir Denison Miller was rightly trusted by the citizens and the governments of this country, no matter what their political complexion happened to be. He considered that; from the point of view of the bank and the public, this was a fair arrangement. Honourable members opposite would not have dared to make these rotten insinuations had Sir Denison Miller been alive. It is only because the man is dead and is unable to defend himself that they trot them. out. Let ns compare contemporaneous action by the Labour Governments. I have here particulars of the arrangements that the Labour Treasurer made with the associated banks. It first of all put forward a proposition to which I referred in my second-reading speech on the Commonwealth Bank Bill . I then pointed out that the Government 1 gave to the banks the right to obtain £ 3 in notes for every sovereign that was paid to the Treasury. Of every £ 3 issued, £ 2 was treated as a loan to the banks on which interest at the rate of 4' per cent, was charged. The arrangement was not for eighteen months, as the honourable member has suggested, but for the honor- whole period of the war.",49

123,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Novembe r 1914. Later, other advances were made by the Labour Treasurer. For instance, in 1916, because the Commonwealth Government of the day had not sufficient stocks of gold, it borrowed from the banks 5,000,000 sovereigns for export. In exchange for those sovereigns the banks were given notes of equal value, and the - right to obtain loans in notes to a similar amount if they deposited war bonds as security. Interest at the rate of 4£ per cent, was charged. The honourable member said that the arrangement made with Sir Denison Miller with the Citizens Company provided for 5 per cent, interest. Subsequently, the rate of interest to the banks by the Treasury was reduced to 3 per cent. That is to say, the Labour Treasurer made a much worse deal with the banks than did the Commonwealth Bank Board with the Citizens Company. This, then, is the ""hideous "" transaction to which the honourable member has referred ! Later, the time came when the primary products of Australia could not be disposed of, and it was necessary to' make advances to producers. The banks undertook to make the advances, and in return were given the right to obtain paper money from .the Treasury bearing interest at the rate of 4 per cent. Similar arrangements were made at a still later date for advances in relation to wool' and wheat, from 4 to-5^ per cent, interest being charged. I have made those comparisons to show the misrepresentation in -, dulged in by the honourable member, who asserted that the arrangement under discussion was made for a special purpose during war time, and was without precedent.

128,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Ge t another word in stead of "" rotten.""",50
129,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"My vocabulary of' permissible parliamentary expressions is insufficient to set out-my views on this matter. Some honourable members opposite are 'capable of going to any lengths to damage an institution that has done good service to the community. The honourable member suggested that after Mr Garvan was appointed to the board the interests of the board were found to run counter to those of the public, and that the board desired to keep up the rates of exchange. I give that an unqualified denial. For many months the bank board, headed hy Mr Garvan, continually urged the Government to return to the gold basis. Every one knows what took place when that was donethe exchange rate f e l l from £3 10s. to 15s. per £100. I remind honourable members that the decision to return to the gold basis was agreed to unanimously by the board. During the preceding eighteen months, I was in close and constant touch with Mr Garvan, and know that he wanted the Government to return to the gold basis as early as possible. I think that my remarks are a complete refutation of the charges that have been made. We come now to a discussion of Mr Garvan's position as a director of the bank. The position is perfectly plain. The act provides that a director shall not borrow money from the bank. The wording of sub-section 1 5 B of"" section 7 is definite15B. .A. person who is(o) A director of any corporation (other than the Commonwealth Bank), the business of which is wholly or mainly that of banking; or (b) An officer of any corporation (other than the Commonwealth Bank), the business of which is wholly or mainly of banking, be capable of appointment, or of to act, as a director or member of No one suggests that Mr Garran had a personal account with the bank, although his company had one there. The honourable member gave away his case by saying that the ordinary account of the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company Limited was with the Bank of New South Wales, The company's only account with the Commonwealth Bank was that arranged by Sir Denison Miller and Mr. Garvan in connection with the loan. The honourable member said that no transaction of this nature had ever taken place previously, and then proceeded to show that a director of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, the claims of which he was urging all the time, had shares in that company. The honourable member has supplied the refutation of his own charge. These arrangements were made in war time, and were publicly acknowledged on several occasions by the - Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company Limited, reference to them being made in the company's annual statements. The effect was to prevent the company from carrying on its ordinary mortgage busiuess, which would have returned it from 6 per cent, to 8 per cent., as against the 4j per cent, received in connection with these loans. Because, in the public interest, it invested in the ivar loans £2,800,000 for ten years at 4£ per cent., the company had to forgo the profits it otherwise would have made. Because a man was public-spirited enough to get his company to do that, and to give his time and the benefit of his experience to the public by serving on the board, the honourable member has seen fit to drag his name through the mire, and make foul aspersions regarding his character, integrity, and honour. charges of this kind are permitted to pass without protest, it will be difficult in the future to get men to accept positions of responsibility. Mr Garvan acted as chairman of the Break of Gauge Commission, in' which capacity he rendered excellent service. He acted also on the Notes Issue Board, giving gratuitous service for four years. Some may have disagreed with his actions as a member of that board, but no one who knows anything of finance has ever suggested that he xised his position on that board for his personal advantage. The* Governor. Earle Page. ment repudiates the sinister suggestion of the honourable member. To sum up, the arrangement was made-whethe r it was a good or a bad one, I do not propose to say-betwee n the bank and the chairman of the Mutual Life and' Citizens Assurance Company Limited during the regime of a Labour Government. On the honourable member's own showing, it was a better arrangement from the public point of view, and from the stand-point of finance, than the arrangement entered into between the Labour Treasurer and the banks. Ten years after that arrangement was entered into, and almost at the time when the loan will be converted-the conversion will take place on 15th December next-this matter has been raised, and the honourable member referred to it as a ""shocking transaction."" He suggested that Mr Garvan should not be allowed to serve the public further in connection with the bank. Yet the arrangement has been made public time after time during that period. Mr Garvan has no personal connection - with the Commonwealth Bank in the way of advances or overdrafts. Simply because he acted in a public-spirited manner, and for many years applied practically the whole of his company's income to the service of the public, in order to provide silver bullets with which to turn back the German Army, the honourable member has thought fit to attempt to injure his reputation. I think that there is no need for me to say more, because the honourable member himself has answered the charges that he made. The honourable member has made a great outcry about these arrangements, although worse things were done by a Labour Government. The If action of Mr Garvan has resulted in great service being rendered to Australia.",50
130,Mr ANSTEY,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Bourke) [9.13] - Bot h inside and outside this House I hear many things concerning myself that I do not like. Similarly unpleasant things I come across in my reading, but I do not squeal about them. I take what is coming to me, and am thankful that it is no worse. But it would appear that no one has any right to criticize the public actions of the Treasurer, or any one connected with him. Should any one have the temerity to do so, the Treasurer squeals like a stuck pig. I am surprised at his audacity, his cold callousness, his shamelessness. He seems to be entirely forgetful of the past. One would think that he had never uttered an unkind word or attempted to defame any one. Has he forgotten the expressions he once used-""cooke d accounts,"" and "" a looter among looters."" On the platforms of this country he told the people that it was time that those with whom he is now associated were prevented from pursuing their pernicious practices. He continued to denounce them u n t i l they took him into their company. Then those whom he had previously defamed became honest men. He has a way of forgetting these things. T do not cast any blame on him ; it is his business to get away with as much as he can while he is in office, for he will not be there He has made statements that obscure the issue. He has endeavoured to make it appear that there is some similarity between the management of the bank under the late Sir Denison Miller, and under its present administration. There is no similarity, because the party, when it established the bank, had to silence a public clamour engendered by those who told the people that we would dip into the funds of the bank-. In order to assuage the timidity of the public, we took .measures to provide that no politician, Labour or otherwise, could ' interfere in operations of the bauk. Everything Sir Denison Miller did was entirely his own responsibility. If he did wrong, he was to blame; if he did right, it was to his credit; but no Government, whether National or Labour, can in any way be held r.esponsible for his misdeeds, or claim any credit for his achievements. The Treasurer further stated that the Labour Government, in the early stages of the war, assisted, the banks to a greater extent than the bank and Mr . Garvan, by common arrangement, have assisted each other. He read a statement in which he said that some honourable members of this party opposed the action of the Government of that time. I was one of those who assailed the Labour Government of that time for entering into that arrangement. I assailed it in caucus, and in the House. Mr Fisher, in caucus, denied that he was in any way responsible. I direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that we have a truth f u l and honest Treasurer, who reads to them a statement that be asks them to believe. Mr Fisher, who was also Treasjirer, said, "" If Mr Anstey does not believe my statement that I am not responsible for this matter, and that it was done by the Government of Sir Joseph Cook;, who was in power at the outbreak of war, and for some weeks afterwards, I suggest that he should make inquiries at the Treasury."" I went to the Treasury and saw Mr Collins, who explained the position; and whether he told the t r u th or not, he at least told me that Mr Fisher was blameless, and that the business was settled before he took office. As a result of that interview with long. Mr Collins, I had to apologize to Mr . Fisher. The Treasurer said the arrangement was made in November, 1914, and when I asked him for the date, he would not state it , but simply reiterated "" November, 1914."" I shall read an extract from the Labour Economist of the 14th October,. 1914. Honourable members will remember that the war broke out on the 4th August, 1914, so that the Economist of the 14th October was published eight weeks after the outbreak of war. The Labour party did not assume office until several weeks after the outbreak of war. and the war the was on when the elections took place. As the message was sent by the Sydney representative of the Economist, it must have been written at least four weeks before publication. It dealt with the arrangement made by the Government with the banks. I said that that arrangement was outrageous, and because I believed it was outrageous, and because I waa under the impression that it was made by the Labour Government, I assailed that Government. I now tell the Treasurer that the Labour Government was not responsible. The letter by the Sydney correspondent, of the Economist statedThere is to he a sufficiency of paper money to advance to the private banks such paper money as they may require. The banks welcome the scheme as one calculated to relieve any pressure on their resources. It makes it easier for the stronger banks, as it relieves them of .the responsibility of coming to the support of their weaker brethren. If it is true that Mr Collins now says that the Labour party was responsible, he lied to me, and put me in a false position with my party and the Labour Government of that time.",51
131,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,I think he told the honourable member the truth .,53
132,Mr ANSTEY,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"As to that I leave Mr Collins to explain. What was the Treasurer's other statement? that Mr Garvan was a most honest and immaculate man, who had rendered great service to this country. Who denies that he has rendered great service?",53
133,Mr MAKIN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Servic e to himself, perhaps.",53
134,Mr ANSTEY,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"I care not whether to himself or to his country. I do not deny that he has rendered great service, but many a gallant soldier who has fought on the field of battle is suffering in the penitentiaries of his country for a smaller misdemeanour. I can recall in this State a certain Minister of the Crown, who was outwardly a good and honest man, who could sing excellent hymns and was punctilious in his genuflexions before the altar of his God. who always carried a hymn-book and Bible about with him. aud who continually counselled others to pursue the path of honesty. That man. while, posing as honest, was secretly and privately pursuing slimy tracks for his own ends. Of what use is it to tell us of Garvan's past? I am not concerned with what he was, but with what he is. I want to know what his relations with the business of the country are., and how he came on the scene? There is no service that he renders for nothing; he makes no great sacrifice without remuneration, and he derives apparently from many sources the emoluments of the split efforts of a day. He came on the scene because Sir Joseph Cook wanted to employ him on a council of finance. The Parliament objected to men who had nothing but their wealth to recommend ihem being a secret government behind the Government. Then came the Nor.es Issue Board'. Garvan was placed on that board, and given his present position i u the bank. What does he represent ? He represents, apparently, the Mutual L if e Association. What is the Mutual L if e Association? He holds, in the name of himself and his family, some 60,000 shares in that company. He holds 44,000 of them in his own name, and 14,000 in connection wit b John Power, who also owns another 14,000. Sir Samuel Hordern, a bosom friend, who has £150,000 of interest in the company, is also on the directorate of the bank. The f a m i l y of Garvan and Sir Samuel Hordern hold between them shares in that company worth He said £1,000,000, and whatever may be their emoluments from the Commonwealth Bank, they are between them the dominating force in the Mutual L if e Company. E a r ly in the war the Government issued an advertisement that was not exclusive of any particulai individual. It did not offer special. privileges to certain persons in the community. It did not say, "" The man who is rich shall have advantages the poor cannot get,"" but it said, "" There is a - war in Prance, and we want money. If there are any men or women in this country in this hour of t r i a l who have no ready money to lend, they can take securities in the for m of title deeds for land, or mortgages, and place them in the Commonwealth Bank, and if they do so, the bank will advance them a loan at 4 per cent, to reinvest in the National Loan at 4^ per cent."" The borrowers were to refund the money lent at 4 per oent. with in eighteen months. Nearly every man in the community went into the scheme, and, apparently, the much boomed Mutual L if e and J . J . Garvan made a great patriotic contribution to it . The public thought that J . J . Garvan and those connected with him went into the scheme on the same footing as the humblest and poorest citizen, to take a temporary loan to tide them over an emergency. There was no one in this community, except themselves, who knew that the loan was not merely for a period of eighteen months. If any other individual who secured a temporary advance at 4 per cent, did not repay it within eighteen months, he had to pay a rate of interest on the overdraft greater than that received from the National Loan. J . J. Garvan, however, did not repay the finally loan at the end of eighteen months, but continued to hold it year after year. He was thus able to secure at 4 per cent, money for which the public eventually paid 6 and 7 per cent. He had £1,000,000 in one dose, and for i the paid only 4 per cent. He now sits on the Board of Directors of-the bank, and is a controlling and dominating influence there. It has been pointed out that he formerly carried on his business with the Bank of New South Wales, which would not, however, make him an advance of money",53
135,Mr WHITSIXT,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,How does the honourable member know that?,54
136,Mr ANSTEY,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"I would not make the statement unless I knew. would not advance him money to enable him to speculate upon the market, ancl conduct exchange transactions in opposition to them. They not only refused to advance him money, but they went a step further. He secured the money fro m the Commonwealth Bank, for he was Chairman of Directors of that bank long before he was formally appointed. For all practical purposes he was Director General of the Commonwealth Bank from the day Sir Denison Miller died. He had offices in the bank, and they wore the centre of operations in which he manipulated the bank. So strong was the resentment of the private banks that last year, when he was in the midst of operations with Commonwealth money, which he was obtaining at 4$ per cent., and farming out at 6£ and 1 per cent., they threatened to cease business relations with the Commonwealth Bank. That is why I raised the question in this House. And now, looking over the list of shareholders of the Mutua l Life , I observe that, in addition to the huge interests of the Garvans and Horderns, officers of the Bank of New South Wales and officers of the Commonwealth Bank also have monetary interests in the company. It is a matter for investigation how and when they came to possess those shares. The money which the Commonwealth Bank lent to the Mutua l L if e Company could better have been to the citizens of this country when the financiers were holding our in dustries by the throat. The bank could have come to the aid of the primary producers, could have helped the exporters of primary products, ancl could have broken the banking ring by advancing that money at 4 or 5 per cent. Instead of doing so, it held off, and took part in the boycott of our exportable products. While the country suffered, this man was obtaining money from country's bank and operating with it on the markets in the processes of exchange. What was yesterday a bank that was public property, administered by a. man independent of political and social influence, is today a public institution administered by private capitalists in the interests of private capitalists, and to the detriment of Australia generally.",54
137,Mr WHITSITT,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Darwin) [ 9 . 3 1 ] - I feel that it is a very great mistake that The bank the Commonwealth Bank was ever established. The Yarra bank is the only bank about which honourable members opposite know anything. I know something about this business. The manager of the Mutua l L if e and Citizens Assurance Company went to the late Sir Denison Miller, manager of the Commonwealth Bank-the gentleman who made the bank what it is by his business acumen and knowledge of banking, and not by political olap-trap-and said that the company would take £2,000,000 of the bank's money at a certain rate of interest for a certain term. That term was not eighteen months. Do honourable members imagine that the manager of an insurance company would go to the manager of the Commonwealth Bank and say, "" I want to borrow £2,000,000 of your money for eighteen months""?- That would not be business. No. The company said that it wanted the money for an extended term. It was not like a man investing a paltry £ 1 0 0 for the purchase of a littl e war loan stock. The manager of the company said. ' ' I want £2,000,000 for a fixed term to protect the shareholders of my company. What terms can you give me ?"" The terms were ten years at 4 per cent. At that particular period every Treasurer and banker was at his wit's end to find money to finance the war. We all mortgaged ourselves. I mortgaged myself, and obtained money advanced for a. longer term than eighteen months. That blows out honourable members on the other side.",54
138,Mr MAHONY,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,Fro m whom did the honourable member get his.loan?,54
139,Mr WHITSITT,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"F r o m the Bank of Australasia. Everything depends upon the nature of the business done with the bank. I have listened to-night to so much piffle that it is enough to make angels weep, let alone members, of Parthe liament. I cannot understand why a man who did so much for the country and invested his money during the war period to keep the flag flying should now be condemned and for. political purposes. It is lamentable that such - A thing should occur - i;-. In view of the piffle to which we have - listened to-night, I ask what inducement there is for any man who loves his country to come to its assistance ? Everybody is bad, filthy , and corrupt except. honourable members opposite. They are the "" Simon Pures."" They are marvellous men. I thought that we were all k it h - and kin-, that the same blood flowed i i i - our veins, and that we were all trying to do the best we could for the Commonwealth. ""But do honourable members mean to say that this man of business acumen would have gone to the Commonwealth Bank to make investments in the interests of the country if he thought that he would be subjected i o the exposure to which we have listened r.o-night? Who turned traitor on the bank and gave the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) the information upon which he based his attack? Who divulged the secrets of the bank? It is clear that there are "" scabs "" in .the, Commonwealth Bank as well as elsewhere: The officers of the bank are sworn to secrecy, and I want to' know who. made his case for the honourable member for Reid. 'The honourable member should stand up and let the people of Australiaknow who divulged to him the secrets of the bank. Has he been given the sack? Some one must have prompted the honourable member, and I hope, that he will be man enough to get up and name the traitor, or traitors, in, the Commonwealth Bank who are prepared to divulge the business of the bank, to a member of this Parliament. This . is. the* people's bank, and we have no right here to criticize 'the management of those in charge of it . They are men who know their job, and can be trusted to conduct the business of the bank on proper lines. I am very sorry that such a matter should have been discussed in this chamber. It is a case of "" save me from my friends.""",54
140,Mr BRENNAN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Batman) [9.35] Following on the tempestuous address of the honourable member for Darwin (Mr . Whitsitt), it is a little difficult to come back immediately to the calm consideration of the serious question raised by the honourable member for Reid'(Mr Coleman) in submitting his amendment. But we must endeavour to do so. One cannot compliment the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) upon the speech he made in defence. I give the honourable gentleman credit, however, for the very high compliment he paid the honourable member for Reid in that he was obviously disturbed by the charges made by that honourable member, and the method with which they were presented. I watched with great interest to use a word that is perhaps unknown to my honourable friends opposite, the "" colloguing "" of , the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), whilst the speech of the honourable member for Reid was in progress. Although I could not hear precisely what was passing between them, I gathered that it was to this effect: The Prime Minister, I understood, was saying, "" This is pretty hot stuff, Page, what are we goingto do about it ?"" and the Treasurer replied, "" Well, I do not know what we are to do about it , but, obviously, it is up to you, as Prime Minister, to make a defence of the bank."" It appears to me clearly that the Prime Minister replied to that by saying, "" I cannot say anything in defence. I do not know the facts. It looks bad and my advice to you is . to spit blazes, and give me time to think about it . "" That is the only possible explanation of the temper, tone, and matter of the speech delivered by the Treasurer. We beard from the honourable gentleman that he had been pained by seme "" rotten insinuations,"" He has been moved by the ""obvious stupidity"" of honourable members on this side. In fact, for a professional gentleman, accredited with an unimpeachable bedside manner, his language approached more nearly to that of the renowned Biddv Moriarty, of the country of my own ancestors, than anything I ever heard in this chamber before. "" Why , "" the honourable gentleman saidlightly scanning the pages of history, and especially those irrelevant to the question - "" have we not the testimony of each of' the Treasurers""-and he ran them off with an easy grace which showed that he had been reciting the list for some time before the honourable member for Reid made his speech. "" Have we not,"" said the honourable gentleman, "" the testimony of each of these Treasurers in support of the view that Mr Garvan was amongst patriots the most shining patriot of them all. "" I do not know whether we have that testimony, or not, but I accept the honourable gentleman's assurance on the point. It is, as the honourable member for Bourke pointed out, mainly irrelevant, but it bas this degree of relevancy, at all events, that if one-half of - what was said by the honourable member for Reid about Mr Garvan, and his connection with the bank and public enterprises, is correct, it is quite possible that Mr Garvan was in a position to be magnanimous to the Commonwealth Bank, the Treasurer, aud the public generally, because he seems to have done remarkably well in this country for himself and for his company. It seems to be taken for granted in the mysterious regions of high finance that it is not only moral, but in the highest degree au evidence of patriotism, to borrow money from the Commonwealth Bank, the nation's bank, in the time of the nation's distress, at a certain rate of interest, and to invest it in the name of patriotism at the time of the nation's distress at a rate 1 per cent, higher than the rate for which it was borrowed. I pears to be taken for granted that, in this regard, Mr Garvan was no exception to the general rule, and that his action was in accord with a financial policy which, on moral grounds, and in time of war especially, is not only defensible, but to be applauded. I let it go at that. Tbat, unknown to nie, may be a test of high morality in regions of high finance. Perhaps I do not understand the standards of financiers in the same way as that brilliant exponent of high finance from Darwin appreciates them. But I know that to the 60,000 dead and the 400,000 who offered their lives for this country in a time of war, very little was said of a profit of 1 per cent, on their investments in connection with the war.. Why is this standard of morality applied to the wealthy, which was never thought of in connection with the working people in this community? Why was it never suggested as being fairly applicable to the men whose bodies were to be snatched, under conscription, and thrown willy-nilly into the furnace of war during the four bloody years of torture that .the country passed through? In the realms of high finance, and also of patriotism, men who made substantial profits out of their very safe sacrifices are said to have made them for the country. I listened with close attention to the Treasurer to ascertain if he bad a reply to the case putby the honourable member for Reid. Is there any honourable member 7 2217 who listens to me to-night who will deny that the honourable member for Beid put his case in temperate and carefullyconsidered language. His address-and it is to the honourable member's credit-wa s admittedly carefully prepared and considered. Every sentence of it was expressed in language to which no man could take the slightest exception on the ground of good taste or the method of the honourable member's presentation of his case. That is as to its form. As to its substance, we have been told that the. honourable member was throwing about reckless and poisonous innuendo. There was no innuendo. The honourable member made deliberate and serious charges, and made them in language which could not be misunderstood. I venture to declare that no honest critic of debate in this chamber, or out of it, can say that the Treasurer gave a clear and concise answer t ap- to any one of the charges made by the. honourable member for Reid. On the contrary, he ran away from them all. Let me repeat them, and then ask honourable members again how far they were answered. A protest is being made against the action of the Government, and as usual when we make a charge against the Government, and link up with it the name of an individual, it is the policy of the honourable gentlemen opposite, by the judicious operation of the smoke screen, to make it appear that our whole charge is against some other individual and not themselves. I direct attention to the fact that this grave charge is more against the Government than against an individual. The individual fulfils to"" the full his proclivities for making money. He revels in that sphere in which he is a past master. But this Government is responsible to the whole of the people, and in the last resort for the management of the Commonwealth Bank, because as we pointed out in this - chamber in debate a week or two ago when discussing the case of a late officer of the bank, Mr Young, if there is any scandal affecting the relations of the bank with the public, the bank cannot hide behind the provision in the act which declares that the directors alone are responsible for its internal management. The Government is responsible for the relations of the bank with the general public. Our protest relates to the fact that Mr Garvan was at the time of his appoiiitmeiit as a director of the bank, also managing director and chief shareholder of the Mutual L if e and Citizens Assurance Company Limited, which was then a borrower from the bank The Treasurer has been referred to the Commonwealth Bank Act. If he is acquainted with that law he will, know that it is unbecoming, nay, that it is unlawful for a director to be a borrower from the bank. AMhougb, it may be technically urged that Mr Garvan personally was not a. borrower, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) pulverized tha i: aspect of the case, or any possible .answer in defence, by pointing out that MJ . Garvan had a substantial interest in this insurance company, and that any advantage, ancl there were substantial advantages, that was received, from the bank affected him personally to his advantage. Did the Treasurer answer that, charge? Can any one chamber say that he definitely defended the policy of a director of the bank beiug a borrower from the bank, or of a director of the bank, who"" is largely interested in a company, permitting it to be under an obligation to the bank or to trade with the bank? second charge is that preferential treatment was accorded Mr Garvan through his company in that he was given an overd r a f t for an extended term at arate of interest which was not applicable to the ordinary customers of the bank. Did the Treasurer compare the position' of the ordinary customers of the bank with that of the insurance company of which Mr . Garvan was a member? I listened attentively to his speech, but I heard no comparison of, or justification for , the preferential treatment given to Mr Garvan and his company. I still await an explanation. A declaration to the effect that Mr Garvan is a shining patriot, that he came to the rescue of the Commonwealth, or that he Avon the approval and applause of seven succeeding - Treasurers, or even that he won the war, is not an explanation. I want to know whether he received a preferential treatment fro m the bank. I want a definite answer to that charge.",55
141,Mr COLEMAN,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"The increase rate of interest to 7 per cent., while Mr convened Garvan had an overdraft with the bank, requires explaining. Mr Bremuvn. Mr TSKENN&N - Mr Garvan, when he had an overdraft at 4 per cent., was instrumental in raising the bank's rate of interest to 7 per cent. The .third charge - is that the relations of Mr Garvan with the bank have been out of harmony with the relevant provisions of the Commonwealth Bank Act and the well established principles governing the condition of persons in the employ of the Crown. Considerations of honour should prevent any person in the employ of the Commonwealth from profiting by transaction with the Commonwealth. It has ever been a test of honor that no man in the Public Service shall attempt to serve two masters, or attempt to make profit out of an equivocal position of that kind. The honourable member for Beid has absolutely established the case as it stands at present. The charges remain unanswered, and they in this ought to be answered. Tbey can never be answered by any splenetic outburst. / These definite charges require definite answers. They should be answered by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, because no more damning or grave charge could be levelled against a government The than that is was a party to the transactions disclosed by the honourable member for Reid, whose case was supported by a wealth of argument.",57
142,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Cowper-Trea surer) [9.52] - For the information of honourable members. I shall quote from Hansard the actual statement that was made by Mr Fisher in respect of the arrangement made by him with the private banks.

The following statement appears in Hansard of 9th October, 1914: - I do not propose to discuss the measures arrived at by the conference which was convened by the Leader of the Opposition when Prime' Minister, unless he wishes me to say something about them and our present difficulties.

At a conference of ail parties convened - by my predecessor, the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition, subsequent to the breaking out of war, but iprior to the general elections, a unanimous agreement was arrived nt that the financial resources of the Australian note issue should he utilized to assist in financing the States, the banks, and the Commonwealth.

148,Mr ANSTEY,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"The Treasurer said 1915 in his budget speech. I challenged him at the time, because he said that it was one of the most questionable trans^ actions of the war. I know all about Mr . Collins and the double-faced business h e ' is playing with the different Treasurers of this country. The Treasurer said that this arrangement was made in November, 1914, and that the Labour party was responsible for it . I know all about it , because I had to suffer for my attitude at the party meeting. My testimony is borne out by the fact that Andrew Fisher told his party in caucus that the arrangement had. already been made. What was the arrangement) When war broke out the Government of that day called together, not the political parties, but the Stock Exchange and the Banking Association. This arrangement was made, and Andrew Fisher, who was fighting me on this matter, said to the party, "" What can I do in the midst of war? This arrangement is practically settled."" Mr Collins pointed out to me that Mr . Fisher was not responsible for the arrangement. If the Treasurer denies m y statement, he puts me i u a false position. Mr Fisher had to take the responsibility cast upon him by his predecessors. As. a matter of fact, if the Fisher government' had been responsible for the arrangement, the Labour party would not have stood by it . The reason that the party stood to the arrangement was because it understood it had practically been completed by the previous government. Upon that I j u s t if y m y attitude during the last twelve months. I do not entirely blame the Treasurer, because I know what Mr Collins is capable of. Last year the Treasurer said that the arrangement was made in 1915, and now he says it was in November, 1914. The evidence is clear and definite that the arrangement was practically made before the Labour party took office.",58
149,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"D a r l i ng Downs-Attorney-General ) [9.59] - In justification of the Treasurer's reply, I - wish to explain what the position was. The Treasurer, when dealing with a certain transaction between the bank and Mr Garvan, was challenged by the Opposition. He replied that the Treasurer of a. Xuhaux government had wade an. arrangement - with the private banks that was uot as favourable, from a Commonwealth point of view, as the arrangement made between Mr Garvan; and the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable member for Bourke challenged that state not responsible for thearrangement, sioee it was made by his predecessor. As the Treasurer has shown, the evidence clearly indicates that before the elections were held a conference took place, and  said distinctly that although that conference bad been held the position was unsatisfactory. Thus, the matter had not been settled by October. On the 2(ltb November the question of the arrangement with the States was again brought up by a question put by the. aonr orftblo member, for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson). That honourable member asked whether definite arrangements had been made, with the associated banks. Mr. .Fisher replied:It will be best to wait for the budget for a fall statement regarding this matter. Thebooks, bave come to a voluntary arrangement with the Government covering a proposition of the kind mentioned.

Fisher said that associated with the loans to the States wasAn. agreement made with tke associated banks whereby they should give to the Commonwealth £10,00O,009 in gold for Australian noteB. 3fr. Fisher went on to say Tn undertakingtbis financial transaction, I impressed upon the banks' representatives that, as Treasurer, I should require their other financial institutions. assistance, end they, recognizing the national emorgency, choerfuly agreed to render the Government every possible aid in their power, ft ahoo/d be clearly understood that the €10,000,000 advanced by the banks will be redeemedat the. close of the war. It was a transaction' covering the whole period of the war. Therefore, the Treasurer's statement; was absolutely correct, and tire position he has taken up is absohrtetily justified.. Mr CHARLIQN: (Hunter) [10.3}. - I nave never beard more definite charges made, in this House than those .levelled by the hoaaosable member for Beid (Mr. Coleman) ac the board of directors, of the Commonwealth Bank. But. instead of meeting .those charges, Ministers: are endeavouring to camouflage the position. The Treasurer's quotation from Hansard shows that whatever happened at the time of which he was speaking, took place of tear the ecBllmenx;eraenlt of the war, trad , shortly before the Labour party succeeded in winning the election. The party in power at the. time went to the country believing that the people would not "" swop horses crossing a stream,"" hut the people did so,, and returned us to power. Prior to that,, certain conference! had been held, and an agreement hatf been reached. Speaking from information he received at the time,, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey)' has. made certain statements. I remember the discussion of the matter at tba party-meeting, and I know that the bonorabW member is absolutely correct in saying that. M i . Collins gave him the information that  arrangement with the haiiks which, had been practically agreed to by the Cook Government. But what has all that to' do with the definite charges made here by the honourable member for Keid'< TwoMinisters have spoken, but neither has made any reply to those charges.. I have never heard a lamerspeech delivered here than that of the Treasurer, and. the Attorney-General has not helped his. cotleague in any way. A case uaast be'a bad one if it has to be. camouflaged in this way. The Government c&anged the management of the CommorjrreoJih Bank, notwithstanding that we on this side of the House pouited out the danger of such a. cbangpThe Government has appointed as directors men who are directly interested' n> Would any fair-minded person expect directors who are interested in. private banks to do their best, for *»Commonwealth Bank? Thebalancersheet of tha bank is not yet availably but this fact stands out that, as a.resutt. of planing, the lastiCutioa in the hapm*!; persons whom the honourable member .for Reid has charged with making iadrisy - - at the expense of the bank, it has made no progress during the eight or nine months that 'have elapsed since the change. Rather it has' gone bacE. The deposits in the savings, bank branch have decreased, whereas every State savings bank is showing' an increase. On the business side the ,bank is making no progress whatever - No effort is being made to open out. People who have asked for loans, primary producers in particular, have not been able to get them because the bank will not come' into competition with the private institutions with which the directors are connected. know that Mr Garvan is interested in a wealthy assurance company. We know the amount of profit, his company is making, especially through the loans it has been able to get by connection with the Commonwealth Bank. All these things cry out for vestigation. Statements such as we have heard to-night cannot go unchallenged. Ministers may pass them over in a free and easy manner, but there is a day of reckoning ahead for them. The public will want to know why these charges have been made, and why directors have been appointed who are connected with private institutions, who have no sympathy with a national banking institution, and who. are entirely devoted to forwarding j the interests of private enterprise. How can we expect the Commonwealth Bank to be success in such circumstances? When charges are' made showing clearly that things are not going right, when the balance-sheet of the bank shows that it is going back under the. new regime, we are entitledto some explanation ; but we have heard .no reply whatever. least thing the Government could do was to say that it would institute a thorough investigationinto the position of the bank. But it will not allow the light of day to come into the management of the institution. It s policy in regard to this bank is to Keep everything from the public. When the Commonwealth Bank Bill was under consideration, we pointed out what was likely to happen. It has all turned out as we prophesied. Men appointed to these responsible positions always look after fiemselves. They are not to be blamed l o r it . In this competitive world of ours, if a man can make £100,000 for Jiis own company he will do so. Butaccording to the honourable member for Reid, it has been done in this instance at the expense of the Commonwealth Bank and.to the disadvantage, of the private banks, too. What connection is there between the arrangement made by the Government with the associated banks and the arrangement with this life assurance company? The Treasurer wil l not admit that this company does banking business. . The honourable member for Reid says that it does certain banking business and that it should be classed as a bank. If the We Treasurer were tb admit that thiB life assurance company should be regarded as a banking institution Mr Garvan's appointment as a director of the Commonwealth Bank would - be a breach of the his provision of the act - which stipulates that no> one connected with another bank in- can be appointed director of the Commonwealth Bank. The matter is so serious that if the Government did the' righ t thing it would have an investigation made into these charges. If there is nothing in them, so much the better for-the.bank. But can honourable members believe that all the material collected by. the' honourable member for Reid counts for, nothing ! How did the matter originate? How did the honourable member get, possession of this information ? How did he come to know about Mr Garvan's position in regard to the company with which he is a associated ? Mr Garvan' and another man hold between them 60,000 or 70,000 shares in ah institution with a total share issue of 200,000. Each f u l ly paid-up £ 1 share in the company is worth £ 1 5 and a profit of 80 per cent, is earned .on its capital. That is a staggering position. The A man in the position of Mr . Garvan should not be connected with the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank. It. is idle for the Treasurer to say that Mr Garvan is a financial genius, and that he acted patriotically in accepting a position on the Commonwealth Bank Board. If he does his work f a it h full y , he has enough to do in attending to the institution of which, he is managing director. ' 1% is of no advantage to the Commonwealth Bank to have him, and men of similar calibre, in charge of its administration. The time is coming when the electors will haye to pronounce upon this matter, and then there.will be a-cleaning up of the whole business. The.Commonwealth Bank will..have' to function as. the Labour party intended it to do. It will Lave to be a bank for the people, and not merely a central bank for the bankers. It must play, its part in developing and populating the country. The Government has not answered the charges made by the honourable member for Beid, aud I shall be surprised if Mr Garvan, when, he reads the newspaper report of the debate, is satisfied' with the Treasurer's reply. If he is a man, .he will ask that an inquiry be held, so that he may have an opportunity to clear his name of these charges. It is the Government's duty to hold, an investigation. Serious allegations concerning a national institution like the Commonwealth Bonk cannot be allowed to go unanswered. Suspicion has been - created since - the Government appointed the present hoard.",59
151,Mr CUNNINGHAM,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,What about those officers of the bank who hold shares in the company of which Mr Garvan is a director t,61
152,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"That statement, too, requires investigation. I have heard that every officer employed in the Commonwealth Bank is required to go to the Mutua l L if e and Citizens Assurance Company to be insured. I do not know whether or not the statement is correct, but it is common talk. If these allegations are disproved by investigation, so much the better for all concerned. The Treasurer had no righ t to castigate the honourable member for Reid and say that he was talking rubbish and nonon sense. It is his duty to appoint a com- . quiry. mittee- I do not care how it is constituted-to s if t all the evidence bearing .on these charges, so that we may know definitely whether the institution is being strangled by the people who now direct it. If it is, a change in the administration should be made at once. The bank Bhould be of great service to Australia. and improper assertion ? It should be the financial bulwark of the country. Everybody admits that during the great war it rendered yeoman sernot vice. We must not allow its powers to be diminished; rather should we increase them arid extend the ramifications of the institution , so that it may become in reality a people's bank. Unless the vernment orders an inquiry into this 'matter, a stigma will rest upon the tution'. .The honourable, gentleman did not meet the charges and the Attorneylate General, when lie rose to defend the Government endeavoured by a reference to a .transaction that occurred over ten years ago, to throw responsibility upon ' Mr ! Fisher. Apparently, the Government's case is' so weak that it has no answer to make to the strong and"" definite charges made by the honourable member for Reid-. If they are not probed to the bottom now, the people.will demand i u the near future - the fullest inquiry. If there is one public institution of. which the whole of our people approve, it is the Commonwealth Bank, and they will demand that it shall have a fair run, and not be hamstrung and strangled by the legislation which, this Government has introduced.",61
153,Mr GREGORY,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"Swan) [10.16] - The arguments of the Leader of the Opposition are somewhat extraordinary. Thegravamen of his charge is that the action of the Govermnent in appointing.a board of directors to control the Commonwealth Bank has damned that institution: He has condemned the Government's policy - as injurious to the bank and liable to lead to all sorts of wrong-doing, with resultant loss to the bank and the country. I was not present in the chamber when the honourable member for Reid made his speech, but I do not propose to accept any ex 'parte statement.

I accept no' ex pairtfeVstatement against: the Governor of'the'bank, or Mr Garvan', or anybody else. During the war, did not the Government, by advertisements in the press and on the hoardings, urge all citi-zens and corporations to take up war bonds, and in order to enable tliem to do that, were they not promised advances by the bunk for, .1. think, eighteen months, at a, lower rate of interest than was being offered by the Government? So that I might take up 5 per cent, bonds, I ob- tained from the bank an advance which was repayable in instalments. In a similar way other individuals and large companies were induced to invest in the war loans. I feel satisfied that the same conditions applied to every subscriber, but if some wrong-doing has resulted in connection with those transactions, the person responsible was the late Governor of the bank. Surely there should be greater safety in control by a large body of directors Mr BRENT* AN - Yes , if they are interested ; but if they arc not there grave danger.",61
158,Mr GREGOB Y,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"I know nothing .more of Mr Garvan's transactions with the Commonwealth Bank than his public statement that, in reply to the request f for . subscriptions to the war loan, company applied for a large amount stock and obtained an overdraft from Commonwealth Bank. Later Mr Garvan was appointed to the Commonwealth the Batik Board. In regard to the charges made against hi in. to-night, it is for Government to say whether or not anywere thing wrong was done. It can make inquiries and explain the transacpatriots""' tion to the House later, but I repeat there is surely less danger in the control of the bank by a body of directors than in edged securities. the absolute control by one man, no matter how competent he may he. I deprecate some of the speeches made to-night hy honourable members opposite, particularly is a soldier's hat. as the charge is based upon an assumption. If I had not heen prevented from attending the House last week owing indisposition, I would have supported the motion for an inquiry into the relations community, do in the Great War? between Mr Mark Young and the acthave ing governor of the bank, because believe, from the information I have - obtained, that a prima facie case has been made out. But some honourable .members - opposite who have, been prominent in making charges agaiust the Government and the bank, did .not support that inquiry.

""What did .these so called patriots, who are today fleecing the We had a revelation of it today, and I remarks such as those made hy the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) apparently '''got under the s k in "" of the Treasurer and those who support these "" pocket, patriots."" ""We were told that money was a good soldier, and that the sacrifices should be equal. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) has told us of the great sacrifice he made. What did it amount to? He purchased 5 per cent, bonds on money advanced to him by the bank, which was paid back in instalments. But the honourable member is hanging on to the interest aa strongly today as many other so-called patriots. What are we told when an appeal is made on behalf of an ex-soldier suffering from tuberculosis? We are informed that we are unable to .prove that his health was undermined during the war.. How often have we to approach the Eepatriation Department, and plead on behalf of Australia's manhood who went overseas to fight, and who now cannot get that consideration to which they are entitled? I know of one man living on the charity of the soldier's fund, and I cannot get the Eepatriation Department to admit its liability. Some doctors have recommended that he should receive the benefit of the doubt, his disability is due to war service, and yet no satisfaction can be obtained from the authorities. The Minister has said that we cannot prove that he was in hospital at Codford when he said he was there, because there was no hospital for pneumonia patients, although the soldier avers that be then suffered from pneumonia. The man concerned has been living on charity, and. is now dying. Another, who was living at Galway Gardens, a suburb in Adelaide, died a fortnight ago. He could not - obtain assistance because he could not prove that he was ill in England or in France.

168,Mr YATES,PROPOSED TELEPHONE,"I am not mentioning that. I do not want anything for myself, but have always said that every one suffering from war disabilities should be fairly treated by the Government. The liability is a diminishing one, as it will cease to exist before very many years, but our loan liabilities will never cease. There is another case which I wish to as place on record. A lady was sent to me hy a school teacher, who, I presume, was made aware of her position by the children who attended the school. Her husband had blown out his brains. She went to the repatriation office to apply for a war widow's pension, and she was told that her husband was not killed in action. She told me that he had not had a day's good health since he returned. He had been in Bedford Park Sanatorium, and eventually he finished the work that Eritz had begun. Yet they had the effrontery to tell her that he was not killed in action! If that is so, then I do not know of any man who was. When I made representations, the pension was granted to her. It should not be left to any member of Parliament to speak on 'behalf of an incapacitated soldier who has seen service in the line. I hope that the Government will agree to an inquiry being instituted so that those who contributed funds for the prosecution of the war will be subject to the treatment that is meted out to the soldiers who actually did the fighting. When a soldier seeks a pqpsion he has to prove up to the hilt that he is clean. If he has come back with syphilis he is told that that is not a war complaint. By heaven, it was! These officials ought to have experienced the temptations to which the men were subjected. If the Government did the right thing it would say, "" That is our concern. If you had not gone oversea you would not have contracted that disease, because you would not have been subjected to the temptation."" been amongst these things. I am not a painted lily. I saw all that there was to be seen whilst I was over there. It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to succour to the end every soldier who is suffering from any complaint.
