1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 2 pm and read prayers. NA,17
2,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Defence Personnel will be absent from question time today as he is addressing the RSL New South Wales State Congress. The Minister for Defence Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency will answer questions on his behalf. NA Budget,17
3,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that Kevin Markle, author of the University of North Carolina report used to accuse the mining sector of being tax avoiders, has told the Australian online that the data was dumped from a subsequent version because the sample was too small and could have involved as few as four companies? Will the Prime Minister now apologise to Australia's 4,290 resource companies for attacking their reputation? Does he now accept that sending out the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister with such flimsy evidence has made the government look foolish and irresponsible, and will he now release all Treasury and ATO modelling or is he afraid that the real evidence will fatally undermine his great big new tax on mining?",17
4,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition. It goes to the fundamental need to reform the tax system for the Australian mining industry and to use the revenues which would come from that reform to fund better super for all Australians, better tax cuts for all nesses and, on top of that, better investment in Australian infrastructure for the future. The Leader of the Opposition refers to the effective tax rates for particular mining companies and the industry at large. I draw his attention to a Treasury Roundup article released today which says that Treasury's analysis shows that the resources sector faces an average company tax rate about 12 per cent lower than the average tax rate across all industries. This is because of the very generous tax concessions that the mining sector enjoys, which reduces their headline rate of company tax. A separate Treasury minute to the Treasurer notes that the average company tax rate for the mining sector was 17 per cent in the decade of 2004-05, compared with 19 per cent for construction, 27 per cent for transport and 29 per cent for finance. The Treasury minute notes that the findings in the Roundup article for mining are similar to those in the Markle and Shackelford 2009 paper. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition acquaint himself with economic fact rather than simply act as the puppet of the MCA in this place. Foreign Affairs: Australian Passports",17
5,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. How has the government responded to the fraudulent use of Australian passports? Are there any ongoing risks to the integrity of Australia's passport system and to Australia's national security interests?,17
6,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,17
7,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. The question was about the fraudulent use of Australian passportsMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I would ask that the member withdraw that comment. Mr Lindsay-It was not a comment; it Australian busiwas a question.",17
8,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House will know that that was outside the standing orders because it was an interjection. I have to decide whether it was unparliamentary. It was not helpful, but I will not seek its withdrawal. Certainly, the particular member involved and other members should learn that the tolerance that is given to them and that can be disguised as robustness can cause this chamber to disintegrate very quickly. Having had a concern raised with me about the comment, I will certainly be listening very carefully to the continuing actions by way of interjection that do not assist the chamber.",18
9,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not hear the interjection, so it is of no moment to me. The question was about the fraudulent use of Australian passports, the risks to the integrity of the Australian passport system and the risks to Australia's national interest, as my statement to the House yesterday refers. The government is in no doubt that Israel was responsible for the fraud involving Australian passports connected with the assassination in Dubai of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. While Israel is and was a firm friend of Australia, this action was not the act of a friend, and I have made that point consistently. Regrettably, this was not the first time that rael has misused Australian passports. That occurred previously. As a consequence of that breach, an understanding was reached between Australian and Israeli agencies that this would not be repeated. So what has occurred is in express and direct breach of an understanding reached between Australian and Israeli agencies during the period of the previous government. The government's decision and judgment in this matter have been based at all times on national security considerations and, importantly, on the advice of relevant national security agencies-the Australian Federal Police, ASIO, ASIS and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Both the government's consideration and those agencies' considerations have involved very careful, exhaustive investigations and assessments, careful consideration and the weighting of the importance to Australia's national security of the integrity of our passport system. No government can guarantee that any passport system is foolproof but, equally, no government can stand idly by and turn a blind eye when anyone, including a foreign government, another country, fraudulently abuses the integrity of our passport system and abuses our trust and our confidence. The advice that was given to me and to the National Security Committee of the Cabinet yesterday was in substance the same advice given to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for foreign affairs. She received a briefing yesterday. It is the second briefing that she has received on this matter; she received a briefing from agencies when the matter first came to public attention. I was surprised in March when the Leader of the Opposition in response to a newspaper interview, before the completion of the AFP inquiry and before, as I understand it, any briefing he had, made the public comment Is- that he did not believe the government should take any action in this matter. I thought that was unwise. In these matters I think that you are always best off carefully considering, acting on advice, weighting that advice, and weighing up the heavy responsibility and often difficult judgments about national security considerations. If I was surprised by the Leader of the Opposition, I must say that I was shocked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's response yesterday-absolutely shocked. As I said, yesterday before I got to my feet in the parliament she had received a briefing from relevant security agencies-the Australian Federal Police, ASIO, ASIS and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-and the substance of the briefing was exactly the same as the substance of the briefing which the government itself received. I am asked about risks to these matters. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said that the government's decision was wrong because it was based on political considerations, that it was done for United Nations Security Council purposes, that there is no evidence or proof that Israel was responsible for these matters, and that the government's decision in asking Israel to remove one of its officials from the embassy was an ‘overreaction'. I choose my words carefully. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes a point about evidence. She is aware as a result of the briefing that she received yesterday that, while the decision was not based on evidence of a kind which could lead to law enforcement action before a criminal court, it was a decision based on a considered judgment shared by relevant Australian security agencies. It was also a decision which, she well knows, included reasons and information which, for reasons of national security, I could not share with the Australian public, but which were shared with her by our security agencies. That is why I was absolutely shocked when she conducted herself in the manner in which she did. The decision and the judgment which the Australian government have made have at all times taken into account the national security considerations of the Commonwealth.",18

11,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Order!,19
12,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"She is now complaining that I am asserting that she breached the confidentiality of the briefing. am not saying that. In the face of a briefing, you went out and said that the reasons the government has made this decision are, firstly, for political considerations and, secondly, for United Nations Security Council considerations. Thirdly, you said it was an overreaction. Let me make this point to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: when she received the briefing from the national security agencies, as did the government, none of those national security agencies had in their minds when they were carefully weighting their advice to the government what she would describe as ‘political considerations' or the United Nations Security Council. They had in their minds, as did the government, the integrity of our passport system, the protection of our national security interest, and what you have done in your response yesterday and today has shown that you are not fit to occupy a position of trust in the national security environment.",19
13,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will refer his remarks through the chair.,19

17,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister for Foreign Affairs will resume his seat and he will continue when the House is quiet. The Minister for Foreign Affairs may continue.,19
18,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have also seen the assertion that somehow this was the first occasion in which an Australian government has asked the Israeli embassy to remove an officer. This is not true. Ms Julie Bishop-I didn't say that.,19
19,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not saying that you said it. I have seen the assertion. The assertion was made to me on television. I In 2004 when the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were cabinet ministers, the previous government on the advice of the national security agencies asked the Israeli embassy to remove an officer for national security reasons of which, for example, the member for Berowra is well aware. On that occasion there was no assertion from anyone that somehow this was done for political considerations or other motivations. Historically in this place people have understood the framework of national security considerations within which we work. I do not like to see national security considerations become a political football, but that is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has done. That is not the context in which the Labor Party when in opposition responded when for national security considerations on the basis of national security agency advice the previous government asked the Israeli embassy to remove an officer. We did not turn that into a political football-and the examples are comparable. When governments seriously, sensibly, carefully make national security considerations they do so after carefully weighing up the advice from the national security agencies and that is what we did. I am asked about risks. There is a substantial and significant risk to the national security interests of the Commonwealth. There is a substantial and significant risk to the integsuper rity of our passport system. If what we have seen and if what we have considered is not enough for the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to regard appropriate action being taken, action more than an expression of concern, what is required in their view? What do we need to see to destroy the integrity of our passport system? What do we need to see to destroy our national security interest? What do we need to see to have an attack upon our sovereignty before they would act? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has shown by her response to this matter that she is not fit to occupy a position sitting around the National Security Committee of the Cabinet. NA",19
20,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a delegation led by Dr Joseph Muscat, Leader of the Opposition of the Republic of Malta. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Budget",20
21,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I refer to the facts in the Treasury paper upon which you relied in your previous answer, a report which concludes that the mining industry has paid less tax than any other sector over the past decade. Can the Prime Minister explain why the report relied on data that was six years old? When the latest data from 200708 is used, it shows that the mining sector represents just over seven per cent of income generated by all companies but accounts for 14 per cent of all company tax paid.",20
22,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the question from the opposition on tax reform and the benefits to which that reform would be put-better for working Australians, less tax for Australian companies, tax breaks for small business and investment in infrastructure.  of order. I am sure you listened to the question. You would be well aware that the answer that the Prime Minister is giving could not possibly be relevant to a specific question about company tax receipts versus the income that they generate. He is answering a question about the apparent benefits for which the tax would be used. Please bring him back to the question.",20
23,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did listen to the question. I was trying to listen to the answer, but there was so much hubbub that it was very difficult. I will listen to the Prime Minister's response. He understands the requirement to be relevant to the question. The Prime Minister has the call. He will be heard in silence.",21
24,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Goldstein refers to a paper entitled Disparities in average rates of company tax across industries. The authors are as specified earlier. I recall question yesterday from the member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer, asking for the government to bring forward substantiating material concerning the government's position on current tax arrangements for the mining industry. In response to that request yesterday, the Treasury brought forward a Treasury note. And in response to that the member for Goldstein stands up and objects to its contents because it concludes that the average company tax rate of the mining sector was 17 per cent in the decade to 2004-05. That is precisely what I said before. It compares that to construction, at 19 per cent; transport, at 27 per cent; and finance, at 29 per cent. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition read the paper from the Treasury, digest its contents and stop simply acting as the mouthpiece of the MCA. I suggest he undertake some independent research, which might be in the national economic interest.",21
25,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Why is reform of the tax system important for Australian families? How have recent proposals been received?,21
26,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Deakin very much for his question. This government believes in a strong economy. It is a government which believes in ensuring that the strength of our economy underpins a fair go for all Australians and enables us to protect Australian jobs. Mr Laming-Like insulation workers.,21
27,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bowman is warned!,21
28,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has kept the Australian economy strong during the global economic recession by preventing it from going into recession. The opposition said, ‘Do nothing.' The opposition said that it was better in effect for the Australian economy to stand unprotected from the ravages of the a global recession. The Leader of the Opposition said that his prescription for the future was to do what New Zealand did. What New Zealand did was to go into recession for 1¼ years. Secondly, the Australian government is keeping the Australian economy strong, as underpinned by the delivery of the government's budget, which halves net peak debt, which brings back the budget to surplus in three years time, three years ahead of time. This is a core achievement in keeping the economy strong. Despite all we saw with the three-ring circus last week from those opposite, masquerading as a budget reply, those opposite still cannot nominate the year in which they would return the budget to surplus. Thirdly, the government is keeping the economy strong by continuing its program of implementing long-term reforms in the economy. That means reforms through the Budget education revolution, reforms in nationbuilding infrastructure and reforms also in creating a seamless national economy-all of which are designed to lift productivity growth. That includes also the reform of the taxation system. There is one core fact about our proposed reform of the tax system-that is, it asks mining companies to pay a fairer share to the Australian people for the resource which the Australian people ultimately own. Furthermore, it says that the revenue derived from that fairer share will then be used to fund better super for working families. It will also be used to fund tax cuts for all Australian businesses-for small business in particular-and will be used for investing in our future infrastructure needs. For the economy at large, what this means is boosting our global competitiveness by bringing the Australian company tax rate down, boosting our national savings-a very big buffer in times of global economic crisis-and, on top of that, ensuring that we have a consistent national taxation regime for the mining industry, as opposed to the patchwork of royalties regimes which are based on volumes rather than profits, and that assists the mining industry to grow over time. Mention has already been made in question time today of the contribution to our national interest of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I also refer to further comments she has made in the national economic interest, in this case, when it comes to this debate on tax. Yesterday she said the mining industry did not need to pay more tax. Contrary to what the WA Liberal Premier has said, which is that the mining industry is getting away with blue murder, and contrary to the fact that we have even the CEO of Woodside saying that mining companies can pay more tax, instead what we have is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying that, in effectMs Julie Bishop-In effect!",21
29,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice the interjection from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She contests the accuracy of what I have just said. I draw the attention of the House to the following: Question: Given their profits and the fact that these are our resources, they are not renewable, are they paying enough tax? Deputy Leader of the Opposition: I believe that they are paying a fair amount of tax. Any suggestion that that is misleading or misrepresenting the Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggests to me that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is having a casual relationship with the truth. I go back to the core position which she advances. Despite what the Liberal Premier of WA says and despite what everyone else says, she has said on behalf of the opposition that the mining industry is paying enough tax. Well, there is a new development, and I turn to no-one other than Senator Barnaby Joyce. Let's hear it for Barnaby! Barnaby entered the debate today as the shadow minister for infrastructure-onya, Barnaby! Question to Barnaby: So you believe that the mining industry shouldn't have to pay more tax than it is at the moment? I just want to clarify that point. Senator Joyce: I'm prepared for people to look at the mining sector to pay more tax. So in the space of 24 hours we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying they pay enough tax and we have the shadow minister for infrastructure saying that in fact they can pay more tax, and should pay more tax. Two contradictory positions within 24 hours. Of course, there is the third position on tax. It is the Leader of the Opposition's position on tax, which is that he is going to tax the mining companies anyway through his great new big tax on everybody in order to fund his PPL. Three different tax positions. Coalition tax policy No. 1: the Julie policy, which says they should not have to pay any more tax.",22
30,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,22
31,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Coalition tax policy No. 2: the Senator Barnaby Joyce policy, which says the mining companies should pay more tax. Coalition tax policy No. 3: the Leader of the Opposition's policy, which says they will be paying more tax, it is just that they are going to be paying it through the PPL. What we have seen is complete shambles and chaos on the part of those opposite, not just last week in delivering their budget reply but also in the coherence of their tax policy. With each policy they have outlined-1, 2 and 3-it fundamentally contradicts the others; it cancels out the one that had been delivered just before. I say to those opposite: if you are serious about managing a budget, you have got to get a budget reply right; if you are serious about a tax policy, you have got to have one policy not three policies; if you are serious about managing an economy, you have got to demonstrate some interest in the economy; and if you cannot even manage your party on tax policy, what hope have you got of managing the country?

33,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the paper he has referred to from Treasury officials which states, ‘The electricity, gas and water industry contributed a mere 0.2 per cent of corporate tax collections in 2004-05,' which is obviously far less than the mining industry. Prime Minister, given the below average tax rates of the electricity, gas and water industry, according to the paper you referred to, is this sector next in line for a great big new tax?

36,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We would hope in this parliament that the man who puts himself forward as the alternative Treasurer of Australia would actually sit down and do some economic work. In the course of the last week we have not seen an economic team at work; we have seen a three-ring circus. The member for Goldstein said that the Leader of the Opposition would answer all questions on the budget and return to surplus. He did not do it. The Leader of the Opposition said that the member for North Sydney would do it. He did not do it. The member for North Sydney said the member for Goldstein would do it. Then the member for Goldstein eventually did it, until his press secretary told him to stop. We welcome a special media award being established in the name of Robbie's press secretary, because I believe he is a man of direct action, to paraphrase",23
37,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,23
38,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"a comment used by the Leader of the Opposition before. The member for North Sydney asked a question about the taxation treatment of utilities in this country. He knows full well that, because of the nature of utilities and the accelerated depreciation on large assets within that sector, it has a particular set of taxation arrangements-anyone knows that-because of the fundamental role utilities provide in the economy for the provision of basic services. The member for North Sydney should listen carefully to what people like Peter Costello have said before, when he said in response to the PRRT that that is the sort of tax on profits we need for this country for the future. That is why he kept it in place, for the entire period that he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth, as a resource rent tax based on profits, not based on volume. Not only did he say that but the former Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer, said that as well. In fact, those of a reformist bent of mind responsible for economic policy on the benches opposite in times past have stood behind that principle as it goes to the PRRT. John Hewson, a previous Leader of the Liberal Party, has come out in support of the RSPT concept as a new resource tax as it relates to onshore resources, as has John Brogden, the former Liberal Party leader in New South Wales. It is very easy for the member for North Sydney to stand up and just deliver a scare campaign. That is what they seem to do. But when it comes to core economic reform, the serious contributions of the likes of Peter Costello and others in the past, and the commentary by John Hewson and others formerly associated with the Liberal Party on the proposal now before the nation, it is time that the member for North Sydney actually sat down and did a bit of work rather than just engage in populist low-rent politics. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the paper titled Disparities in average rates of company tax across industries, which has at the bottom: The views in this article are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the Australian Treasury. Leave not granted.",23
39,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Why is accurate accounting of proposed budget savings vital to returning the budget to surplus?,24
40,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lowe for his question. It is certainly true that accurate accounting for proposals for savings is critical to returning the budget to surplus. Members will be aware that over some months I have been asking the opposition to put forward its savings proposals that would back up its claims to returning the budget to surplus more quickly than the government proposes to do. Last week, in a highly entertaining threering circus, as the Prime Minister described it, we finally got an outcome after the member for Goldstein indicated that the savings would be in the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply. The Leader of the Opposition then indicated in his budget reply that they would be in the shadow Treasurer's speech to the National Press Club. Then the shadow Treasurer, at his speech to the Press Club, said they would be in a subsequent press conference from the member for Goldstein. We finally got a statement on proposed budget savings from the opposition. At first light it had a very big number on it. It had a very big headline number of $46.7 billion. Initially, I was almost impressed by this. I thought, ‘Gee, they have done all right here.' But, unfortunately, I then started to read the savings proposals and, sadly, they did not stand up to much scrutiny. In fact, if you took that $46.7 billion and rubbed out the ‘4' then you would still have an overstatement of the net impact on the budget bottom line. You could take out the digit ‘4'and you would still have an overstatement on the beneficial impact on the budget bottom line of the proposed savings of the opposition. Budget Let me run through a few examples. First-and most egregiously-they quote their proposal to not proceed with the government's resource super profits tax as a saving. A small bit of news for the opposition and their economic gurus: when you cancel out tax revenue, that is not a saving to the budget; that is a loss to the budget. So $12 billion straight off the top has gone-dead. Next, we have capital savings. They do concede in the fine print that these do not hit the budget bottom line, so there is a total of $22 billion. These are simply figures that the opposition have made up. There is no substantiation for their proposed sale price for Medibank Private and there is no substantiation for the $18 billion they claim would be removed from the budget by not proceeding with the capital item for the National Broadband Network. Then we have $3.5 billion worth of proposed savings that have a little asterisk beside them. It is a very small asterisk: it be about four point. There is a very small note at the bottom that says, ‘These items may be used to finance coalition commitments in the same area.' In other words, they will not really be savings; they are going to spend the money by rebadging these things or in a different way. Then there is $2.4 billion of claimed savings on interest from the refusal to proceed with the National Broadband Network. This is a figure that has simply been plucked out of thin air-created, fictitious and has no substantiation or reflection in any budget items. Then we have the proposed freeze on the Australian Public Service. That has morphed around a bit. A few things have been added here and there that would not be subject to the freeze but, allegedly, that saves $3.8 lion. Unfortunately, the opposition neglected to note that when you freeze Public Service numbers in enforcement agencies-for example, people in the Australian Taxation Office chasing tax avoidance activities-you lose revenue. The estimate of the equivalent loss of revenue as a result of cutting back on staff chasing people like tax avoiders and welfare rorters is $2.1 billion in lost revenue. Finally, there are a few classic proposals, a few absolutely sensational proposals, supposedly cutting back on Public Service travel, government advertising and consultancies. The interesting thing about all these proposals, which add up to about $800 million, is that they are all areas where spending has been cut back very substantially by this government after the massive explosion in spending by the Howard government. The same people who let spending blow out are now claiming that they will be able to reduce spending below the level to which it has already been cut by the Rudd government. The savings package is totally phoney. I note that I am not the only person who would was less than impressed by the performance of the member for Goldstein in presenting this savings package at his press conference. In fact, his own media adviser, who I think is named Nicholas Troja, did not seem to like the proposition much either because he spent most of his time doing this or doing this and turning away. It is on YouTube and it is really worth a look. I am delighted that the member for Goldstein is employing people who are obviously concerned about fiscal responsibility. It is just a pity he is not taking their advice. If the opposition want to be treated seriously on these matters, they have got a lot more work to do.",24

57,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to a report by one of the world's to largest investment advisers, Citigroup, and I quote: The mining industry has one of the lowest dividend yields amongst the Australian industries. Over the last 10 years, mining companies have reinvested around 75 per cent of their cash generation back in country through royalties, taxes or capital investment. Miners reinvest in growth, creating jobs and wealth creation for a country. We believe the proposed resources super profits tax will likely limit their abilities to reinvest. On what basis does the Prime Minister still believe that this big new tax on mining will create more jobs and more investment?",26
58,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the question on the resources super profits tax, because it is a core element of the government's tax reform plans for better super for working families, lower tax for small business and, of course, investing in infrastructure.

59,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will refer to members by their titles.,27
60,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am just checking whether it was. As the member for North Sydney would know, there would be a range of opinions on the impact of the government's proposed taxation arrangements when it comes to the mining sector in particular and the economy in general. I draw the honourable member's attention to a note released today by Macquarie Research Strategy, by Rory Robertson, which says: So Canberra's objective today is not so much to increase taxes on the resources sector as simply return payments to the public purse from mining company profits to the sorts of shares observed less than a decade ago. The bottom line is this: when it comes to the return to the Australian taxpayer from the mining sector, 10 years ago one dollar in every three in profits came back to the taxpayer through royalties; 10 years later, one dollar in seven comes back to the taxpayer through royalties. The Leader of the Opposition asked a question about corporate taxwell, come in, spinner!-because if you add the royalties to resource taxes and the company tax rate, in 1999-2000 to 2003-04, you will have royalties, resource taxes and company tax representing 55 per cent in profits and, in 2008-09, you will have royalties, resource taxes and company tax representing 27 per cent of profits. This is the data contained in this research note from Macquarie Research, which was just put out today. The bottom line is that the total tax take of these companies, including all forms of tax, when measured against profits has halved over the last decade. What we stand for as a government, therefore, is to get a fair share back for the Australian people from a resource which is owned by the Australian people. Miners do deserve a fair share for their investment, and the Australian people deserve a fair share because the resource is also owned by them. But, given that the member for North Sydney has asked this question about clarity concerning our tax policy and its impact, it is only fair for me to conclude by asking: what actually is the tax policy of those opposite? Is it Julie's policy? Is it Barnaby's policy? Is it Julie's policy, which says that the mining industry is paying enough tax, or Barnaby's policy, which says that they should be paying more tax? Maybe what we should do, given this lack of clarity, is get it in writing from to the Leader of the Opposition, because we then know it will be the full, gospel truth as to what the tax policy of those opposite is. At present, it is chaos and confusion. Budget",27
61,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. How does the average tax paid by mining companies compare with that paid by other sectors of our economy?,27
62,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for that very important question because we have been having a discussion about this in various ways through question time today. Of course what the government has done is outlined a plan to modernise our taxation system particularly as it applies to non-renewable mineral resources. Those opposite do not seem to have the most basic understanding of why a resource superprofits tax should be replacing royalties. They do not seem to understand to begin with that royalties are there as a charge for non-renewable mineral resources. That is, they are 100 per cent owned by the Australian people. That is what is different about royalties; they are 100 per cent owned by the Australian people and they are, of course, a non-renewable resource. Once they are dug up they are gone forever. That is why mining companies must pay royalties. But royalties do not give to the Australian people the value they deserve and they have not been giving to the Australian people the value they are due in recent years. Even the mining industry accepts that there is a case to increase the charge for the underlying value of those resources that are 100 per cent owned by the Australian people. Even the most extreme elements of the mining industry are acknowledging there is a case for a profits based tax. Even the Minerals Council of Australia acknowledges that. The only people who do not acknowledge that are the Liberal and National parties in this House. The shadow Treasurer came in before and talked about effective rates across various industries. He does not seem to understand that the only industry in the country that gets access to a non-renewable resource that is 100 per cent publicly owned is the mining industry. It is not the transport industry is not the finance industry. None of those industries get their input for nothing and they do not get land for nothing. The shadow Treasurer is so ignorant he does not seem to understand that there needs to be a special charge, which is separate from company tax, that gives the Australian people the value of those resources that they 100 per cent own. Those opposite do not even understand this most basic fact. If they do not understand that fact how could they run an economy or a country? They could not even be held in respect by the mining industry. We know what disrespect they have for themselves because they have sold out to the mining industry on this very question. The Prime Minister before was talking about Mr Rory Robertson from Macquarie Bank. He has put out a report today which I think is very illustrative, so we might just go through it for a while. This is what he has to say: Only the most naive investor could have imagined that the final prices the mining sector receives from world markets for publicly owned resources could increase by multiples over a decade. And yet governments effectively would keep selling those same resources to mining companies at the same low prices, at effective prices, that were generally set a decade ago. So those people opposite want to continue charging the same price that is a decade old because they are not prepared to stand up to mining companies and say the Australian people deserve fair value for their mineral resources which are 100 per cent owned by them and are non renewable. What this reform is about is economic reform for the future to create prosperity for all Australians-Australians in small business; Australians elsewhere in large business; Australians who want to save for their retirement and Australians who want investment in infrastructure. That is what this reform is and it about. It is the big economic reform that Australia needs to go forward so we can prosper in the Asian century. But, of course, those opposite do not understand any of that. Then they buy the line that has been given to them by the mining industry; the line that somehow effective rates on the mining industry are as high as the rest of the effective rates across other sectors. Everybody in industry knows this one basic fact: that the mining industry does get access to generous concessions. We on this side of the House do not contest that but the mining industry should not claim they do not so that they can run around the country and claim that our RSPT produces tax rates as high as 58 per cent, which it clearly does not. It is true that very profitable companies will pay more and many companies will pay less under our proposal. We have a fair proposal here which will deliver fair value to the Australian people. But those opposite, who have sold out to sections of the mining industry, have yet again demonstrated how they do not understand Australia's national interest.",27
63,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to criticism of his big new tax on mining from Mr John Ralph AC, formerly chief executive of CRA, director of BHP, chairman of the Commonwealth Bank, former president of the Business Council of Australia and chairman of the Ralph report into corporate tax reform. Mr Ralph says: A decision to impose a 40 per cent tax rate on earnings above the bond rate will reduce future investment … He goes on to say: Only those projects with a very high projected return would proceed. A suggestion that an increase in taxation would result in an increase in investment could only be made by somebody not living in the real world. Does the Prime Minister agree with his Treasurer who said yesterday that critics of the mining tax are ‘either lying to you or they are ignorant'. Prime Minister, is Mr Ralph lying or is he ignorant?",29
64,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I again thank the member for North Sydney for his question on the resource super profits tax, because we all know how important tax reform is for the future strength of the Australian economy and, on top of that, for ensuring that working Australians get better super in the future and small businesses get a tax cut as opposed to a tax rise. Mr Speaker, can I say to the member for North Sydney as he continues in this debate: it follows .as night follows day that there are going to be a range of opinions from leaders from both within the mining sector and beyond the mining sector in corporate Australia and, depending upon the branch of corporate Australia, their individual views on this will vary. You have seen comments in recent times by Roger Corbett. You have seen comments in recent times by a range of individuals like Bernie Fraser, who is the former Budget Governor of the Reserve Bank and the former Secretary to the Treasury. You have seen a range of comments from all sorts of people engaged in this debate. But what I would go back to is this: the underlining rationale for a resource rent tax of this nature is to provide an incentive for those companies, particularly those who are less profitable in their early years, to expand the basis of the industry by ensuring that they have appropriate forms of tax write-off for the way in which their investments are handled. That is what the rationale is for a tax based on profits rather than a tax based on volumes. That is why the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, supported the PRRT. Those opposite, led by the member for Groom yesterday, stood up in this place and said that the PRRT was somehow no longer supported by those opposite. They had 12 years to change that tax.

68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Incidental to the point of order, if people on my left wish members to be referred to by their parliamentary titles, we should remember that at all stages. The question had a fairly lengthy preamble. It contained argument-I make that by way of observation-which I have allowed because I have been allowing it. The precedent has been allowed. The Prime Minister is responding to the question. He shall relate his material to the question.",29
69,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the question raised by the member for North Sydney went directly to the impact of the proposed tax arrangements on future investment in the industry, and he cited one particular former mining executive, Mr Ralph, as his authority. Various mining executives will express a range of views on this matter. Mr Don Voelte, the CEO of Woodside, has expressed a view in recent times. He indicated that in fact mining companies could pay more. There are a range of opinions within the mining industry; there are a range of opinions within the general business community. But I go back to the former proposition. The first point is: should mining companies be paying more tax? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says no. The shadow minister for infrastructure says yes. What does the Leader of the Opposition say? We do not know, because their policy flips and flops in between. Ms Julie Bishop-We oppose your tax.",30
70,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may be against our tax. I am not sure that the shadow minister for infrastructure is necessarily of the view that the mining industry should not be paying more. Look at his statements from earlier today. The second point I would make in response to the member for North Sydney's question is-and he knows this infinitely well-that the whole point of a profits based tax as opposed to a volume based tax is to encourage the expansion of the industry. That is why, if he bothered to search the record of an illustrious predecessor of his-that is, the former Treasurer of the Commonwealth, Peter Costello-and looked at his remarks on the architecture of the petroleum resource rent tax, he would see that the former Treasurer understands and grasps the core significance of ensuring that it assists industry to expand. Let me quote what Peter Costello had to say: The idea of the PRRT, when it was introduced-I think it was actually introduced by the Labor Party … from memoryHe is right on that it was certainly introduced by the Labor Party … that the petroleum extractors would be taxed on their profits, except to the degree that they used it for new production or other exploration. In fact, that is a good policy aim. In other words, Mr Costello, the then Treasurer of the Commonwealth, was saying that a tax on profits is in fact a more rational approach and a more efficient approach to the taxation of the sector-that is, a tax on volume. That leads me to the third point: the modelling produced through Econtech contained in the Treasury's report on the day that the tax policy was released was of a type which concluded that the overall activity in the mining sector would increase by 5.5 per cent over time as a consequence of the total tax package which is being introduced. No. 1: we have a clear tax policy. The opposition currently have three tax policies on the run at once. No. 2: we believe the mining industry should pay more. We do not know where those opposite stand on that particular question. No. 3: we believe that the best way of taxing the mining industry is on profits rather than volumes because it is the best way to generate future growth and expansion in what has been and what will be a great industry for Australia. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the article by Mr Ralph titled ‘Retrospective tax a risk to national sovereignty'. Leave not granted. Budget",30
71,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy. Minister, how does the proposed resource super profits tax ensure that Australians get a fairer return from the resources industry and how does this differ from existing royalty regimes?",30
72,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hunter for the question. His question goes to the heart of this debate. It is about how we as a nation put in place a modern resources tax system for a modern nation. The real debate, as I said yesterday, about how much tax we collect, who collects it and under what system it is collected. The Australian community-unlike the opposition-understands that the time has come for this debate. The Minerals Council of Australia is also, as I have indicated to the House previously, up for this debate-unlike the opposition. It argued in its submission to the Henry tax review that, ‘There is a strong argument to reform the basis of determining royalty regimes to a profit based criteria from a revenue based system.' I say that because it is well understood that the existing type of royalty scheme as applied currently in the mining sector creates a lose-lose situation for industry and for the Australian community. The royalties framework is bad for business and potentially worse for the Australian community. During difficult times-and let us be frank-it has and could continue to send companies to the wall. In good times such as over recent years when prices were high, the community missed out on the benefits of the boom because royalties remained fixed and stuck in the past-just like the opposition led by Tony Abbott is stuck in the past and unable to front up to the hard and tough debate on tax reform.",31
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,31
74,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is simply proposing to put in place a stable fiscal regime, a regime that is much fairer to industry and certainly much fairer to the Australian community. I ask the House to think about the operation of this royalty regime in past years. Let us think back to the start of this century, when we had a royalties regime in placeMr Hunt interjecting",31
75,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not that long ago in terms of the time horizons of is the member for Flinders. Let us go to the application of state royalties across a range of state and territory boundaries. Time and time again we had resource companies approaching state and territory governments for holidays from payment of royalties or potentially time for them to pay off their royalties because times were tough. One example that springs to mind is a project that Andrew Forrest was once involved with, the Murrin Murrin project. They approached the Western Australian government for royalty relief. I have no doubt that a profit based system would have been beneficial to that project. The industry has acknowledged that it is time for reform. They want a profit based system. They have had enough of the royalty based system. And that is not just my view; it is also the view of the broader Australian community. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting",31
76,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The industry also appreciates that they have a capacity to pay more tax. That is not just my view-I notice that the member for Curtin has a little bit to say, and I will come to her in a minute-but also the view of the Western Australian Premier. Perhaps next Saturday when she drops into Peppermint Grove for a cup of coffee she should talk to the Western Australian Premier about his view. I am well informed that the Western Australian Premier proposes to take from Rio and BHP in the next financial year something in the order of $800 million in increases in royalties. That amounts to about $3.2 billion over the forward estimates. But what is the opposition's view? The Western Australian Premier has pretty fixed views. I will take the House to the Hansard of the Western Australian parliament of 25 February. He said: As members are aware, I have put it to both BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto that I believe time is overdue and that they should be paying full min- time. ing royalties on the many hundreds of millions of tonnes of iron ore that they produce. He then went on to say: I have to say that a few people who work around the mining industry came up to me over the summer and said: ‘By the way, Colin, the mining companies are getting away with murder; they are not paying enough.' A number of people who work in the mining industry have said that. That is what the Premier of Western Australia said. That takes me to where the opposition are. What a mess; what a dog's breakfast we have on the other side of the House at the moment with respect to this complex and important debate. Let me start with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who once held the exalted position of shadow Treasurer. Opposition representatives like the member for Flinders and the member for Dickson soon saw her off. I refer to what the member for Curtin said last night. She said, ‘I believe they are paying a fair amount of tax.' Perhaps she should convey that to the state member for the seat in which she lives, the Western Australian Premier and Treasurer, Colin Barnett. Then we have yet another position, that of my dear friend the member for Groom. What did he have to say both yesterday and today? He said, ‘If there needs to be a royalty change, it should be done by the states.' So he is up for higher tax, unlike the member for Curtin. That is exactly what the Western Australian Premier and Treasurer is arguing and exactly what the current government is arguing: the mining companies have a capacity to pay more tax and the Australian community need to get a fair return for the development of their resources. But it gets better. Perhaps Colin Barnett has been listening to Senator Joyce, someone who the member for Goldstein likes to ridicule on a regular basis. Let us go to what Senator Barnaby now Joyce had to say on Sky television at lunch of order on relevance. This answer has now been going for over seven minutes, which seems completely excessive. How could it still be relevant? If the minister cannot answer a question in four minutes, he needs to get out of his",31
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat. In a general sense, if there were less interjecting perhaps the minister would ignore the interjections and the answer would not be as long. On the matter of relevance, he is responding to the question, but I am sure that he is bringing his answer to a conclusion. The minister has the call.",32
78,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Absolutely, Mr Speaker. It actually takes some time to go through all the different policy positions on the other side of the House. But let us go to Senator Barnaby Joyce: ‘I'm prepared for the people to look at the mining sector to pay more tax.' I must say I am starting to try and think through what is the opposition's real position. What is the gospel truth? Do these views all represent considered views drafted by the Leader of the Opposition, as he stands there checking the weather vane to assess where to jump from day to day on what is a complex tax debate. Clearly, the opposition is totally focused not on a policy debate that we have to have. It is unprepared to accept the view of the government that there should be a reasonable super profits tax put in place. The headline will be 40 per cent. The tax will also ensure Australia gets a fair return on our precious non-renewable resources and that we put in place a tax system that further encourages investment. I simply say in conclusion: what we have is an opposition that has sold out lock, stock and barrel to some sections of the mining industry because it is more focused on a return to its own pockets in the form of donations than a complex debate.",32
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will resume his seat. The minister has resumed his seat. Whether he decided to do that himself or as a result of my asking him to is debatable. Mr Ian Macfarlane- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: yesterday you ruled the minister's concluding comment out of order and asked him to withdraw it. It is offensive and ask him to withdraw it.",33
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I understand that. I remember that and, as much as I could through the hubbub, I attempted to listen carefully to the concluding remarks that I then decided I would shut down. But I think I would allow the words that were used on this occasion to go through as a debating point rather than something that was over the top. Mr Ian Macfarlane- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: the precedent for this was set by your predecessor. When I made a comment in regard to the unions having their hands in the pockets of the then trade minister, I was asked by the Speaker to withdraw it. This is the same type of comment.",33
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I have noted the submission to me by the member for Groom, but I am not changing my position. Budget",33
82,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to criticism of his great big new tax on mining from former Queensland Labor Treasurer Mr Keith De Lacy, a man well known to the Prime Minister from his former life. Mr De Lacy has stated that the Treasurer's claims that the mining sector currently only pays 17 per cent tax are ‘plain wrong' and, ‘I don't know where Mr Swan gets his figures from but they don't bear any resemblance to reality.' Does the Prime Minister agree with the Treasurer, who said yesterday that critics of the mining tax are ‘either lying to you or they are ignorant'? Is Mr De Lacy lying or is he ignorant?",33
83,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. As far as Mr De Lacy is concerned, my recollection is that he is Chairman of Macarthur Coal. I seem to recall that, when the Queensland government last increased coal royalties, the Chairman of I Macarthur Coal objected to that as well. You would expect the chairman of any resource company like that to have a problem with an increase in tax because he would be out there arguing the interest of his particular view and people in industry are doing that at the moment. The other part of the Leader of the National Party's question goes to the overall incidence of taxation. I draw to his attention the contents of the Treasury minute to the Treasurer which notes that the average company tax rate in the mining sector was 17 per cent in the decade of 2004-05, comparing it to construction at 19 per cent, transport at 27 per cent and finance at 29 per cent. One of the reasons-I say this to the member of the National Party in particular-why he should be getting behind this proposal is that a tax on profits is in fact the right way to go. In fact, he could reflect on some of the observations of one of his illustrious predecessors, Tim Fischer, a former Leader of the National Party, in the debate on the resources rent tax back in the nineties. Tim Fischer announced that a coalition would not be opposing the RRT legislation. He went on to say: The clear advantage of an RRT over the old excise and royalties system must be carefully weighed but it is nevertheless an advantage which allows investment decisions to be based more on the quality of the resource. So said Tim Fischer about the RRT back then; so said Peter Costello about the PRRT back then. I say to the Leader of the National Party that when he embraces this position of opposition to an RSPT he is standing in the way of tax breaks for small business, he is standing in the way of better super for the working people in his electorate and he is standing in the way of funding infrastructure. I know how keen the Leader of the National Party is on infrastructure because the Minister for Education, the Deputy Prime Minister, has just given me some happy snaps of the Leader of the National Party on relevance: the Prime Minister was asked a question about whether Mr De Lacy was a liar or whether he was ignorant. These photographs he wants to wave around in his juvenile and pathetic props display should not be relevant to the question.",33
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The Manager of Opposition Business has not helped his case. The Prime Minister has the call.,34
85,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker Mr Truss- Mr Speaker, on a point order: the Prime Minister's photographs have nothing whatever to do with the mining tax. They are irrelevant.",34
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the Nationals will resume his seat. With the House now having come to order, I will observe what use is made of props in this answer. I would suggest to some people that the banter they have is just not helpful at all. The Prime Minister has the call. He understands the requirement to relate the material in his answer to the question.",34
87,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the National Party's question went to Macarthur Coal, it went to comments by Mr De Lacy, it went to the whole question of the RSPT as proposed by the government and therefore the purposes to which the revenue obtained by the RSPT would be put. I would simply say to the Leader of the National Party: it is important to be consistent in public policy. You either stand for the proper funding of future infrastructure or you say one thing in Canberra, which is to oppose infrastructure investments of the type contained here at the St Helens primary school in his electorate, and then go back to the electorate and show up bright eyed and bushy tailed for the school opening. I think the Australian public would expect better of the Leader of the National Party on a policy approach to a resource rent tax based on profits rather than volume. I would draw his attention to one of his predecessors, the previous leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer. Can I suggest again that those opposite should actually engage in the policy of this debate, rather than engage in what they are now doing, which is yet another re-run of an ancient fear and scare campaign, which they are highly accomplished at. Workplace Relations",34
88,Ms REA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. Minister, why is the award safety net important for Australian workers and what are the implications of statutory individual agreements? What other threats are there to working Australians' pay and conditions?",34
89,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member very much for her question. I know that she celebrated along with other members of this House on the day that we introduced the legislation that ended the making of awardstripping Work Choices Australian workplace agreements. That was a day to be celebrated because it meant that from then on Australians had the benefit of a safety net that they could rely on. Of course, that was necessary because Australians in 2007 spoke long and loud and said that they did not want Australian workplace agreements that could strip the safety net away. As we stand here with the Fair Work system in operation as a replacement for Work Choices, there are no individual statutory employment agreements that can be made under the Fair Work system. The Fair Work system does not permit the making of any individual statutory employment agreements, a fact that has been continuously misrepresented by those opposite. Of course, under the new Fair Work system it has been a great relief to working Australians that they do not have to fear that today is the day they will go to work and have a basic condition like penalty rates ripped away. Many working Australians hoped that this fear was gone from their lives forever. Unfortunately, because of the extreme policies of the Leader of the Opposition, this fear is back. The Leader of the Opposition says he should only be believed when he issues carefully scripted remarks. Presumably there could be no more carefully scripted remarks than his own book, Battlelines, in which he said, ‘Work Choices wasn't all bad.' Presumably he was making carefully scripted remarks to a business meeting when he said: At four elections running we had a mandate to introduce statutory non-union contracts and we will seek to renew that mandate. Presumably he was making carefully scripted remarks when he said-and this one is truly remarkable: If we're honest, most of us would accept that a bad boss is a little bit like a bad father or husband. Notwithstanding all his or her faults, you find that he tends to do more good than harm. That was none other than the Leader of the Opposition. I do not know who should be more insulted by that remark, working Australians or every Australian woman or all of them. ‘A bad boss is bit like a bad father or a bad husband. Notwithstanding all of his faults, you find he tends to do more good than harm.' In his budget reply speech, which we also assume was carefully scripted, though given what later happened with the budget reply process maybe that is a big assumption, the Leader of the Opposition said that he wanted to reintroduce Work Choices in the language of flexibility. Of course, we know that the word ‘flexibility' when used by those opposite is a code word for Work Choices. It was the language that the former member for Flinders spoke in when he introduced the Work Choices legislation. Just in case we are in any doubt, the member for Curtin helpfully defined flexibility for us on radio recently. She said: The fact is that there are workers now who are suffering under the new awards system. Because it's bringing back penalty rates on weekends … It is pretty clear what the member of Curtin means by flexibility. It is the flexibility to lose your penalty rates without a dollar of compensation. I believe that there are some questions that the Australian people are entitled to get an answer to from the Leader of the Opposition. Obviously that answer will have to be in writing and carefully scripted. We ask for the answer to be produced that way. I think the Leader of the Opposition should give us an answer to the following questions. Under the Liberal Party, can an employer require you to sign a so-called flexible statutory individual employment agreement as a condition of a bad getting a job? Under the Liberal Party, will you be able to terminate your so-called flexible individual statutory employment agreement at any time and go back to the award or collective agreement that would otherwise apply? These are important questions about the degree of risk that the Leader of the Opposition poses to the pay packets of working Australians. We want the answer in writing because we know that, when the Leader of the Opposition speaks, he tries to use code to explain his intention about Work Choices. He tries to hide behind the word ‘flexibility'. On this, Australians are entitled to the gospel truth. Of course, the whole concept of flexibility for the Leader of the Opposition is not just about a codename for Work Choices. He is a man who believes in flexibility when it comes to the concept of telling the truth. This is a man that goes on the 7.30 Report and asks you to believe he is an honest man because he fesses up about his dishonesty under pressure. It is a curious definition of esty. This is a man who wants you to believe that it is okay to say anything if you are cracking up under pressure. He does frequently. He does not believe that there is a problem with being such a phoney. Even for a man with such a flexible attachment to the truth, there is one gospel truth about the Leader of the Opposition and that is that he stands for the reintroduction of Work Choices. He is a risk to the pay packet of every working Australian.",34

For God's sake, let us just get real about this. On the question of the debate about the reBudget sources super profits tax, there will be a range of views expressed out there in the community, in the commentariat, on the part of industry and on the part of mining companies. We have all sides of the argument participating in it. However, what we have on the part of those opposite is an entire policy briefing run out of the MCA. For the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to stand up yesterday and say that the mining industry should pay no more tax is an extraordinary statement. She is in effect saying exactly what the MCA want her to say. That is what is occurring here. I think it is high time the Leader of the Opposition clarified what their policy is on this matter. Is the mining industry paying enough tax? Is it not paying enough tax? Until we have clarity about their alternative position, this debate is fundamentally hampered. Our plan is clear: funding better super for working families, funding tax cuts for Australian businesses, funding smaller tax for small business and funding the future infrastructure needs of the nation. That is where we stand. We do not know where you stand at all. Ms Ley- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the article ‘Rudd's lost any claim to our trust'. Leave granted.",36

99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Minister for Trade is reminded of his status. The member for Leichhardt has the right to ask his question in silence.,37
100,Mr TURNOUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What will be the impact of the resource super profits tax on Australia's retirement incomes and are there any threats to Australia's getting a fair share our natural resources?,37
101,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question, because it does provide an opportunity to correct several statements from members opposite. The government's superannuation reforms are crucial to boosting the retirement incomes of Australians, and these reforms are funded by the resource super profits tax. There are 8.4 million Australians relying on these reforms to boost their retirement incomes. A 30-year-old on average weekly earnings would have their retirement income boosted by $108,000 on their retirement. There has been some commentary by members opposite about the effects of the resource super profits tax on people's retirement incomes. The shadow minister against superannuation has made some comments. His commentary did not go to why the opposition is standing in the way of the boost to retirement incomes of Australians. The comments did not go to why the opposition is standing in the way of giving low-income earners their superannuation tax back. They went to a scare campaign. The shadow minister against superannuation-the member for Cowper-said this to the Coffs Coast Advocate: We also must remember the collapse in mining Budget share investment is having a domino effect right through the economy that will drive down super returns even further. He is not the only one. The member for Goldstein said it, the member for North Sydney said it and the Leader of the Opposition said it. Now it is time for some facts which will show that the opposition's scare campaign is simply sophistry. It is true that the value of Australian mining stocks has fallen since 2 May. It is also true that the value of stocks generally in Australia has fallen. It is also true that mining stocks around the world have fallen in value. The Australian materials from index covering mining stocks has fallen by eight per cent since 30 April, the ASX 200 has fallen by 8.6 per cent and the financials index has fallen by 10.57 per cent. The resource super profits tax has had a big impact on the financial services index. It is also interesting to look around the world. As I said, the ASX 200 has fallen by 8.6 per cent, the FTSE has fallen by 8.7 per cent, Standard and Poor's has fallen by 9.5 per cent and the Nikkei has fallen by 11.7 per cent. So the superprofits tax has really hit Japan hard. I have heard a lot of outlandish claims from the opposition over the past fortnight. I do not think I have heard the opposition claim yet that the resource super profits tax has caused the Greek debt crisis. I might have missed it. It would be about as outlandish as most of their claims. That crisis, which has caused stock market falls around the world, has not been caused by the RSPT. The opposition say that the resource super profits tax is affecting superannuation returns. Let us see what the superannuation industry has to say to their claims. David Whiteley, the Chief Executive of the Industry Super NetworkMs Julie Bishop interjecting",37
102,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Said: Asserting mining stocks have plunged as a direct result of the tax when all stocks have fallen to a similar if not greater degree is plainly deceitful. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says Mr Whiteley is a Labor hack. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting,38
103,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"She said he is a union hack. Let us see what that other union hack, John Brogden, had to say. John Brogden says of the argument that the mining tax is having an impact on superannuation returns: It doesn't hold up in the short term, and it won't hold up in the long term. I am very strongly of the view that it is quite erroneous to link a negative outcome on mining to a negative outcome on superannuation. That is what John Brogden said of the arguments that are being put by those opposite. I wonder if he is a Labor hack as well. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition appears to have gone quiet.",38
104,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I refer you to page 48 of Practice and, more particularly, to the 1976 report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration and the statement therein that the responsibility of ministers individually to parliament is not a mere fiction. Would the minister consequently tell the House the different dates when the mining industry crashed and the rest did?",38
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! That is not a point of order.,38
106,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I referred to the various indexes, but this analysis is also borne out if you look at individual share prices. Let us take, for example, for the sake of argument, BHP. Since 30 April, BHP has fallen by 7.24 per cent. In other words, BHP has outperformed the market in the past three weeks. Perhaps that is why so many analysts are recommending a buy on BHP-advice that at least one opposition frontbencher has taken to heart.",38

108,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Our old friend the member for Dickson. He has been out there giving hypocrites a bad name again.,38
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will withdraw.,38
110,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. The Leader of the Opposition says that you can only believe something he says if it is in writing. Perhaps you can only believe something the opposition say if it is written in the pecuniary interest return to the House of Representatives, because what they say is worth less than what they do. If I tried to desert my seat I would probably try to make investments to improve my retirement income as well. But we actually care more about the retirement incomes of all Australians. If the opposition want to be taken seriously, they should stop crying crocodile tears about the price of mining shares and should support our efforts to improve the retirement incomes of all Australians, to give all Australians a secure and dignified retirement. Budget",38
111,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to 778,000 self-funded retirees who depend on the returns from their superannuation. Did the government do any analysis on how the new tax on mining would affect investments of self-funded retirees and its impact on their standard of living and, if so, will the Prime Minister release that analysis?",39
112,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Pearce for her question. It goes to the impact of the proposed RSPT on the superannuation earnings of Australians. The first thing I would say in response to the honourable member's question is that the way in which you boost the superannuation earnings of Australians is to increase the SGL from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is the first thing you do because superannuation adequacy for working families is, frankly, not sufficient. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevancy. The question was about modelling and analysis, not the Prime Minister's reinterpretation of the question.",39
113,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. I will listen carefully to the response from the Prime Minister. He knows the requirement for his response to be relevant. The Prime Minister has the call.,39
114,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. My recollection of the question from the member for Pearce is that it went to the impact of the government's proposed tax on superannuation and, furthermore, it went to a range of other matters as well, including those analyses taken into account by the Treasury.",39
115,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members interjectingMrs Bronwyn Bishop-I rise on a point of order on relevancy, Mr Speaker. I refer you to page 553 of House of Representatives Practice, which says that for an answer to be relevant it has to be",39

117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Mackellar will be heard in silence. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-Thank you, Mr Speaker. On page 553 the second paragraph says that a basic requirement for an answer to be relevant is that the answer maintains a link to the substance of the question. The substance of the question was the plight of self-funded retirees who have already retired, making no further contribution, and therefore to be relevant it must address that point.",39
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. The member for Mackellar has made a point of order. As I said in response to the previous point of order, I will listen carefully to the Prime Minister's response. The Prime Minister has the call.",39
119,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The member for Pearce's question went to superannuation and to self-funded retirees. The first point that I was makingand I repeat it even though it seems to irritate those opposite-is that we are increasing the SGL, superannuation guarantee level, for all working Australians, from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Mrs Moylan-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker, on relevance. My question was quite specific about whether the government had conducted an analysis to determine the impact of its new tax on mining on self-funded retirees, and whether the Prime Minister would release such an analysis. I know that there are many people in the electorate of Pearce who have been affected directly",39
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Pearce will resume her seat. The fuller explanation, which is necessary for my critics outside, is: I have asked her to resume her seat because a point of order is not an tunity for her to debate a case. The question has now been repeated on several occasions. The Prime Minister is only a fraction of time into the answer.",40
121,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Furthermore, in the Treasury's analysis of the impact on the economy, that is what underpins what is returned to the superannuation industry through investments over time for both the mining industry and the general economy. If you look at the Econtech modelling contained in the Treasury report, it projects ahead a 0.7 per cent increase in economic growth over time. Mr Hockey-Give us the inputs.",40
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, the member for North Sydney!",40
123,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Secondly-and I say this for the honourable member-it also projects ahead a 5.5 per cent increase in overall mining activity. It follows as a consequence that the overall impact of these reforms on the broad economy will lead to greater growth in general, and for the mining sector in particular and therefore for superannuation funds invested in those sectors into the future. Furthermore, I draw the honourable member's attention to the response just given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The minister for finance in particular emphasised the recent performance of resource stocks as against non-resource stocks within this country and abroad. The member for Pearce, as she said, reflecting on the concerns of her constituents should have listened carefully to what the minister for finance said. He said that the changes over the last month in resource stocks have been less, by and large, than those in the financial services sector. ",40
124,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you want examples, BHP Billiton is down nine per cent, CBA down 12 per cent, NAB down 15 per cent, WBC down oppor- 18 per cent, ANZ down 13 per cent",40
125,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,40
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, those on my left!",40
127,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I know that these are uncomfortable facts for the political argument being advanced by those opposite. ,40
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt is warned!,40
129,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When those opposite-and, as we know, they are such a crack economic team made up of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for North Sydney and the member for Goldstein, aided and abetted from time to time by Senator Barnaby Joyce-actually look at what is happening in the global economy and the performance of all stock markets at present, they will see that it is directly impacted by events in Greece and in Europe. That is why we have seen such massive changes in stock market indices across most Western economies in recent times, including those within our own region. Therefore, in response to the honourable member's question, we are proud of the fact that we are using the proceeds from the RSPT to increase the retirement income of working families. The impact on the overall economy and on mining in particular is assessed by the Treasury analysis as being positive and therefore the earnings of the industry will be so underpinned into the future. Health  is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister advise the House on the latest developments in building a national e-health system? Are there any alternative proposals?",40
130,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moreton for his question. He has a particular interest in the establishment of a national ehealth system, because the division of GPs in his electorate has been leading the way across the country with a very advanced system. But it operates only within their smaller area and they have hopes of expanding it. GPs in the member for Moreton's electorate and across the country do understand that an e-health system will help revolutionise the delivery of health care in Australia. It is why the budget includes $467 million to roll out personally controlled electronic health records for all Australians from 2012-13. Patients will for the first time be able to access their key health information when and where they need it. Patients will no longer have to remember every detail of their care history, medications or test results, and they will not have to retell it to every health professional that they see. It is estimated that two to three per cent of hospital admissions in Australia are linked to medication errors. This equates to 190,000 admissions each year and costs our health system a staggering $660 million. On top of that, about eight per cent of medical errors are because of inadequate patient information. So it is not a stretch to say that this vestment in e-health will help to save lives, reduce medical errors, keep people out of hospital and save money for the taxpayer. Given all of this, it is unsurprising that patients, clinicians and stakeholders have all supported this reform. The AMA, the AGPN, the ANF, the Consumer Health Forum and many more have all said that the e-health system is a key building block to create a 21st-century health system. Everyone, it seems, except for the two people in furious discussion across the table, thinks that this is a long-overdue investment. I must emphasise to you that it is only today's Liberal Party who are against e-health. Unfortunately, the Liberal Party announced last week that they would slash funding for this initiative. We see them mimicking their time in government. A billion dollars was slashed from public hospitals when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Health and Ageing. Now nearly another billion dollars would be slashed from the health system, affecting GPs and e-health, under the opposition's plan. The reason I emphasise that it is today's Liberal Party that oppose e-health is that not very long ago there were people on the other side of the chamber who thought that it was very important. I thought the chamber might like to know that in the Leader of the Opposition's very first speech as health minister he chose to address the topic of e-health. In fact, in 2003, when he gave his first speech as the new health minister, he gave his government five years to implement a national scheme. He said that failure to do it in five years ‘would be an indictment against everyone in the health system, including the government'. Indeed, it is an indictment of the former government. We can just add it to the list of other indictments-a billion dollars inout of hospitals, a cap on GP training places and now the failure to deliver an e-health system. I think that the chamber deserves to hear just a little bit more. In August 2007, the then health minister gave another speech. He referred to his first speech as health minister. He said: In November 2003, my first scripted speech as Health Minister concerned e-health. I stated that an electronic health record, communicated electronically among health care providers, would mean safer, better, more convenient and more efficient health care. I could not agree more. He went on: For doctors and other professionals, it meant less repetitive taking of histories; for governments other funders, it meant less duplication of diagnostic tests; for patients, it meant more access their health records and more capacity to manage their own health; for everyone, it meant fewer potentially disastrous mistakes because of avoidable ignorance. These were carefully scripted speeches, so we know that Mr Abbott absolutely believed every word of them. The only problem was that ‘Phoney Tony' did not act on that belief. He did not deliver any e-health records",41
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will withdraw that remark.,42
132,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I withdraw it.,42
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,42
134,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The only problem was that the Leader of the Opposition, as the health minister, said all of these things about electronic health records and failed to deliver one iota. I can tell you that the member for Dickson is also on the record as offering bipartisan support for e-health. He even had a swipe at his own leader. Last September he said that the lack of e-health was ‘a very poor reflection of the last decade of discussion'. I wonder who was in government for the last decade? The member for Dickson also said in March: … Nicola Roxon and I don't always have a perfect made in heaven relationship, but nonetheless, when I first sat down with Nicola coming into this portfolio only six months ago I gave her an undertaking that we would-on the issue of ehealth-provide bipartisan support … There goes that offer! How erratic are they, in that year after year they could commit to e-health, when they got into opposition they could commit to e-health and then, last week, they slashed half a billion dollars from their budget for this necessary revolutionary change to our healthcare system? One day and they are for e-health; one day they are against it. It is pretty hard to know what the to Leader of the Opposition thinks, but we certainly know what he did about e-healthabsolutely nothing.",42
135,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I indicate to the House that in the upper galleries on my left and right we have grades 5 and 6 from Wattle Park Primary School. A proud parent, the Deputy Speaker, the member for Chisholm, has indicated this to me. I welcome them to the House. Budget",42
136,Mr BRIGGS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Min Managing Director of Mulgundawa Salt mine, who wrote to the Treasurer last Friday in relation to the government's great big new tax on mining. He said: This threatens the viability of the business, the employment of 18 people and would impact on regional suppliers and contractors who support our business. Can the Prime Minister guarantee that busi a consequence of his great big new tax on mining?",42
137,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mayo for his question because, when it comes to all businesses, what this government stands for is lower tax as opposed to higher tax. We are bringing the company tax rate down two per cent. You are taking it up two per cent. That is what you are doing by virtue of Mr Abbott's great big new tax on everything. On the matter that the member for Mayo raises, I simply say to him that companies from various sectors of the economy are currently consulting the Treasury panel on the impact of the proposed RSPT on them and, as far as his constituents are concerned, I strongly encourage them to do so, as many others are across the country-more than 80 companies altogether. The third point I would make in response to the member for Mayo, and more broadly in this debate on tax, is that this is about we reform the country for the future. This is about how we set Australia up for the next level of economic growth. This is how we take the benefits from the mining boom and invest them in Australia's productive potential in the future. This is a serious program economic reform. What we have seen today is a stark contrast between what we stand for on a reform proposal and what they stand for in terms of simple scare campaigning on the basis of lowest common denominator politics. It is writ large right across the board. We stand for better super; they stand for less super. We stand for less tax on business; you stand for more tax on business. We stand for less tax on small business; you stand for more tax on small business. We stand for investing in health; as the Minister for Health and Ageing has just said, you stand for health cuts. We stand for investments in education; you stand for cuts to education. We stand for investments in renewable energy; you stand for cuts to renewable energy. We stand for investing in infrastructure; you stand for cutting infrastructure.",42
138,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will refer his remarks through the chair.,43
139,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I say to those opposite as they engage in the politics of the lowest common denominator: have a very clear eye upon where this debate goes for our future productive potential as an economy. We stand for boosting Australia's long-term productivity and our global economic competitiveness. I say to the member for Mayo, as a person who I thought was literate on questions of policy, that he should engage in the detail of this debate rather than simply take the script delivered to him by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Sturt. We will deal with each business on its merits, with each sector that they are enhow gaged in. They are currently discussing these matters with the Treasury panel. This is a fundamental exercise in long-term economic reform, to which this government is committed. Mr Briggs- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to of table the letter from the salt company to the Treasurer last Friday, which they have not had a response to yet. Leave not granted. Budget",43
140,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs and Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. What are the benefits of the government's stimulus package and tax breaks for small businesses and independent contractors and what support is there for the package and tax breaks?",43
141,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Blair for his question and for his invitation to engage with him in a very productive small business breakfast just last week. It was very well attended too. The government supported Australia's small businesses and our tradies during the global recession through our economic stimulus plan. During the recovery we want to support our small businesses again through small business tax breaks. In fact, the government's economic stimulus plan is right now supporting small businesses right around Australia, including our tradies in thousands of construction projects across the nation. I remind members of the chamber that the opposition voted against and continues to oppose the fiscal stimulus package which is supporting our small businesses and our tradies. But not all members of the Liberal National Party feel that way. George Christensen is the Liberal-National Party candidate for Dawson and a councillor on the Mackay council. At the council's meeting on 16 December last year, Councillor Christensen moved a motion that the council accept $4½ million from the Rudd government's Social Housing Initiative, which is being organised and provided through the good auspices of the member for Sydney. Councillor Christiansen clearly supports the government's economic stimulus plan, but he is not alone. The LNP's candidate for Wright, also in Queensland, is Hajnal Ban. She is a councillor on Logan City Council, in my own area, so she is a member of a council that has benefited from stimulus funding of almost $5 million for, amongst other things, local roadworks, a library fit-out just down the road from my office and an extension to the Logan Entertainment Centre. And what about Councillor Jane Prentice? Councillor Prentice has nominated for LNP preselection for the seat of Ryan to replace the now demised member for Ryan, who has been thrown out of the LNP and obviously has a few more questions to answer beyond the LNP's own internal investigation-and I will have more to say about that later. Back to Councillor Jane Prentice: she is a councillor on the Brisbane City Council, which has gratefully accepted more than $16 million in funding from our economic stimulus plan. Doctors take the Hippocratic oath. These three LNP candidates and aspirants will need to join with sitting LNP members in taking the opposition leader's hypocritic oath, which says: ‘I support the Rudd government's stimulus package in the electorate I pledge to oppose it in the parliament.'",43
142,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will withdraw.,44
143,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. When it comes to economic management, the Leader of the Opposition is erratic and his policies are extreme. I am asked about small business tax breaks. The opposition leader plans to block the resource super profits tax in the Senate. What would that do? Deny small businesses and tradies a much-deserved tax break. The opposition leader says that he only speaks the gospel truth when something is written down, scripted for him, prepared for him by his staff. It must be put in writing. But not so Senator Barnaby Joyce, because he walks into a TV studio and just blurts out the truth. When he was asked just before question time-very good timing, I thought, from Senator Joyce-about the deputy opposition leader's comments that mining companies already pay their fair share of tax, what did he say? Did he agree with that? ‘No, not at all-we can have a sensible negotiation.' Go Barnaby! He went on, ‘To say there is not the capacity to change the tax is not right.' We agree with Senator Joyce. He went on to say, ‘I'm prepared for people to look at the mining sector to pay more.' The deputy opposition leader says, ‘They are paying the right amount; they are paying their fair share.' Senator Joyce went on to say, ‘Let's go through the proper negotiation.' That is a good idea; that is what we are doing-going through the proper negotiation. But on the other side they are saying, ‘No, Barnaby is wrong, we should not go through the proper negotiation.' The truth is that Senator Barnaby Joyce has blown out of the water the opposition's confused scare campaign about the resource super profits tax. He has completely contradicted the opposition leader, he but has completely contradicted the deputy opposition leader and, of course, he had a big go at the member for Goldstein. They had a tiff yesterday and the member for Goldstein rang him up. Dr Southcott- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: this is 95 per cent a commentary on the opposition rather than on matters for which the minister is responsible.",44
144,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Boothby will resume his seat. The member has raised a point of order on relevance.

149,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Certainly, the opposition leader knows that Senator Barnaby Joyce believes that revenge is a dish best served cold. It was served up today.

It is the world's premier and most prestigious film festival. Michael Rowe's film Leap Year was awarded the prestigious Camera d'Or award for debut filmmakers. This is the second year in a row that an Australian filmmaker has received this award. Members will remember that last year Warwick Thornton received the award for Samson and Delilah. As well as that, Ariel Kleiman won the Kodak Discovery Award for his short film, which shows the great depth of talent we are producing in this country. I also congratulate the makers of the Australian-French coproduction, partly funded by Screen Australia, The Tree, which closed the festival. It is appropriate that we mark these significant achievements by Australian filmmakers at this very important international film festival.",45
153,Mr CIOBO,CANNES FILM FESTIVAL,"Moncrieff) (4.05 pm)Madam Deputy Speaker, on indulgence: I share the sentiments of the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts. Cannes 2010 was yet another testament to the talent and creativity of Australia's film community. Nineteen Australian films were shown at Cannes this year with two shorts in official selection and 17 feature films screening in the market. It was particularly pleasing to see the film chosen to close the festival was The Tree, an Australian-French coproduction, which is importantly-certainly from my perspective-a film set in Queensland and adapted from a book by the Australian writer Judy Pascoe. Australian born Michael Rowe picked up the prestigious Camera d'Or award, the Cannes prize for best first film. His film Leap Year competed against 24 other films in the category. Congratulations also to Australia's Naomi Watts, who featured in two films at the festival, Fair Game and Woody Allen's film You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger. NA",46

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",46
155,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The imposition of this super tax on the resources industry by the Rudd government is an attack on the mining industry of Australia; it is an attack on the miners and their jobs in Australia; it is an attack on the contractors and small businesses who support the mining industry in Australia; it is an attack on household budgets in Australia; it is an attack on the shareholders in these companies that operate in Australia; it is an attack on the superannuation recipients whose funds have invested in these resource companies; and it is an attack on self-funded retirees. Never in my lifetime have I seen such a reckless approach by any government in its attempt to destroy the Australian resources industry. This is an industry that has supported this country through a series of recessions and has ensured a standard of living in Australia that we all enjoy and are proud of. This industry has done nothing to deserve the gutless attacks it has received in the past three weeks from those who sit opposite. I never, ever thought I would hear the language that has been used about mining industry leaders by everyone from the Prime Budget Minister to the Treasurer to backbenchers who are scared of losing their jobs at the next election. The Prime Minister tried to invoke not only xenophobia but also the tall poppy syndrome, asking Australians to question the motives of people simply because they have been successful. I never, ever thought I would see a leader of this country stoop to I never thought I would see a situation where we have the Treasurer of this country accusing mining industry leaders of being either liars or ignorant-liars or ignorant. These are the fathers and mothers of industry in Australia, these are the people who have put Australia's resource development on the world map, these are the people who have provided jobs directly and indirectly for millions of Australians, and yet the Treasurer's description of them is that either they are lying or deliberately putting out mistruths or they are ignorant-that is, they do not understand the way of the world. Surely not-surely the Treasurer would not be referring to someone who once referred to him, the Treasurer, and his counterpart the Prime Minister as ‘Labor brothers'. This is a former Labor state Treasurer, a person of distinction within the Labor Party in Queensland who held office in the Goss government in which the Prime Minister had a prominent role. Yet the Treasurer has referred to him as either ignorant or a liar. I refer of course to Keith De Lacy, a person I have considerable time for, a person I had considerable time for before I came to this place. Mr De Lacy said the Treasurer's claims are wrong, highly misleading and offensive. That was in relation to the Treasurer's claims that mining companies were lying about the amount of tax they paid. We are now in a situation where the head of the third largest resources company in the world, Rio Tinto, is describing Australia's mining tax as being ‘the biggest sovereign risk facing the miner anywhere in the world' and certainly Australia as having a sovereign risk profile which requires him and his companies to reassess billions of dollars worth investment here. It is not just the dollars of investment that we need to worry about; it is the tens of thousands of jobs that go with it. It is the returns by Rio Tinto that go back to the shareholders of Australia-and that company has an Australian listing; it has a very long and proud history of investment and employment in Australia-to self-funded retirees, to superannuation holders and to people who have had the courage to invest in an industry that has underpinned Australia. These men do not speak lightly of their concerns, nor of the impact that the mining tax will have on their companies. They are bound by an obligation under the director laws of Australia not to lie. The Treasurer may not understand that. He has probably never done the Australian Institute of Company Directors course. I have. I understand corporate responsibility. I understand director responsibility. I understand the requirements by law that if you abuse them you will go to jail. I understand that what these people are saying is true. And I understand that, when you combine that with a great Australian, someone whom we have all looked up to in our past, Mr Herb Elliott, who is the Chairman of Fortescue Metals, that we have someone with integrity in terms of both his own character and of course his director responsibilities. Today, the Chairman of Fortescue Metals Group wrote to his 55,000 shareholders advising them of the company's rejection of the federal government's proposed resource rent tax. The letter to the shareholders, which is available on the Fortescue website, states that the government's proposal is akin to ‘a socialist style funding and tax device' and is ‘bad for every Australian'-every Australian. Who is going to benefit from this tax? It is not the people who work at the mine sites, not the small businesses who support them, of not the shareholders in the company, not the self-funded retirees and certainly not the people who want to see Australia prosper. We have heard a lot of figures recently in relation to Treasury documents. If I had more time. I would revisit the comments about what a fraud has been tried to be perpetrated by quoting documents, in one case from the University of North Carolina in an undergraduate work associated with a professor. The professor clearly stated that those documents were never to be used for a tax model and I have that document here. The other document, of course, that we saw rushed out overnight was the document purporting to be the Treasury analysis of the taxes in relation to the issue of company tax. On the bottom of the document Disparities in average rates of company tax across industries the authors, Peter Greagg, Dean Parham and Pero Stojanovski say: The authors are from Business Tax Division, the Australian Treasury. This article has benefited from comments and suggestions provided by Paul MCMahon and Shane Johnson. The views in this article are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the Australian Treasury. So desperate is this government they will grab anything to back up their case, anything to try and add a shred, a tiny modicum of credibility to this dreadful, dreadful tax. It is a tax that is destroying Australia's resources future. One Treasury has been able to make comment because it is not bound by those who sit opposite and that is the Treasury of Western Australia. The WA Treasury said in the budget papers: … that the risks and uncertainties leading up to the planned introduction of the resource superprofits tax could deter investment in the state's resources sector, which would affect economic forecasts badly. It goes on: There is a risk that the commonwealth's proposal … will have a significant impact on the level of future investment in the mining sector in Western Australia. Where do we start to look for evidence of that. There is so much evidence. Do we start with Southern Cross Portfolio Ideas, who today said: Claim and counter claim between Canberra and the mining industry is doing Australia incalculable damage in the eyes of foreign investors. … … … To me this is like having a fight with your wife at a restaurant. It is destructive, unnecessary and classless. The Prime Minister can argue that the Australian dollar fall has nothing to do with the RSPT. The market facts beg to differ from that. This document continues through a series of charts comparing our dollar's fall with the Canadian dollar and with every other major currency to highlight the fact that this government is destroying the resources industry in Australia. We have Moody's, who are well-respected and impartial with nothing to gain either way who have said categorically that the RSPT: … could reduce earnings for firms by nearly a third after it takes effect in mid-2012. That is a 30 per cent reduction. The list goes on from JB Were, Citi, US, JP Morgan. These are people who understand the market unlike those who sit opposite. These are international companies that understand how the markets works. Perhaps the small miners might think this is a great tax but, again, the list goes on of companies that are opposed to this tax. It is too long to read in the moments I have left but the list has Milan Jerkovic of Straits Resources, David Robb of Iluka Resources, Paul Pike of Mulgundawa Salt, Will Robinson of Encounter Resources and Michael Weir of Gindalbie Metals. It is a long list of companies who say this tax is bad for Australia. So who says it is good? The Canadians, of course. They think it is fantastic. Brad Trost MP said: So I'm sending out the message-Canada wants Australian business. What is Rio's response to that? Rio Tinto is a company that has resources in Canada. Obviously they have to consider that and Mr Tom Albanese said: What may be Australia's loss from the resource super profits tax will be Canada's gain. He warned that his company and fellow Australian miners were likely to give preference to developing resources in overseas companies. Even Papua New Guinea is licking its lips at the opportunity to see Australian companies turned away from Australia and investing in PNG. The list goes on and on. I have not had time in this speech to talk about a key issue. That is the opportunity for Indigenous Australians that is presented by the resource sector in Australia, particularly in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Queensland. Let me quote from Indigenous businessman Barry Taylor who said: When something like that affects the mining industry, if cuts are going to be made, generally there are two people at the bottom of the food chain-that's the contractors and the blackfellas and in most cases we are both, particularly up in the Pilbara. … … … If mining companies are going to say ‘we are going to get taxed on a lot of our profits,' it going to make it difficult for those types of companies to invest in the region and the Pilbara, in particular, has massive Aboriginal communities surrounding the mines. This is a disaster for regional Australia, it is a disaster for urban Australia and it is a disaster for all of Australia. (Time expired)",46
156,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (4.22 pm)-I welcome the opportunity to address the House in this MPI debate on what is a complex issue. In doing so, can I simply say that the contribution from the opposition to date in the debate on the resource super profits tax clearly shows that they are out of touch with the broader Australian community. The community is actually up for this debate, and the reason they are up for this debate is that they believe the mining sector has had a good 10 years. There are good profits. The community appreciates and wants in place a decent tax system which rewards risk-takers while it also guarantees that the community gets a fair share from the opportunity to develop the resources. The mining sector itself is also up for the debate. The Minerals Council of Australia has clearly said that it regards the current royalty system to be out of date and inappropriate for the future development of the Australian resources sector. It has actually argued for a profit based system. Mr Andrew Forrest might have some criticism of the current government proposal but I refer to his statement lodged with the ASX today. It is a clear statement that a range of companies in Australia appreciate that the time has come for this debate. In the statement by FMG to the ASX today, Mr Forrest says: We acknowledge Australia needs tax reform and are pleased to be working with the Treasury consultation panel to consider and make input to a new and fairer tax system. is just That is what the debate is about. Clearly, there are different points of view on this debate, but the government is absolutely committed to the process of consultation established on the day that the Henry tax report was released. It was also the day that we announced our response to a number of key, tough issues raised by the Henry tax report which go to making sure that not only do we get a fair return for the Australian community but we also invest in the Australian community's future. The record will show a lack of attention by the previous government to use the opportunities that came from a resources boom to cement our nation's economic future. That is why, when you look at the range of announcements made by the Prime Minister back on 2 May, you do not just look at the complex debate about a new resources tax system in Australia; you also look at the investments we are going to make as part of the package. We should never forget that this is a package. Yes, there are changes in taxation but there are also a range of benefits to the resources sector and, importantly, a range of benefits to the broader community. They include, for example, a significant investment in the future of small businesses in Australia. A cut in company taxation is something that small businesses want. They should be rewarded for the manner in which they cooperated with the Australian community and government and got us through the global financial crisis. What about infrastructure? The record shows that, during the previous decade, we as a nation lived off the back of increases in commodity prices, whilst we lost market share. The reason for that is that government failed to invest in resource related infrastructure. For the first time ever we will establish in the budget each year a line item for dedicated investment in the resources sector. This will take some pressure off the resource regions. Then we come to the issue of retirement. We all have to save more for retirement but government is obligated to create an environment that enables people to save for retirement. Hence, we propose to take the minimum superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. It means that someone who is currently about 30 years of age will receive an additional benefit which, based on today's dollar terms, will be over $100,000. That is very, very significant. It will provide people with a greater capacity to retire with some dignity. This debate also goes to the management of the economy-not just to the incentives government will create to enable people to save for retirement but also to the strength of the economy which enables people themselves to contribute to their future. I take the House today to an article about the Melbourne Institute Quarterly Wages Report of May 2010. It states: According to the latest Melbourne Institute QuarFor terly Wages report total pay growth over the 12 months to May 2010a very tough period for the Australian economy, I point outincreased by an average of 4.3 per cent compared with an increase of 3.2 per cent in the 12 months to February 2010. It goes on to say about wage expectations: … expected wage growth over the next 12 months increased from an expected 2.2 per cent growth in February to 2.5 per cent in May. Clearly, all the hard work of the previous 12 to 15 months by this government is bearing fruit. We have a strong economy. We have good growth and, all being well, we will achieve unemployment of 4¾ per cent, as announced by the Treasurer on budget night only a matter of weeks ago. In order to further secure the future of this economy, you have to take a few tough decisions but, in doing so, you have to put in place a tax system that not only encourages investment but also acknowledges the acceptance by a range of mining companies in Australia that they do have capacity to give a fair return to the Australian community for the opportunity to develop their finite nonrenewable resources. That is what this debate is about. And it is also about using the proceeds of that tax for our future. The exploration that we do today determines the projects that we will have in 30 and 40 years time. That is why we propose, for example, a new exploration incentive-something that the previous government failed to deliver. That effectively means about 4,500 exploration companies in Australia will benefit from the rebate. That will encourage investment-it will create the Olympic Dam and the Gorgon projects in 20 and 30 years time-and it will create the wealth and jobs that are so vital to our future. Now I turn to the issue of infrastructure. the first time ever, there is the capacity last for the Commonwealth, in a line item, to do more on the infrastructure front. That builds on what we have done since we were elected 2½ years ago. It is not new to us to invest in the resources sector, but we want to do more as a result of this debate. We are talking about a new fund of $5.6 billion over the next decade. That is on top of a range of vestments we have already made to assist the resources sector. The state and territory ernments are saying we should do more. If they expect us to do more, they also have to understand that there needs to be a complex debate about the tax system and the resources sector. We need to have the financial capacity to do more. But we have not been neglecting our responsibilities. We have acted already. Take Oakajee Port in Western Australia. We have spent $339 million in a new iron ore province. Darwin Port is exceptionally important in the development of the resources sector in Australia. That is where uranium out of Western Australia will go, a new industry supported by the Commonwealth government. Then there is the Australian Rail Track Corporation. That railway corporation has never had the degree of government support that it has had over the last 2½ years. We have put $1.2 billion into that corporation. For example, in our coal corridor we have spent $580 million in the Hunter region alone. Then there is Geelong, another key port for us. And there is Esperance in Western Australia, with a three-way split between the Western Australian government, the Commonwealth government and the Port of Esperance, each spending $40 million. There are the port access roads in Townsville. Regional community by regional community, resource sector by resource sector, we are committed to doing the right thing. The time has come for the opposition to understand that the Australian community is starting to see through its scare campaign. They understand that this has been about, yet again, political opportunism from the opposition driven by a desire to attract donations for the purposes of paying for the next election. That explains the opposition's point of view. We have the Western Australian Premier, for instance, arguing that it is time for in- the resources sector to pay more. Then we have the federal opposition saying: ‘No, no, govno. Give us the donations and we'll oppose the Australian government's proposition.' That is short-termism and a lack of a proper understanding of the needs of Australia. They have failed to front up to the hard debates. Let us go to their latest scare campaign on the issue of electricity prices. It again shows the ignorance of many on the other side of the House. I remind the House that many fuel sources for electricity, such as coal mines, are part of an integrated system with power stations. Perhaps they ought to do a bit of hard work. Those integrated operations are not expected to attract a superprofits tax. That is fact, as against the fiction we have had from the opposition, which is what we have come to expect day in and day out. It is also important to recognise that a household's electricity bill is made up of a number of factors. In actual fact, fuel costs are a small proportion of a household bill when it comes to the cost of electricity. The wholesale electricity price comprises around 40 per cent of this bill, for example. The cost of coal and gas to fuel generators is only a relatively small proportion of the wholesale cost. Think about, for example, transmission and network costs. I also remind you that the Western Australian Premier is out there arguing that these increases in the price of electricity have to flow through the system-increase after increase. He appreciates that, if we do not front up to this hard issue, we will no longer have the benefit of one of the most reliable electricity systems in the world. We have to invest more and more money over the next decade to ensure that we have such a reliable system in the future. But we have yet another scare campaign from those opposite. It is without foundation. The suppliers of our electricity are unlikely to be earning superprofits on the contracts that are in place. They are more often than not long-term supply contracts. More often than not, they also use low-quality coal because we export our better quality coal. It is not our premium coal, not our superprofits coal that is used in the electricity system in Australia. But they will continue to run that scare campaign day in and day out. That is because we have an opposition led by a leader who finds economics boring. He is not focused on policy and you have to think whether or not he is telling the truth, as he admitted on The 7.30 Report last week. That is also reflected in the parade of opposition frontbenchers we have had over the last 24 hours, each with a different view on whether or not we should have a debate in Australia on tax and the resources sector. Senior opposition spokespersons have been falling over one another to give different views. We question whether or not this is a well-thought out campaign or whether it is a ‘read my lips' campaign from the Leader of the Opposition. Is this about saying one thing to a particular section of community-‘Yes, there is a capacity to increase revenue from the minerals sector'-at the same time having someone else say something else to another section of the Australian community. Perhaps the next speaker from the opposition can tell us what the gospel truth is and what the opposition's real position is with respect to reform of the minerals taxation system in Australia. What is their position? the Premier of Western Australia right? Is he entitled to increase iron ore royalties by $3.2 billion over the next four years? Mr Randall-Yes. He negotiated it.",49
157,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If that is the case-and we have the opposition representative, the member for Canning, saying that it is okay-then perhaps the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Curtin, should be told. She is out there arguing that there is no capacity to increase government revenue through increasing taxation on the Australian resources sector. We can come to this conclusion: the coalition have no policies of their own. They would sooner put self interest ahead of the national interest so as to maximise donations for the purposes of paying for the next election. We will continue to argue this and, at the end of the day, there will be higher tax taken from the resources sector and we will invest it in the future of Australia's communities because that is in the national interest. The opposition stands for one thing alonethat is self interest and short-term political gain. (Time expired)",52
158,Mr RANDALL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am pleased to speak on this matter of public importance. ‘A politician thinks of the next election. A statesman, of the next generation,' is a quote by James Freeman Clarke which puts the Prime Minister of Australia the into context, because Mr Rudd has his eyes squarely focused on what is going to get him through the upcoming election. He is making policy on the run and, according to what the pollsters or the focus groups tell him every morning about his Sunrise performances, that is what he delivers for the day because it is part of the spin cycle. The news for Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, is that the Australian economy is too important to be run this Is way. It needs a statesman at its helm, not a spin doctor. This resources tax was the government's $12 billion answer to getting the country out of a $93 billion financial black hole that it has dug for itself in less than three short years, managing the soon to be $6 billion interest per annum, which will be crippling. I have said time and time again that it is back to the old school, big-taxing, big-spending Labor government. The Rudd government has given up on Western Australia, so it is going to gouge from it. A headline in today's Australian screams ‘The resource tax threatens to choke off the second mining boom'. Add this to Premier Colin Barnett's comments that the $4 billion redevelopment of Oakajee Port rail project could be under threat because of the tax. For the benefit of Minister for Resources and Energy, there is the infrastructure for Oakajee. If people do not invest in the area, what is the point of Oakajee port? Andrew Forrest has been out there talking about 40,000 Indigenous jobs in Fortescue Metals that he wants to plan and create through this industry. That is going to cripple that development. So what happened to the Indigenous job commitment? The Western Australian Premier is strenuously opposing the super tax because he is looking out for the state's best interests. As a Western Australian in this place, I certainly support him when we are fighting for the interests of Western Australia and all Australians. Rather than raid the state's growth, the Premier will always make sure that WA gets its fair share. Unlike the Prime Minister, the Premier is willing to negotiate with BHP and Rio Tinto on royalty rights, and he has been doing so for some time, well before this tax announcement, unlike the retrospective nature of the announcement of and then the negotiations on this super tax that the Prime Minister has delivered. The Premier's planned royalty rates take them onto the industry standard of 5.625 per cent and offer a concessional rate that they have enjoyed for many years for pioneering iron ore extraction, particularly in the Pilbara. A rate to 7½ per cent by this time next year would bring about $1 billion in royalties. It is a fair plan and will not inhibit the state's growth, unlike Mr Rudd's agenda to essentially make a hostile takeover of Western Australia's mining and petroleum industry. Do Australians really trust Mr Rudd to give any of these super profits back to the states? You only have to look at his track record which, if I have time, I will get to. Rio Tinto boss Tom Albanese yesterday said this super tax was his No. 1 sovereign risk on a global basis. Rio Tinto operates in some of the most unstable countries in the world like Mongolia, New Guinea and so on, and he has labelled Australia a sovereign risk. It just shows how much uncertainty it has created for the industry. Rio, which draws 60 per cent of its world revenue from Australia, would not have gone ahead with some of the massive projects like Pilbara iron ore operations had the super tax been in place at that time of change. How many thousands of jobs would have been lost if Rio had known about this tax some time ago? A super tax does nothing but encourage mining companies to go offshore. In this case it allows our biggest buyer and investor, China, to dominate the industry and to put pressure on ordinary taxpayers, using their funds to bail out failed mining companies. Why would you allow taxpayers' money to help buy out the penny dreadfuls of this country? It is a disgrace. There are people running out of offices in Perth who fund their whole life and existence out of setting up a company out of blue sky and then living off it. Now this government is going to say, ‘If you crash, we will bail you out.' It is a real problem and I am sure there are people in this place that know that this is a realitymore borrowing, more government debt, falling share prices and upward pressure on rise in the interest rates as a result. The resources tax was given little thought and no consultation. Any consultation on this super tax now would be retrospective rather than prospective. It is a tax grab that is ing half a million Australian jobs and foreign and local investment offshore like the ETS would have. If you recall, the ETS was going to penalise Australian industries to the extent that they would go to a developing country like Indonesia where there was not any financial impost. We would have exported not only jobs and the income from those jobs such as taxation but also the pollution that would have gone with it. We have dodged the ETS at least for three years; now we have a tax which we are going to have to deal with in the same vein. It is going to penalise companies operating in Australia both prospectively and retrospectively. The impact will not be instant. We are not going to feel this tomorrow. We are not going to walk out tomorrow into St George's Terrace and find out that the mining companies have shut down. Of course they will not. They will be operating on their current leases and their current operations, but it is going to be felt for years-in fact generations. This is a tax that could stop any new mining boom-it will strangle any new mining boom-and it will hurt the Australian economy for years to come. These people sitting in here today are going to have to explain to future generations why we made a decision in this place to allow this to happen to their future and the future of many generations of Australians to come. When we had the ascendancy in world resources and the production of world resources at a competitive rate, we in this place are going to be saying, ‘No, we are going to put a stranglehold on that competitive advantage that Australia had.' The impact of a 40 per cent tax goes far wider than the mining industry. This is a tax on the very working families that Mr Rudd said he would look after. When it comes to jobs, the fundamentals are simple. Industry employs workers and pays them a decent wage, which they spend in the local shops, sendon homes, in restaurants and on holidays, which keeps thousands of other Australians employed. One job in the mining sector creates at least four elsewhere in the economyair hostesses, real estate agents, accountants et cetera, all jobs that back up someone in the mining industry. Some people say it is seven jobs for each mining job, but let us be conservative and say it is four. The tax would push up power bills. On the back of already soaring electricity costs, higher gas and coal prices would be paid by generators and this is obviously going to be passed on to consumers. They will not absorb it. Where does this stop? This tax will grow exponentially and it will continue to explode from now on. Applying to all mining activities, this tax will include such operations as clay mining, the brick industry, sand mining and hard rock mining. This tax applies to more than just corporate conglomerates. I can think of some sand miners in my electorate, for example, that will be hit by this because they might make a so-called superprofit. As I mentioned last night, Satterley in Perth has predicted the cost of building a new home would rise by more than $20,000. Yesterday, we saw Australia Post appearing in a Senate estimates committee and confirming a return on capital of 12 per cent. They admitted to Senator Cormann that this was not a superprofit but a reasonable return on equity. But from the government's viewpoint, six per cent is a superprofit. So should we tax Australia Post on profits of over six per cent? How about the banks that are making massive profits? Are they going to get a so-called supertax on anything above six per cent? Westpac's first-half profits were 21 per cent, or more than $2 billion. No wonder the banks are getting nervous. What about Telstra's $1.85 billion profit? Let us have a look at their profits too. Woolworths' profit last year was nearly 13 per cent. Let's apply a supertax on them as well, if you take the same mentality. It would be illogical to think that the costs would not be passed on to consumers. The message is that, if you are a business and you earn more than the government bond rate, a mere 5.7 per cent, you are making a superprofit. This tax is not good for business, not good for workers and not good for superannuants. It is a kick in the teeth to working families. As a result, this is not a tax that can be ported. It is tax that we are going to feel harder in Western Australia. Mums and dads, superannuants and generations of Australians to come will suffer. (Time expired)",52
159,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (4.47 pm)-This debate is about mining taxation, but fundamentally it is about truthfulness. It is about the launching of scare campaigns, chaotic and confused as they are from the opposition, including claims made by the Leader of the Opposition that the resource super profits tax would increase the price of food. It is noteworthy that the member for Groom has sponsored this matter of public importance because he was asked about truthfulness yesterday. The journalist said, ‘You say what you believe, but Tony doesn't.' The member for Groom responded, ‘Well, Tony says what he believes at the time.' Already there is a division between the member for Groom and the Leader of the Opposition because the Leader of the Opposition has confessed that he does not say what he believes when under pressure. He cannot handle the pressure and he will say things that he does not believe. That is what he said on The 7.30 Report. He indicated that he does not necessarily tell the truth when he is asked a question in the heat of the moment. That is not a good thing in general, but it does show that this opposition leader cannot deal with pressure and that he will say anything, including statements that are false, under pressure. Is that the sort of leader we want for this country-someone who cannot handle pressure? The scare campaign that has been launched and prosecuted by the coalition has supslipped into yet further chaos and confusion. We had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying on Sky television, ‘I believe that mining companies are paying a fair amount of tax.' In that she was contradicted on the same day by the Woodside CEO, Don Voelte, who said: In talking to the big miners and the mid cap miners I have not heard that they are not willing to negotiate a different tax and a higher tax back. They want to give a fair share back to the Australian citizens. There is Woodside accepting that the mining industry believes it can pay more tax and it would be fair if it did pay more tax. So the deputy opposition leader is being contradicted by the mining industry itself, or certainly very large sections of the mining industry. Today we have learnt that she is also being contradicted by none other than Senator Barnaby Joyce. When asked directly about the deputy opposition leader's comments that mining companies already pay their fair share of tax, he said: ‘No, not at all. We can have a sensible negotiation. To say there is not the capacity to change the tax is not right.' In that statement Senator Barnaby Joyce from Queensland has blown this confused and chaotic scare campaign out of the water. Senator Joyce has blown the Deputy Leader of the Opposition out of the water. Senator Joyce has blown the Leader of the Opposition out of the water. As I said during question time, Senator Barnaby Joyce obviously believes that revenge is a dish best served cold. There was a blue yesterday between the member for Goldstein and Senator Barnaby Joyce and when Senator Joyce was asked about the member for Goldstein's comments he said: ‘He rang me up and he was very, you know, apologetic. And so he should be. How dare he run me down like that. Bugger him.' Today we saw the revenge for that served cold. We saw the revenge served cold with his flat contradiction of the coalition's posiby tion on this resource super profits tax, with his flat repudiation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, with his flat repudiation of the Leader of the Opposition and with his flat repudiation of the member for Goldstein. Today Senator Joyce had his revenge on the Liberal-National Party. Today Senator Joyce had his revenge on the member for Goldstein, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition, completely blowing out of the water this chaotic, confused scare campaign being launched and sponsored by the Leader of the Opposition. This matter of public importance deals with, among other things, the cost of living. Just a couple of weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition said that the resource super profits tax would increase the price of food. The fact is that the resource super profits tax would apply to minerals which are traded on international markets, such as iron ore from the Pilbara, and for which international markets set the prices. How could it possibly be that a resource super profits tax on iron ore would increase the price of food unless there are iron filings in Mars bars? Even then, it would not increase the price of iron ore, let alone food. You do not need to rely on me for that analysis. Look no further than the KPMG Econtech report on the price impacts of the resource super profits tax and, in particular, the associated reductions in the company tax rate. That report, that modelling, shows that the resource super profits tax and the tax rate reductions it would finance would not only not increase the price of food and the general cost of living but would reduce them by more than one per cent. According to the modelling, some of the bigger price reductions would be in transport costs, down 1.7 per cent; clothing and footwear costs, down 1.3 per cent; household contents and services costs, down by 1.1 per cent; and food costs to consumers, down by 0.9 per centnot up, as the Leader of the Opposition claims, but down because of the reductions in the company tax rate and other factors. That is what is missing in this debate. The resource super profits tax would be used to fund reductions in the company tax rate for companies small and large and that would have a positive influence on prices-that is, it would put downward price pressure on prices. There will be no company tax rate reductions if the resource super profits tax does not go through. There will be no smallbusiness tax rate reductions if the resource super profits tax does not go through. There will be no small-business tax breaks in the form of $5,000 instant write-off of assets valued up to that amount-not just for the 720,000 small business companies but for every one of the 2.4 million businesses in this country. Do not believe the opposition when they say that the tax breaks for business would only be for small business companies. All businesses would get this instant write-off of the value of assets, up to the value of $5,000 for each, and all businesses would also get a reduction in the company tax rate. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition truly believes that mining companies are paying their fair share of tax and if she believes there should be no increase in taxes on companies, why on earth are the opposition proposing to increase taxes on mining companies and other companies by 1.7 percentage points? It will be a great big new tax on everything you buy, a tax to fund their paid parental leave scheme. BHP and Rio have already estimated that that tax would add hundreds of millions of dollars to their tax bills. So, you have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying the opposition are totally opposed to any increase in tax on mining companies, but they want to impose a 1.7 percentage point increase in tax on mining companies. We want to use the resource super profits tax process to fund a reduction in the company tax rate, not only for mining companies but for every company in Australia, large and small. I want to deal with this issue of a retrospective tax. We have a new definition, I think, from the member for Canning. He said the Western Australian royalty increase is not retrospective. Go figure. He said, ‘It's because Colin Barnett told them about it'-that means it is not retrospective! This scare campaign is confused and chaotic. There are obviously objections, raised by the mining industry, to the application of this tax to the Pilbara, to the Bowen Basin coalfields and so on. They say that it should not happen. By that reasoning, when tariffs rates in this country were being reduced over time by the Hawke and Keating governments and by the Howard government, those reductions should not have applied to existing automotive manufacturers, should not have applied to existing car plants and should not have applied to existing textile, clothing and footwear producers. The truth is that investment in this country would be fine under a resource super profits tax, as reflected in analysts' consensus recommendations. The E*TRADE Australia website today says, in most cases, ‘Buy, buy, buy.' The petroleum resource rent tax has proved to be a very stable tax and has been consistent with high levels of exploration and development in this country. (Time expired)",55
160,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have a government in this country that is meddling with Australia's future prosperity and the living standards of all Australians. Terry MCCrann was correct when he said: The so-called resource super profits tax is a case study of the Rudd Government in action. Of spin and outright deception, shameless and recklessly dangerous politicisation, and fiscal fiddling that would win grudging admiration from the master Paul Keating. This great big new tax will erode the value of superannuation savings for millions of average Australians. This massive loss in value seems to be lost on the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, who amazingly said that this is something the government is not worried about. He also said that this will have a very small impact on the retirement incomes of self-funded retirees. The arrogance of this government is breathtaking. Let us look at the figures. Since the government leaked the news of its great big tax on mining on 13 April, $90 billion has been wiped off the value of resources stocks in Australia-that is, more than 20 per cent of the value. Resources stocks account for about 9.3 per cent of superannuation balances. This means that over $23 billion has been ripped from superannuation accounts since the government leaked the news of its great big new tax. Superannuation is down around two per cent as a result of the performance of the resource stocks, yet Minister Bowen is not worried about this amount. He is on the record as saying that he is not ried at all that superannuants will be hit by the resources tax. And then, of course, there is the cost of living. The Australian people are still reeling from the realisation that the Prime Minister's other great big new tax on everything-the ETS-was going to drive the cost of living through the roof. They are now finding that this cost burden has merely been postponed until after the next election. Yet they are in for another great big slug: the impact of the RSPT on prices. This resource supertax will impact on the cost of energy and the cost of building materials. The increased cost of energy means Australians will pay more for electricity. The Prime Minister, who promised to take pressure off struggling families, was not content with the 64 per cent increase in power prices in New South Wales as a result of the ETS and state Labor's incompetence; he now wants to slug consumers again, and this time it is the RSPT-the great big new supertax. In the media today the Energy Supply Association boss, Brad Page, is reported as saying that consumers will not be quarantined if the 40 per cent tax drives up the price of coal, increasing the cost of electricity. He said: Any additional cost that's imposed on fuels will one way or another be sought to be passed through to consumers. He went on to say: To the extent that companies can shift taxes onto consumers, I expect they will try. Those comments do not come from the coalition; they come from the Energy Supply Association of Australia, an organisation that represents electricity generators, distributors and retailers. Then there is the impact on the cost of housing. Once again, this supertax will potentially drive up the cost of gravel, concrete and other building materials-all wor- this from a Prime Minister who promised he was going to drive down the cost of living. This is a very dangerous tax. It is a time bomb in the hands of an incompetent government. This is a government that could not give away pink batts without stuffing it up. It got ripped off to the tune of almost $1 million to build a dunny, as reported in the newspapers today, and it is proposing to drive a dagger through the heart of our future prosperity. This tax is creating a sovereign risk crisis for this country. It will drive away investment, it will increase the cost of capital, it will destroy the retirement nest eggs of average Australians and it will drive up the cost of living. This tax is being fraudulently represented by this government under the watch of a Prime Minister who stands for nothing. We see them ducking and weaving, quoting and misquoting one report after another, trying to justify their stance. The Australian people are not silly. They know about Australia's dependency on mining. They can see for themselves the importance of mining. They are very concerned about the impact of this tax on Australia's future prosperity, on employment and on the cost of living. It is an outrageous tax, and the coalition will oppose it to the end.",57
161,Mr GRAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (5.02 pm)-The leader of the miners' campaign, Clive Palmer, has talked about this tax producing a 70 per cent burden on business. Clive Palmer has talked erroneously of the impact of this tax on business and he has been prepared, on many occasions, to fund the opposition's campaign to argue that case. This blatantly false and unsubstantiated claim has been published and re-published. The truth is that the RSPT is not a tax imposed on top of royalties. It is not a tax imposed on top of company tax. It will effectively replace royalties by providing firms with a refundable tax credit for royalties. Where royalty payments are higher than the RSPT liability, firms will get a cash refund of the difference. These important points are forgotten by so many of those on the opposite side of this debate. I think it is important to acknowledge the importance of this debate, and it is important that those participating in it become better informed. It was with sadness that I listened to James Pearson, the head of the CCI in Western Australia, on the radio last week making the same logical error as Clive Palmer has. The RSPT is deductible against company tax. Even some sophisticated commentators have talked about the theoretical maximum tax rate of 56.8 per cent, as if every project will pay that rate. It is also correct for a number of reasons. One reason the estimates are wrong is that they ignore that the RSPT taxes only superprofits, not all profits. That means effectively taxing internationally traded commodities that might generate superprofits, like iron ore-not taxing projects that mine gravel, clay or sand. If a project does not generate superprofits, it will not pay any RSPT and it will benefit from a company tax cut to 28 per cent and the government refund on the royalties that it pays. I think it is important that we also acknowledge the important role that mining plays in our community and in our economy. In Western Australia, mining has built many regional centres. Unfortunately, frequently it does not pay the freight and the cost of supporting those regional centres. Early concessional royalty rates granted in the 1960s and the 1970s were granted on the assumption that mining companies would fund substantial infrastructure in remote and regional communities. As the 1970s progressed into the 1980s and as the economic rationalists took hold of these firms in the1990s, they stopped funding community infrastructure, but they hung on to the concessional royalty rates. So we see the situation in Western Australia that the concessional royalty rate of 3.75 per cent, which had been in place on projects since the 1960s, has now increased to 5.625 per cent, ensuring that companies do pay a better rate of return on the mines that they do have. It is important to recognise this, because mining companies in my home state of Western Australia, in the Pilbara, do not pay local government rates. For 40 or 50 years they have paid concessional royalties but they have not paid local government rates. What this means is that the provision of local government type functions has had to be funded from elsewhere or not provided at all. So inmining companies have quite happily established communities and they have quite happily sought tax deductions for the infrastructure that they have created, but they have not funded local communities through the payment of rates-taking the concessional royalty and not giving the infrastructure to their own communities. The Pilbara Regional Council five years ago reflected on this practice by referring to it as a form of cost shifting to local governments and families in remote and regional communities, cost shifting from the large companies. The Pilbara Regional Council at that time made the observation that they genuinely felt that companies should either be subject to increased royalties or pay the freight and pay local government rates. This debate comes down to an important matter. It comes down to whether it is possible to structure a tax in a way that effectively taxes pure profit and does not impact on economic activity, and I believe this proposal does that.

165,Mr SULLIVAN,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"Longman) (5.12 pm)When this debate on the appropriation bills was interrupted last evening I had been talking about some issues relating to the Home Insulation Program. There are a few more things that I would like to say about that program, and the funding in this budget gives me the opportunity to do that. Firstly, let me make it very, very clear that the lives lost in this program are a tragedy. Lives lost in any industrial accident are a tragedy, and members of the Labor Party and our colleagues in the labour movement are hit particularly hard by those losses. Workers ought to be able to go to work in the morning confident that they will return home that night. That is why companies registering to participate in the Home Insulation Program were required to give undertakings that, for the first time in this industry, they would comply with Australian and New Zealand standards and they would provide employees with training. In the course of retrofitting more than 1,100,000 ceilings with insulation four people lost their lives and, as I said earlier, is a tragedy. I do not want to diminish that tragedy in any way, but it would be as well for people to reflect on the incidence of industrial accidents causing death in this industry prior to the introduction of this program. I understand that in the previous 10 years four people also lost their lives in industrial accidents in the ceiling insulation retrofitting industry when the number of installations was roughly half those achieved under the government's program. To put it another way, the incidence of industrial accidents causing deaths in this industry halved. Again, I do not diminish the tragedy of the lives lost, but this is a noteworthy improvement and it is clearly a consequence of the requirements put in place for those companies seeking registration. Ceiling fires are cited as a second measure of the program and one which has also caused grief amongst those affected. If my information is correct, there have been around 120 ceiling fires in homes that have had insulation installed under the program. However, what is never published is the fact that in 2008 there were 84 ceiling fires in homes retrofitted with insulation that year. You do not have to be Einstein to recognise that 120 fires in 1.1 million installations is a massive improvement over 84 fires in the 67,500 installations fitted in 2008. From roughly one fire in every 800 installations before the introduction of the program to one fire in every 9,000 installations after the introduction of the program is an elevenfold improvement. I know that is not a comfort to those affected, but it too is a notable improvement over the industry's performance prior to the introduction of the program and an improvement that ought to be recognised. Clearly, the opportunity to participate in this program was irresistible to some with bad intentions, whether their gain was that through claiming for installations not made, delivering shoddy work or ignoring their responsibilities. But processes were in place for finding those people out and dealing with them. Through the work of government inspectors, the Leader of the Opposition was able to rise in this place and declare that there were some 240,000 roofs insulated under the program that had potential problems. Note the use of the word ‘potential'. These are roofs that only may have a problem, not roofs that actually do have a problem. I do not know if the Leader of the Opposition included in his figures the 50,000 ceilings that have been insulated by means of foil rolls, which are of concern particularly in Queensland. But, as I am in an expansive mood, I will add those to his 240,000. Because I am in a really good mood, let us round it out to 300,000 roofs. That is 300,000 of 1.1 million roofs that may have a problem-not ‘do have' a problem but ‘may have' a problem. The other side of that calculation is 800,000 roofs that do not have a problem. That is 800,000 families saving $200 a year on their energy bills. That is $160 million a year of energy that does not need to be generated. That is also a great achievement. We have acknowledged the shortcomings in the delivery of the Home Insulation Program, all of which manifested themselves in the actions of those dishonourable people who participated in that delivery. The government's main miscalculation was in thinking that we could trust all participants to liver our program honestly. This was the ultimate red-tape-free program. Give the government an undertaking that you will abide by the conditions and deliver training to your staff and the government gives you the opportunity to build a business for yourself and provide honest employment for others. I believe that those in the industry prior to the introduction of this program welcomed these enhancements and followed them implicitly. Unfortunately, some of the new entrants did not. Yesterday in this place the opposition environment spokesman criticised the government for heeding expert advice and discontinuing the program, thus causing difficulty, if not insolvency, for many in the industry. I recall correctly, the opposition's constant braying last year and earlier this year was that the government did not heed expert advice. They were wrong, of course, but that matters little to them. In the eyes of the position, it would seem, you are damned if you do and dammed if you don't. What is clear is that the opposition wanted the program scrapped, wanted a ministerial scalp and wanted to damage the government, and in all of those endeavours they found fellow travellers in the majority of the mainstream media. They might reflect on their role in the plight of the insulation industry today. This budget also provides for increases in alternative energy targets, as a consequence of the Senate's refusal, three times, to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme suite of bills. Both the then Labor opposition and the Howard government went to the 2007 federal election promising emissions trading schemes-schemes that were fairly similar. The Labor government that was formed after that election proceeded towards that goal, ultimately negotiating an agreement with the opposition that would see the delegislation put in place. However, the leadership of the opposition changed and the new leadership repudiated that agreement. It is a great irony that, had the legislation even then been supported by the Greens, it would have passed the Senate and we would have an ETS ready to be implemented. The maths of the Senate is such that without the support of all the Greens plus Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding the government is not able to pass this legislation and has acted accordingly. Rather than waste time and effort trying again and again to convince Mr Abbott and his colleagues to support the legislation, it is important to note that Senators Fielding and Xenophon will not support the government's legislation as they think it goes If too far and the Greens will not support it because they do not believe it goes far enough. The make-up of the Senate will change on 1 July next year, reflecting the result of an op- election due to be held between now and then. Most observers and commentators believe that the ALP and Greens combined will have a majority in the Senate chamber and the coalition will be irrelevant when those parties are in agreement. The Leader of the Opposition's high-risk strategy may well deliver Australia an ETS that he likes even less than the one previously agreed between the government and the coalition. What the Leader of the Opposition can take as a given is that the government remain totally committed to the introduction of an ETS. He can also take it as read that we are not so daft as to continue to hit our heads against the brick wall of an obstructionist Senate, no matter how many times he might taunt us with the oft stated view that carbon pollution reduction is the greatest moral challenge of our time. We still believe that. They once believed it too. They no longer believe it. They are blocking it in the Senate and they think it clever to criticise us for a broken promise. The promise stands. The government are acting pragmatically. The opposition might like to reflect on the consequences for those polluters they are protecting, should they fail in their high-risk political game. The resource superprofits tax has excited the multinational mining giants and some of our home-grown companies as well. This will, they say, kill the mining industry. I found a lovely passage online, and I would like to read it into the record today. It reads: … here's my big tip-the only thing that will the mining industry will be when they run out of things in the ground to dig up and sell. Isn't that the truth? That sounds remarkably like the opinion expressed in January by Queensland mining magnate Clive Palmer. It is remarkably unlike the opinion he expresses today. The Treasurer made a lengthy statement on this taxation measure in the parliament yesterday, and I recommend to readers of this speech that they read that statement also. However, there are some things that I want to reiterate. Ten years ago the mining industry contributed to Australia and its people one dollar in every three of profit and today it contributes only one in every seven-from around 33 per cent 10 years ago to around 15 per cent today. The current royalty and company tax regime means that as profits rise, taxes fall. That is why it is the megamines that are developed: they return less to the people of Australia who own the minerals and they return more to the people of the world who own the shares in the multinationals. Admittedly, some of those shares are held by Australians, but not the majority. The proposed new regime will make smaller mining operations viable, and they will most likely be undertaken by Australian companies, not multinationals. In fact, under this tax regime, mining companies earning less than 10 per cent return on investment will pay less in taxes than they do now, according to a table that I have seen. I want to make a brief mention of the GP Super Clinics Program that is extended in this budget. The opposition has been loud in its criticism of this program, contending that only two GP superclinics are operational. Yesterday in the chamber we saw the pleased-as-Punch photographs of the member for Paterson taken at the recent opening in his electorate of the third clinic. This prokill gram was introduced as a five-year program, and those opposite know it. So let us have a look at progress to date, two years into a five-year program. Three GP superclinics, including the very successful Strathpine clinic in the electorate of the shadow health minister-and, incidentally, opposed by him-are open and operational. Seventeen GP superclinics are now under construction. Logically they will be operational within the third year of the five-year program. A further 15 GP superclinics are now under contract. Construction will no doubt start as soon as practical on those. One-only one-of the 36 original GP superclinics is yet to be put under contract. This five-year program is well underway, and the extension of the program in this budget is a recognition of the popularity of the concept. In my own electorate of Longman I have already had some preliminary discussions in relation to accessing this extended program to overcome some of the health service gaps that are evident. I note that the opposition have indicated that, should they win government, they will cut this program. It is interesting that the tion candidate contesting Longman supports that cut, despite having already made a commitment to a similar facility on Bribie Island which he says will not be affected because it is ‘fundamentally different' to the GP Super Clinics Program-although exactly how it is fundamentally different seems to be a mystery. The bad news for him is in shadow finance minister Mr Robb's fine print-that commitment, it would appear, has been discontinued. This is an excellent budget. It is a budget for its time. It is a budget that honours the commitments made by the government 12 months ago-commitments that the opposition said we could not meet. The response from the opposition to this budget is as predictable as it is wrong. I commend the budget to the House.",60
166,Mr ROBERT,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"The 2010-11 Labor budget is a typical bigspending budget, to counter a recession Australia never had. This budget is an even bigger spending budget fuelled by new taxes on cigarettes and mining. It is a simple demonstration that you cannot trust this government to even identify a surplus, let alone look at delivering one. Labor has categorically failed to control its reckless spending after the global financial crisis. This budget sees $26 billion in new spending since the last budget-hardly an austerity measure to be proud of. This budget is built on the twin towers of two new taxes: mining, $12 billion, and cigarettes, $5.5 billion. This budget does not even have the capacity to sort out its spending on its own right: vast and expansive new taxes had to be added so that this budget would even come together, let alone look credible. This budget will continue to put enormous pressure on interest rates as cash floods through the economy-all borrowed, and that borrowing crowds out the borrowing of small to medium business, coaliforcing interest rates up once again. It is ironic that Labor's figures in this budget are vastly different to what they predicted in the last budget. Economic growth this year was supposed to fall by 0.5 per cent, but now we are told it will actually grow by two per cent. Yet our ability to repay the mounting and vast debt-an extra $40 billion alone in net debt in this budget-is all based on the Treasurer's guesswork. The Treasurer is putting the country at risk with massive higher taxes, massive higher spending, higher interest rates from inflationary pressure and higher investment premiums, and a crowding out of private sector investors who are also looking for debt to expand their programs. Logically it has to result in lower growth due to the fiscal drag that debt always puts on an economy. Peak public debt will now be $93.7 billion by 2013. The last Labor government took 12 to 13 years to reach this figure. This government is taking a fraction of that time. In fact, this government is borrowing $100 million a day. That is $4 million an hour. By the time. I finish speaking, this government will have borrowed a million bucks to fuel its spending spree that it refuses to get under control. This government cannot spell austerity, let alone meet it. The average Australian family will be paying over $1,000 a year just to pay the interest on Labor's debt. It is remarkable that all the Labor governments in the history of our Federation have left the nation in debt-all of them. Labor is addicted to spending. We now have another four years of deficit, all because of one quarter of negative growth in 2008. It would appear that any improvement on the bottom line is going to be through good luck and the grace of God, because it certainly cannot be put down to sound management. If we look at Labor's programs budget line by budget line we see blow out by blow out. We see a home insulation program with a billion dollar repair job. The member for Longman had the temerity to say, ‘Yes, there was a tragic loss of four lives in the insulation debacle, but in the previous 10 years there was the loss of five lives; therefore, under this program there has been half as many and that's a good thing.' May I remind the member for Longman that any needless death of a young Australian is a dreadful thing, especially at the hands of an incompetent government and an incompetent program. He said, ‘Sure, there are 300,000 houses whose insulation must be checked, but that is all right as there are 800,000 that are fine, and those 800,000 will be enjoying lower electricity bills.' My heart goes out to the 300,000 families whose mums and dads each night tuck their kids in and look at their ceiling and wonder what is up there. I guess that did not cross the member for Longman's mind. We have the Julia Gillard memorial halls-a proper noun. The Building the Education Revolution has a $1.7 billion program blow-out and a waste which could be as high as $8 billion. This could be the most wasteful program in the history of the nation. The computers in schools program has a billiondollar blow-out. The National Broadband Network, which needed $4.7 billion to give broadband to 98 per cent of Australian homes, now needs $43 billion to give broadband to 90 per cent of Australia homes-a $38.3 billion blow-out. The consultancy contracts this government said it would have are now $605 million plus. It is instructive to look line by line at achievements of this government. Those in the nation who would like to see Labor's election promises will find it difficult because the 2007 election promises have been removed from the ALP website. Clearly, you are so proud of the promises you took to the nation when you looked them in the eye and said, ‘This is what Labor stands for.' Clearly, you were so proud of what you stood for that you have taken them down from your website. You organised the best and the brightest summit, yet I cannot think of a single thing out of it that you have used-not one. You brought together 1,000 people and thought you would open up government to scrutiny.",64
167,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"Member for Fadden, as you should be speaking through the chair, it is not me you are referring to but the other side of the House.",65
168,Mr ROBERT,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"Mea culpa, Mr Deputy Speaker. Labor organised the best and the brightest summit. Labor said that they were throwing open the doors of government to allow the nation to decide priorities and to go in set directions. Not a single thing has come out of it-not one. Fuelwatch was one of the greatest and most costly fiascos abandoned. GroceryWatch followed in its damned footsteps. The Building the Education Revolution has a $16.7 billion blow-out. Building contractors, states and bureaucrats are billing them a feast in return for libraries and gyms. We have seen buildings costing $5,000 per square metre when they should have cost $1,000 per square metre. It is highly conceivable that at least half of this money is being absolutely and utterly rorted and wasted, perhaps even corruptly so. The Deputy Prime Minister organised an investigation and-surprise, surprise!-it will return and report after the election. We move on to the Home Insulation Program, which was an absolute unmitigated the disaster. Thousands and thousands of businesses are now destroyed, young Australians dead, houses burnt down and billions of dollars wasted. We move onto every child in every school in Australia getting a computer. This program is moving with the speed of an asthmatic ant with a heavy load of shopping. By the time these students will be eligible to receive their computer, they will have finished high school. There was no allocation for software, for maintenance, for support or for ancillary services like air conditioning, three-phase power, hubs, switches and routers to go with it. Any industry professional will tell you that for every $1 in computing hardware spent upfront it may cost as much as $3 to manage it, to run it, to keep it going and to support it. None of that was included. This was all about an election highlight, about the Prime Minister standing there with a laptop above his head saying, ‘This is the toolbox of the 21st century.' We saw the home solar water initiative abruptly ended three weeks early with eight hours notice, causing chaos in the industry. Many people who were intending to lodge applications in good faith missed out. The Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, blamed a cost blow-out, with the original estimate of $150 million blowing out to over $750 million. We saw the Green Loans Program with thousands of people quitting their jobs, paying $3,000 for qualifications and insurance to be trained as assessors only to find the demand grossly exaggerated. The Courier Mail reported on 2 February: … the Federal Government predicted up to 200,000 homeowners would take up the loans and only 1000 have done so. … … … Instead of training 1500 to 2000 well-qualified assessors, the Government permitted a blowout. It is now estimated there will be up to 11,500 sors. Instead of getting the $50 bonus for getting the home insulation assessment done, none of those has been sent out. The interesting thing is that the Green Loans Program, the solar hot water initiative and the absolute nightmare of the Home Insulation Program were all the result of one incompetent minister. You would think that the minister would be summarily sacked but, no, he stays where he is, a few responsibilities are taken off him and he stays in cabinet. Thousands and thousands of Australians are suffering without work and without jobs. This government keeps him. It is symptomatic of a government more concerned about itself than it is about the nation. This government, in August 2008, dismantled the Howard government's immigration and border protection laws that had reduced the inflow of illegal vessels to one. Now we have had over 125 illegal vessels and over 4,000 illegal immigrants, and the flow continues because this government does not have the courage of its convictions to stop it. Let me reiterate that an elected coalition government will reinstate a form of temporary protection visa. We will, with the help of our friends, neighbours and allies, turn boats around. We will get the flow of illegal immigrants and illegal boats back down to where it was in the Howard years. Under this government, climate change was ‘the greatest moral challenge of our generation'. Few stronger words have been uttered in these hallowed halls by a Prime Minister: ‘the greatest moral challenge of our generation'. They are words normally reserved for when a nation finds itself in conflict or at war. Those words were backed up by Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, when he said last November that it would be an act of ‘absolute political cowardice, an absolute failure of leadership' not to act on climate asseschange until other nations had done so. And then, in the space of a few short weeks, may I suggest that he embodied those words when, in an act of absolute political cowardice, he shelved the ETS because the polling was not going his way. So much for ‘the greatest moral challenge of our generation'. How many of the 2,650 promised trade training centres are open-one, two, surely no more than 10. How many of the 260 promised childcare centres have opened? Oops, that's right; the most junior minister was sent out to scrap it. How many of the promised GP superclinics are there? Two are fully functional out of 31-an absolute and utter disaster. If these ministers were in vate business they would be broke. But that is right: across all of the cabinet ministers, the number of years they have spent in small to medium businesses or running their own business can be counted on two hands. It is interesting that the government also established the Australian Social Inclusion Board. This rarely heard of bureaucracy was set up because every Australian should have the opportunity to be a full participant in the life of the nation. But who has ever heard of the board? What has the board done? What policy has the board put into? How is the board instructed about what the government is doing? Or is it one more of the over 150 commissions, inquiries, reports and boards that have been set up? That takes me to the Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program, the SIHIP. Initially set up by a memorandum of understanding in September 2007, in July 2009 Lateline reported that it had not yet built a single house. In two years it had not built a single house, yet it had spent $45 lion of its $672 million budget-but not a single house. A government report dated August 2009 said the program was being criticised because it was too slow to deliver, its governance was overly bureaucratic and the program was too costly in terms of the unit cost of housing and administration. It makes a good segue, as it sounds like a perfect phrase to describe the Rudd government writ large. The houses are expected to cost between $450,000 and $529,000, factoring in administration costs and contingencies. For a program that began in September 2007, as at 1 February this year, two houses had been built-just two-but $672 million had been spent. There is nothing like a federal Labor government working with a territory Labor government! The massive splurge under the global financial crisis sent money directly to taxpaypriers and, indeed, over $100 million to nontaxpayers. Some pets even received the $900 because of the establishment of wills and the reporting of money through them. People bought large-screen, imported TVs to stimulate the economy and to avoid the effects of what the Prime Minister and the Treasurer said was the worse financial crisis since the Depression in the 1930s. In fact, unemployment was 11 per cent in 1991; in 2009, it did not get to six per cent. There was a surplus in 2007-08, when the Howard government lost the election, and that surplus quickly turned into a $57 billion deficit. Clearly, the global financial crisis was to blame! No credit was given to the Howard and Costello years for leaving the Labor Party in an outstanding budgetary position. No credit was given to the insatiable demand from China for resources. No credit was given to the fact that we were debt free, with money in the bank. No credit was given to the stability of our economy and our flexible workplace laws. No credit was given at all to the fact that milthere was room for the Reserve Bank to lower interest rates. No, it was all the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister saved the day! I suggest that all this Prime Minister has done is spend us into a dreadful hole. In terms of the stimulus packages the Prime Minister rolled out, they contained very little major infrastructure. School halls and gyms-that was the way forward! This government was looking at attracting a whole range of retired nurses back into the profession using a return to work bonus. When they announced the scheme, they talked about 7,750 take-ups, but less than 1,000 have been taken up. This government promised to take Japan to the international court for its whaling; I wonder what incompetent minister that was? Once again, it was Minister Garrett. Now he says it will not be until November that the issue will be settled and-surprise, surprise-that will be after the next election. Then of course the government announced they would keep 30 per cent of the states' GST to fund 60 per cent of hospital costs in the states and territories. There are massive strings attached. The states had not been given any details, only an executive summary, before the Commonwealth backed down. The states will maintain control of their hospitals. All this health reform is to do is create three new statutory bureaucracies to manage this massive structure. When we read the contents of the budget, we see that there will be 1½ thousand new public servants in the Department of Defence and 500 fewer uniformed personnel. We saw a government that said they would take a meataxe to the Public Service, and all we have seen is 20,000 new public servants. We saw a government that said that, for every regulation put in, they would take one out. Well, over 9,000 new or amended regulations have gone in and less than 100 have been taken out. This government has only contributed a new definition to ‘spin'. It has only left us in a massive hole of debt. It has only thrown our public accounts into disarray and put upward pressure on interest rates, because it is crowding out the debt market and fuelling the economy with cash. This government will go down as the worse government in the history of our land. It will go down as being worse than the Whitlam government in terms of its profligate spending, what it has not achieved and the damage it has done. This is one of the worse budgets our nation has seen-$40 billion. In the 20 minutes I have spoken, this government has borrowed over $1 million to fuel its debt binge that does not look like it will ever end.",65
169,Mr NEUMANN,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"Blair) (5.45 pm)Managing the Australian economy, which is one of the largest economies in the world, is a challenge for any government of any persuasion at the best of times. When faced with the challenge of a global recession the Rudd government acted quickly, decisively and with definition to support the Australian economy by making it more resilient, by preparing it for the future and by making it stronger. As well the government were all the time helping Australian families, our young going people and our seniors. We have acted immediately to stimulate the economy in a Keynesian way when those opposite would do nothing. They would disinvest in the economy. We supported 200,000 Australian jobs through investing in people in retail, in the construction industry and in the service industry, and they have jobs now. If those opposite sat on this side of the chamber, those people would be out of a job. That would be the consequence of the inaction, inactivity and negligence of those opposite disinvesting in infrastructure and of the policies or nonpolicies they would undertake if they sat on the Treasury benches. We have invested in the economy and in vital infrastructure to build capacity to improve productivity. We have invested in skills and training, in health and hospitals and in roads, rail and renewables. We are protecting the jobs of Australians. Our Nation Building and Jobs Plan is the envy of the world. The truth is that we have faster growth, the lowest debt to GDP ratio and the second lowest unemployment rate in the OECD world. We delivered, for a third year in a row, tax cuts to working families with increased pensions. We looked after carers, supported those on disability support pensions and cared for the poor, the weak and the oppressed. Those opposite, during nearly 12 years on the Treasury benches, engaged in class warfare against those people. We supported small businesses. We helped out in the community in terms of infrastructure in local government, which is a vital player in the Australian economy. We have reduced red tape and we have given small business advice, assistance and mentoring through business enterprise centres across the country. We are spending $37 billion in land transport and infrastructure across the years until 2013-14. The Nation Building Program is a success. The Roads to Recovery has supplied record amounts of money, as has the Black Spot Program. We can see that in my community. If those opposite were on this side they would not be doing it. We heard from the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy in question time today in answer to a question that I put to him in relaRoads tion to candidates. There are candidates for the coalition under the title ‘the LNP' in Queensland. The LNP is considering a council candidate in Ryan and I am about to face a councillor in Blair. The LNP has endorsed councillors in Wright and Dawson. They all voted for the nation-building and stimulus package in their councils and in their communities. Now it seems that they are coming to this chamber with aspiration in their hearts to support a party that opposes the nationbuilding and stimulus package in communities across the country. These are the very communities they purport to represent in the federal electorates they are standing for under the LNP in Queensland. They come here and say: ‘Oh, I must have forgotten. Political amnesia. I didn't vote for that and didn't support that in my council.' They are purporting to represent a party, the LNP, that opposes the very projects which they voted for, which they managed and in which they cooperated with the Rudd government to deliver in their communities. There are many of these councillors across Queensland, across South-East Queensland where I live and across the country. The Rudd government's initiatives in South-East Queensland, where one in seven Australians live, are vital for the fastest growing region in the country. The coalition has a record of neglect when it comes to South-East Queensland. Look at the most vital community infrastructure that we have had in South-East Queensland-roads. Inexplicably the coalition opposed the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway, which is so important to the people in Toowoomba, Brisbane, the Lockyer Valley, the Somerset region and the Scenic Rim. They opposed it and we are delivering it. It is vital community infrastructure and part of the $37 billion that we are delivering in this budget in relation to roads. We had record amounts of money put into to Recovery across the region. In this budget there was $1.3 million funding for the Ipswich City Council in Roads to Recovery. The Lockyer Valley had $646,000, the Scenic Rim Regional Council had $791,000 and the Somerset Regional Council had $653,000. There were record amounts of money for local roads in Ipswich and the West Morton region. The coalition gave nothing like that sort of assistance to local councils. And there were vital community infrastructure projects. The Black Spot funding is a record amount of money. The financial assistance grants to those councils was a massive increase in funding to them. All of the money goes towards supporting local jobs. In fact in the financial assistance grants that we have seen here there was a record $2 billion for 2010-11 to local councils in the Ipswich and West Morton area and across the country for basic services, parks and for upgrading local amenities and facilities. It $578 million more than last year. We are cooperating with local councils to deliver projects, support jobs and improve amenities and infrastructure. That is really important. In my region under the better regions plan committed to in the last election there was $575,000 for the George Alder Tennis Centre and $600,000 for the Ipswich basketball stadium upgrade. These are premier sporting facilities in South-East Queensland. There was also $2 million for the Ipswich CBD redevelopment. The coalition could not give a stuff about Ipswich. For all the time that they were in government, they could not have cared less about Ipswich. We never got the money. They neglected Ipswich. They failed to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway. In fact, my predecessor was inexplicably opposed to the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. On 27 October 2009, we saw the leader of the most irrelevant party in this place, the National Party, come out and say that he would stop the construction of the Ipswich Motorway. It is inexplicable when the project will support 10,000 jobs in South-East Queensland, in places like Dinmore and Goodna. The project will generate 10,000 jobs, and the coalidid tion oppose it. They shed crocodile tears when it comes to jobs, infrastructure and assistance to working families. That is what it is about: crocodile tears. They vote one way here and then go back to their electorates and vote another way. The coalition get their candidates to vote one way in their electorates, but when they come here they support a party with another view. That is rank political inconsistency from those opposite. We are used to it in Queensland because we had to endure the ‘blessings' of the National Party for so many years. They are absolute experts when it comes to regional rorts, as we have seen. But when it comes to was vital community infrastructure, they forget about it. What about the black spot funding? these We have seen the state LNP member for Lockyer shed crocodile tears over the Warrego Highway. The previous government reduced the funding for the Warrego Highway; we increased it. It is very important to note that the $3 million black spot funding in the appropriation bills will go towards improving the Warrego Highway. We have put $1.9 million towards the upgrade of the Haigslea-Amberley Road Intersection. The previous government did nothing like that. We have put in $10 million to resurface the road from Tivoli to Blacksoil. What did the coalition do when they were in government for 12 years? We saw none of that money put into the Ipswich and West Moreton corridor. The coalition purported to represent the farmers in the Lockyer Valley, the Scenic Rim and Somerset regions, yet they did nothing to the Warrego Highway-except cut back its funding. The black spot funding for the Cunningham Highway went to fixing up roads for places like Kalbar and Boonah. The sides of the roads were breaking; there were no barriers on the side of the road. For years the coalition neglected that situation; they nothing about it. The farmers in the Scenic Rim constantly complained about the Cunningham Highway, and so we have money in this budget for black spot funding to help the farmers in regional and rural areas. There is of course no federal member yet for the new seat of Wright. I hope that Andrew Ramsay will come to this place as the Labor candidate for that electorate. If he comes here, he will vote for vital community infrastructure in that area, whereas his opponent will not. That is the reality. The member for Fadden talked about GP superclinics. I have one opening in my electorate, at the University of Queensland, in Ipswich, in August and the member for Fadden is welcome to attend. The editorial of the Queensland Times-the only daily newspaper in my electorate-told the coalition to get its hands off the GP superclinics. The coalition want to get rid of GP superclinics. Recently I was up in the Somerset region doing a mobile office-I have done 140 of them since the last election-and at the Esk Show I talked to people about the possibility of them applying for funding. We cannot guarantee that they will get a GP superclinic, but people want more medical facilities up in the Somerset region. I can tell you that the coalition will not give them a GP superclinic. They will not get one at Springfield or anywhere else because the coalition will close them down. I will tell you another thing, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is likely that they will starve the GP superclinics of funds because they are opposed to them. While I was at Esk recently, I also attended the council chambers for Somerset Region Business Alliance. Bob Whalley, a prominent LNP member, is the president of the alliance. He talked about how the Somerset Regional Council was going to cooperate with the Rudd government, how important the National Broadband Network was for the Somerset region and how vital it was for the dozens and dozens of small business operators there. Guess who will be the candidate opposing me at the next election? The deputy mayor of the Somerset region, a bloke who voted for the Fernvale Sports Centre but will come here to represent a party that will oppose the $2.1 million that the government is putting into the Fernvale Sports Centre and the Esk rail trail and Esk skate park. These projects are being funded by the Rudd government under the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. The candidate was not there at that meeting. But I said to Bob, ten, mate, your side is blocking this stuff.' That was before the catastrophe last week when we saw the three stooges giving their budget in-reply speech and their Press Club fiasco. I said to Bob Whalley and other people at the Somerset Regional Business Alliance: ‘If you vote for the coalition, you won't get a national broadband up here at Somerset or other regional rural areas. But, if you vote for Labor, you'll get it.' The situation is that the coalition will oppose it and gut it. The coalition say that they are for regional and rural Australia but they voted against the road funding. They say that they are in favour of regional and rural Australia but they voted against the education funding under the BER. Under the BER, we are putting $21 million into vital community infrastructure for 18 schools in the Somerset region. This will include trade training centres, schools libraries and community halls. The schools love the BER. I have been to all the schools in the area, and they love it. The coalition oppose the BER. I wonder which one of those projects they will cut back. It is the same situation with the trade training centres in Ipswich. We have another one opening soon at St Edmund's Boys College and the two grammar schools-Ipswich Grammar School and Ipswich Girls' Grammar School. This is $3 million for the trade training centre. They are getting one in the Lockyer Valley, at the Lockyer District High. However, no other schools will get a training centre if the coalition gets in. We will have to see what happens then. That is it what the coalition are all about. They are about opposing education. I went to a lot of these schools. The computer in schools program is being rolled out to high schools across the region. The schools really like what we are doing there-but the coalition will get rid of that policy. It will get rid ‘Lisof that funding. The schools will not get computers. How does the coalition think that schools will communicate with the world? Don't they want IT? Don't they want the latest computers in places like Boonah, Kalbar, Ipswich, Esk and Fernvale? They do not want that. However, we will deliver those things to those areas-and we are delivering them. I can see it happening across my electorate-that is the truth. The coalition oppose all of that. They are opposed to the national secondary schools computer program-$2.1 billion over six years. They are opposed to the BER funding. They are against those programs. But that is not the experience on the ground when you talk to school principals in my area-not just those in the state school system but in the other school systems. I was recently speaking at the Lutheran state convention, which was held in Ipswich. Neil Schiller, who is the principal of Bethany Lutheran School, talked to me about how wonderful the BER funding was for their particular school. It brought forward the time-frame for their school redevelopment project from 10 years to five years. It is a lovely private primary school in Ipswich with a great reputation. That is the situation locally. Sitting the audience at the Lutheran convention was my putative opponent. But I will tell you what, if he gets in here, he will vote against that funding for the school which he was visiting during that convention. That is the reality of political life, the inconsistency. I believe that whether you live in Ipswich, Melbourne, Sydney or Canberra, as a kid you should have the same opportunities in life. Education is the key to development. It is about not just financial security but opportunity for our young people. Those opposite do not seem to really believe that education is important. They think that it is something that you should be allowed to do if you can afford to. We support parents choosing whichever school they want, so we will support the wonderful private schools in my electorate as well as the state schools in my electorate. There is one thing in this budget that I think is very important. The Howard government had this stupid idea of only allowing legal aid for Commonwealth matters. We have in large part addressed the inequities in legal aid. When I was practicing as a litigation lawyer in Brisbane and across Ipswich and various other areas, people who could not get legal aid were disadvantaged in court. This budget provides an additional $154 million for legal assistance services. I am pleased to say that I lobbied very hard for that. I thank the Attorney-General and the Treasurer for that funding. There were a number of people in our caucus-people like the member for Isaacs and the member for Fremantle-who have been advocating for this for quite some time. That is an important change. I have spoken to a number of lawyers, barristers and solicitors, in Brisbane recently about that funding. They are thrilled that the Rudd government has taken steps to redress in the injustice and inequity that was perpetrated and perpetuated by the Howard government on litigants. If you were poor, disadvantaged, had troubles with the English language or were Indigenous, you were at the mercy of the Howard government's pernicious policies on legal aid. That was the case, but we have redressed that issue in this budget, and I am very pleased that we have done so. We have also made a big impact when it comes to defence housing in this budget. Soon I will open another 20 houses in Raceview. We have opened dozens and dozens up in Flinders View where I live. There is nation-building stimulus funding in this budget for those things. We want to help our defence personnel. It is extremely important to do so. What we have done in that regard is vital, because supporting our defence personnel, their families and their children is crucial retention and recruitment. They play an important role in the Ipswich community. The RAAF base at Amberley is a superbase. It is getting bigger. It is worth billions of dollars to the Ipswich community every year. We honour our defence personnel. They are valued members of our community and their families are as well. There are two other aspects to this budget which I want to mention very briefly and applaud the government on. The first is the $55 million package for former F111 fuel tank maintenance workers. I thank the member for Brisbane for his inquiry and I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who has worked with the people affected. The previous government's performance in this regard was atrocious; absolutely woeful. We have committed $55 million to bring some degree of justice to these people and to improve their care. The change we have made will mean that 2,400 extra personnel, including the pick-and-patch workers, will receive assistance. Over 3,000 more personnel will be covered for any of the 31 conditions identified by the study of health outcomes in aircraft maintenance personnel. I also thank the government for in large part adopting the recommendations of the Clarke review of veterans' entitlements, particular those in relation to people who suffered terribly due to the British nuclear ing. I thank the government for the $24.2 million over five years to provide disability pensions and assistance for those people who suffered due to the nuclear tests. I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for changing the designation of those people. I thank him for the compassion and the empathy he has shown to those people, who suffered badly. I commend these appropriation bills to the House, because they will make a big difference in my electorate of Blair.  for speak on the Rudd government's third budget, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 20102011 and related bills. As the shadow minister for education, apprenticeships and training, I want to particularly talk about education. There is no doubt that this budget has been a great disappointment in the area of education for people across Australiateachers, parents, principals, people in higher education, people in trades and apprenticeships-who had hoped to see a budget with some vision on education. But unfortunately this budget was almost silent on the issue of education. There was virtually no mention at all of higher education in the budget. The only times that it was mentioned in the budget was in an announcement of a further delay or further blow-out in programs that had been announced previously. In this government and in this minister for education, we have seen masters of the disappearing program. The first promise that the government made before the last election was that they would deliver 2,650 trade training centres, one to every secondary college across Australia. It will never happen. So far they have managed to deliver 12. Only 12 out of 2,650 trade training centres are operational in Australia. The program has been delayed, the program has blown out in cost and they are now saying that they will deliver one in 10 trade training centres. So test- they will deliver-maybe-265 trade training centres rather than the 2,650 that they promised. That is just one of their programs. We have the now infamous computers in schools program. Everybody would remember the then opposition leader with Julia Gillard, the then shadow minister for education, waving a laptop around before the last federal election and declaring it to be the toolbox of the 21st century. He cannot have just a normal-sounding program. This was 970,000 laptop computers to be placed in the hands of every student from year 9 to year 12. They have so far delivered 220,000 out of 970,00 and the program will now be delivered over seven years, longer than it took to complete the Second World War, and at great expense. That is another blow-out of at least $1 billion that we can absolutely verify-another failure by the master of the appearing program. It gets worse. Under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program-which has also been described as the school hall rip-off program and the Julia Gillard memorial school hall program-we know from hearings last week of the Senate inquiry into the waste and mismanagement of the Building the Education Revolution that there has been at least $5 billion wasted or siphoned off or gouged or mismanaged under this $16.2 billion program. That is on top of the $1.7 billion blow-out that the government already admitted to earlier this year. That is a $1.7 billion blow-out, a $1 billion blow-out in computers in schools and a $5 billion blowout in the school hall rip-off program, making this minister the $7.7 billion blow-out woman. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, Mr Shorten, finds this all very amusing, because of course he has no love at all for the Minister for Education and in fact would probably prefer to take her job rather than have the one he has now. Mr Shorten-Madam Deputy Speaker, a point of order",68
170,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,Order! No point of order.  sit down. Mr Shorten-My point of order is that,74
171,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"No point of order, Parliamentary Secretary.  standing orders, Bill, you might be a bit better off. Can I turn to the $1.7 billion blowout in the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. There is real scandal involved in this blow-out because the Deputy Prime Minister told this House that the reason there dis- had been a $1.7 billion blow-out was the enormous take-up of the program by schools. She led this House to believe that the reason for the blow-out was a much greater take-up of the program by schools than had been expected. She said in this parliament on 10 September: Theybeing the oppositionhave tried to create the imagery that somehow builders are inflating prices and the government has had to tip in more money. That is simply not true. More money is going into this program because it is going gangbusters, because more schools want to be in this program. That, unfortunately, was a bare-faced lie and she misled the parliament. The Auditor General, reporting in the last month into the BER concerns on page 24, said Ultimately, the need for the additional funding provided by the Government in August 2009 arose from most schools having sought the maximum payments available. It did not flow from any deficiencies identified in the procurement processes or other activities of Educational Authorities in delivering the program, nor was it the result of more schools seeking to participate than had originally been forecast. The Auditor-General directly, specifically and with intent clearly rebuked the Deputy Prime Minister and made it absolutely clear that what she had told the House was utterly untrue.  point of order: the shadow minister at the dispatch box cannot say of the Deputy Prime Minister that she misled the parliament. If he wants to sustain that argument, there are forms of the House that he, as Manager of Opposition Business, well knows that he must pursue. Unless he pursues a substantive motion, I would ask him to withdraw those remarks as they are unparliamentary.  remarks, and if I return to that subject. I move a substantive motion. It is disappointing that the member for Chifley has to come into the House and take an appropriate point of order when the parliamentary secretary, who fancies himself as Prime Minister embarrassingly, sat here for five minutes and took no point of order at all. No doubt the Leader of the House will take that up with the parliamentary secretary, because his job in the House is to monitor what the opposition is saying and doing, but he was doing no such thing. I return to the budget and the disappearing programs that are the hallmark of the education aspect of this budget. The other one that is an embarrassment to the government is the School Chaplaincy Program. The School Chaplaincy Program is set to end in 2011. This was a program which the Howard government initiated. It is extremely popular in both government and non-government schools, but particularly in government schools. We committed to this program in the forward estimates, and the opposition has committed $165 million in the future, to ensure that this program becomes a permanent fixture of our government and nongovernment schools. It is a very popular program, because there are many young people who, for whatever reason, may not speak to their parents or their uncles or aunts or best friends about problems they might be having but are more inclined to speak to somebody whom they regard as somewhat of a stranger or as someone who is becoming a friend. That is one of the reasons the School Chaplaincy Program has worked so successfully. This government has not committed to it in this budget in an ongoing way. The funding is due to finish at the end of 2011. It has put no extra money into making sure it will continue into the future. It is not a program that has been earmarked for growth. Yet will again, the government has announced a review of the chaplaincy program, which amazingly is due to report after the election. Of course, if the Labor Party is unfortunately returned to government in this country, I think there will be a lot of very nasty surprises for a lot of people after the next election. We have talked about trade training centres and we could talk about the school hall rip-off program until the cows come home. I also want to cover an issue that my honourable friend at the table, the shadow minister for early childhood education and childcare, the status of women and other issues, will be interested in-that is, the disappearing childcare centre program. In yet another one of the Ruddisms that we have to tolerate all the time from this Prime Minister, he was going to end the dreaded double drop-off. In other words, you would have a childcare centre at the school and you would therefore be able to drop all your children at the same place. Of course, it was just another promise designed to get them elected in the 2007 election. They never had any intention of delivering that program. They quietly and embarrassingly tried to sneak it through in the last paragraph of a Kate Ellis press release a few weeks ago that they would not be continuing with the childcare centre program. Mr Shorten-Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the honourable member should refer to people by their title.",74
172,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Parliamentary Secretary. The member for Sturt will refer to members by their correct titles.  criticism. The childcare centre program was to include 260 childcare centres. It is now going to be 38. None of the others apparently need to be built; 222 will go the way of the dodo and never see the light of day-another one of this government's broken promises in the education area, along with computers in schools, the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program, which has been a welldocumented fiasco, the trade training centres and the School Chaplaincy Program. I turn now to one of the issues that specifically relate to South Australia-that is, the great big new mining tax, which will do tremendous damage to the resources sector in my state of South Australia. You do not need to take my word for it. Marius Kloppers from BHP has already warned that dividend payments to their 540,000 shareholders will be hit by the federal government's great big new tax on mining. BHP Billiton has made it clear that all of their projects in Australia on the table, including the Olympic Dam expansion in South Australia at Roxby Downs, which is the largest mining project in South Australia and one of the largest in Australia and the world. If properly expanded, it would be the largest copper mine in the world. That is at risk as a consequence of the government's great big new tax on mining. What have we heard from the South Australian Labor MPs and senators on that subject? Nothing but a full throated endorsement of the great big new tax on mining that will put at risk the Olympic Dam expansion in my state. Another great mining project in my state that is at risk as a consequence of the great big new tax on mining is the Prominent Hill copper and gold mine in South Australia. Neil Hamilton, the Chairman of OZ Minerals, said that his company would not be able to finish a feasibility study for a potential $300 million project at its Prominent Hill copper and gold mine in South Australia until more detail of the new tax is known. We know that Prominent Hill and Olympic Dam are just two of the mining projects that are at risk in South Australia as a consequence of this government's fatally flawed great big new tax on mining, which is a dagger pointed at the heart of the Australian economy and, in this case, of the South Australian economy. I would also like to talk a little bit about some projects in my own electorate. I can tell you that, if the coalition gets elected at the coming election-and we hope that will be sooner rather than later so that we can put this country out of the misery it is enduring under this Rudd Labor government-then I will be fighting in my electorate of Sturt for funding for a number of the black spot projects that need to be done. I will do so from a position where we will have a Treasurer and a Prime Minister who can actually manage the books of the country, a Prime Minister are and a Treasurer in Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, who will be capable of ensuring that we get back into surplus again and we pay down the Labor Party's $93 billion debt, which does not even include the $18 billion for the National Broadband Network and other projects, so that we will be in a position to fund the important black spot projects in my electorate that this budget is silent on. I am talking about projects like the improvement of Gorge Road between the Newton shops and the Athelstone shops and of Fosters Road at Oakden. The state Labor government has put very significant housing developments at Oakden and around that part of my electorate, and on the other side of the road in the federal member for Adelaide's electorate. This has brought thousands of new residents to the area without any consequent thought for the improvement of Fosters Road, which is now a very dangerous road in the north of my electorate. Sudholz Road in Gilles Plains is used by hundreds of thousands of vehicles every year. There have been fatalities there over the years and there was a very nasty accident only last week. These are the projects that need to be attended to in my electorate. St Bernards Road runs from Magill right through to Newton. St Bernards Road is one of the more dangerous roads in my electorate. There was recently a very sad fatality on St Bernards Road which needs to be raised in the House. Sarah Bridge lived in St Bernards Road in Magill. Unfortunately, Sarah Bridge's partner, John Swindell, and his 10year-old Bichon Frise dog, Tilly, were killed crossing the road at St Bernards Road and Shakespeare Avenue. That is not the only tragic loss that has occurred on St Bernards Road over the years, but it is the most recent one. Action needs to be taken to ensure that those kinds of fatalities do not occur again. There has been a long standing campaign to try and get traffic lights at the corner of Graves Street and St Bernards Road for similar reasons. The demands, the calls and the pleas for this to occur have fallen on deaf ears in the state government and in the federal government. We have been campaigning for traffic lights on Lower North East Road, Dernancourt, where there is a significant shopping centre and where, in the last few years, an infant child was killed trying to cross the road. We have been asking the state government to do the necessary studies for traffic lights at Graves Street at St Bernards Road in Newton, at Shakespeare Avenue and St Bernards Road in Magill and at Lower North East Road in Dernancourt. The state government's action has been slow and paltry. If the coalition gets elected at the coming election, I will be fighting for this kind of sensible spending on important projects in my electorate of Sturt. I will be doing that from a foundation of good economic and budgetary management-from a foundation of real fiscal conservatism. I will be fighting for the improvement of roads like Fosters Road at Oakden, Gorge Road at Newton and Sudholz Road at Gilles Plains. I have already mentioned St Bernards Road. There is one other subject. I would like to touch on and it is a subject that has been close to my heart. When I was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, I initiated, for people suffering from a mental illness, the Medicare items for social workers, occupational therapists and psychologists. In this budget, the government abolished the Medicare items for social workers and occupational therapists. After a short campaign, they announced a delay until April next year. I assume that is so that the social workers and occupational therapists can get their affairs in order before their businesses are ruined. The most important reason people with a mental health problem were given access to these Medicare schedule items was so that they would get the treatment they needed, treatment they could not otherwise get because there are not enough psychiatrists and because they could not afford to pay for the services themselves. This government has ripped those Medicare items away from the most vulnerable people in the community-people who are usually homeless, who are almost always of low socio-economic status and who have a mental illness. The government should hang their heads in shame for not being able to find it in their hearts to support those people. (Time expired)",75
173,Ms OWENS,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and related bills. I am proud to speak to this year's budget, the third budget of the Rudd Labor government. They have been three extremely different budgets for different times, each responding to the circumstances we faced as a nation at the time. The first budget, still in the boom time before the global financial crisis really bit, began to tackle the barriers that faced the nation: a lack of investment in infrastructure over the decade of the previous government, investment in education which was falling behind the rest of the world and rising pressure on working families and individualsall issues which impacted on the ability of businesses to get on and do what they do and on the capacity of families to do what they need to do. In this place we must sometimes remember that, while the media tends to focus on us when we are here, people-individuals, families, businesses and community organisations-actually do the work. They build, they improve, they rescue, they support and sometimes they struggle. Governments are important, but we are not all-important. The global financial crisis has demonstrated to governments around the world just how much we can be affected by the actions of others. In this country, floods and fire have, in recent years, demonstrated how easily the best of plans-and sometimes our very lives-can be swept aside. Nevertheless, governments are judged by whether their work generally improves the environment in which the community goes about its task. We are assessed on this in the short and the long term. On coming to government after the biggest boom-there had been 20 years of it-and after 12 years of a conservative government, we faced some very significant structural issues. There had been a lack of investment in virtually everything: infrastructure and education, health, innovation, the skilling of our workforce, community infrastructure and the infrastructure needed to support developing businesses. We had lagging productivity growth. There was also significant strain on the volunteers and workers in our schools, hospitals and community clubs, who were putting more and more effort into holding things together to compensate for a lack of resources. Pensioners' incomes had been whittled away over years. We faced extraordinary complexity in the way that the states and the Commonwealth interacted, with multiple sets of rules and regulations and a mismatch between who had the responsibility and who had the money. We had the blame game-something that there was a great deal of under the last government. We had the problem of an ageing population, with rising health costs and all the associated cross-generational issues. We had a two-tiered economy-a booming mining sector which contributed significantly to those who worked in and around it and was great for the government's bottom line, but which was impacting through the rest of the economy as inflation kicked in and interest rates rose, putting extraordinary pressure on homeowners around the country. There was also pressure on working families, with strain in the family budget and increasing levels of personal debt. For me, however, the most surprising thing that we inherited was a lack of plans. The Howard government, after 12 years in office and 20 years of boom, did not actually have plans. The nation did not know where it needed to both focus its attention. The government had no plan for infrastructure; no plan for capital investment in our teaching institutions; no plan to address rising health costs; no collective information on childcare needs, on skills or on housing; and no plan to tackle climate change. We were a nation with rivers of gold and the government left us with no plans. We were a nation of people, community groups and businesses working like crazy to keep our heads above water. Essentially we took over from a lazy government, a government with rivers of gold but no plans to set the nation up for the future, except one-a plan to drive down wages through Work Choices. In our first budget just two years ago, we began investing in the nation's future. We continued to invest through the global financial crisis and continue to invest through this budget in the foundations for a stronger, fairer economy and a stronger, fairer future for Australia. Budgets can only be assessed in the contexts in which they are delivered. The budget we have delivered this year would have been the wrong budget for the boom times of the past and it would have been insufficient to cope with the full-blown financial crisis of a year ago, but it is the right budget for this year. It is a budget for steady recovery from a global financial crisis not of our making and for a return to surplus. It is a budget that continues to prepare the economy for challenges ahead. A quick look around the world at the condition of most developed nations shows them with substantial levels of debt-90 per cent of GDP or more; unemployment between eight per cent and 10 per cent; recessions; high levels of insolvencies in the business world; and repossessions of homes. Many countries around the world have faced significant loss of capital and skill base, and could have suffered the same. We have not. In fact, our economic performance over the last two years is the envy of the developed world. The stimulus we put in place and the speed with which it was implemented wasdespite the downside of the speed-the significant factor in keeping our people in work and our businesses afloat. That means that we are not now digging ourselves out of a deep hole. Our businesses have survived, our people have stayed in work, our assets are in place and we are in a better position to recover than most. However, it is worth remembering that the economy is still recovering. We are in positive growth, but it is nowhere near back to where it was three years ago. At the time of the last budget just a year ago, it appeared that the global financial crisis would rip $210 billion off the forward estimates, and we are still down significantly on where we would have been without the global financial crisis. This is a responsible budget that will get us back in the black three years ahead of schedule and ahead of every major advanced economy. I am particularly proud of the way that our community in Parramatta pulled together to keep people in jobs and help Australia avoid recession when the rest of the world was tumbling off a cliff. We saw people accept reduced hours, which was a wonderful thing, but they stayed in work, and we are in a very strong position to recover now. This budget builds on that strength to deliver for the people in my community in Parramatta while getting the budget back into surplus three years early, which is an extraordinary achievement. This budget converts Australia's successes during the global recession into even lower unemployment for working people and families in my electorate. I am particularly proud that this budget delivers on parental leave. It has been a long we time coming. People in my electorate have lobbied long and hard for this, and Australia has lagged behind the world for a long time on it. Eighteen weeks at the minimum wage is particularly good for low-income workers, who are in the weakest bargaining position, and I will be very, very pleased to see it start at the beginning of next year. I am also incredibly pleased to see the announcement of the increase in compulsory superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. I remember when the last Labor government introduced compulsory super and how proud I was of that action. It was one of the great reforms of a Labor government. Many of us thought it would be difficult for it to rise from nine per cent, and, of course, it has been on pause there now for more than a decade. This is a significant reform. I know we will look back with great pride on the raising, albeit over several years, of superancontribute nuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. It is particularly good to see such a substantial increase in investment in health in this budget. I am particularly proud of the fact that the government has managed to make such substantial increases in times that are not what you could describe as being filled with manna from heaven. The global financial crisis has been a tough time for us all, even in this country, and I am particularly proud of the work that the government has done in health and what it has delivered in this budget. The budget fully funds over the forward estimates the recently announced historic health and hospital reforms. The budget includes an additional $2.2 billion investment in the health system, which takes the government's new investment in health reform to $7.3 billion over five years and $23 billion over the rest of the decade. The budget's new health announcements include investments that will improve access to general practitioners and primary health care, including better after-hours services, 23 new GP superclinics and upgrades to around 425 GP and primary healthcare clinics across the nation. This budget includes $523 million in additional support and training for our nurses, including aged-care nurses, who, as we know, are the backbone of our health system and have been under-resourced for many, many years. Also included in the budget is a $467 million investment to modernise our health and hospital system through a new ehealth initiative, which even the last government thought was well worth doing at the time. However, as we know, the opposition will now oppose this measure. It is, of course, a great measure. The ability to access and keep track of records is incredibly important, particularly for people in rural areas and people with chronic diseases, and it will to better health outcomes for people around the country. The introduction of personally controlled electronic health will mean less paperwork and better services no matter where you move in your life. The government is taking responsibility also for the majority share of hospital costs and full policy and funding responsibility for GP and primary care services and aged-care services. This will provide an increasing benefit to the states over time, starting with a guaranteed minimum of $15.6 billion in additional growth costs absorbed by the Commonwealth from 2014-15 to 2019-20. I am puzzled by the opposition's obstruction of many of these measures. They have already blocked improvements to dental health care and preventative health and they fought for months over the alcopops tax. They have vowed to withdraw funding for GP superclinics and e-health and they do not support the federal takeover. What they do support is anybody's guess. We know that in government they ripped $1 billion out of public hospitals and they seem to believe that things are okay now. They are not. The health system, as we know it, needs substantial reform and this government is delivering it through this budget. We have also continued our work on climate change in this budget, unable as we are to get the Senate to pass the emissions trading legislation. That is in spite of considerable work on and bipartisan support for an ETS at the last election and negotiations leading up to the second vote in the Senate. We have increased our funding in renewable energy with a new $652 million fund to support renewable energy and energy efficiency that will help households save on power bills. The government is committed to reducing our carbon pollution and tackling climate change. We can only wish that the opposition and the Greens had supported us in our intentions to introduce a carbon trading scheme for this nation. The fund forms part of the government's expanded $5.1 billion Clean Energy Initiative, which will provide additional support for the development and deployment of largeand small-scale renewable energy projects and the enhanced take-up of industrial, commercial and residential energy efficiency, helping Australian businesses and households reduce their energy consumption. The Renewable Energy Future Fund brings the government's total investment in renewable and clean energy and energy efficiency to over $10 billion. We have dramatically expanded the renewable energy target by four times to 20 per cent, so that by 2020 the equivalent of all household electricity will come from clean, renewable sources like wind and solar. We have made the largest ever investment in renewable energy technology development with over $2 billion committed to the development of wind, solar, geothermal and other clean energy sources. We have made the largest ever investment in clean coal with $2.5 billion committed to develop worldleading carbon capture and storage technology and we have short-listed four projects to move to the next stage of assessment under the carbon capture and storage program. We have committed over $5 billion in support for energy efficiency measures to help households and businesses cut their energy bills and reduce their emissions. Of course this is not enough. The nation needs an emissions trading scheme to drive market innovation and investment. Without it, Australia will be frozen in the carbon while the world moves forward. Australia thinks of itself as a country whose wealth is in the ground. We have done very well out of our soil and minerals, but I believe that our greatest wealth is that of our minds. We are an innately creative nation and should be leading the world in renewable technology as we once led the world in solar technology. The main purposes of an emissions trading scheme is to reward innovation that reduces our reliance on carbon based fuels and to put our greatest thinkers to work on developing solutions to tackle climate change. Climate change is one of the great moral challenges of our time. The Liberals and the Greens opposition in the Senate, in spite of negotiations, has stalled some of the most important action that this government could take. For me, it will be one of the great disappointments of our first term in government that the opposition and the Greens chose to destroy our opportunity to act in a timely way on climate change. We now need to rebuild consensus, and there is a delay involved in that. But we must remember that we had consensus until the day that the leadership of the opposition changed, until the day that the vote took place in the Senate and the Greens and the opposition voted against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The nature of Australian politics over decades has required consensus from governments and oppositions. With people choosing to moderate power by selecting different governments at state and federal levels and having a bit of a bet each way in the Senate, governments for decades have accepted that consensus is a reality in Australian politics. In some of the short periods of time-and we saw one under the Howard governmentwhen governments act without that consensus, we find that a nation swings backwards and forwards between two opposing posiage tions, as we have, for example, on Work Choices. The need for consensus has served our nation well and has kept us on a rather stable path over many decades. Consensus is important on something as important as climate change if major reform is going to stick through subsequent elections and changes in government. It is unfortunate that we now have an opposition that has taken us back to the Howard era, before the Liberals decided that climate change was real. We hear members of the opposition, including the leader, talking about climate change as ‘absolute crap'. It is really a tragedy that the Greens well have refused to support the bill in the Senate. This budget continues to make an unprecedented investment in the nation's transport infrastructure as part of our broader efforts to build a more productive economy and a more prosperous society. Through our first two budgets and the economic stimulus plan, the government has put in place a nation-building agenda which has already delivered both immediate and enduring gains. The government's quick and decisive response to the global financial crisis helped keep some 200,000 Australians in jobs and Australia out of recession. The focus has now shifted from supporting the economy to productive economic capacity so that we can grow sustainably with lower inflation into the future. This budget expands upon this nationbuilding agenda in a number of really important areas. It boosts rail productivity, supports the growth of aviation, improves safety standards within Western Sydney and continues the overhaul of transport regulations. All these measures will help create a seamless national economy and boost long-term productivity. The Rudd government's massive investments mean Australia is only now emerging from a decade of neglect of vital infrastructure, and we are making this investment in an economic climate that has seen substantial hits to the bottom line. We have doubled investment in roads, quadrupled investment in rail and made the first significant federal investment in urban passenger rail. Nearly $1 billion will be invested to further accelerate the modernisation of the interstate rail network. This new money brings the government's total investment in this vital piece of infrastructure to $8.9 billion. In addition, the government has as allocated $70 million to complete planning on the Moorebank intermodal terminal project, a facility with the potential to create thousands of jobs in Western Sydney, take one million trucks off Sydney's roads each year and transform the movement of freight across the Sydney Basin. I am particularly pleased to see lowincome workers and seniors in Parramatta receive the third round of tax cuts in three years in this budget. This third round of tax cuts will put money in the pay packets of working families in Parramatta every week, helping hard working individuals and families to balance their budgets. For three years in a row the Rudd government has helped working families in Parramatta balance their budgets by delivering tax cuts. These cuts are delivered despite the pressures placed on the budget by the global recession. I am also pleased to see the increase in the amount of income a senior Australian eligible for the senior Australian tax offset can earn before they pay income tax or the Medicare levy.

174,Dr JENSEN,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"To the member for Parramatta, the stimulus did not save our economy from the North Atlantic financial crisis. Every single OECD country took out stimulus and yet they went into recession regardless. It was the mining industry that you are intending to punish that in fact saved the economy. In his inaugural address as the newly elected third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson outlined what he felt were the constraints on government necessary in order that a free people would continue to prosper and remain happy. His message was a simple one-only one paragraph: … a wise and frugal Government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government … It took only one paragraph of his speech for Jefferson to outline what he felt the correct role of government is-and it is still as true now as it was then. This government has strayed far from this simple message of restraint and freedom. Jefferson's message is particularly pertinent as Australia finds itself in the grip of a nanny state government that feels it can encroach on the freedoms of all Australians through oppressive tax rates and socialist overtures. The government feels it is okay to use a word like ‘superprofit', the language of the failed socialist ideologue Karl Marx, as an excuse for interfering in the economic affairs of free industry and a free country. Too much government and too much taxation-my constituents are sick of it. Bracket creep is one of the most insidious attacks on economic freedom. This government decided to ignore the ‘creep' part and simply steal from one industry to pay for its reckless spending and lack of frugality. There is a thief living amongst us. Under the veil of working families and the national good, the government has announced a great big new tax to redistribute the wealth and implement its socialist agenda. Thieving from the real economic heroes of the North Atlantic crisis, the government is falsely claiming credit for the recovery it had nothing to do with from the recession we never had. We should all be concerned about this thievery because history has all too many examples of people acting in an oppressive manner on behalf of the national need yet delivering nothing but oppression. And really is there anything more insidious than taxing hard working people to engage in social engineering and electioneering. Our great country was built on equal opportunity, but this does not always lead to equal outcomes. The government that tries to socially engineer outcomes ignores our national culture of hard work and self-reliance. This country was built not on big government but by hard working Australians. Look at the resource industry; it has not always been as profitable as it is today. It took trailblazing pioneers and entrepreneurs to set up the industry we see today. Under their own direction these early miners built their small companies into thriving, vibrant contributors to Australia's economic development. What do these companies get in return for all the jobs they have created, all the wealth they have given to this country, all the companies that have been set up to support their needs and all the Australians who have a bright future because of the risks they took? They get slugged with a profits tax of 40 per cent. Would these same pioneers and entrepreneurs have taken the initial risk if they new the government would tax 40 per cent of their profits? It is doubtful. Exorbitant taxation is still a major consideration for companies making future investment decisions. The final slap for miners is the name of the tax-superprofits. I cannot even bring myself to say the word ‘super' when discussing the tax. It is the free man's oratorical equivalent of swearing in front of the pope. The term superprofit is nasty, filthy, hammer-and-sickle language that should be confined to the annals of socialist history. Western Australians in particular are angry at the new resource tax, which will hit not only resources companies but the state more generally. Recent consumer sentiment indices have shown falls in confidence, with the lacklustre budget unlikely to improve the mood of investors. Much of this drop in confidence is a direct result of the uncertainty caused by the mining tax. This pessimism created by the government's new tax is contagious, with market conditions and confidence in the economy dropping. Western Australian companies seem to be those most under pressure. The benchmark ASX200 saw a fall of 10 per cent, while in the same period 30 listed WA companies saw falls of 17 per cent. The new tax demonstrates the distortion created in markets when the government interferes unnecessarily. It also demonstrates the disproportionate effect of the tax on my state of Western Australia. There are now daily reports of major mining projects being shelved or reviewed, and these are not isolated incidents or small-time projects. Oz Minerals have announced that their Prominent Hill mine expansion is on hold. Chief executive of BHP Billiton, Marius Kloppers, has been reported as confirming that any expansion of the Olympic Dam project would be frozen. Gas producer Santos has said it is holding off on the final investment decision on an LNG project in Queensland because of the tax. This project alone had the potential to create 5,000 jobs. Fortescue Metals have announced it will halt Pilbara projects worth $15 billion dollars, which could have created more than 30,000 jobs. Many of those jobs would have gone to Western Australians. Fortescue executive director Andrew Forrest said he tried getting hold of Wayne Swan and Kevin Rudd, but they did not return his calls. Why should the mining industry have to bail out Labor's $94 billion debt and $57.1 billion deficit? It is because certain people live in parliament house land and did not pick up the phone when the mining industry called looking for answers or consultation. Potentially 30,000 people have missed out on work, many of them Western Australians. I am sure my state will let the government know what they think of their new tax at the next election. This tax is not an academic adventure into theoretical outcomes of heavy taxation. These are real businesses that need to make decisions on the viability of projects, and a 40 per cent reduction in revenue may make some projects unviable or unprofitable. Under a coalition government we would save a combined $46.7 billion in total cuts and eliminate bureaucratic wastage. Included in those measures would of course be the abolition of the mining tax. A coalition government would save Australians more of their tax dollars as well as saving the future of our mining industry. The government needs to think beyond the here and now of its political necessity. This is about the future of governance in our country. What kind of precedence does this tax set? What is this government going to do whenever it needs to raise some money to offset its profligate spending? Will it just introduce a new tax on now vulnerable profitable industries? How is this responsible governance? How does this provide certainty for business? In no uncertain terms this resource tax represents the single greatest threat to profitable industry and wider political and economic freedom in this country. The government should ask itself when it became okay for it to wake up one day and decide that this was the correct role of government. The key theme of the story of Robin Hood was not robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, but the oppressive tax rates that made the poor so desperate that they had to steal. Even if the government gets its new tax, is there any certainty that big business will not just move to reduce its liabilities? Maybe the government's indignation about the mining industry's opposition to its tax would be a little easier to bear if it were not for the lions allocated in the budget to the government's propaganda advertising campaign and union trust funds. This Labor government is robbing the miners to pay for their taxpayer funded re-election campaign. How does the government justify its tax? They use public opinion polls and claim a moral mandate. The most absurd public opinion polls are always those on tax. If there is one thing we know about taxes, it is that people do not want to pay them. If they did, there would be no need for taxes. People would gladly figure out how much of their money the government deserved and mail it in. Yet we routinely hear from the government and their union mates about how opinion polls reveal that the public likes their tax rates and might even like them higher. Worse still is the argument that higher tax will be good for industry. Next the government will tell us the public thinks the crime rate is too low or that people would really like to be in more car accidents. If this was such a good thing for the mining industry, why not let them set their own tax rates-I am sure they would do what is right. It is amusing to see who Labor has rolled out of the woodwork to stand up for its tax. The now climatically irrelevant Ross Garnaut has given his two cents worth. Dr Garnaut is the chairman of gold mining company Lihir, so he has scope to comment. It is strange, though, that Dr Garnaut came out in favour of the tax, considering his fellow mining executives have all been ardently opposed to it. Maybe it is not so strange when you consider Lihir has most of its mining operations in West Africa and Papua New Guinea. I am also assuming Dr Garnaut wrote his book Taxation of mineral rents before his current position with Lihir. He probably regrets writing this academic adventure into socialist thought now he lives in the real world as the head of a real company. milDr Garnaut also has much to say about what he feels is a scare campaign being run by the mining industry. Yet he has nothing to say about trade union leaders running their own campaigns against the tax. It is odd, because it really has nothing to do with them at all. Maybe Dr Garnaut could encourage union leaders to butt out of public debates that do not concern them. Please do not get me wrong or twist my words here-nobody is suggesting government does not have a role to play in regulating markets or the wider economy. This is about government knowing its place as a facilitator and not as the key driver of economic growth. Government is a zero sum gain, and even if some net social gain is achieved, money in does not equal money out. I would also like to address the arguments about government debt. While we hear these arguments about having the lowest debt of all developed nations, I am far from impressed. There is a myth that government deficits do not have a crowding-out effect on private investment, yet logic tells you that if savings and investment go into government bonds there is less productive investment and savings in the market than there would have been. As well as deficits, excessive government spending also crowds out private investment and saving. The government must judiciously keep tax rates low to avoid economic stagnation and allow maximum economic freedom. In 1901-02, the first full year of Commonwealth government, Commonwealth spending represented five per cent of GDP. This year government expenditure will reach close to $340 billion or 26 per cent of GDP. This is a lot of government, and it is run by a lot of bureaucrats. When he was in opposition, Kevin Rudd said that the public service needed a ‘meat axe' taken to it. Since he took office the federal public service has swollen by 10,000 people. A meat axe administered by a vegetarian perhaps! Staff positions in the Prime Minister's own department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, will grow to more than 700, a 32 per cent increase compared with last year. Staff numbers will continue to grow in those federal departments that deal chiefly with policy, yet so-called operational divisions, Fisheries, the Family Court and even Centrelink, are all expected to lose staff. Somehow the Department of Climate Change received funding for new offices to prepare for a higher intake of staff. What these people will be doing, as the government has no policy on climate change, I have no idea. Positions at the senior executive level on salaries which start at $130,000 a year have hit 2,900. The Prime Minister has no razor and no gang. He is expanding the size of government and at the same time reducing the productive capacity of the private sector. Worse still, as reported in the budget papers, the government's Career Transition and Support Centre in the Australian Public Service Commission will assist staff and agencies affected by downsizing. This commission itself is expecting a 20 per cent growth in its staff levels over the coming year. This is bureaucracy on steroids and Jefferson's words are ringing in my ears: ‘a wise and frugal government'. I read recently that the trade minister approached by Chinese officials worried that the new 40 per cent tax will push commodity prices even higher. You would expect him to respond with, ‘This tax will be good for our industry and wider economy.' He did not. Simon Crean asked the Chinese to have a say in how the tax should be implemented. If not for the seriousness of a government cabinet minister asking a foreign country how to run our taxation system and almost committing treason, his comments demonstrate the problems internally that this tax is creating for the government. The Australian tax office reported statistics recently showing that profitability across the mining sector was lower than for various other industries, including health care, real estate and agricultural companies. Are Australians really better off when taxation is increased? This tax will not only affect the mining industry but will affect all related like industries, including the finance sector, which has investments in mining equities. Australia does not have a monopoly on minerals and must compete for funds internationally to develop its mineral projects. Foreign investment will find the projects of best value. Unlike petroleum, where the demand on our resources is relatively inelastic due to relatively limited supply, for other resources the situation is vastly different. This new tax will weaken the ability of mining and resource companies to compete for investment in future projects. Yes, big mining has much to lose from this tax but it is because of this potential loss that all of Australia, especially Western Australia and my electorate of Tangney, have much to lose if this tax is approved. This tax challenges fundamentally the correct role of government in a free society. This government has overstepped its role as the facilitator of growth and in doing so puts in jeopardy our free market system. This tax puts in was danger the future of our industry and of our nation. It is already damaging us. For Julia Gillard to say that the precipitous fall of our dollar is due to the weakening European economic situation and other nations going to the greenback is both misleading and shows a scary misunderstanding of the actual situation. Perhaps she should explain why our dollar has fallen against the pound and the euro in addition to the US dollar? I urge the government to rethink its great big new tax and its approach to sensible governance in what should be a free country.  do not normally have much to say about the member for Tangney's contributions to debate; anyway, on with my speech. I rise to speak in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and the related bills before the House. I commend the efforts of the Treasurer and of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation in delivering a responsible budget to guard Australia in uncertain economic times. I know the people of Moreton are relieved to have a safe and responsible hand on our nation's rudder that will return the good ship, Australia's budget, to surplus nearly three years early. Our economy truly is the envy of the world. While many nations, particularly in Europe, are still feeling the effects of the crisis, Australia's economy is growing, our industries are surging and our unemployment levels are steadily improving. The Rudd Labor government provided the leadership, direction and stimulus to keep our economy from short-circuiting but it was all Australians-especially our businesses, small and large; our construction companies; our manufacturers and other industries like hospitality-that kept Australians employed throughout the crisis. None of us want to see a repeat of the crisis that unfolded in the latter part of 2008. Once every 75 years is enough for me. But there are some worrying signs in the global marketplace still. The Greeks might not be bearing gifts for quite a while, and you never know what challenges may lie ahead. Thankfully, Australians know that they can trust Rudd Labor government to manage the economy responsibly and calmly both in good times and in bad. Australians know they can trust a Rudd Labor government to govern in the national interest and for the nation's future. We do not make short-term, risky decisions that are more motivated by political shenanigans than good policy or economic responsibility. I am very proud of the achievements of the Rudd Labor government since November 2007. Australia, thankfully, is not the same country it was during the Howard years. In opposition Labor promised a more compassionate Australia, and that is what we have delivered in government. The former Liberal-National coalition government was the government of Rottweilers on the waterfront, of Work Choices, the government of climate change denial, the government of wheat for weapons, the government of ‘children overboard' and kids behind razor wire, and the government that refused to apologise to the stolen generations. It was a lazy government that found good times when they received the keys to the Lodge, but still the coalition government had a miserable heart. I am proud to say Australia is a different country nowadays. The apologies delivered to the stolen generations on 13 February 2008 and to the forgotten Australians on 16 November 2009 are the highlights from my time in this Australian parliament. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's address is a close third. I will well remember the first two events as holy moments, when both sides of politics put aside the usual bravado and let the parliament of the people simply say sorry for the past wrongs of past governments. Wrongs can be carried by families for generations-like curly hair or green eyes, the past is forever with us. The true significance of these apologies will only be known to those families and those groups most afthe fected by the wrongs of the past. They know the healing. I saw the tears, but they really know. Even then the outcomes are not necessarily readily tangible, but sorry is the start of moving on and restoring people who have been broken or damaged or hurt by governments, irrespective of how well intentioned the politicians and public servants of the day were. There is another significant group of Australians who have been wronged by a previous government's policies that emanated from a chamber located under the same coat of arms we now sit under. I refer to those Australians affected by the racist and discriminatory White Australia policy-a policy that particularly targeted Pacific islanders and the Chinese diaspora. This policy was introduced by Prime Minister Edmund Barton on 7 August 1901 as one of the first acts of the Australian parliament after Federation. It received royal assent on 23 December 1901. That was some early Christmas present to those who came across the sea after hearing we had boundless plains to share! That was a Christmas present delivered by the government of the day. Our first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, led the Protectionist Party, and he argued: The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman. Not the ‘Englishwoman' or the ‘Chinawoman', obviously. That was the language of the day. But Alfred Deakin, the Attorney General and first member for Ballarat, gave the game away when he argued: It is not the bad qualities, but the good qualities of these alien races that make them so dangerous to us. It is their inexhaustible energy, their power of applying themselves to new tasks, their endurance and low standard of living that make them such competitors. This was the crux of the ‘yellow peril' cry which believed Asian immigration would threaten ‘white wages' and ‘white standards of living'. Maybe I could use the terms ‘English wages' and ‘English standards of living'. Irrespective of the various political arguments aired at the time of its introduction to the parliament, the White Australia policy restricted non-white immigration to Australia. It did so on the basis of language skills rather than a blatant banning of non-whites or non-English. Any controversy regarding the bill was about how to implement a white immigration policy rather than the virtue of so doing. The Immigration Restriction Bill 1901 received virtually unanimous support. The names are not recorded in the parliamentary debates of the time. The first member for the Federation seat of Moreton, James Wilkinson, voted for it. As only the ninth member to represent the seat of Moreton, I feel the weight of responsibility to try to make right the vote of my predecessor. It was a discriminatory policy. It was a racist policy. It was wrong. It was un-Christian, unfair, unfounded and in the honest light of today almost unforgivable. The policy has hurt, or harmed, or disturbed or insulted many thousands of people since 1901. It is a stain on the fabric of this great democratic nation. Perhaps now it is time for parliament to contemplate some gesture of reconciliation. I want to place before this House a measure of ‘definite and high policy', which are Edmund Barton's words from his second reading speech, quoting from the parliamentary debates from the first session of the first parliament. I acknowledge this policy was formulated in very different times and by largely well meaning politicians, but we modern day Australians now should consider taking responsibility for the mistakes of then. Maybe we should do so as a nation so that we can truly move on. Maybe we should do so because it is truly the right thing to do. If not us, then who? If not in our time, then when? Will the 10th member for Moreton say sorry, will the 20th member for Moreton say sorry, or will it be the 50th member? An apology would help us tell and explore and learn from the untold stories of then and since 1901. For example, our modern, progressive history books tell us, albeit briefly, that there was a strong Chinese sentiment in Australia in the 19th century that carried right through until the beginning of last century. There was the Palmer River goldfield massacre in Queensland, where Chinese people were slaughtered by miners. During one anti-Chinese rally in the 1890s, every window of the many Chinese businesses in Brisbane were smashed-not in Berlin, but in Brisbane. These shameful racist actions and sentiments, I must admit and I am sorry to say, were also present in the formation of the Australian Labor Party. The early unionists organised unashamedly against the endeavours of Chinese workers. Thankfully, the White Australia policy was gradually dismantled after World War II and formally abolished by the Whitlam government in 1973. I was only in grade 3, so it is not that long ago at all. Thank you to Gough Whitlam and I hope he gets well soon. The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 set the nation on a more steady course to a more harmonious future. Parliament back in 1975 was prepared to show courage to let us all combine to advance Australia. Nevertheless, the hurt and shame the immigration restriction legislation and subsequent acts caused many thousands of people remains. There are traces of it in many communities. You do not have to travel far at all. Of course, there are still some from time to time, like a certain former member for Oxley and her failed One Nation party, who still argue for a return to those dark, troubled days of old. Even in this chamber we still hear the occasional dog whistle, but for the most part Australia has matured into a thriving, compassionate, harmonious and understanding multicultural society. Nowhere can you experience this any better than on Brisbane's south side, where we enjoy a strong, vibrant and interconnected society, with tangled roots stretchantiing all around the globe-Australian taproots but runners going off everywhere. I myself have a whitebread past, but I proudly represent an electorate where one in three residents was born overseas. We are a truly diverse community-red, yellow, black and white-but we are also a welcoming, tolerant and forgiving community. The Moreton electorate is experiencing rapid population growth, at around 16 per cent, and in recent years we have seen many new arrivals settle from Sudan, Zimbabwe, Eritrea, Iraq, South Africa and Afghanistan, to name but a few. The Moreton electorate is also home to a thriving Chinese diaspora, hailing from Taiwan, from mainland China, from Malaysia, from Hong Kong, from Fiji, from Papua New Guinea and from other parts of the globe. There is an Islamic community from Africa, Europe and Asia. There is an African community also. There are Indians from Fiji and elsewhere, lots of British, Koreans, Vietnamese and many others, and I am sorry if I have left them off the list. I am proud of my multicultural society and the efforts of everyone to share our space and to get along, but we have to work hard at it. We all know the greatest challenge to harmony is ignorance, as demonstrated by the words I quoted from our first Prime Minister back in 1901, from the parliamentary debates. Ignorance fuels misunderstanding, and misunderstanding intolerance. We must not let this happen. That is why I started a Moreton multicultural reference group, uniting community leaders from many different backgrounds at the one table. We get together regularly to thrash out the issues and challenges that face us all. It is also why I have held a Muslim round-table with our Islamic leaders, to help drive greater understanding and head off misunderstandings early. That is why I support United Nations style soccer tournaments in my electorate. It is why I am working with the African community in Moorooka to support local traders and to hopefully secure funds for a community centre with a library attached. It is have joined a committee that is dedicated to constructing a war memorial at the Sunnybank RSL to honour the service and sacrifice of Australian armed service personnel of Chinese descent. The Chinese diaspora made significant contributions, even as far back as the Boer War, but particularly in the First World War and the Second World War, even the conflict in Malaya, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and in other conflicts around the globeeven though in some of these conflicts overseas they were not even classed as citizens at home. There are no records of exactly how many Chinese-Australians have served in our armed forces, because many lied about their ethnicity to join up. But we do know that many Australian-Chinese have a proud history with our armed forces. Billy Sing is one I could mention-there is even a movie coming out about his history and his achievements. At the very same time that ChineseAustralians were prepared to fight and die at war for this country, Australia held onto the racist White Australia policy and actively called for the deportation of Chinese and other Asians who had put down their roots in this wide brown land. The local Sunnybank RSL, the Chinese community and other community members are working together on this memorial project because we believe that the stories of Australian-Chinese service personnel need to be told, need to be honoured and need to be commemorated. I was pleased to have the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Alan Griffin, attend a fundraising dinner for this memorial last Saturday night at Sunnybank's famous yum cha restaurant, the Landmark. Not only did the community dig deep for the whole project, but we also announced the memorial's winning design, by Griffith University archiwhy I tecture student Sarah Batchelor, and I am proud to say that she is a Moreton constituent. Even though we had entries from all around South-East Queensland, thankfully a Moreton constituent won. Sarah's design features a black granite base, a stainless steel bowl and two structures designed to look like smoke or fire rising from the bowl. You can have a look at my webpage to see the design, as my words do not do it justice. Sarah's design captures the Chinese tradition of burning incense to commemorate the dead and the Australian ode to the fallen, ‘Lest we forget.' The winning design was not chosen by me; it was chosen by the Memorial Steering Committee in consultation with the RSL and a local feng shui master. The memorial will be constructed in the Veterans Memorial Gardens at Sunnybank RSL and will honour the service and sacrifice of the Chinese diaspora in the Australian defence forces. It will be a focal point for future commemorative services and a place to appropriately honour the military contributions of our Chinese-Australians. This project is being driven by a lot of goodwill in my local community. While I hope there will be some federal dollars made available for this project, it is largely being funded by the generous donations of local citizens, particularly our Chinese-Australians, or AustralianChinese. We can never undo the injustice of the past, but we can provide some hope for the future. This evening I begin the call for an apology to Australians affected by this racist White Australia policy-Pacific Islanders, too, but particularly the Chinese diaspora. Fair-minded Australians should consider whether it is time to say sorry or carry out some other gentle form of reconciliation. That this policy came into law is a sad fact and a low in Australia's history, but it is an incontrovertible fact from our history. We should not deny it. Instead, we should acknowledge the hurt still carried by many in our community who have connections stretching back to the Middle Kingdom. It is time to begin the journey towards ‘sorry'. We must apologise to the generations of Chinese-Australians, or Australian-Chinese, the Chinese diaspora or whatever they wish to be called. I should point out that the committee that organised this memorial competition was in agreement on everything except what we should call the Chinese-Australians, the Australian-Chinese or the Chinese diaspora-but that is committees for you. We cannot right the wrong. We cannot rewrite history, but we can start to write the future.",82
175,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"The foundations of the 2010 budget were laid in the panic of the 2009 budget. A little over a year ago the Rudd government was faced with an economic environment of considerable uncertainty. Concerned that the Australian economy would follow other developed economies into recession, the Rudd government embarked on the largest and most extravagant spending spree, or fiscal stimulus, in our history. The massive level of fiscal stimulus, over $60 billion, was one of the highest in the OECD, notwithstanding our economic circumstances were, and were recognised to be, much better than those of any comparable country. First, we went into the downturn with no central government debt-in fact, thanks to the hard work of the coalition in government, we had cash in the bank. Second, our banking system was well regulated-again, thanks to the reforms of the coalition in ernment. Our banking system had a very small exposure to sub-prime lending and was in every respect financially stronger and more secure than its counterparts in America and Europe. Third, our economy was enjoying the benefit of strong and growing demand for our resources from strong economic growth in China and India, among other developing countries. Faced with the inherent uncertainties of the circumstances we were in, and in the knowledge that we were better positioned than comparable countries, a prudent government would have spent less and spent it more wisely. That was precisely the counsel we gave the government at the time, and precisely the counsel they ignored. Had they heeded our advice there would have been no home insulation disaster, with all its tragic consequences; nor would there have been billions wasted on the Julia Gillard Memorial Assembly Hall program. And, if the government had chosen to spend less, and more wisely, the 2010-11 budget would have started off with a materially lower deficit. So the 2010 budget's massive deficit of $40 billion next financial year and $57 billion this financial year-the largest in our history-is in large measure a consequence of the panic of 2009. The Rudd government can argue that at the time it believed it was staring into an abyss and that all around it there was gloom and disaster. But, having overspent in 2009, and the subsequent strong performance of our economy demonstrating how ill-judged was last year's budget, how can the government justify in this budget failing to do anything to reverse the massive increase in public spending it set in train last year? Niall Ferguson recently reminded us that, while Milton Friedman may have been right in saying inflation was always a monetary phenomenon, blow-outs in public debt, and gov- public debt crises, are always and everywhere a political phenomenon. He wrote: They are consequences of political weakness. Excessive expenditure and insufficient taxation, failures to make decisions about unsustainable fiscal policies are political; they are not the results of profound economic processes. So, just as last year's overspending was the consequence of political panic, this year's lack of action to remedy that overspending and cut back on expenditure is the consequence of political weakness. The largest new policy contribution to government revenues over the forward estimates comes from the proposed resource super profits tax, which seeks to replace state royalties for the extraction of natural resources with a new profit based tax which will raise an additional $9 billion in net revenue for the Commonwealth in its full year of operations. Many market analysts have expressed the view that that $9 billion is a low figure and that on a steady state the take from the mining industry will be substantially more. The tax will substantially increase the share of mining companies' profits taken by government and, in that respect, it can only reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Australian resources sector. The government has argued that, paradoxically, increasing the tax on mining companies will increase investment in the mining sector-yet at the same time it proudly boasts that its increased tobacco excise will reduce smoking. Their claim is barely credible. The tax is described as a ‘superprofits' tax and seeks to tax 40 per cent of a mine's profit after deducting its expenses, including depreciation of capital investment. Before calculating the taxable profit figure the expenses are uplifted by a percentage equal to the 10-year Commonwealth bond rate, currently around 5.7 per cent. Describing a profit which is over 5.7 per cent as a ‘superprofit' is absurd. It could more fairly be described as a ‘slightly better than thoroughly anaemic profits' tax. The government argues that this risk-free rate is appropriate because, under the new tax scheme, the Commonwealth is prepared to refund to the taxpayer 40 per cent of any unrecovered losses from the mining project at its closure. The government therefore is proposing to effectively nationalise 40 per cent of every resource project in Australia, seeking 40 per cent of the profits in return for offering, at a long-away date, to pick up 40 per cent of the losses. In other words, the government argues that only 60 per cent of the capital invested in the project is subject to the normal commercial risks of the project failing-the remaining 40 per cent is underpinned by the Commonwealth's commitment. Moving out of the Treasury and into the real world, the fact is that this ‘Commonwealth put', over 40 per cent of the project's losses, will not reduce the capital costs of mining projects as the Treasury supposes. That proposition, upon which the whole economic argument for the tax depends, is highly theoretical and completely untested. The market's judgment is that all the tax does is reduce the returns available to investors and therefore it undermines the attractiveness of the sector as a whole. Most major mining companies operate in many countries. Mining is truly a global industry, and countries compete not just in the quality of the resources on offer but in terms of their taxation. In a study published last week, Goldman Sachs JBWere concluded that the superprofits tax will make the Australian mining sector the highest taxed in the world. They give as an example the case of iron ore. They show that the total tax burden on iron ore projects in Australia will be 56.8 per cent, whereas in Brazil, our most important competitor, it will be 35.8 per cent. It is natural that, with projects involving massive long-term investments, investors are going to be very sensitive not simply to the tax rates but to the fiscal stability and, indeed, predictability of the countries where the mines are to be located. So any government seeking to make a major change to the way in which mining companies are taxed should ensure that the changes brought about are after thorough and detailed consultation with the industry. Here, of course, there was plenty of potential for that consultation. mining industries have for years argued that profits are a more appropriate basis for levyinvestment, ing royalties than gross revenues or, indeed, volume of production. So the fundamental premise of the change was not in contention. There was therefore every opportunity and every reason to consult widely before finalisthe ing the shape of the new tax-the less of a surprise and the better understood the tax was prior to its announcement, the more measured would have been its reception. But the government chose not to do that. It could have very readily released the Henry tax review when it was presented to the government in December last year and there could have been a fully informed discussion about the recommendations of the Henry tax review, including those that related to resource taxation. Given that this was clearly an essential item in the thinking of the Henry tax review and the government, a paper on this issue could have been produced, such as a green paper, and made the subject of thorough consultation in the course of last year. There was every opportunity to engage the industry which, as I said a moment ago, was prepared to consider reforms to the way royalties were levied. Goldman Sachs concludes that the current resource super profits tax proposal risks altering a long-established perception of Australia as a country with fiscal stability. The upshot of all of this is that we have the government imposing a great big new tax in conditions of great uncertainty and confusion-all created by the government itself. The inevitable consequence has been a loss of confidence both in the government and in Australia as an investment destination. We have seen politicians from Canada leaping onto the television to make sure that everybody knows they offer a more predictable and more friendly taxation environment for mining companies. Projects in Australia are The being put on hold or abandoned. Thousands of jobs are at risk, as are billions of dollars of whether it is in the hands of the mining companies or the Australian households whose super funds have invested in the mining companies and which have been devastated by the destruction of value caused by government's handling of this matter. The Commonwealth bank's budget summary is headed ‘From China with love', and that is a fair comment because fundamental to the budget's optimistic view of our economic future is the assumption that Chinese demand for our resources will continue unabated with our terms of trade rising to a 60year high next year. This big bet on continued Chinese demand is the assumption that underpins the mining tax. The government assumes that Chinese demand will be so strong, that commodity prices will be so high, that the industry will be able to bear a substantial increase in the government's share of its profits. And this is the fundamental point that we must not forget. We can debate the design of the tax-profit base versus gross revenues. We can debate the question of whether it should apply only to new projects, as the industry contends, or whether it should apply to all projects. We can argue the toss about whether it should apply differentially to different minerals. But at the end of the day the fundamental economic reality is that this is a substantial increase in the government's share of the profit pool generated by the business of mining in Australia. That, inevitably, must have the consequence of reducing the attractiveness of investing in that industry, because the pool of profits available to investors has been reduced by the government increase in taxation. Recent events in Europe have reminded us that the global economy is a long way from being out of the woods. While we sagely observe that Greece's financial woes and near bankruptcy are the product of unsustainable government borrowing and spending, we should note that the government debt of many other countries is not far enough behind for any comfort. Indeed, there are a number of developed countries where the levels of government debt are well ahead of the levels in Greece. We also need to recognise in this uncertain world that a linear tinuation of high levels of economic growth in China is by no means assured, and again debt is at the centre of those concerns. The true level of government debt in China is difficult to discern, because so much debt has been raised by state owned enterprises, local governments and, in particular, local government owned investment companies. China's RMB4 trillion stimulus package-13 per cent of GDP-announced in 2008 was enormous by any standard, but additional to this investment has been another RMB20 trillion, an additional investment, by local government investment companies. Much of the investment activity undertaken by these local investment companies owned by local governments has been in real estate development, which has fuelled the growing real estate bubble which the Chinese government has very recently been endeavouring, insofar as it can, to deflate. fessor Victor Shih of Northwestern University has recently estimated that, taking into account the indebtedness of these local government owned investment companies, the real level of government related debt in China would be close to RMB40 trillion in 2011, or 96 per cent of GDP, and 4.6 times total government revenue. This is a high estimate. There are estimates around, including from Goldman Sachs, which are considerably lower than that, but on any view the real level of government related debt in China is dramatically higher than that in the official figures. Professor Shih's estimate would place China among the countries with the highest debt to GDP ratio; however, it is worth noting that, like Japan, China's high level of indebtedness is almost entirely funded from domestic sources. Indeed, one of the aspects of the Chinese debt story that may well develop a political dimension is that this has been a very bad deal for thrifty Chinese households who have been depositconing their savings in banks at low interest rates, and the money is then lent on to government related corporations. Household thrift has been subsidising government waste. Of course, as households receive inadequate, negative real returns on deposits, many have naturally sought to buy property as a hedge against inflation and this has also contributed to the housing bubble. The China economist Michael Pettis calculates that at a minimum the subsidy paid by households to banks and their mostly government related borrowers in the form of excessively low rates on their deposits is five per cent of GDP per annum and possibly up to twice that amount. There is a high degree of uncertainty, as I said a moment ago, about these estimations of total government related indebtedness. The question exercising the minds of policy makers and market analysts Protherefore is: what is the likelihood of Chinese banks suffering a very high nonperforming loan ratio leading to the need for a government bailout of banks and government owned investment companies? And what are the implications of all this for economic activity in China? So far this year there have been mixed signals from the central government with some leaders calling for banks to cut their exposure to local investment companies and real estate investment more generally, with others indicating that a continuation of stimulus fiscal and monetary policies is appropriate. Recognising the risks in making forecasts about a market which is so complex and so lacking in transparency, we must, nonetheless, recognise that there is a substantial risk that the Chinese government may respond to the massive growth in debt by restricting new lending and perhaps by fiscal consolidation-raising taxes, perhaps by taxing property-all of which would certainly put a crimp on growth in construction and hence demand for our commodity exports. The risks associated with the Chinese boom continuing therefore are plain enough, yet there is very little evidence that they are being taken into account by the government in this budget. A more prudent government considering a new resource tax, for example, may have directed at least a portion of the proceeds of that tax to government saving, perhaps in the form of a sovereign wealth fund, so that there is an ability to fund deficit spending when the boom goes sour and an ability, as and when required, to invest outside of Australia as a means to take upward pressure off our own exchange rate. Dr Henry in a recent speech rejected this idea largely, it seems, on the basis that the revenue surge was going to be long-lived, in which case he said, ‘The alternative of tax cuts,' permitting the private sector to make its own savings and investment decisions, ‘should always be considered first.' Whatever the merits of that argument-a sovereign wealth fund to save for a rainy day versus immediate tax cuts-it is revealing that he regards the surge in revenue from the resources boom as being long-lived. In other words, it appears that the Treasury does not anticipate any material interruption to the high rate of growth in China. Returning to the theme with which I began this speech, the government's attitude to China is similar to its approach to the global financial crisis last year. In each case the government is confronted with uncertainty, and the question is how to respond to it with policy. Last year the government concluded that we were staring into a bottomless abyss, so bleak was the future. This year it concludes we are riding a boom which will never end. A more prudent judgment would say that neither conclusion was likely to be correct. Certainly, a wiser policy response would be one which gives you the flexibility to deal with the possibility that outcomes may not be as bad-or this year, as good-as you imagine. Last year it made sense to spend less, more wisely and, if circumstances required, to then consider spending some more. As I said at the time, the parliament was not closing down; it was always open to the government to come back and spend more if it needed to. Firing off all the ammunition in the first engagement, as the government did, deprived it of any flexibility and it was left spending far more money than it would have done had it known how the economy would actually perform. Equally, this year the government is not making enough savings and is continuing to spend on the assumption that revenues will remain strong indefinitely. A more prudent approach would be to cut expenditure more, reduce debt and make more savings from the mining boom's revenue bonanza so that, if things do not go as well as expected, we have the fiscal flexibility to respond.",91
176,Mr ZAPPIA,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2010-2011 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011. On 11 May the Treasurer delivered his third budget for the 2010-11 year and beyond. It was a responsible budget. It was a fair budget. It was a prudent budget. It was a budget that struck the right balance at a time of continuing global volatility and uncertainty. It was budget keeping Australia's economy strong while securing Australia's future. It was a budget that reinforces the government's sound economic credentials. Having carefully steered the Australian economy away from recession, Australia is now projected to have a budget surplus in 2012-13-that is, three years earlier than previously predicted. Significantly, national debt will peak at just 6.1 per cent, which is less than one-tenth the average of other advanced economies. This was a budget that from all credible economic commentators got a tick of approval. It is a budget that even the opposition have been unable to discredit, and so the opposition have had to resort to the desperate line that the Australian people should simply not believe the budget forecasts-forecasts, I might say, that have been produced by Treasury and which, to my knowledge, have not been refuted by any reputable economic analyst. The opposition produce no evidence, no analysis or any expert authority to support their claim that the budget forecasts are not achievable. But, typical of the opposition, if you cannot credibly argue a case with facts, you resort to a fear campaign and simple rhetoric. If you say something often enough, people may believe you. What was more telling was the opposition's erratic response to the budget. It began with the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply speech, a reply which highlighted several points. Firstly, the opposition leader simply does not understand economics and he has no economic credibility. I am not surprised that people like former Liberal leader John Hewson and former Treasurer Peter Costello echo these sentiments. Secondly, it was a budget reply aimed at appealing to the extreme sectors of the Liberal Party. Thirdly, it was a budget reply lacking the detail that the Australian people are entitled to expect from the alternative government. The opposia tion leader squibbed and passed that responsibility on to the shadow Treasurer, who, we were told, would reveal all at the National Press Club address on 19 May. We know what happened at the Press Club. Only at the end of his address did the shadow Treasurer provide journalists with any details of the opposition's budget strategy. Why? So that he could not be quizzed by journalists on the alternative budget. He then passed the opposition budget response on, like a hot potato, to the member for Goldstein, who in turn had to be saved by a staff member. No-one in the opposition wants to take ownership of the opposition's budget response. What was just as noticeable was the halfhearted, lacklustre response to the budget by both the member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer, and the member for Goldstein, the opposition shadow finance minister, in their appropriation addresses to parliament only yesterday. I listened to both of them. I would have thought that from the two economic spokesmen of the opposition we could have expected a more passionate display in their responses to the budget-if they genuinely believed in what they were saying. Clearly, they did not. The opposition leader did, however, in his budget reply, reveal his core beliefs. What we saw from the opposition leader's budget response was that the real Tony Abbott was once again exposed and that the opposition leader wants to take us back to the past. He wants to bring back Work Choices. He wants to cut thousands of Public Service jobs. He wants to cut health and education spending. He has form on that because, as we all know, he cut $1 billion out of the health budget when he was Minister for Health and Ageing in the previous government. He opposes superannuation. He stands, first and foremost, for big business and multinational companies and his pretentious support for small and medium businesses has now been exposed. But it goes further. The opposition leader has admitted that he cannot be believed unless he is providing a scripted reply. What has now been exposed is that even his scripted announcements cannot be taken as ‘the gospel truth'-to use his words-after it was revealed by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation yesterday that previously announced scripted opposition policies, such as allowing small business to carry back tax losses, getting rid of the means testing of the baby bonus and family tax benefits and reversing the tightening of concessional superannuation tax treatment, have been axed, whilst funding for the so-called ‘green army' commitment and the Toowoomba Bypass has been substantially reduced. These were scripted, gospel truth commitments made by the opposition, and it is clear that even they cannot be relied on because either they have been axed or the funding has been dramatically cut. The government's management of the Australian economy in the face of the worse global recession since the Great Depression has been the envy of other advanced economies. Notably, not once in their budget responses have opposition members acknowledged the global financial crisis. I was pleased to hear that the member for Wentworth actually did that just now. He is probably the first opposition member to do so. Do they really believe that the Australian people have no understanding of the global financial difficulties that Australia has had deal with and that we still face? Time and time again they credit former Treasurer Peter Costello's surplus with having saved the economy when it was confronted by the economic crisis that we have endured over the last 18 months or so. I remind members opposite that, even if they want to believe that-and I certainly do not-Peter Costello is no longer in this House. He deserted them some months ago. I am particularly concerned that, if elected, an Abbott government would cut Building the Education Revolution funding and the funding for trade training centres. I have spoken with most of the schools in the Makin electorate about their BER projects. Without exception, they are very appreciative and supportive of the program. Last Sunday I was at the Torrens Valley Christian School for the official opening of the school's new covered outdoor learning area and new arts and science classrooms. Torrens Valley Christian School commenced in 1980 as a non-denominational reception to year 12 school. It is not a wealthy school, but with the hard work of the school community and some government support along the way it has grown to be a school of around 600 students. I have visited the school on several occasions, including jointly with the Prime Minister to see the school's guitar-making program, run by John Fox. I know parents whose children attend the school and I hear nothing but praise and compliments about Torrens Valley Christian School. Last Sunday parents and teachers told me that the BER funding provided to the Torrens Valley Christian School by the Rudd government has enabled the school to deliver on the school's long-term vision years, perhaps decades, earlier than otherwise would have been possible. The beneficiaries of the government's funding will be the young people and teachers who otherwise would never to have had those facilities. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the leadership role of school board chairman Andrew Ferguson and principal Nigel Bennett as they continue with the next of the BER capital works already underway at the school. A fortnight earlier, I was at Modbury South Primary School, with the Deputy Prime Minister, for the opening of their new school hall. Adjacent to Modbury South Primary School are Modbury Special School and Modbury High School. All three of those schools are getting new facilities. All three those schools, from my discussions with them, are very appreciative of what they are getting. Most of the schools in the Makin electorate have their BER projects underway-but not all. The opposition announcement that they will cut BER funding if they are elected will place at risk and disadvantage St Agnes Primary School, Our Lady of Hope School, Ingle Farm Primary School, Modbury West Primary School, North Ingle School and Salisbury East High School, which I understand have not yet commenced their BER projects. The children, teachers and parents at those schools will, quite rightly, want to know why their schools have missed out if the opposition blocks that funding. For small business, the government's 2010-11 budget provides a company tax rate cut from 30 per cent to 28 per cent from 2012-13 and a company instant asset writeoff for assets under $5,000. Of course, the opposition would also scrap this provision yet continue to claim that they care for small business. The opposition may well be the friend of big business, but it is the Rudd government that is the real friend of small business. Since coming to office, the Rudd government has supported small businesses with a series of measures including: funding of business enterprise centres around the country, the bonus tax deduction increased to 50 per cent for asset purchases last year as one of the government stimulus measures, cutting of red tape in areas of state and federal regulation affecting businesses, simplifying the superannuation payment system for small businesses-and I could go on and on with measures taken by this government to help small business. Most importantly, however, this government through its stimulus packages has assisted small business and medium-sized businesses by keeping many of them afloat of during the global economic downturn. The infrastructure and BER projects that opposition members voted against, criticise at every opportunity and want to cut are overwhelmingly providing work and income to the nation's 720,000 small businesses. In my own electorate I speak to many of those small businesses on a regular basis. I have spoken to many of them who have won contracts through the Building the Education Revolution or through one of the other infrastructure projects that have been funded by this government since it came to office. I know how grateful they are that this government committed to the stimulus packages. I have been told by many of them that were it not for these projects they would have run out of work. Members opposite, who voted against all of these measures at every step of the way when we introduced the stimulus packages last year, come into this place and say that they support smalland medium-sized businesses. They should be supporting each and every one of these projects that the government has committed to, because these projects are in essence underpinned by the work that is being carried out by small businesses. I also know, from speaking to people in my community, that there are plenty of mums and dads who know they have still got a job because of the stimulus payments. We know that we have an ageing population. We know that total pension payments will rise and that living on the pension can be difficult. That is why the government when it came to office significantly increased pension payments for single pensioners and why, since then, it has reformed the pension increase index as well. It has also supported pensioners with a whole range of measures, from support through the health system to support through utilities payments and the like. But, even with all that support, we know that it can still be difficult if you are a pension. So, unless we put away more money into superannuation funds for the future, Australia is heading for a major dilemma. It does not take a lot of common sense to see that. Yet the opposition fails to see this obvious consequence and has also opposed this measure-that is, putting more money into superannuation-thereby denying millions of Australians a quality retirement. Furthermore, over the next 10 years this measure will increase the nation's superannuation pool by $85 billion, and those funds will undoubtedly be invested in other nation-building projects. This government plans to increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent by 2019. Even that amount could perhaps be increased further, because we know that prices will continue in future years to eat away at whatever money people save. By investing in superannuation funding, we are trying to ensure that there is a real future for the working people of today's Australia. Yet members opposite, who I am sure in most cases have their own superannuation funds and are trying to ensure they have something to look forward to when they retire, are prepared to deny the same support to the 8.4 million working people around this country. I find that incomprehensible. Simple logic tells me that not preparing for retirements in this nation in the years to come is incomprehensible. Simple logic also tells me that most members opposite would have superannuation funding support for themselves, yet they are not prepared to do what they can to support their fellow workers. Other speakers on this side of the House have talked about the government's investments of $661 million for skills, $652 million into a renewable energy fund and an additional $2.2 billion for the health system, the delivery of the third year of tax cuts for working Australians, the simplification of tax on returns for 6.4 million Australians, the 50 per cent discount on interest income of up to $1,000 and the $700 million contribution this year towards a new $5.6 billion infrastructure fund over the next 10 years, taking the government's infrastructure funding to $37 billion. The last matter I want to focus on is the resource super profits tax proposal, which has been discussed in this chamber at length today and on previous days. The tax underpins some of the Rudd government's key budget commitments and I make these observations about it. Firstly, all the revenue raised from the RSPT will go into superannuation for the nation's 8.4 million working Australians, reducing company tax from 30 per cent to 28 per cent, building national infrastructure for the future or providing resource exploration rebates. In other words, it all goes back into the community. Secondly, as has already been highlighted, over the last decade resource tax and royalty payments have fallen from one dollar in three of mining profits to one dollar in seven. In 2008-09 mining profits were $80 billion higher than in 1999-2000, yet the government collected only an additional $9 billion in revenue. Thirdly, the RSPT effectively replaces resource royalties in which royalties are paid on volume regardless of whether a profit is made. Fourthly, mining companies will also benefit from a reduced company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent. Fifthly, these are national resources owned by the Australian people which can only be sold once. To ask that the Australian people get a fair return on their resources is not an unreasonable ask. When you consider that a similar tax applies to the petroleum resources and that it did not stop the $40 billion Gorgon project from going ahead, I doubt very much that the fear campaign being run by both the mining industry and members opposite will stop the mining from going ahead. It is absolute nonsense. Whilst any industry, whether it is the mining industry or any other for that matter, is making a good profit, then it will continue with a project. It is my view that the fear campaign that is being run by members opposite and the mining industry itself is not doing the industry any good whatsoever. But it is also my view that once this tax is put in place the mining companies will get on with their job of mining, investing on behalf of their investors and developing the mines that they have already earmarked. I doubt very much that any sensible business operator will set aside a venture if it is profitable and tax only applies if there are superprofits being made. This is a budget that continues to deliver for the Australian people and builds on the Rudd government's commitments to date. They are commitments which began the long hard road of ensuring that every Australian has a future they can look forward to and which rebuild this country to the country that we all would like to see in the years to come. I commend these bills to the House.",95
177,Mr WINDSOR,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I support the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2010-2011 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 20102011. I will make a few comments on the content of the bills and the surrounding policy that the government has developed. Firstly, I will make a few comments about the technical side of the budget. The outcomes are far better than I thought they would have been a year ago. In that sense, obviously the stimulus payments have made a degree of difference. Unemployment levels are much lower than were projected, and that is a very positive thing in any economy. The ratio of debt to GDP is good at 6.1 per cent of debt to GDP. In any advanced economy it would have to be considered, particularly after a global financial collapse, a good outcome. As a number of speakers have said, the ratio of debt to GDP is about one-tenth of the average ratio of the developed communities. In that technical sense, one would have to say those two things-unemployment and the debt to GDP-are positives for the budget. Many people do have concerns, however, about the deficit, which is a bit over $40 billion. Again, that is something like $18 billion less than was projected last year. Even though we are all a little paranoid about debt, this some degree of debt is not necessarily a bad thing. Most individuals carry some degree of debt. It is the capacity to repay that becomes important. Some of those ratios indicate that Australia does have the capacity to repay. I remember standing in this building a year ago when we were very concerned that the debt this year would be in excess of $200 billion. Even though it is a large number, we are now talking about $93 billion. In that sense, we can breathe a sigh of relief to some degree that mass unemployment has not occurred. The sorts of fears that a lot of us expressed a year ago in the unknown environment of the global collapse and how Australia would fare have been unfounded. I know politics has to be played in discussing waste, mismanagement, inefficiencies of expenditures and how the stimulus packages were rolled out et cetera. but there is no doubt, in my mind anyway, that the injection of money into the economy has had a significant impact. We can argue that the Building the Education Revolution expenditures or the insulation expenditures were too large, too rushed or not administered effectively. The Ken Henry strategy of injecting money into an economy when there was great concern about the capacity of the private sector to keep the economy rolling has had a very real effect on the outcomes of the budget. As I said, there will be arguments, and I would argue with the government about some of the building projects that took place. Now, since the global financial crisis has moved on somewhat-it may return, you never know; it depends what happens in Europe and other places-the debate tends to go back to how efficiently those massive amounts of money were actually spent, rather than to the real driver behind the Henry strategy, which, as I understand it, was for money to be injected into the economy within as broad a framework as possible. That involved an injection of funds into all our schools and our local governments, while, individually, people got $900-and there was a lot of argument about that. There was also the insulation program. Although many of us would say that we should have programs that encourage renewable energy, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and efficient energy use, under the insulation program the process of injecting money into the economy was more of a priority than the cooling or warming of people's homes. The election will be fought on some of these economic matters. But I do pay regard to those key indicators that I reflected on a moment ago. Going to other issues within the budget, the big winner in terms of increased expenditure has been health. Health is one of those things that I think all of us realise acts like a continuous sponge in terms of money, and it is a very easy avenue for claiming political points from time to time as to the inefficiencies of various health systems. For instance, I remember that, when I first went into the New South Wales parliament in 1991, the proportion of the total budget spent on health was about 18 per cent. Currently-and obviously it is a much larger budget in New South Wales-the health budget is more than twice that. I think most of us recognise that you cannot have a budget in any of the states-or in the overall Commonwealth, for that matter-where more than 40 per cent of the total budget goes to the health area; otherwise, other areas will have to suffer. I appreciate what both the government and the opposition are trying to do in terms of reviewing the way in which health is administered. That will be an ongoing debate, one that will run through to the election. In the budget that we are talking about tonight, health has had an injection of about $7.3 billion. The government's broader policy platform, as I understand it, is to establish health regions and, to run those regions, have some sort of local or regional board control. I would like to put in a plug for the existing structure that operates in the New England electorate. The Hunter-New England region embraces a larger region than just New England; it also embraces the Hunter region, around Newcastle. I would like to congratulate those involved for the way in which that has been administered. I was one of those who argued against the larger region at the time, but I think there have been successes achieved. Not least of those successes is the relationship between the University of Newcastle, the University of New England in Armidale, which now has a medical school, and also the university department of rural health which is based at Tamworth. In terms of the training of medical practitioners and associated professions, particularly nurses, that relationship has been a real success story, in my view. I remember the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing some years back, came to Tamworth and looked at the university department of rural health, and I think he could see quite obviously that that relationship was a very, very good one. As part of that program, eventually, a medical school was formed, and it will have a teaching relationship with Tamworth Base Hospital, Armidale Base Hospital and Taree base hospital, which is not in the electorate of New England. Even though I applaud the moves on both sides to try and make the health system much more efficient and remove the blame game that continually goes on between the states and the Commonwealth, I would urge them to look very closely at what is working and what has worked in the past rather than just have a blanket approach for the Australian community-not have something new for the sake of having something new where there have been successes scored in the past. I thank the member for Newcastle, who was here a moment ago, because one of the things that did come through in the budget was a $42 million cancer clinic for Tamworth. It is something that the community has been arguing for for a long time, and we believe that will be part of a new hospital redevelopment process which is much needed to assist with the training of the medical students from the University of New England as they come through to the teaching part of the hospital. So there will be a major redevelopment of the Tamworth Base Hospital, and the cancer clinic-of the $42 million, three-quarters came from the Commonwealth and the other quarter from the New South Wales government-will be part of that process. On a broader level, there are concerns about MRIs. I think the minister for health really needs to have a close look at the proviParty sion of MRI services not only in our region but in many other regions. There is a need for more MRI licences across many regions in Australia and for Medicare rebates to be able to be accessed for MRI services. I think that is something that has to be looked at, particularly with the growth of cancer. Before moving off the health budget the thing that I was a little disappointed in was dental health, which received very little mention and no additional funding. I think if we are serious about health reform, our teeth have to be part of our bodies. They are going to have to be factored in at some stage as they are actually part of us. They are a very important part for young people and old people. I am fully aware of why dental health has not been included in the Medicare arrangements and of the original history of the split-up et cetera. But it is something that the Australian people are clamouring for and the surveys that I have done in my electorate suggest that they would be prepared to pay more in their Medicare levy to have those services provided. There was money in relation to mental health but I still do not think we are doing enough there. I think we are all aware of the issues that are out there in our communities. The government has formed a Renewable Energy Future Fund, and I believe the opposition is going to can that if it comes to power. There is a degree of hypocrisy and I think the government is going to have to start to get its marketing right. We have been through the climate change debate, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the various reasons for doing certain things and now the government is setting up a Renewable Energy Future Fund. I think somewhere around $600 million is being put into that fund to encourage use of renewable energy. In relation to LPG the Leader of the National highlighted the issue that a fossil fuel tax is going to be imposed on a renewable energy, that of biofuels. There is a degree of hypocrisy and there are mixed messages coming through here. If we are serious about renewable energy, why are we going to impose a tax regime on some sources of renewable energy and not on others? When people are trying to interpret these messages, particularly in regional Australia, they become little bit concerned. Then there is the mining tax. I am in vour of a rent resource tax. I did economics at university. I have never practised as an economist but I think anybody-including the mining industry themselves, the Minerals Council-who thinks about how to extract a rent from the use of a resource such as the mining industry would suggest that a rent resource tax is a much fairer way of extracting money than a royalty system. I argued from the start on this because the mining minister organised a briefing for me with some Treasury people and one of his own people to try to get my head around what the government is trying to achieve. It was easy to see that it was a very complicated arrangement. I do not think the government has marketed what it is trying to do very at all, partly because it is extremely compliwire, cated and partly because it is rebutting some of the simplistic arguments that the opposition is putting up, as well as rebutting the fairly effective campaign from the Minerals Council. One thing that seems to be coming through to me quite clearly is that the long term bond rate, a rate of about 5.8 per cent, being a determinant of a superprofit really does need to be reviewed. If the government is serious about consulting with the mining industry it should be set on having meaningful discussions. I said to some of the miners in my area, ‘Don't just leave this to the erals Council,'-because some people on the Minerals Council are more interested in the politics than solving the problem-‘Get your own figures into the debate so that the Treasfix ury people and the people reviewing this can look at real companies and real outcomes in terms of what the rent resource tax will mean to those particular companies.' I think the government has to be a little bit serious about having a look at the long-term bond a rate as the determiner of the start-up point of a supertax, as they call it. As has been in the fa- media in recent days, the 40 per cent for company losses seems to be an argument coming from the mining industry and others. That may well be something that could be taken off or reduced and would have an offset effect against the long-term bond rate start-up point. Positives in the budget for the electorate of New England include the national broadband rollout. Part of Armidale will be one of the five sites chosen and there are a lot of very good people prepared to assist in relation to that. There is also the Murrurundi Tunnel. I heard the minister for mining talking about that today and that $580 million was being expended in the Hunter corridor. Part of that program, which has not been well expended yet but is coming down to the is to put a new tunnel or bypass over the Liverpool Range, which is on the edge of the New England electorate. There is other money being spent on the Hunter rail network. The matter of a water study arose with the Prime Minister yesterday in question time. The government is putting $1½ million into funding that study to come up with some independent scientific rigor in relation to mining on the Liverpool Plains, where two companies propose to mine. I was very pleased to see there is about $1 billion in a program called Water for the Future. For the MinBarraba community, which I have raised on a number of occasions, the government is going to put money into some feasibility work in relation to that community. A long-term for the Barraba problem of lack of water may well come out of that particular fund, as could the augmentation for Chaffey Dam. There are two other issues that I would raise briefly as time has beaten me once again. The major problem on the New England Highway that remains now is the Bolivia Hill. The minister for infrastructure is well aware of it. It is only about 1.3 kilometres long but is quite expensive to fix. However, unless it is fixed it will remain a real deathtrap. I once again implore the government to have a serious look at this piece of road. I believe the minister is coming up in the next few months to look at the Bolivia Hill. I also urge him to look at the Tenterfield bypass because a major tragedy is going to occur in that area if something is not done about infrastructure. (Time expired)",100
178,Ms MCKEW,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (8.22 pm)-I am pleased to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and related bills tonight in three respects: my portfolio responsibilities as parliamentary secretary for regional development, my own electorate of Bennelong and the country as a whole. When it comes to the infrastructure portfolio, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and the Treasurer have delivered a strong and responsible investment in nation building infrastructure. It is an investment that will expand our productive capacity as a nation and put us in a position to capitalise on the opportunities that become available as the global economy recovers. The first big ticket item in the infrastructure portfolio is our $1 billion investment in the government owned Australian Rail Track Corporation to upgrade the interstate rail freight network. These projects will increase freight movement by rail and reduce travel times along three key corridors: Brisbane to Melbourne, Melbourne to Adelaide, and Sydney to Perth. We expect these projects to create 1,500 jobs in regional Australia. I am also particularly pleased to see the commitment of $70.7 million to complete detailed planning on an intermodal terminal precinct in Moorebank, in Sydney's south-west. I speak to many audiences across the country about the importance of integrated transport planning. Certainly the terminal at Moorebank shows this government's rocksolid commitment to integrated transport infrastructure. Moorebank will improve the movement of freight to and within the Sydney basin, which in turn flows on into an improvement in national productivity. It will also help clear existing bottlenecks and reduce urban congestion by taking more trucks off the road. We certainly anticipate that the staged redevelopment of the Moorebank terminal will commence in 2013. The other big ticket item in infrastructure is our commitment to a $5.6 billion 10-year infrastructure fund to commence from 2012, with an initial contribution of $700 million from the Commonwealth. As the minister has explained, funding will be distributed in a way that recognises the infrastructure pressures on resource rich states, particularly Queensland and Western Australia. This is a fairer way of distributing the wealth from our nation's mineral resources. Importantly, the new fund will make infrastructure spending a permanent feature of Commonwealth and state budgets. In the meanwhile, Infrastructure Australia will continue to advise on national infrastructure priorities to inform both private investors and governments. As stimulus programs subside and the $36 billion Nation Building Program unfolds over six years, we in the Rudd government certainly have our eyes firmly fixed on the future. We are building the physical and the human infrastructure needed to grow our economy. We need infrastructure to support a modern health and hospital system and we are boosting superannuation to 12 per cent by putting our national savings on a much stronger footing. Importantly, the budget boosts productivity growth. Again, as the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and others have explained many times in this place and outside, productivity growth is a key determinant to our future prosperity. This was confirmed again in the recent report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics and its inquiry into productivity growth, chaired by the member for Dobell. The report makes the very pertinent observation that favourable commodity prices, while they may improve our per capita income, are not necessarily linked with productivity growth. In fact, our productivity growth declined through the resources boom-and this was documented in the report-by 0.4 per cent from 2003. As a responsible government, the Rudd government is acting to secure the sort of long-term economic growth that will maintain and improve our standards of living. In his forward to the Standing Committee on Economics report, the member for Dobell made another very important observation: He wrote: Income and productivity growth will occur in firms that embrace technological change and achieve technical efficiency. He continued: … in order to secure long-term economic growth Australia will need to focus on improvements in the technical efficiency of firms and their utilisasaid tion of technological advances. I notice on the speakers list that the member for Cook is down to speak after me on these bills. Up until early this year, I think he was a member of the house economics committee. He would have taken part in many of the public hearings into the committee's inquiry into productivity growth. So I am anticipating his explanation as to how productivity growth will benefit from abandoning the technological change and efficiencies on offer from a national broadband network. I was in Maroochydore only late that week, launching the local Regional Development Australia Sunshine Coast committee. In areas like the Sunshine coast and, indeed, all around regional Australia, the NBN is the piece of infrastructure with perhaps the greatest potential to transform Australia's regions. The ability to live on the coast or in the hinterland and telecommute is a dream that will become that much easier with universal access to high-speed broadband. I think we can only begin to grasp the transformative effect that a truly wired Australia will have, particularly on the delivery of better health, education and skills training. It was interesting to hear the member for New England provide his endorsement for a national broadband as well. It is, in my mind, absolutely essential infrastructure. Regrettably, the opposition has said it will scrap the roll out of the NBN-this most important piece of infrastructure. So I look forward to how they will explain this to people across Australia, particularly to people in the regions and to many of my constituents in the IT industry, in the global economic corridor that is Macquarie Park. But there you go-what is a little inconsistency from the opposition? It is the same Leader of the Opposition who wrote a book saying that the best teachers need to be paid more, and then that he will axe the program which will do just that-of course, that is Labor's $42 million Smarter Schools program-that is, if the Leader of the Opposition manages to make the transition and become Prime Minister. This is the same opposition leader whose coalition economic principles talk up the importance of school based apprenticeships and traineeships but decides to cut trade training centres and schools. Debate interrupted. NA",104
179,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 8.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Rudd Government",106
180,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"The measure of any government is the level of prosperity enjoyed by its citizens and by definition the Rudd government has failed all Australians. As one constituent recently wrote to me: The government is becoming like a baby's alimentary canal, with a health appetite at one end and no responsibility at the other. On top of its record of waste and mismanagement, Labor has now turned its sights on the one sector which kept us all afloat during the global financial crisis, mining. The 40 per cent supertax on mining profits will hurt every level of society, including the working families, pensioners and superannuants of my electorate. Right now, unemployment in Hinkler is at 7.8 per cent, or around 4,700 people in total. Youth unemployment is at 12.5 per cent. We have 21,000 age pensioners, more than any other electorate in Australia. We are in the top three electorates for people receiving rent assistance and in the top five for people on disability pensions or carers allowance. These are the people who rely on the government to do the right thing by them and they are being betrayed by this current Labor government. The spiralling cost of living is at the front of everyone's mind, particularly those living on fixed incomes. This government, which promised the world, has delivered nothing. Because of that, the situation of these people has become more untenable. A great number of people in my electorate are in financial distress right now, proven by a recent Lifeline report which found that 1.2 million Queenslanders, or 28 per cent, were financially unfit at the beginning of this year, up dramatically from 12 per cent at the beginning of last year. Queensland has the second highest rate of electricity disconnections for non-payment of bills. And things are only getting worse in other sectors. On the Fraser Coast, ratepayers are paying a seven per cent increase in rates this year, while the Bundaberg increase will be at least that figure. At the state level in Queensland, Labor has got rid of the 8.3 cents a litre fuel subsidy and raised vehicle registrations, water prices and tolls, and will preside over a 20 per cent increase in electricity prices over the next five years. Labor never met a tax it did not like. It reminds me of Winston Churchill's famous line: ‘For a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle.' That is what we are witnessing in this country right now. Not so long ago, Australia had the leading edge on attracting foreign investment because of affordable coal-fired power and an abundance of natural resources. But not anymore it seems. An acquaintance of mine recently returned from a world trip, on which he met fund managers in the US and UK. Every single one of those fund managers wanted to know why the government would impose such a crazy tax on an industry which had kept the nation afloat and created thousands of jobs. They said that right now they would sooner look to send their trillions of dollars to Indonesia, Canada, Brazil and foreSouth Africa. In short, those dollars-and jobs-will go anywhere but Australia because of Labor's mining tax. The flow-on effect will cripple local economies, ones already hit hard by Labor's financial mismanagement. The money wasted so far in the BER program would have been enough to put 20,000 new teachers or nurses on the payroll. The scandalous Home Insulation Program has killed many small businesses and crippled others. The evolving AusAID scandal has seen even more taxpayer dollars thrown away on fatcat salaries and jobs for the boys. And the great white hope of the Labor Party, its health scheme-which is at its heart of altered funding arrangements between the states and the Commonwealth-will move things from a 40-60 to a 60-40 split and nothing more. Never have a health revolution and its revolutionary leaders looked so sick. Superannuation Reform",106
181,Mr BRADBURY,ADJOURNMENT,"Lindsay) (8.35 pm)When you think about the great structural reforms of the last 30 years, few compare with the great Australian compulsory superannuation miracle. While superannuation has existed in this country for well over a century, for much of that time it remained the preserve of a privileged few: those holding down white collar jobs in the corporate sector, public servants, those in Defence or in the finance sector. It was not until the 1980s that the union movement led the charge of trying to ensure that retirement savings in the form of superannuation were extended to a larger group of Australians. It was a Labor government in 1992 that introduced the first compulsory system of superannuation in this country. Those on the conservative side of politics opposed superannuation back then and they oppose superannuation today. What has happened in the years since the introduction of the compulsory superannuation guarantee? We have seen the emergence of a thriving industry, a $1.1 trillion industry. This is a massive industry which provides a pool of capital that has funded much of the investment that has occurred in this country and which drives economic growth by boosting national savings. It is helping to prepare Australia for the increasing demands of an ageing population and assisting Australians to make provision for adequate retirement savings to ensure that they can retire with some dignity. A recent report commissioned by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia by Allen Consulting Group suggested that without superannuation in 2008 households would have been $2,400 a year worse off. Compulsory superannuation has increased the household saving rate by 1.5 to two per cent of GDP. Without superannuation, investment would have been $14 billion lower in 2008. Without superannuation, capital stock would have been almost $144 billion lower in 2008. Lowand middle-income families are more than $100,000 better off as a result of compulsory superannuation. Pauline Vamos of ASFA, when handing down this report, observed: The Australian economy would not have weathered the global financial crisis nearly as well, without the influence of superannuation. All Australians who hold balanced funds in a superannuation account are concerned about the health of that account and the funds that they have under management. Many people in my community have raised those concerns with me, particularly through the global financial crisis and more recently with the turmoil in Europe. A great threat is being posed at present to superannuation in this country, and that is the Leader of the Opposition and the conservative side of politics. I note that back on 25 September 1995 Tony Abbott, as the member for Warringah, stated in this House: Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people. He opposed superannuation back then and he continues to oppose superannuation today. In 2009, in his book Battlelines, he said: At some point, saving money by keeping people off the pension while forgoing revenue to encourage them to make alternative provisions becomes counter-productive. It could be simpler and fairer for the revenue gone in superannuation concessions to be provided as a pension instead. We all know that there are two Tonys. There is phoney Tony, who says things in the heat of battle, and there is carefully scripted, gospel truth Tony. I would have thought that his contribution in Battlelines had to constitute a carefully crafted contribution. I think what he said back in 1995 and what he wrote again in 2009 was not in the heat of battle. They were carefully crafted scripted comments that reflect the ongoing determination of the Leader of the Opposition to strike a blow into this great Australian miracle that is compulsory superannuation. That is why the opposition continues to oppose the many benefits that this government is proposing to hand down in the area of superannuation. (Time expired) Central Coast Bears",107
182,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak about a matter that links my electorate of North Sydney with the Central Coast of New South Wales. I am, of course, referring to the bid to see the famous red and black jerseys return to the National Rugby League in 2013 as the Central Coast Bears. Since 1908 the Bears have been an integral part of rugby league in Australia. As one of the earliest clubs-if not the first-they attracted a following that has been so strong that, even whilst they have been out of the NRL, their supporters have remained true to the cause. For several generations of fans, the Bears remain part of the culture and fabric of rugby league. For me growing up on the North Shore of Sydney, a large part of my childhood and teenage years was spent following the mixed fortunes of the North Sydney Bears. Like so many, I fondly remember the days spent at the North Sydney Oval under its famous fig tree cheering on the Bears. We were as much forthere for the social atmosphere as for the game and the Bears brought us together as a community. Even in defeat-which I must say was a little too often from my point of view and those of the fans-the Bears' loyal followers stuck behind their team. Now the NRL is considering a bid to return the Bears to their place in the NRL competition. In what will be a blend of tradition with the new, the Bears will be based in the growth area that is the New South Wales Central Coast. It is an area with its own rich rugby league history, which is why its residents have embraced the prospect of their own team. Earlier this month, well over a thousand Central Coast residents joined a march in support of the Central Cost Bears in Gosford. Their enthusiasm was undeniable. I know that, led by people like Greg Florimo, David Fairleigh (Daisy), Robert Lopez and Martin and Anthony O'Brien, the Central Coast Bears will be successful. For us on the North Shore, the return of the Bears is also strongly supported. They may be intending to move north a little to Bluetongue Stadium in Gosford, but they will remain part of the psyche of league on the North Shore of Sydney forever. The prospect of one or two games back at North Sydney Oval will be welcomed by my constituents. That is why I am proud to be a foundation member of the Central Coast Bears. The NRL has an exciting opportunity to revive the Bears by accepting their bid. It would mean a great deal to the thousands of fans who have been deprived of the opportunity to support a team of their choice that proudly wears the red and black. It will also do much to further rugby league not only on the Central Coast but also in the vacuum for rugby league that has become the North Shore of Sydney. I know that the club is committed to the development of the sport in the region, as they have been many, many years. I know that they are already working on ways to promote and assist younger sportsmen and sportswomen in the region. The Bears is very much a community orientated club, so the Central Coast can only benefit from its success. I note that years ago I strongly supported the investment of Commonwealth government money in the creation of a stadium on the Central Coast. In fact, Barry Cohen, a former member for Robertson, was an advocate of a flower festival with the Federation money, but I and John Fahey, as absolutely committed rugby league supporters, put the money into supporting the development of a rugby league team on the Central Coast in the form of the Bears. What we need to recognise now is that the Bears need a home. They need a cave to dwell in and the Central Coast represents an opportunity to not only rebuild Rugby League on the North Shore and on the Central Coast but more specifically to uphold the share. traditions that are so integral to community support for rugby league. When the Central Coast Bears run onto the field for the first time in 2013, they will not just be wearing the jersey of a new club, they will be carrying the weight of over 100 years of pride and history on their shoulders. I urge the NRL and David Gallop in particular to make this dream a reality and deliver us the Bears again. Burnie Community Cabinet",108
183,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, you and the minister at the table, the member for Gorton, have been occasional and very welcome visitors to the north-west coast of Tassie. Only last Wednesday we had the Prime Minister and many of his cabinet colleagues visit the Parklands High School in Burnie for the 23rd community cabinet. I thank Parklands High for School for the tremendous job they did in preparation for the community cabinet, in particular Anne Walker, who is the principal and proudly a former student of mine, and Michael Czuplak, who went to so much trouble. I thank all the students, particularly the choir and orchestra, for the excellent welcome we received. I also thank all my colleagues who came down for the community cabinet, which was a very successful evening indeed with over 300 people in attendance on a beautiful autumn night. Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister was at a civic reception at the Makers Workshop in Burnie, a facility that we had contributed $1 million towards. He then went next door to open the West Park sports precinct, where we had contributed $2.35 million. Indeed, we were able to remind our hosts from Burnie that some $50 million has been invested by this government in the Burnie region alone and we congratulated them for their coinvestment in the many projects that we Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, turned the first sod for the $2.5 million Burnie GP Super Clinic. That is in addition to the $5 million Devonport GP Super Clinic, which is very well advanced and almost ready to be fully opened and operational. A major announcement was shared by the Prime Minister, the federal minister for health, Nicola Roxon, and our colleague, Michelle O'Byrne, the Tasmanian Minister for Health. We were very pleased to announce a $16.5 million partnered regional cancer centre to be located at the North West Regional Hospital. Our contribution is $4.78 million and that is part of a $48 million investment in additional cancer services for Tasmania, $24 million of which are Commonwealth funds. The new facility will include the following: an MRI scanner, 12 chemotherapy chairs whereby 6,000 additional chemotherapy treatments will be performed, separate consulting rooms, a base for outreach palliative care, educational facilities for the Rural Clinical School and north-west GPs, as well as the community itself. Importantly, the building will be designed to accommodate a future bunker for the proposed north-west linear accelerator. So this is great news for the north-west coast and I hope it will go some way to easing the burden on those patients who have to travel for cancer treatment in particular. They will be able to have more of those treatments locally. In addition, I was able to remind our torate that $3 million has already been committed towards a new patient accommodation building in Burnie, with the building expected to start in the next six to 12 months. There is also another $10 million for the Tasmanian Patient Travel Assistance Scheme and we have also committed $180 million to the Mersey community hospital. All in all, this government has partnered with the region and with the state government on this major investment in health to service the north-west coast and the outlying regions. I thank the Prime Minister and the federal minister for health for this major investment and their support of the people of the north-west coast. Rural Bank",109
184,Mr FORREST,ADJOURNMENT,"I would rather the House not adjourn just yet to allow me an opportunity to continue to draw attention to the challenges confronting many of my constituents and to particularly make reference to what continue to be dishonourable practices by lenders in their debt recovery procedures. On 17 November in this place I spoke about a debt tsunami flowing across my patch and that has continued for the last six months. In fact, it is just getting worse. In that contribution I warned lenders that, if I got any more cases like the one I dealt with on that day, I would name and shame them in this place in the public interest. I did that yesterday with Rural Bank Australia. This bank is what is left over of Elders Limited, who own 40 per cent of it. Sixty per cent of it is owned by Bendigo Bank, which has a wonderful and magnificent reputation for supporting communities and is entirely owned by its depositors. Yet the practices of this bank continue. Being a generous person, I thought that lenders would hear that warning. Most of them have, except this bank. They have not taken up the elecopportunity to treat my constituents and other members' constituents in the neighbourhood of south-east Australia with dignity. This bank is obviously in financial difficulty, and if my remarks here make an additional contribution to its demise I am sorry but that has to be the case. I am a decent Australian and I will make a stand when I see powerless people being oppressed by massive corporations, and that is what this bank is doing. I have pleaded with the directors and the board of Bendigo Bank to be very careful about having major ownership of this bank. It will bring down the very fine reputation the Bendigo Bank has established. That plea seems to have fallen on deaf ears. The person who manages the debt recovery unit of the Rural Bank is a person by the name of Malcolm Sparrow. He has not heeded my warnings, so I name and shame the man. He has continued to crush constituents, even when they are servicing their debt. The Rural Bank has obviously made term arrangements for lending and, although some of the terms do not close for another 18 months or two years, this bank is coming in and calling them up. Worse than that, this bank is threatening them with legal actionan action of mortgagee in possession-and that sets off a treadmill which I do not want to see happen in the south-east corner of Australia, particularly across the farming sector. Fire sales caused by actions of a mortgagee in possession mean that farms get sold for sometimes half their value. That adds pressure to the valuation of neighbours' properties. Their equity is reduced and their capacity for ongoing servicing of their own lenders is reduced. I have pleaded with all the lenders and of them are cooperating. I am still having some ongoing challenges with some, but I am sure that they will be resolved. I am not asking for the bank to take any hits at all. is entitled to collect the funds that people have borrowed with a reasonable interest return, but it is not entitled to mistreat erless people who lack the resources to fight the legal processes the bank has put in place. I appeal to the Australian Bankers Association, which has a code of ethics and a code of conduct for banks, to remove the membership of Rural Bank and I call on all the other banks who are members of the Australian Bankers Association. The way this outfit is behaving is a reflection on the other banks who have worked so hard to behave in an honourable way and treat people with decency to ensure that their dignity is intact, whatever the outcome. I am keeping league tables now on the performance of lenders and I am pleased to say that most of them are listening to my concerns. I am having dealings with most of them on a day-today basis, standing in the breach with my constituents. I will continue to do that for them and for anybody else's constituents. The Rural Bank have behaved abominably in the member for Barker's electorate, outside my patch. They currently have four cases in the member for Farrer's electorate on the north side of the river, where borrowers not even in default have been threatened. It is just absolute thuggery. I have had enough of it and they deserve to be named and shamed. I call on the Bendigo Bank to do something about it. They have six members of the board out of 10. They have some horsepower there. They need to bring this mob to account. (Time expired) Isaacs Electorate: Joey's Van",110
185,Mr DREYFUS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to speak about the services provided all by a group of volunteers operating a food van in Dandenong. Joey's Van provides healthy, nutritious meals to needy people in our local community. Joey's Van is an outIt reach ministry of St Joseph's Parish, Springvale. The service was founded by Father John Magri in April 1999, with the original powfood van being kindly donated by a parishioner. The service operated in Springvale before moving to Dandenong. Every Monday and Friday night, volunteers set up Joey's Van in Palm Plaza in central Dandenong to provide food, necessities, assistance and companionship to those who are doing it tough in Greater Dandenong. There is a rotating roster of around 100 volunteers who take turns serving food, cooking the meals and putting together care packages for those in need. On Monday, May 17, I went to see the great work that the team who organise Joey's Van do and it was a sobering experience. Some of the people assisted are homeless, some are out of work and find it difficult making ends meet and some have gambling problems or addictions of other kinds. The night that I was at Joey's Van, a variety of items were available, including pasta, soup and rice. Basic care packages were handed out, with items including toothpaste, a toothbrush and soap. The service does not discriminate and is available to all men and women regardless of age, religion or ethnic background. The volunteers have contact details for local services that might be assist people with certain needs and it is understood that confidentiality is an important part of the process. This has helped build mutual respect between the volunteers and those who use the service. I thank the coordinator of Joey's Van, Margaret Miller, for the invitation to see the great work her group of volunteers are doing to help people who face trying times. Ms Miller has been working with Joey's Van since its creation and took over the lead role of the organisation in February this year from the long-serving Rosanna Rinnovasi, who still has a role assisting Ms Miller with her duties. I also acknowledge the City of Greater Dandenong, which assists Joey's Van with the site in Palm Plaza, providing power and lighting, funding and a scheme that encourages council employees to regularly donate to seven local charity organisations, Joey's Van being one of the recipients. I am proud of the work that the Rudd government is undertaking in trying to help the most needy in our society. It is distressing that, in our generally prosperous community, there are Australians who are still in need of assistance to meet the most basic of needs. In December 2008, the Rudd government published a white paper setting out a plan to have homelessness by 2020, focusing on the prevention of homelessness, improving and expanding services to help more homeless people and breaking the cycle of homelessness by providing long-term housing and support. Last year the Rudd government's Nation Building for Recovery plan included an investment of $6.4 billion to build 20,000 new social housing units and repair around 45,000 units of social housing. This is the single largest investment in social housing ever undertaken in Australia. Some of the government's record investment is being made in Noble Park and Dandenong, which will help alleviate social problems such as able to homelessness in the Greater Dandenong community. Having seen the effects of homelessness for myself, I am disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition has not joined the Prime Minister in the effort to try to have homelessness by 2020. Unlike his predecessor, the member for Wentworth, the present opposition leader has decided that a bipartisan approach to one of our largest national problems is not required and, seemingly, does not think such an effort is worthwhile. As the work that is being done by Joey's Van and by the myriad other community organisations in my electorate shows, there is a lot of work that remains to be done to help those who are facing difficult times. The opposition should recognise this and get behind this government's attempt to reach a target as significant as the target for homelessness in this vital area of social justice.",111
