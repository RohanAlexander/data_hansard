NO-CONFIDENCE AMENDMENT Debate resumed from 28th February (vide page 34), on motion by Mr . HURRYThat the following Addrcss-in-Roply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General he agreed to by this House. MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY : We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.",14
44,Mr ANSTEY,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Bourke) [ 2 . 4 9 ] - I am very sorry that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) is not in a fit state of health to resume the debate, and that therefore the 'responsibility falls upon me as Deputy Leader. You, Mr Speaker, know that I shall not be able to conduct the debate with the moderation, distinction, and judgment which would have characterized the speech of the. Leader of the Opposition, but I can only do my best and bear the responsibility for my shortcomings. Yesterday an that the Address-in-Reply to the speech of H is Excellency was moved. You, sir, are aware that I take no part in the formalities of the Chamber. I regard the Address-in-Reply as largely formal, and also, to a large extent, a waste of time. But when we have a Government that ignores Parliament, treats it with contumely and contempt, and furnishes no information, it is only right'we should take advantage of a vehicle like the motion for the adoption of an Addressin-Reply in order to express our opinion PAPERS. of the manner in which the Government conducts itself. Yesterday I walked into this jhamber with the rest of the members and took the oath of f a it h f u l allegiance to His Majesty the K in g . I was not called upon to take an oath of allegiance or fidelity to Australia, to its institutions, or to its people, not even to the 20,000 people at Bourke who gave me t.he opportunity to enjoy the honours and emoluments of this particular establishment. I do not question the course which was adopted, and I only point out the fact in order to add that, after the oath was taken, I was called on, with others, to listen to a Speech fro m His Majesty the K in g. The ter of the Address was a complete blank; the first paragraph, the middle, and the last contained nothing. I venture to say that it would be an insult to H is Majesty to assume that he had himself dictated the Speech. To do so would be to asof sume that His Majesty is a petrified nonentity, with no opinions of his own. This Speech purports to come from the King, but it contains uo inspiration, information as to the direction of the country. Af t e r all, however, I am told that this Speech is only a fiction; that is not from His Majesty, but from legal and Ministerial advisers; and the responsibility for it is on the Governmentwe ment of the day. We are told that our attendance is required for nothing in particuvernment lar, but in accordance with terms of the Constitution-w e are not called together to serve any public purof pose. The first three paragraphs of Address are mere blanks or platitudes. The fourth paragraph saysIn view of the recent assumption of office my advisers, time is required for the preparatries tion of measures to give effect to their You will be invited to re-assemible us early practicable to consider a definite programme legislation. The Speech goes on in a similar strain nothingness, and finally commends our deliberations to the guidance of God. are not culled here to deliberate, but get into recess as quickly as possible. Yesterday, when you,, sir, were api pointed Speaker, you were congratulated upon a variety of subjects, were not congratulated on others, while there were many things that were not mentioned. I may be said, however, that you have the unique distinction of presiding over Parliament controlled by a Government the like of which has never been seen Australia. I ask no questions as to the place or the particular methods of its origin ; I do not ask anything as to the methods by which it proposes to Parliament and the destinies of the continent over which, unfortunately, i this moment presides. This is a peculiar and unique Government, and because of that fact, it requires examination and vestigation. It is a Government "" business "" men, shrewd and astute, dismattinct from any Government that has ever held the destinies of Australia in its hands. There have been other Parliaments, and this is the ninth. The first Parliament of Australia was composed of men drawn from all parts of the Commonwealth, many whom had never met each other; they had never shuffled themselves together in the coils of party, either on the Government benches or in Opposition. The no Departments were then in disorder, with Federation i u its infancy, and yet within five weeks these men were able to present it to Australia a clear and distinct policy. his That was so in the case of the second Parliament, and with every other Parliahave seen, except the presentthis Parliament of "" shrewd men of business."" In 1910 there was another Government called into existence. It was a Goof "" tinkers, tailors, soldiers, the sailors ""- a Government of carpenters, miners, and menders of umbrellas. None these men had been cultured in Oxford the or Cambridge; none of them had been taught to shape their thoughts in the way of a trained mind. None of them was by adepts at that military strategy which at the same time to combine treason policy. and patriotism. Such a conception as as' keeping their lines of communication in of tact while leaving a passage for the enemy did not belong to it ; but that Goof vernment, insignificant as its members were in point of education, could yet deWe velop a policy. They could not even to conceive that particular policy by which they could have a watchdog to ring a bell, cry "" Drop the loot,"" and then take t ; but they could formulate a policy. What was true of the first, the fourth, the eighth, and all the other Governt - ments is not true of the present Government. The present alone of all Governa ments is utterly incapable of producing a policy at this particular hour. ' It in knows nothing, and treats Parliament with scorn, while regarding the general public as a thing to be played with. Is it not right, then, that at this juncture we control should express our opinions? I now propose, Mr Speaker, to t at read to you something that I shall move as an addition to the Addressin-Reply. The ordinary formalities, rei n - quire nothing more than that there of shall be submitted a motion that the Government of the day does not receive the support of Parliament, and on that - hangs the story. ""We, however, go beyond that. This - Speech is blankthe K i ng is silent, inane, incapable of expressing an opinion, and we ought at - least to do something. The amendment I propose to submit, if as !,ong as a Rabbi's curse, as not quite so wearying, - and it is intended as a placard and proclamation to the public of what we think. You, sir, will listen with patience while I read tihe following amendment, which I mow moveTlint the fo'Howiiig words lie added to the proposed Addross-.ii]-JBepl.y:-' - but we regret that this .House views with disapprobation the conduct of the Government in meeting Parliament with a Speech containing .no evidence of anv public policy. There is no - mention of any - intended policy upon the subject of niilenimtioniU - trade which the head of the Government has asserted to be .liuiuhimental to the .progress and prosperity of Australia. There is no input ion ,of a policy on .the .sugar .agreement, wliie'h expires next '.Tune ' 3 hero is :no - mention of - a policy rolutiii"" to .the development .of internalfcr.ade,which Ts so vital to the employment .of our people but. - on - the contrary, the administrative methods pursued by the - Government accentuate imemSployiueirtIChere is .110 .mention - of the attitude of the Government '.towards .'iiabitration. towards the oil and wireless agreements, or .towards old age and invalid pensions. The Speech makes no - mention as 'to - whether the Government intends - to .investigate .the War Service Homes .and other matters of maladministration exposed last session by the Jiabour party. In brief, .this - Government, which claims to be n Goveniment of .business .men, gi« s no evidence of such qualification. Tiher.e is not rmc subject in His IDxcellencv's Speech upon which is given .a delinite, a concrete, or a composite opinion. 'Under these - circumstances, and in view of the peculiar methods under which this .Government .was formed, and in view of the fact that this .Government discloses an unseemlv haste to reach the haven of a recess of several lnorfths* duration, thus leaving in abeyance .the - discussion of these subjects vital to' the .welfare-of .our country, this House deems it necessary to protest and declare - that this Government does not possess its confidence."" Now faced with ibis peculiar ment, unlike any other in Australia, we have to ask ourselves - something as to the method of its origin. Rut before I touch Ujpon that, let me refer for a moment to .the statement made yesterday by the honourable - memher for Richmond' (Mr R. Green) that the Ministry is exclusively Australian. . All credit <to it, but the honourable member ignores the fact Mr Avslcy. under our flag, we speak a common tongue, and have a common destiny, ancl a - common faith . I do not object to the honourable member's discrimination. It is simply my misfortune not to have - been born on the soil of Australia) although my offspring are of this country. Rut, at least, if I came here from the centre of the Empire, it was my aim to i*ealize in this country those things I was not permitted to achieve in the land of my b.ixth. There have been Ministers within Australia .who. were essentially and characteristically Australian, born and iftrnined in Australia, but there ha-v-e been others who, - although .they had their .place of nativity in - other parts - of H is Majesty's Dominions, caonc to this country to realise, as I and others ""have done, those opportunities not - open to them in the land of their birth, and who at lea3t endeavoured with pre-eminent success to - be Australian in sentiment, and make .'this Commonwealth furnish for .them those chances not provided for the masses of the people in the centre of the Emjx'ir.e. Whether they were English, Scotch, Welsh, or Irish, whether they were cultured or uneuiltua-ed, none of tibem clim'bed 'to pre-emimeuce without a long . period of political .apprenticeshiip, and all of them possessed tihat .outstanding ability which enabled them to achieve - success. Bn.it today we - have a .Government .controlled iby ,a new foroe, by a ona-n who is not merely Australian, or - merely ; C English, b.ut is a cultured Australian seeking to adapt to himself the manners, customs, and fashions of Bond-street and Piccadilly. So much - for place of nativity. It matters not whether one 4s horn in the country lanes of England, .earn the slums of its cities, <or, again, in #he ; 'broad spaces of Australia. We are all the sons of one breed. If the honourable member meant anything by his statement, I ask him ;to adhere to it . If he - meant nothing, let him try to exiplain what he inea,-iiit. GovernNow I propose to deal with the origin of this Government, because its methods are so - exceptional and so unknown, a3 unknown ""as ave the things it proposes to do. It is distinct from anything we ""have had. 'Let ns consider how it was - produced, and at this point I place upon 'the stage of pu-b'lic --events once more the right that, honourable member for Nortfh Sydney (Ms. W. M. Hughes). I do. not intend to refer to«k.isirelations.w.ith the labour partiy of! bas old association with it,, buit I attentioii to the fact that he was a man .who,, .in the mindsof the Nationalists,, quite apart: from; the view taken by the Labour party, had. done things,' not. merely for hiscountry, but also for the Empire. SupporteiiS' of the National party shouted hurrah for what he' had' done for his country and for his Empire-. He even subordinated' the interests of his - party to those of his country. At any rate, he won great honour, and achieved renown. It is not my intention at this nioment to pick out his good or his evil points, but I say that the Nationalist press,' reflecting die views of the Nationalist} party,, hailed him as a man whohad done - immense service for his country, hia Empire, his flag, amd for the vast imperialism, of the British race. In fact., lie waa lauded as a man worthy of the highest appreciation-, and wJiile lie was successful,, powerful, and predominant, our friends OIL the Ministerial side of this- 'Chamber were sharers of his victories and participants in his re- nowir,. basking in the: sunshine of his glory.. ""But dien. there ' camea day when he fell 1 disfavour, when he no longer had that renown of that glory, and when we in v thns party were making accusations against hirii that were gradually eating into his reputation. Btafc we never said that he was alone responsible. We clearly recognised that hecould do nothing good or evil without every; honourable member' on the .Ministerial sidebeing a participator or asharer in what he did. Therewas nothing good hedid in which they wore not participants. ThcTe was nothing evil he did in which they were not aiders, abettors and' accessories. could accomplish nothing without the support of liisGovernment. There wasnothing he coul'd' accomplish in which every supporterof the"" National party was: not a participant. The Nationalist party, in a word, being, participants' in his' renown, were equally responsible for the evil he di d . What has' become of ; : hiim? Tho man who drove him out of public Wfc has now become a partner off ono who aided, abetted and supported' hihr. im die crimes for which he has been deprived of office. Who supported the honourable member for North 'Sydney moaze ably dian; did' the gendeman when . direct now occupies the position' of Prime Minister ? Going far beyond the declarations', of others, he swore to his leader the oath of brotherhood^ he made a blood compact witli him., shook him by the hand, and swore eiiernal fidelity, declaring, "" Where he goes I go too; and when he goes I go also.""",14
45,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Did he share in the£25,000?",17
46,Mr ANSTEY,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"No . He could share in the honour and' glory of victory, but he could not share in that.

But it is. that .culture which, is taught by "" big 1 business "" in Flinders-lane. It is honour as imdemstood among those who struggleHe for prestige of position in the market places of the world. And so they let . theiileaider' go, and' in turn beganto negotiate'. With whom-?' WiHhthe faction in theCountry party,- whose members are also' men of honour, of culture, of profound learning; mienof the highest attainments' and the widest experience; possessed of and' governed by the noblest codes of honour.. Do-honourable-members: ; recall' a certain famous speech of the pre*sent' Prime Minister-this - gentlemanof the bl'ood compact-wherei n he madehisrenowned assault upon the Country party? Mind you, Mr Speaker, I draw no distinction between the Country party, and that which is known as the Nationalist party. Both names are merely among the disguises behind which the opponents of the Labour movement masquerade from time to time. When one name 'begins to "" hum,"" to stink too vilely in the public nostrils, these myriad and varied opponents of Labour hide themselves 'behind a new name. The Country party assailed the late Prime Minister for three years; and for three years it kept him in power! It charged him and his Government with every manner and variety of miisgovernment and maladministration. But, today, the Country party associates itself with the late Prime Minister's colleague and blood brother. To-day, its members arc participants, aiders and abettors in all this wrongdoing and maladministration-the only difference being that now they all sit together, whereas, formerly, they did their aiding and abetting and participation under the guise and pretence of fiercest criticism. The present Prime Minister, who swore fidelity to his late chief, but whom he' helped to assassinate, and whose place he has taken, has done all this after saying that there was only one man who was capable of ruling Australia. As a matter of fact, he did indicate that there one other who also was a paragon of ability and, as such, .was also capable of ruling this country. That was yourself, Mr Speaker. But the honourable gentleman added, in respect of yourself, ""He has not the courage!"" Lacking in courage? There are various forms and manifestations of courage, which are exercisable both in time of peace and in war. Although the honourable gentleman who now occupies the Speakership has been my political opponent for thirty years-almost literally from the time when he was a boy-I am ready to say that he has never lacked courage. know that he has been called upon to fight forms of adversity which the--Primes Minister has never had to face. He was not horn with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has had to battle against hardships and drudgery-against conditions which might well have blanched and starved one's soul; and the courage with which he has overcome his disabilities has been of a character not lower than that which Mr Anstey. is displayed upon the .field of battle. Yet, ""he had not the courage!"" There was only one man, then, who, in the opinion of this gentleman of the blood compact, was qualified to exercise the political, rulership of the Commonwealth, and that was William Morris 'Hughes. Yet the honourable gentleman sitting opposite me deserted him, and took his place! What he must have really said-to himself, of course-was , "" There is no other man but myself who is capable."" And then he goes to His Excellency the Governor General. God forbid that I should be so disloyal as to reflect upon the character or the actions either of His Majesty or of his representative in this country. But since the one and only Leader had been discarded, and stood discredited, how great ,and worthy was the judgment ^ of theKing's . representative! ' How clearly did he steer from the stigma of partisanship when he called upon the man who had taken the cloak of his discarded and discredited chief to form an Administration! Great be our patriotism ! All glory to the King, and all honour to His Excellency! In his famous Maryborough speech, not only did our new Prime Minister say that he would fight, and, if necessary, go out and die, with his then Leader, but he was' made certain reflections upon the Country party. What would honourable members think of me if I said that you, Mr. Speaker, were a man of paralyzed intellect, and.if I were then to offer you the Treasurership? The honourable gentleman opposite to me' was referring, of course, to the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page). He said that he was the Leader of a party of men of paralyzed intelligences.",17
49,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Oh , no!",18
50,Mr ANSTEY,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Oh , yes! I read it in the press. I do not know, of course, whether ir, was in the Prime Minister's 1 papers. But there it was. The honourable gentleman said that the members of the Country party were men of paralyzed mentality. Did the present Treasurer resent those words? Not at all! The ordinary, crude, rough, and uncultured man, born in the street, and dragged up in the alley-ways, might bridle at such a stigma, and might want to strike a blow at his accuser. But culture and polish demand, of course, that one must smile and take it all. Anyhow, what happened soon afterwards? This other blood brother conies over to Melbourne, but drops off at a side station; he claps his sombrero on his head, wraps his poncho about his chest, sneaks round the darkened streets, crawls up the new Prime Minister's back stairs, and signs the contract. These gentlemen of culture can do the sort of thing that the average man. in the street would repudiate and describe as a degradation. The Prime Minister, having called attention to their paralyzed mentality, promptly "" signs up "" with the members of this so-called Country faction. Having stigmatized the in as being without sanity or stability, and as men who would lead the country to disaster, he takes theni into partnership. That is honour; that is politics; that is shrewdness and sagacity! He ""signs up."" The deed is done; the task is accomplished! Then we say to ourselves, "" At least, there must be some bond of policy between them; at any rate, they Avill give us a policy."" Here is an aggregation of men who are unknown to Australia. They come before us in their serried ranks, armed cap-a-pie, with all tlieir shrewdness, sagacity, and business capacity. But, no! They will not propound a policy. They will not indicate any policy. We thought that they, with, their superior gifts 'and capabilities, would call Parliament together with all promptitude, and there make known their business. But they do nothing. They are mental blanks; paralytics! We find nothing. We can see nothing in this Speech, and where else shall we search ? We must look for the particular reasons which have brought about this combination. I have already said that I draw no distinction between the Country and the Nationalist party. I ask honourable members to inquire of themselves, where do the majority of these country gentlemen come from? From those areas of Australia which, for twenty years or more, have been the centres of reaction. In most instances the Labour party has never held sway in the districts from which they hie, and , if , by any chance, there has come from out of those areas a man of liberal thought, it has been more by accident than design. But what of the policy of the Government? We have to look beyond these walls, and before the doings of this past clay ov two to try to discover their policy for ourselves. There is emphatically nothing in the speech of the Governor General which may be taken remotely to indicate what the Government propose to do or to put before Parliament. The first course which we take in our search is to probe the public utterances of the Prime Minister during the brief period which has elapsed since he took up his supreme office. I find that he spoke at a meeting in Sydney on 17th February. The occasion may be said to have been the Prime Minister's first speech in public, ancl it might be called the "" National S p i r it "" speech. At the meeting he was upheld, supported, ancl surrounded by a number of gentlemen embracing the heads of commerce, aud including the Employers' Federation. There was Sir Owen Cox, the head of the Black Labour gang, the representative of the blacklabour interests of Lord Inchcape-the gentleman who, though a British subject himself, and professing to support and honour the British flag, exploited his country in the hour of war, and has never regarded men of his own race and blood as fit subjects - to man his ships. Unfortunately, it was in this environment that the Prime Minister, of Australia made his first speech, which, as I say, may be designated "" the National Spirit Speech."" Addressing these gentlemen, these representatives of monopoly, and of black labour, he said, ""I welcome the fact that on this, the first opportunity I have had of speaking to the people of Australia as Prime Minister, I do so in an atmosphere free from poldtics, and to gentlemen who know no' party divisions or sectional aims."" If my esteemed friend and learned Bolshevik from the Barrier, Mr Michael Considine, had spoken to a meeting of Bolsheviks or a Communist assembly, and had addressed those present as representing the intelligent, the i l it e , the moderate, and the discreet people of Australia, his statement could not have been regarded as more absurd, more ridiculous, and more laughable than that of the Prime Minister when he speaks to the representatives of wealth, and labour, and all .that stands for reaction, as representative men "" free from party divisions and sectional aims."" the men who pour their money into the party funds of the political reactionaries) of this country in order to obstruct the march of Australian Democracy. Prime Minister went on to beautiful sentences' which can be read in the speeches of Shiels, Warren and others. He said, "" The future depended upon the creation of a true national spirit, and if every one should have that spirit, and if it pervaded their lives, their troubles would 'Great questions were - sometimes sight of in the welter of lesser that .divided their ranksi and - obscured their vision. To-day 'they had great opportunities. If they did not :seize them they would miss them. future w.as bright, and they achieve their great - destiny that was. He did not - appear to - know what their .great destiny was. He did not even trouble .about it. He went oin to say that the Government was founded on sanity and progress, .and^that was' the .great aim it had m_ view. It is no doubt a "" stable'"" ment. It is in a very bad condition, too. It wants cleaning cart. 'The Prime Minister added that ""' the Government did not look to left or right, and did not seek the support"" Of either the reactionary or the revolutionary.. looked for support to the the right-thinking, and the and 'the extent to which people possessed those quaiTiifications would - no doubt be discernible by the extent to which they supported the 'Government. .Government, he said, Australia destined for an - era - of .prosperity and happiness. This <era of prosperity and happiness, presumafb'ly, will be the result of a - policy of - negation. About months ago the Prime Minister, who was then Treasurer, went to Adelaide, there he told 'the people that could not live by herself alone, and. that ' her future did - not . depend politics or the tactics of but upon the recovery of When speaking in Sydney, he said, "" I now say that under my Government tralia can live for herself alone, and_ can enjoy an era of prosperity and happiness even if Europe be a ' quivering wreck ',"" Ur. Anstey. black .as Mr Lloyd George expressed it - 'The Prime Minister did not actually use those words, but I am .stating what he meant Tbey are to say, and tried to say. He concluded by saying, "" Again I congratulate you that you reflect nothing narrow and sectional, but in all your speeches, whatever The they may be, you. reflect the highest express national spirit."" The newspapers said he spoke well about the national spirit. It is, Hastings, of course, a, fine sentiment upon which one can make eloquent perorations. An y one can deal with the "" national spirit '"" aa long as he can stand up, but when he is asked to translate his talk in to something disappear - tangible, hiB difficulty arises. People ask, lost "" What 'do you mean by ' a - national things spirit ' ? Translate it into something tangible. Demonstrate it in legislation, and in .a clear and definite policy. It may mot be a policy that we agree with , Their but if you will, at least, only translate it would .into some form of practice, we shall .be ""-'whatever able toi understand - what you mean."" It may be stated clearly and definitely that neither the people nor the press can understand the policy or the tactics of the Government at 'the present time. stability The Prime Minister went to Sydney and made a second speech. He made .this Govern- .to "" the people "" in an appropriate place, namely, the Millions Club. On that occasion he worked off a fine phrase which can be read in text-books, and whidh we all .learned as boys. He said, "" The >best Government is that which governs least."" It The .press and the people of the country fair-minded, - ridiculed that statement; there - was hardly moderate,"" .a newspaper in Australia that did - not criticise -%. To this .gathering of ;anti-Socialists, anti-Labourites, anti-ieverything that stands far progress and Under his development, and pro-everything that was stands for tke t r i u m p h of money-power in Australia, he .quoted that piece of SpencerSan philosophy from Spencer's article on "" The . iComing Slavery,"" twelve the article commencing, "" B e it true or not truethat man is born in sin and and shapen in iniquity, it is unquestionAustralia ably true that 'Governments are born of aggression and live by .aggression."" The upon Prime Minister .at this hour has to re-echo individuals, to the representatives of dominant capiEurope. talism in Australia the absurdity that the beat Government is that which governs Aus- least. He knows, 'and the press .and the people of this country know, that the best Government is that which utilizes the resources of communal effort in order best to develop the talents and capacities of the individual members of the community. The Prime Minister went on to ""promise"", and it . appeared as if we should at last get something definite- - He said, "" We promise consideration""-of what? promised consideration of the problems of Empire trade relations and Empire defence. There we see the great statesman ! He is not troubled about the affairs of Victoria, South Australia, or Tasmania, or even of Australia generally. His main concern is with great Imperial, things. He wants to solve the problems of Empire; his mind goes far beyond the problems of Australia. He has not told us how he is going to solve the problems of the Empire. B ut he will "" consider "" them. He also undertook to consider the problem of population, and to look into internal development and in ternal finance. Finally he promised a declaration of policy whereby the aforesaid problems would be solved. He finished with a peroration in which he spoke of an unrivalled climate, unmatched resources, brilliant sunshine, fine nights, and glorious mornings. The newspapers were very critical of this effort. The best criticism I saw was in the Melbourne Herald, which said that the Millions Club speech consisted of prettily expressed platitudes. Then came at h i r d speech in Adelaide. I read a threercolumn' report of that speech. It contained twenty-sevenE m pires and three Australian. of ties of Empire, bonds of Empire; love of ' Empire, unity of Empire, f a it h in Empire; stTeam pire; amd so on. Therewas not much. Australiai n it . This"" gentleman could contemplate the problems of another country, but not of his"" own. ' this; speech he said that he was going to consider threegreat problems-Defenc e of Empire^ Foreign Policy of the Empire, and Tradeof the Empire. There was nothingabout the defence of Australia. Why should he worry about that? Australia is mentioned only in a subordinate way at the t a i l end of the speech. He pointed out that Empire defence was, of course, needed, and that if something was not done, something would be left undone. In order to devise remedies he advocated that there should be a great Empire Conference. He proposed to solve the Empire problems of Imperial defence, foreign policy, and Empire trade by Conference. He did not propose to solve these questions by legislation, or by presenting a policy Heor Bills for Parliament to discuss, but by a Conference which may or inay not becalledSince we can get nothing from the Prime Minister, we have to turn to the other elements of the party. The Treasurer went to Sydney and denied the truth of what the Prime Minister had said. He said he had not been guilty of having a suggestion, and if he had one he would let them know of it . He professed to explain the position, and said the Country party members could pull out of the Government whenever they liked. He went on to say that the idealsof the Nationalist party and the Country party were alike. The Prime Minister said that he had a paralyzed mentality, and that he would be; unable to give direct effect to the policy of the Country party! The Country party are represented in the Cabinet in; the proportion of five out of eleven, but. they are "" e q u a l in all t h in g s "" ! They are a distinct, entity! They, are united' in substance, but not bound in person). The Country party have developed a policy; and since w.e cannotobtain from the Prime Minister any pronouncement asi to the policy of the Government, let ua ask ourselves what the Country party He spoke have to offer. Canthe. Country party impose their policy upon the Government?. Have the Country p a r t y swalof Em- lowed the Nationalist party, or have the. Nationalistsswallowed the Country party f In Pear what do the Country party stand'? In the first place, they stand for the abolition ofgovernmental activities. How grand-ho w masterly a policy f I do not ask honourable members to consider what may be regarded by some as the. Socialisticor extreme doctrines of the Labour party. Whatever our doctrinesmay be, we have f a i th in them, and believe them tot be essentiiall to the progress and development of the country. I ask honourable members to look abroad-to see what is going on in other countries'. It is unnecessary for us to go to' any country presided over by a Labour Government for an illustration of what is happening in respect of governmental activities. Throughout the world the general tendency is towards the extension of governmental functions. The world is not moving backwards. As individualism disappears, and wealth is aggregated in the hands of the few, Governments of countries all over the world see that in respect of 'many functions there is only one alternative. They have either to leave extreme industrial powers in the hands of the comparatively few, or to take them over and to control them through the medium of Government. It is a question, not of the application of Socialistic policy, but rather of doing those things which are essential to the well-being of the people. In every country municipal activities increasing. In this very city, under a Government, dominated by a man who> is hostile to Socialistic doctrines, municipal activities are expanding. In this State, where, except for a few days, there has never been a Labour Administration i u power, governmental activities have in creased. What is the greatest activity into which this State has entered ? In. secretly. every State in Australia the railway system is controlled by the Government. Need I ask what prompted the pioneers- the original Governments of this country - to decide that our railway systems should be governmental activities ? We know that the railways are infinitely more satisfactory in the hands of the community .than they would be if in the hands of private corporations. If , the United States of America, our ways, instead of being controlled by vernment, were in the hands of private corporations, our agricultural, producers would be crushed by heavy imposts. This country acted wisely in assuming governmental responsibility for railway transport. The Treasurer, who affects be progressive, and who tells us that party of which he was, but is no longer, the leader, is a party of progress, stands in the ranks of the most Tory elements. He is opposed to the advanced thought of all countries in so far as he declares at this hour that if he had the power - would . sell the railways of the several States to private corporations. That deBank. claration was made by him , not upon the platforms of the country, but in House. Mr Anstey. In Victoria we have a Government which is hostile to the Labour movement and its principles, but which has been driven by the force of facts to go into the heart of Gippsland, and to monopolize there a great product. Under the direction of General Monash, it is spending millions in an enterprise designed to develop a.' State-owned activity. It has taken this action because it recognises that whomsoever owns or controls the sources of supply of power and transport controls individual industry within the State. The very Governments which are hostile to the Labour party are driven by force of circumstances to follow the very lines which the Labour party have laid clown as offering the best solution of a national problem. The present Comare monwealth Administration proposes to Tory destroy the Woollen Mills ancl the Saddle and Harness Factory, as well as other industries which the Commonwealth has developed. In. so far as it can, it destroys these industries openly, but in some directions it dare not proceed. What it dare not openly destroy it will destroy The Government does not propose to destroy the Commonwealth Bank. Even the Leader of the Country party, who denounces Governmental activities, and proposes to destroy some of them-the Commonwealth Woollen Mill s are to bo disposed of because they come into conflict with the private interests of certain as in members of the Government-doe s not railpropose to do away with the CommonGowealth Bank. We are told that the programme of the Country party is not to be restricted, but, on the contrary, is to 'be extended. The activities of these economic functions of the community are to be ""floored."" To what extent does the to practice of the party conform to its printhe ciples and professions? Why do they not put their principles into operation in so far as the Commonwealth Bank is concerned? The reason is that Tory and reactionary as they are, they know M l well that no Government i i i Australia he dare attempt to destroy the structure and the ramifications of the Commonwealth An y Administration that attempted to do so would be swept out of this public life. This Govermnent, however, proposes to appoint a Board of Control for the Commonwealth Bank, because it objects to "" one man power."" Whether the Bank is controlled by one man or a dozen, it must be judged by its success or failure, and since there is no dead level of mediocrity, the brainiest man on the directorate wall come to the top even if a Commission or Board of Control of three or four be appointed. The Government, according to press statements, proposes to appoint a directorate of at least four members. We are informed that it haa determined to do away with five of the Government motor cars, and so to save the wages of five chauffeurs. At the same time, it proposes to put five of its "" p a l s "" on the directorate of Commonwealth Bank. This Government, which proposes to save a penny here and a penny there by cutting down the wages of a few men, or by putting a few men out of work-this Government, which hopes to save £50 here or £100 there by closing down this and that office -^is ready at the same time to spend thousands of pounds on another expedition to Europe to solve the pro-, blems of Empire, while at the same time it leaves untouched the problems of its"" own country. We are told that the Commonwealth Bank needs to be controlled. Is there no need of control in respect of private (banking? In the United States and many European countries, the private hanks are not left uncontrolled, but in this country they are. The Labour party believe in a policy of control in. respect of our private banking systems. The Government, however, proposes in respect of the Commonwealth Bank- a Bank which has been administered by one man in a way that is creditable to himself, and has proved of the utmost value to the country of which he is a citizen-that there shall be a Board of Control. It proposes that the present Governor of the Bank shall be supervised Board consisting of its own particular tisans, while, at the same time, it the private banking systems of Australia completely untouched and uncontrolled. The private banking institutions of tralia control £200,000,000 of the public ing. moneys. Int o their reservoirs flow the savings of the people. The very Savings Banks are channels for the collection the moneys of the people in order 1 they may flow into the reservoirs of private banks. In many countries not dominated by Labour, public inspectors may at any moment call for the books of a private bank and examine them. In Australia, however, the private banks, as I have said, are entirely untouched by the Government. The present Ministry proposes that that system shall continue, but at the same time it seeks, if possible, to penalize and emasculate the national banking institution which was established by the Labour party. This Government ignores all the facts of history. In Great Britain , Germany, and Prance there have been men who the have, at least, recognised that certain fundamental principles of Socialism are capable of being applied with profit to capital and industry. They have objected to such principles, b ut have applied some of them. Disraeli, for in stance, wrote a book which had a circulation of half-a-million copies, and whioh was translated into various tongues. I refer to Sybil, a political novel which gave an impetus to the progressive movement of Labour Disraeli did not accept the theory of Socialism, but in that book lie recognised that every man had a common responsibility to his country, and that there was an obligation on the part of those who controlled the affairs of government to ask themselves by what means the instrumentalities of government could be used, not to augment the riches of the few, but to enlarge' the powers of the m u l t itude. The philosophy for which we stand may not be correct, but there is in it , at least, something clearer and more definite than is to be found in that particular policy which, when it is not absolutely negative, is positively reactionary, and controls everything in the interests of the great money classes. Disraeli, while not accepting the philoby a sophy for which we stand, boldly approparpriated £4,000,000 of public money so leaves that the - Britisli Government might obtain control of the Suez Canal. That was Socialism. It meant GoAusvernment control and Government financAnd Disraeli took that action because he saw that in that enlargement of Government control, that expansion of of public ownership, there was an in that strumentality by which the Empire the . might expand, and the interests of its industries be served. In Germany, Bismarck accepted the policy of Ferdinand Lassalle, applied it in his own way, made great national appropriations in respect of mines and forestry, salt and kerosene, and so gained immense revenues to expend in 'the interests of his country. Would the Government destroy all the activities now carried on by the Commonwealth? Not at all. members opposite have no belief in the policy which they have They destroy Government activities only when they come into conflict with their owu private interests. This cannot hope to live. It has no policy. It cannot promulgate a policy falling to pieces by reason of its own internal rottenness and internal sions. The members of this Government cannot agree upon I shall prove that statement. vernment had been able to agree upon a policy, it would have promulgated As I said at the outset, every Government, that hasexisted in Australia has within a few weeks of its creation brought down a policy and a programme of legislation. It is not because the present Administration is less capable than the Administration which immediately ceded, it that it has not brought a policy. It. is due rather 'to the fact that, it cannot agree upon Honourable members opposite are united only in their hostility to the advancement of the Labour movement. majority of the States of the Commonwealth the Labour movement, despite its lack of organization,, despite the press, despite its ignorance, and incapacity, and the fact that it has neither culture nor military, discipline, has been able to secure the approval of a majority of the people. Those - are the outstanding facts, and, as the (Dr Earle Page) said in the country, the justification which members opposite haye for the arrangement into which they have entered is the fact that they prevent the reins' of government falling into the hands of the Labour party. I do not want the reins of government, and I believe that the majority of my colleagues have no wish to hold them. Certainly we have no wish to sit on the Government bench supported by only a minority of membersiu this Chamber, nor even by a majority Mr Anstey. here, if in another place there is a hostile majority which is able to reject the legislation we enact. We arc not worried, and we are not hurried. We believe in the growth of public opinion. There may be developments in thenear future followed by other political crises, due to the pressure of economic facts which has already given us a victory at Honourable this election. We were successful with the majority of our nominations, and promulgated. but for the peculiar distribution of the electorates of the House of Representatives, we would have had a majority in Government this Chamber. As it was, our total majorities in five States out of six outwithout number the votes recorded against us. That is our triumph, even though we have dissen- not attained to offioe. At this hour werecomposite present the majority of the people of anything. Australia. The Government do not. If the Go- They have a majority in the Chamber by a mere fluke, by the chance of circumone. stances, justas political bosses in the States have achieved a majority in Parliament, not because they were sup« ported by the majority of the electors, but because the . distribution of seats favoured them. The future is .ours; it must be ours, because the Labour party pre- is the only one which can promulgate a down definite progressive policy for this country. Honourable members' may laugh anything,. and sneer, but I ask them to carry their minds back to 1910, when despite the fact that the newspapers said that upon In a three things the Labour party stood, condemned in the minds of all reasonable men, the. majority of the people stood to us., we came into power, we put. owe programme into execution, and our. enactuniversity ments have stood the, testof time. They stand, today unchallenged, and no> Governimentj no. maibter how Tory in tendency,, dare tear therm topieces. As it Treasurer was in the past, so it shall', be in. the future. A party which embodies the honourable progressive thought of the-nation and has a definite policy, which does not alter w:ith. every change of circumstances, isr the only onethat canever control the groiwthof. thiscontinent. The present Government are devoid of ideas; they represent nothing but: the powers of reaction. But their hour is passing; ours is coming: We are not worried; we are not hurried. Woknow that the Government are so ignominious and incapable that they can accomplish nothing.",18

That was their only hope . 1 tunately for them nothing of the sort haa happened or will happen. The Government will not be reactionary, and it will not do any of the things which the honourable member for Bourke predicted as likely .to be done under our rule. do not think that .the honourable member has any personal antipathy to me, but he did not appear to care for my method of dressing, or - my manners, or some quality which he described as culture. But if he thinks ithat any of those characteristics - indicate the good - old Conservative mind, or Tory instincts, I assure him he is quite wrong. The members of the Government are not Tories. We are just as progressive in our ideas as are the majority of honourable members opposite. But we show ,a little more sanity in connection with the means by which we hope to give effect to those ideas. The honourable member complained of the absence of any policy. He said that this was the first Government which had met Parliament out a complete policy, and suggested that if the Labour party had been in our place they would have been ready with, their policy.

Of necessity, owing to. the results of the - election, Unfor- ithe absence of ex-Ministers and the de. feat of others, work in the Departments, .of which uhey .assumed control, was in arrears. We have taken over the reins of governmenait, we have - gone into the Departments - and tackled the problems I which confronted has; - but no Government - wdith .amy intelligence, or who .made any pretence of considering the problems which have to - be solved, .could produce a policy in sio short a time. It would have'been a grave and serious mistake to attempt ,to do so. Some time will be required to frame a policy and present it to the House. I intend, however, to indicate tb honourable members some of the problems with which we have to cope, in order that they may realise how impossible it was to present to the House a completed policy without first having had an opportunity of giving it the most mature consideration. The honourable member for Bourke took considerable objection to some of the speeches that I have made since the formation of the Government. I venwith- ture to suggest that they contained many things which required to be said, and I invite honourable members opposite to study and repeat them. The honourable member for Bourke said that my speeches were platitudes. I can imagine the type of speech the honourable member would have made had he been in my place. My remarks may have been platitudes, but they were common sense platitudes. H is would have been the wild platitudes of the Communist or Socialist, which mean nothing to sane minds, but carry away those who do not understand them. If we are to have platitudes, I prefer them savoured with a little sanity rather than those which the honourable member would have uttered. The honourable member repeatedly said that the combination now in office is without common principles or' common ideals, and was brought about merely for the purpose of keeping the Labour party out of office. That is quite absurd. The two parties that have combined have common ideals and a common basis, and we shall endeavour to carry through a programme which represents those ideals. But even if that were not so. I think it would have been very proper foi the parties on this side to combine 1 if for no other objective than to keep the present Labour party out of power. Some things are so terrible to contemplate for Australia that almost any preventive action would be justified. One of those possibilities is the advent to power in the - Commonwealth of the Labour party as ^at present constituted. I had a very con-siderable respect for the Labour party of those days of which the honourable member for Bourke spoke, which put upon the - statute-book some admirable measures.",25
56,Mr CHARLTON,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Most of the men placed those measures on the statute-book are in the House now, but the parties opposite have kicked out all but two of those who went over to them from the Labour party.",26
57,Mr SPEAKER,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,Order ! I ask honourable members to resist the temptation to in lerject.,26
58,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"I repeat that I had a very considerable admiration for the Labour party of days gone by. and the things for which it stood. Honorabl« members opposite flatter themselves if they think that they are anything lik'e the old Labour party, or that their proposals resemble the principles for which Labour stood in years gone by. In those days of the Labour party stood for great things, nnd was not dominated by outside and - grinding sinister influences. To-day the position is very different. I say quite f r a n k ly that. is moving to the crisiswhile the Labour party is in its present position, and stands for those things that are forced on it from outside, I am going to do everything in my power to keep it out of office. I am sorry to have to say what I must say about the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey), but he said much about the party on this side, and I must point out that honorablt members opposite are not so blameless as he might suggest. There isone phase which I desire to mention for the consideration of the honourable memher. We all know what the Labour party stands for today. The party makes no disguise of the fact that it stands today for what its programme says-the socialization of production, industry, distribution, o and exchange. I presume that, should the Labour party come into power, honourable members opposite are prepared to carry out their own programme.",26
59,Mr CHARLTON,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Hear , hear!",26
60,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Then it is to be regretted that the honourable member did not tell the country what his party's programme was. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) went up and down the country aud made many speeches. I have the greatest admiration for those speeches, because he skated over such thin ice that it is almost inconceivable that he did not go through. This, however, did not.happen; the honourable member evaded all the dangerous subjects and avoided all mention of the real objectives who for which his party stands'. The present Government may have some demeritspersonally, I hesitate to believe it hasbut they and their supporters certainly had the courage to tell the country what they stood for and what they believed in. There are quite a number of gentlemen opposite who did nothing of the sort. I free the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) from any such charge, aa - he never hesitates to say what he thinks. He not only says it on the platform, but has also put it into books, and I have in front of me'one of his very frank utterances in regard to a policy for Australia :Xn skin-plaster legislation, no mere policy alleviation, will meet the position. Revolution in action and method is the one saving instrumentality, the sole alternative to a long period of absolute slavery. I make no nnolojry for this statement. . . ' Australia * At least I admire my honourable friend opposite for thus declaring what he thinks and stands for. I now desire to deal with some of the questions as to which the honourable member for Bourke says that the Government could have solved them in a day ancl submitted to Parliament a policy in regard to them. If , however, the honourable member w i ll consider those questions for a moment-and remember that I am not' so fortunately placed as he is in having his policy made for Mm-h e will see that the Government was in considerable difficulties in attempting its task in the period allowed. I wish, first of all, to deal with the question that I mentioned in Adelaide, and which appears to have caused such intense pain to the honourable member for Bourke. He did not like my referring to the Empire and Empire defence. I suggest to him that it is the most vital question of all, seeing that Australia's defence is wrapped up in the question of Empire defence. less for the honourable member to talk of all those great ideas and ideals of Socialism that he would bring into force in Australia, unless he takes the first necessary step, namely, to assure Australia's safety and the integrity of the territory which we govern today. That is why, I take this subject fii'st. It is, as I have said, the most important question that faces Australia today. There is, I think, not one of us, certainly not any of us who came into close contact with the recent war, but is determined that there shall be no repetition of that tragedy if we can avoid it . I think there are few of uswho do not believe absolutely in the reduction of armaments as far as it can be brought about ancl a minimum expenditure even on defence. Expenditure for war or warlike preparation today is not to be contemplated in any civilized country, and even for defence we must consider what is the minimum compatible' with our safety. But within those limits it is a sacred obligation on us to provide for the safety and integrity of the country we are called upon to govern. It is a question of thedefence of Australia, and we can only defend this country if we are inside the Empire, and if we have the assistance of the Motherland and the Empire as a whole. I believe in the League of Nations. Some day I believe that that League is going to insure the peace of the world if it gets the support it should from all the nations. But that hour has not come, and we have today to preserve our safety. To attempt this task alone, and not under an .Empire defence scheriie, is to court disaster, and the cost of the attempt would place a paralyzing burden on the people of Australia. I ask honourable gentlemen opposite to - turn their minds to the importance of this great question. I know there are some men I shall never convince, and I know also that there are some who realise these facts, but have not the courage to state them. But I appeal to every man who has courage and vision to realise the importance of the question. The Government believe that today, for the discussion of the question of an Empire naval defence scheme, consultation between the Dominions and It is use- the Motherland is essential; and if an Imperial Conference is not summoned, Australia will press for one at the earliest possible moment, believing, as we do, that the formulation of a common scheme of defence is vital to our safety and our whole future welfare. ""Wrapped up in the question of Empire defence, is the question of Empire foreign affairs. There are some in Australia who think that we can be a law unto ourselvesthat we are 12,000 miles away from. Europe, and need not worry about what happens in other parts of the world. I remind those who take that view that the distanoe of 12,000 miles did not save us from being involved in the late war, nor will it save us in the future. We have to try to insure that any Empire foreign policy for which we must bear responsibility is one to which we have assented. W it h full appreciation of the responsibility for what I am saying; I suggest that this question today ds not in a satisfactory position, and that, unless some better arrangements can be made, the position of an outlying Dominion like Australia will become intolerable. If we are to take any responsibility for the Empire's foreign policy, tliere must be a better system, so that we may be consulted and have a better opportunity to express the views of - the people of this country. This is a matter that will have to be considered at the Imperial Conference. We - cannot blindly submit to any policy wiliich may involve us in war. We want to know where we aire going. Another great question of vital concern to the safety and welfare of the Empire is that of commuaiications-wireless , shipping, and all mean's of communication between Australia and the Motherland. These are problems which come first-our safety must stand before everything. When that safety is assured we may then consider schemes for the betterment of our internal condition, but not before. As to the other question, that of ing for herself. Empire trade relations, the 'Government regard it as of paramount imjportance. all realise the .great .change that has come over Australia's position during .the last, few years. Before the war we had 'the whole world as our market;.o«r surplus production was ismall, and no .difficulties presented themselves in its disposal. ing ithe .war, however, the whole position changed,, .and .today w?.e .are faced very different problem. Our production increased, and we hope wild go on increaspractical ing. To-day %w.e have <a great - sua-plus believing ..dispose of, and it .is useless to go on ducing unless w.e have aaaankets. I venfcuireducts to suggest that there has heen too stress laid .on production, and .not quite euongh concern about markets for the .disthe Government will see 'that the G!©mposal of our (products. These two questions walk hand in hand, and to solve one we must first - solve the other. .so'liubion of (the problem of ihe disposal surplus production is more difficult day than ait any -.other time im '.history. We all know the financial conditions that have followed as an .aftermath of the war. A great numher of nations which an ordinary course would take our surplus production are today so situated financially that it is impossible for us trade with them. While our production has increased, and .the surplus we have to - dispose of is - greater, our markets are very greatly restricted. There really only one sound way in which can solve this problem, and that is proved economic relations within - the Empire itself. As honourable memI bers know, Australia has entered a reciprocal treaty with the Dominion Mr Bruce-. New Zealand; - we have carried on negotiations with the Dominion of Canada for a reciprocal agreement, and the Government hope that as a result of the visit of Mr Robb, .the Canadian Ministeifor Customs, some satisfactory progress will be made. If these two agreements are entered into they will be helpful, but we must have something more. It is to the Motherland we must look primarily in considering the question of markets and the disposal of our surplus products. The position today is that Australia has given a great preference in her markets - to British trade and commerce, a preference certainly greater tlia-n the Motherland would ever have felt justified in askI t is true, perhaps, that we expect from the Motherland We some additional consideration in return for what Ave have done, but we realise her vast and very great difficulties. However, the Government feel - that if the suggested Conference 'be held, the visit of Dominion statesmen and the holding of Dur- - the iConference may create an atmosphere which will render possible - the with a carrying through of arrangements which has today appear to he beyond the realms of policy. For that reason, - and to that this question of the marproketing - and disposal of our - surplus - proas - more vital than is any other, much Australia welcomes the idea of the Economic 'Conference, and if it be 'he-Id ! monwealth is properly represented. The I have had to deal with these matters of at some length, 'but they are of paratomount importance. In addition to the external Australian problems for which we have to find some solution, I would like to deal briefly with some of our internal problems. I do not propose .to present the Government's policy, but in view of the suggestion that in a short period of to less than three weeks we could have taken - over the Departments, made all the necesto-day sary arrangements, framed our policy, is and presented it to the House as a we whole, it is only failthat I should by imlay before honourable members some of the problems we have to solve. First, take those - concerning the Territories into over which the Commonwealth preof sides, as against those matters which involve the Commonwealth and the States. The Northern Territory problem has been with us for some time, and irrespective of what we may think of it, it remains. It is a fact- a problem that must be solved. We have to hold this gateway into Australia from the north. Wc must attempt to populate it and try to develop it. . Mr GiiiEooiiT - We cannot hold less we populate it.",26
61,Mr BRUOE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"It is quite true that have to develop it and populate it in some way, because it is imperative we should hold it. The position in the received. Northern Territory was very closely contion sidered by the late Government, and far as opportunity presented itself also been considered by the present Government. For some days past the Minister for Home and Territories has conferred with representatives of the toral and mining industries in the Terriare tory. The whole question has been considered very closely. The Governtion ment aro quite clearly of opinion that the only - way in which this portion of Australia can be deveout loped is by concentrating efforts on the: development of the. pastoral and ing industries. People have had visions of turning this Territory immediately into' a great agricultural country even with small holdings, but the present vernmentdonot believe that the position can possibly be handled in this way. realise that development must follow throughthe improvement of the pastoral amd mining industries. Wrapped up in this problem is the question of the tenure under which land is held. There are someleases held under the old South Australian laws; others are held under. Commonwealth ordinances. The Government think that the solution of the trouble lies to a large extent in the alteration of. the leases at impracticable. present held, by means of which division will takeplace. A more complete, or, at all events, a. more quate stocking than at present is necesfinances sary in the Territory. Transport communication facilities must also be proved. That,, of course, embraces better scheme for shipment from the ritory at some point yet to be determined; also raihvay development, and provision for roads and additional stock routes. I put these points forward because we have been challenged that we could have put forward a policy in regard to these very great things within a few weeks. This is the first internal problem I want honourable members to consider. The Government will say what they propose to do in regard to the Northern Territory it unwhen they submit their policy. In regard to Papua and New Guinea, we we are obliged to develop the mandated Territories according to the lines that laid down by the mandate we have It is a complicated quesinvolving considerable' difficulty in as regard to the expropriated properties. has Great efforts have been made for some time to dispose of these properties, but they have not been disposed of, and some alteration may have to be made in respect pasto the terms on which the Government willing to sell. The problem of the mandated Territories involves the quesof the protection of the natives. The Government have, as one of their basic ideas, the determination to carry to the letter that phase of the mandate: Australia has received which conmintemplates the fair, just, and equitable treatment of the native population.. With regard to the Federal Territory, Goembracing the Federal Capital, the Government, are perfectly clear as to We where they stand in this matter. They believe that the establishment of the Federal Capital on the basis accepted in the original compact must be honoured. Before the war it was contemplated that the Commonwealth should build at Canberra a capital with monumental buildings, which would stand for all time, and constitute a worthy metropolis, for the great nation of Australia. But the waT, which altered many things, rendered the carrying out_ of that original plan quite Consequently the posisubtion wasreviewed, and a means of honouring the obligation without putadeting an intolerable strain upon the of Australia was arrived at. and Under the present plan the Capital' will imbe gradually erected, and as soon asposa sible rendered habitablefor the carrying Teron of the government of Australia. The Government are very clear on three points: Firstly, the work of the Federal Capital must proceed smoothly and evenly; money must be made available so that it will be a continuous job. Secondly, the Government believe that the - Federal Territory and the building of the Capital should be placed in the hands of a Commission, somewhat on the lines of the Commission which administers the"" Federal Capital of Washington, in the United States of America. When, we submit our policy, we shall submit such a scheme to Parliament. Thirdly, we propose to encourage private enterprise to come in and help in the development of the Territory, and in the building of the Capital. We do not think that the whole of the work should he carried out by the Government itself. May I suggest to my friends-wh o say that we could have produced our policy here and gone ahead with legislationone thought in regard to this matter. It is not the work of a week or of two weeks to prepare the whole basis upon which we would propose to hand over a great undertaking of this character to a Commission which would be responsible for the futur e conduct of such an important matter. The next point to which I wish to direct the attention of honourable bers relates to matters involving Commonwealth and the States. first of these questions is that of immigration. I need not remind members of the position in regard to immigration and land settlement. are all familiar with the fact that, the exception of the territories to which I have just referred, the whole of the land in Australia is in the hands of the iStates, and that the States control this side of the question. I remind them, however, of the necessity for getting into Australia, and I can tell them this much of the policy of the Government, that we intend to press on with gration. It would be simplicity itself to have made a policy speech which merely indicated that we proposed to do this. The question is how dt is to be done, and the consideration of that, I suggest, is a matter which will take a little Within a fortnight no Government could have taken the whole of this immigration position, examined what has been done in the past, ascertained exactly where it stood in relation to the States, Ur. Bruce. its opinion on all that has already been done, and formulated a policy for the future. Yet that is exactly what is suggested should have been done. The suggestion is absurd. The Government propose to consider the whole question of dmmigration. At the conference with the States, to which I have already referred, we propose to review all that has been done up to date, the agreements entered into with the three States concerned, the position of the British Government in respect to the matter, and the assistance it is prepared to give. When we meet the House, and set out our polioy, we hope to be able to say clearly aud exactly how we propose to bring about a steady flow of settlers. There is much talk about its necessity, but we find that there are really few people who pay much attention to it generally, and very few who consider particularly how the result which they desire may be brought about. The finances of the Commonwealth and of the States will form another matter for consideration at the Conference. The Commonwealth, and each of the States, conducts its own finances, both with regard to revenue and loan. There are too many people in Australia who seem to mem- think that Commonwealth and State the finances are entirely separated. The The credit of Australia is the credit of the Commonwealth and of all, the States. honourable It will be for us to try to insure that our finances throughout the whole They country shall be conducted on the very with best possible basis, because a weakness in any link is a source of weakness in the whole chain of our national credit. The necessity for our credit today being placed upon the very best possibli© basis will become apparent to all when the Conference is held. I do not propose to set people out the figures at this stage, but the Commonwealth authorities will place before the Conference the full and exact immi- position concerning existing loan commitments-no t riie loan commitments of any one State, or of the Commonwealth alone, but of Australia as a whole. We intend also to set out details of the loans which are to be converted between the time. present date and 1930. It will be an excellent thing that Australia's national position, for once at any rate, should be presented as a whole, so that we may all take stock of the real facts, and performed ceive precisely where we stand. facts, when they shall have heen made known, will, I think, prove rather ill uminating. At the Conference we shall have to deal also with the question of the future borrowing policy of Australia. The best policy i u the interests of Australia as a whole would be to have one borrowing authority. The next point is that we should have a uniform basis for raising loans. At present a quite impossible position exists. Commonwealth has laid down definitely as its policy that it will not issue tax-free loans; the States today are issuing tax-free loans. The Commonwealth, while it does not tax State loans, taxes its own loans, and the result is that the whole of the moneys available for investment by people with large incomes will inevitably flow into the tax-free loans. These are the people who should largely provide our income tax, and who should help materially to-support the Government under which they live and have protection. That obligation they can avoid by investment in tax-free loans. Such a state of affairs is altogether wrong, and cannot continue. A loan is supposed to be so issued that .every individual subscriber will get the same return, but as matters stand those possessed of . large incomes are getting a much greater return than smaller investors.",29
62,Mr CHARLTON,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,Sav e any estimates been made of the amount of revenue which we are losing owing to these State loans being tax free?,31
63,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"No , but the Commoneconomic and unsound. wealth loses very heavily.",31
64,Mr CHARLTON,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Bot h lose, matter of fact.",31
65,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"That is so; bu t the Commonwealth is the more heavily penalized. We must deal with this matter. I think, too, that t.he question of arriving at a uniform basis in respect of sinking funds for Australian loans should be tackled with a view to settletion ment. There is great work to be done by a Conference such as has been procannot posed, and it is certain that the future actions of the Commonwealth Governpossible ment will depend to a considerable tent upon the decisions which we arrive at in the Conference. We shall have to deal with various phases of duplication of public activities. Those The duplication of taxing authorities is a familiar subject. For a long time endeavours have been made to secure some method by which this might be done away with. I do not propose now to outline what has been done in the past in this direction, or in the hope of securing relief; but during the whole of the thirteen or fourteen months in which I was at the Treasury I did all in my power to arrive at soine settlement. A The satisfactory basis has not yet been secured, bu t the Commonwealth authorities propose to put forward definite propositions for discussion. Another inatter in regard to which the policy of the Government must depend ujion the outcome of the Conference is that of public health. The Government hold very clear views upon the subject. We believe that public health and its preservation are among the most important questions with which we are faced. They are of such paramount importance, indeed, that they should be dealt with on a national basis. We shall be prepared to come to a working arrangement with the States, but we do not wish to carry on in existing circumstances; for that would simply mean further duplication and more waste of time and effort. The consideration of electoral arrangements need not be dwelt upon now, but that question must also come forward. Specific arrangements are already in operation in two of the States; but for the Commonwealth and the States generally to carry on as at present is unThere will be still another matter for as a the Conference; and, with respect to it , whether that gathering can provide afinal solution, must remain, of course, to be seen. I refer to the application of science to industry. There is, under the control of the Commonwealth Government today, an Institute of Science and Industry. That the practical applicaof science to industry is imperative - if we are to be a progressive country- . be denied. The difficulty, however, is how to apply it upon the best basis. The operations of the exInstitute are restricted. It has had no may opportunity to accomplish the work which should be done. That it should have been restricted, however, was only right, for the reason that in this realm, again, there is duplication of effort.. The whole question is a national one, and should not be approached independently by each State. It must be handled by the States and the Commonwealth in conjunction.",31
66,Mr GUEGOKY,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,I hope the Government will not try to centralize too much.,32
67,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"I am not suggesting that, but that we should have a method of co-operation. I a.m against centralization. I favour co-operation and the avoidance of duplicated effort, for only in that way can we hope to achieve anything. The Government will be prepared to seriously bring forward proposals, and to embody their outcome in 'their policy - provide d that we can arrange with the States to do away with overlapping. Thus, again, the policy of the Government depends upon what arrangements we may be able to make at the Conference. ' Also, in respect of the collection of statistics, we ought to be able to arrange that there shall not be a continuance of duplication. One further subject is that of the River Murray Agreement and the basis for the development of the whole of the Murray Valley. Commonwealth and States are involved in. the scheme for the looking of the river, and are involved also in the greater part of the plans of settlement proceeding in the Murray Valley. ""We must discuss the whole business in order to arrive at a considered policy. Another matter-agai n depending uponwhat arrangementswe miay be able to make with the States--ha s to dowith securing uniformity of railway gauge. The question is difficult,, but surely every man will agree that it would have been eminently desirable to have all. our railwaysuniformly constructed, and that all fu-tua-e lines, should be. of similar gauge-. Further, I think that all. thinking men will agree that at some time uniformity of gauge must be. brought about throughout the continent. ""We must meet the States and consider the existing financial position, taking stock of the obligations which both Commonweallth and States have entered upon.. When we have that picture clearly before us, we should be able to consider what practical steps may be taken. We must lay down some definite basis; and, if we are not going to proceed with active work a.t once, something, must be done to prevent or minimize ever-increasing losses. It must be remembered, however, that, while the Commonwealth pays one-fifth, the States will be called upou to meet four-fifths of the burden. This is a question for the States to decide in the light of their financial position. They must determine at what pace we shall proceed, and obviously the Government's policy must depend upon the outcome of the Conference to be held with representatives of the States. On the question of industrial relations, I do not think there is any one, not excepting members of the Opposition, who does not agree that a dual authority is undesirable, and is leading to very serious 'difficulties in Australia today. We have the State tribunals and the Federal tribunal side by side, and neither the employer nor the employee can arrive at finality. It is a position intolerable to both sides. I am not saying anything about the principle of arbitration, or the methods that should be adopted; I am-' merely speaking of the respective spheres of theOommonwealth and the States in. the matter. The first thing' we have to do is to determine these sphereSj. and that isa question, which will have to be considered by representatives of the States and of. the Commonwealth when they meet one another.",32
68,Mr CHARLTON,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,-That question was. practically settled - between the States and the Commonwealth during the last Parliament. The present G'overnment intends to whittle away the powers of the Commonwealth.,32
69,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"That is j ust what one (expects, my friend to say; hut it is not. true. The desire is to. arrive at a. common basis of understanding, which will mark the arena in which, the two authorities shall operate. It is said, by some people that this involves the question of State rights. It does' nothing of the sort.. It concerns the whole of our industrial order' and our industrial peace, and it is equally as important for the employee as for the employer. We may be able to settle that question in negotiation with the States. It must be settled, and it is again a matter in which the Government's policy has to ""depend upon whatever arrangement we can make at the forthcoming Conference. I am trybe ing to point out the impossibility of pre? sen ting a complete policy today, when there are so many questions which we have to clear up between the Commonbefore wealth and the .'States. . ""We do not pose to submit our policy piece-meal, but as a whole. Another question which is of great portance, but in regard to which the vernment cannot place its policy on the table today, is the administration of Post Oflice. I am prepared to tell the House how far the Government has gone, and what we hope to do. I cannot state what will be finally evolved as the ment's policy. That will take time, I can announce the basis on which we gard to Boards. stand. Everybody 'in this country believes that it is vital for the development - of Australia that we should have efficient and cheap communication. That is an obvious fact. The Government believes in that, - and proposes so to - conduct the Post Office that it .will give a maximum of .service at is miiiimum of cost. now Ekst, Jiow.etter, we have to put .the Post Office finances on is jpjsoper basis. Those honourable members who heard all the Budget speech last year will rerealized member that I dealt witli the queshelp tion of the amount which the Post Office suggest. owed to the taxpayer. Most of my critics tried ,to point out that the taxpayer money .to .the Post Office, but I .think that most tof them, having now had an opporphonic, tunity to 'examine - the figures and distake cover the actual ^position, realise (that Post Office has had from .the taxpayer something like .£7,0.00,0.0.0 more than earned. The Government proposes leave that £7,000,000 with the Post Office, .but ito charge interest - upon it . That he perfectly fair, but for itihe. future surplus ear.nings of the Post Office will be retained by the Post Office, without payment of interest. We propose proceed with the programme of - capital expenditure which - was laid down last year to bring the Post date, hut we also contemplate giving the Postmaster-General a little assistance in the carrying out of this very difficult and also in the ordinary administration of his Department. It is proposed create a Board, hut honourable members need have no apprehension that it will a Board which will cost a fabulous sum of money. It will advise the Minister. It will meet at regular intervals, and will assist him with any matters he brings it. It will consist of the-engineer prowhom we recently borrowed from - the British Post 'Office to assist with the constructional work, a member of the ordinary .administration of the Post 'Office, imand an outside business man, who will he Gobrought in, not as a permanent employee of the Post Office, but to sit on the Board the when it meets once or twice a week, according to - the Minister's requirements.",32
70,Mr CHARLTON,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,It appears that the GovernGovernment proposes to continue - the but policy of the last Government with re,33
71,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"That is not so, but I would suggest that my honourable friend should think over the position in regard to the Post Office. This is a great activity for one man to operate. It is the biggest business in the country, and, in addition to carrying on its ordinary operations, is launching out into an expenditure of £9.,0D.0„00.0,, covering a period of three years, in great constructional work. If - this is taken into account it will '.be that - the Minister needs a little and assistance of the character I owed - The Government's policy is quite - clear in regard %o the reduction of postal, iteleand telegraphic rates, but it will time to state .the - details - of what ..can the he actually done. The 'Government proposes to reduce rates as far as it can while it has still making the revenue - of - the Post to Office - meet the - expenditure, and while also continuing and extending the faciliwill ties which are now given to sparsely .any populated, districts. The Government is determining how far the rates oan be reduced^ without placing us in the position the of not being able to make our revenue to and expenditure balance, or compelling us to curtail or relinquish the extension of non-paying facilities which we give in Office up to the out-back country. As honourable members know, the porttask, folio of Repatriation has been abolished; but repatriation activities proper-re to patriation itself, medical services, and pensions must still go on, and will be administered together. There is the further activity of advances for soldier settlement, which the States actually conduct, but which we control. The Commission which was established will be continued, and the whole of the repatriation activities will be placed under the direct control of the Treasurer. Avill be a Minister to deal with themSenator Crawford-and the position will not be altered in the slightest degree so far as the care of the soldiers isconcerned. The different activities will not bo scattered, as has been suggested by some people. The ""War Service Homes administration is being transferred to the Works and Railways Department. think honourable members will realise after a little consideration that that is the proper Department for it . have heard a suggestion made that the Government should appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the past history of the War Service Homeb Branch. The Government does not propose to do anything of the sort. It proposes to do its own work in the first in stance. It will examine the whole position, and when it meets the House will present the whole facts to honourable members. If there is anything requiring a Royal' Commission or Committee of the House, the Government itself will propose it , and will ask the House to appoint it . It is the duty of the Government, however, to look into the position first, and form its own opinion of what action should be taken. In regard to repatriation generally, I only wish to say that the Government will , as past Governments have attempted to do, honour our obligations to the soldiers. seems to have been a suggestion that that is one thing we have not done. The suggestion is not true. We are maintaining today, and ' will continue to maintain, our policy of preference to soldiers. The Government has quite realized, and I think every thinking person must have done likewise, that the best possible treatment must b© meted out to those who are old, infirm, and sick. This question will be considered by the Government, will announce quite clearly and definitely what its policy is. It is a matter which obviously must be looked into, and no Mr Bruce. Government should be asked to declare what it intends to do in an important matter of this kind within a fortnight of taking office. There is one thing which I , can promise will be done at once. While at the Treasury I investigated a number of anomalies and hardships occurring under the regulations which govern There the administration of old-age and invalid pensions. The investigation is now finalized, and within a very short period we ought to be in a position to announce a very substantial relaxation of some of these admittedly harsh regulations, and a removal of some of the anomalies which exist at the present time. I Dr MALONEY - The Government can dothat before the House meets. I Mr Bruce - The r e is another very wide' question in which every one is interested, namely, economic and efficient administration. The Government believes in that, and will do everything in its power to' bring it about. Mere pious expressions as to what one is going to do with regard to efficiency and economy are of very little, use; the Government must be judged upon what it actually does. It does no more now than give the country the assurance that it realizes the absolute necessity for both efficiency and economy. I do not wish, however, to be misunderstood. I am convinced that the country does not desire economy that is brought about by injustice. The Government is determined to do all that is possible to secure efficiency ancl economy, but it is certainly not going to achieve those objects by disregarding all justice and equity in respect of those There in the employ of the Commonwealth. W it h that one qualification, the Government will do everything in its power to effect these two ends. As to the practical steps that are being taken, the Government' will proceed immediately with the appointment of the Public Service Board of three Commissioners recommended by the Economies Commission, and provided for in the Public Service Act. The-,Tariff is another question of conwhich siderable interest. I have seen it suggested in a number of quarters that this is a Pree Trade Government. It is nothing of the sort. Neither of the parties constituting it is a Free Trade party. The position is that both the parties which compose the Government believe, as parties, in Protection. The Country party believes in Protection for the produce of the Commonwealth. The Nationalist party also believes in Protection.",33
72,Mr CHARLTON,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,The honourable gentleman's statement as to the Country party is not in accordance with what that party propounded in the last Parliament.,35
73,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Tih e honourable member seems to have in mind the utterances of one individual member. The Government recognises that Protection, is the accepted policy of Australia, and it has<no intention, as some seem to think, of tearing up the Tariff. The Government, however, believes that with regard to our policy of Protection some great factors have to be taken into account. One of these is that the most vital question with which we are faced today is the sale of our surplus primary production in oversea markets. I think that view is generally accepted by even the strongest Protectionists. The Government realizes the importance of the question of the sale of our surplus production. It has heard many suggestions that owing to the duties on agricultural machinery and fertilizers, our production is becoming so costly in primary industries that it is possible to dispose of our surplus in the markets of the world. We propose to refer the question of the duty upon agricultural machinery and fertilizers to the Tariff Board, and to request, it to report as to its effect upon the industry concerned. That report will be submitted to this House, and no action will be taken without the concurrence of the Honse. I think all will agree that it is only right and proper that we should have before us a considered report upon the effects of these duties on the great primary industries.",35
74,Mr A GREEN,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,Will the Prime Minister include 'in the reference to the Tariff Board the question of the duties on mining requisites?,35
75,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"The honourable member may have any matter referred to the Board; but I am now announcing that the particular matter with which we are going to ask it to deal relates to the duties on agricultural machinery and fertilizers. The next question with which I propose to deal is that of sugar. The Government recognises that it is vital to Australia that the white sugar industry of the Commonwealth should be safeguarded against the competition of blackgrown sugar, and it proposes to take whatever steps are necessary to safeguard it. I think that, in that determination, the Government will have the support of not a part, but the whole, of the people of Australia. We all realise that the question involves two principles. It involves, first of all, a principle which Australia has adopted, namely, that its industries must he protected against unfair outside competition. We have even protected ourselves in this regard against our own kinsmen of New Zealand. That being so, surely we are going to - protect ourselves against the blackgrown sugar industry of other countries. This question involves, secondly, the great principle of the maintenance of a White Australia. The sugar industry which has sprung up in the tropical parts of Australia is today of vast importance. Millions of pounds have been invested in it, and it gives employment to a great number of men. To destroy the industry, would be to strike a vital blow at the imwhole policy of a White Australia. In the action which the Government proposes to take to safeguard the industry, I think we will have the support of the whole of the people, but whether the means we propose to adopt to this end will meet with united support is another matter. During the Avar, and the post-war period, protection was afforded to the sugar industry of Queensland by means of an agreement which expires on 30th June next. That agreement the Government does not propose to renew. It is an agreement which might have been suitable in the extraordinary and abnormal circumstances which then preA-ailed; but it cannot be contended that it is right today to give to one iudustry treatment that Ave are not prepared to accord to another. That we are not prepared to do. What we propose is to deal ivith the sugar industry upon the basis on which Ave deal with every other industry, and. that is through the medium, of the Customs Tariff, The question ""of the amount, of the Tariff will have to he declared by us in our policy, but we shall certainly not arrive at a conclusion rhat the present import duty is right, or that it is too high or too Tow, without a very exhaustive inquiry, and without satisfying ourselves that we a-re he-Ming the scales evenly between those who produce sugar in Australia, find are entitled to protection, and those throughout the Commonwealth who consume sugar.",35
76,Mr RICHARD EOSUKB,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,What f r u it in-its relation to sugar?,36
77,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"That is one of the most difficult problems with , which we arefaced, and one with regard to which the Government will have, to declare its intentions - Under the agreement, which expires on SOth June next,, arrangementswere made by which sugar that was required for the processing of Australian manufactures for export and. sale overseas, was granted a rebate.. That was done in order that our manufacturers of jam, preserved, fruit,, or anything else might be ahle to compete on. equal terms in the world's markets.. The question, as to what action, the Government is going to take so as to still safeguard those in dustries of ours which are dependent; ou sugar for the export trad:e will have to be considered and declared by us. ^The amending of the Constitution is another matter as to which I fihinfc we are mil agreedsome action has to be taken. The suggestion has been made that we should lra.ve a Convention, aind it is very possible that a Conventionwill, be held. But at this moment-befor e I can officially declare the Government policy - I am not. going to say how the amendment of the Constitution should' be carried out'. I shall only say that an early 1 opportunity will be taken to deal with it . Mr RCCHA'RD POSTER - A b the forth earning. Conference of State' Premiers'?",36
78,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Individua l might be dealt with at that Conference, butt I am referringnow to the whole question of the amendment of the Constitution'. I propose now to deal, with the Commonwealth Government. Shipping Linei Honourable members, know what is , the' position today. They know that the. Commonwealth Government Line is in exactly the same position: as-that occupied by every other shipping line in. the world. The values of sliirjping have derpredated enormously, and all tonnage which waseither purchased' or built during the inflation period represents - today a very heavy loss to the owners. I would remind a number of peoplei n this country that the Commonwealth Government Shipping Line is not the only one that is faced with heavy losses, owing to about depreciation and to the fall which hasoccurred in the world's markets since the war ceased. It is, however,, a direct problem: with which we are faced. The 1 Government is now taking action totry to' av.riv-e,' in the first place, at what is the truevalue of the shipping we own' today. When w.e-- arrive atthab value the present, value will have to bewritten down. It is impossible to carry on withour ships, capitalized, at. a value they could not realise in. the open - market. Mr Larkin, the manager of, the Line;, is coming; to Australia, - wery shortly,, and advantage will be taken of his visit tofinally decidethe whole question.. At themoment the Trea*sury and the Line accountants are busily engivged getting the figures into order.,, so bhat,. when the action, to be ta&en by the Government is detexmined upow, we - shall' - be able to act without delay. Mu. PEN-TON - Has the Prime Minister anything to. sa.y with regard to the control of the Line ?'",36
79,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"The present Government adopts"" the view of the late Government, that the Line cannot continuet'o be controlled' By one. man moreor lfese under, the Government. Theconfirol must be separate and free from' all 1 political influence. The question; of shipbuilding' is anothermatte* of very con'sideTahle' interest toAustralia today. Commonpoints wealth shipbuilding was. started during the war. It was carried on by the Government as a national undertaking; bnt the late Government declared! that it did! not propose to go on' with Govermnentowned shipbuilding yards or to carry on the Government shipbuilding .policy. To that policy tihe preseut Government adheres. Mx. MATHEWS - That is .knell of shipbuilding in Australia.",36
80,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"The death-knell, so far as 'Government shipbuilding is concorned, was sounded .long ago. The question that the Government is facing - now is whether it is possible to carry on - shipbuilding activities in Australiawhether we can induce amy one to take up ithe industry. 'The industry, if it cari 'be kept going here, is of the greatest importance. It involves 'employment, wud, if we Gould establish it , it would involve increasing employment; 'but there is one thing we are not going to do, and that is to carry on the .industry of producing ships at a heavy loss - spect I hawe ranged - over a lar.ge numlber a iof subjects, and I think that anybody - who has .listened tto m y 'remarks .must realise - tfhait 'the .claim made hy the mover iof the .amendment, uhat the Growelauneitt should have -.produced their policy inside three weeks, is nothing but a demand 'for the impossible. I - have tried to indicate some of .the problems with .which \we - are faced. Except in respect of one or .two, I have not said how we propose to solve them, because that is impossible without due consideration. I have not stated the Government's policy-it is impossible to do so; 'but if 'honourable members derive any satisfaction from attac'king us On that score, they aro welcome to continue doing so. We - are 'not to be rushed into declaring our policy 'before we have had an opportunity of - reviewing our l i a bilities and of surveying --all those activities which were necessary during the war, but which are .now gradually disappearing. When we have a chance to review all the circumstances we shall be i u a position to visualize the requirements of Australia as a whole. And having done that, we shall meet the House, and set out our policy in regard to them in the fullest detail. One other thing I wish to say before concluding, and that is that, whilst 'toalia is confronted with great problems, it is in a better position to than as any other oountry in the world. - It is i u .a unique position, and has unique opportunities. But as the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) does not approve of my declaring the merits the death- of Australia, I shall merely refer honourable' members to some of the speeches .which I made recently. II have not, however., previously referred to the present 'financial position. When I presented the .last Budget. I .estimated a certain revenue for the - current financial year. That figure will be exceeded. I .estimated the expenditure a.t a ceitain amount; that estimate will be reduced. Thus we have an assurance of increased revenue and reduced expenditure, and at the end of this financial year, notwithstanding the remission of £3,000,000 of taxation in accordance with the last Budget, we shall have, I believe, a 'trigger - surplus than we - had on - the '30th June, 1922. 'That proshould be gratifying to all - of «us, .and 'certainly shows 'that Amsfa-alia. is - in a very favourable .position. I have - tried to convince honourable members opposite ^hat their demand for our .policy at this stage is - per'fectily ludicrous. 'Of course, I have not - conwinced 'them, and I realise that 'daring - the next few-days we shall hear more about the iniquity - of Tthe Government i u not having turned - out a - policy - at express - speed. We must remember, however, that these speeches are merely intended, in -6he words >of ithe mover of >the amendment, - as '-' a - poster .and placard "" to icatch the ;aittention of the - people. Mr E. RILEV. - What else is the Prime Minister's speech 1",37
81,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"I have been tryin g to impress upou - the honourable member - some of the great problems - of Australia which lie, as a legislator, must help us to solve. I am certainly not attempting to d r a f t anything in the nature of a political placard. The amendment is quite 'unreasonable:; the Government could not possibly - have produced a policy in Hihe time which has elapsed since it was formed. 'The indication I have given of ; the problems with which we propose to deal should be sufficient answer to the charge made against us, and my assurance that we shall present our policy to A-usthe country at the earliest possible moment, should satisfy even the honsolve them orable member for Bourke.",37
82,Mr SCULLIN,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Yarra) [5.28] - The Prime Minister in his concluding remarks really supplied an answer to his own argument. He said that he had not given the House the policy of the Government. There was no need for him to have made such an admission. He ranged over a large number of subjects, but made no attempt to give the House or the country an idea of the policy of the Government. The reason is not far to seek; the Government cannot agree upon a policy. At the outset of my remarks I may be permitted to adopt the usual course of congratulating the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply. Although they are new members they made very creditable speeches, having gard to the fact that they had nothing to talk about. There was not in the Governor General's Speech a hint or suggestion, let alone a text, upon which to base their remarks. I sympathize with them; it was nothing short of refined cruelty to ask two new members to move and second an Address-in-Reply to a speech which was a blank- I might almost say a "" blankety blank."" In the circumstances they did .admirably. May I also congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) upon having made a very long speech without telling the House or the country anything. That is a task which requires a good deal of skill, and for one who has not been very long in Parliament the Prime Minister acquitted himself admirably. I noticed that there was a tone of complaint in his speech. I pass over the superior tone because the honourable gentleman cannot help it, and we are accustomed to it, but I take exception to his complaint against honourable members on this side doing anything that will embarrass the Government. I remind ham of his famous speech at Maryborough, in which he said, "" If Mr Hughes be thrown out I will go out with him, and we shall put up a stiff fight against those who attempt to run the Government of the country."" I pass by the boast-fulness of that threat, and the breach of his pledge to go out of office if Mr Hughes was put out-h e did not go out, but took his chief's job-and I draw attention to this other aspect of the statement at Maryborough, that if he, Stanley Melbourne Bruce, with Mr. Hughes were put out of the Government, those two together would put up a stiff fight against anybody ""who attempted to run the Government of the country."" He should not now complain if we, on this side of the House, put up' a stiff fight against those who are not even "" attempting to run the Government."" Surely we, as representatives of the majority of the people of Australia, are entitled to make a fight against a Government assuming office and immediately seeking to get Parliament into recess for four months without giving the slightest indication of how the country is to be governed. The Speech delivered by the Governor-Genereral is a blank; we are asked to take the Government on trust, and ask no questions. The Prime Minister charged the honourable member for Bourke with talking wild platitudes in regard to the socialization of industry and those other awful ^ proposals which he said would bring rain to Australia. I remind the honourable gentleman that long before he entered politics the proposals submitted by the Labour party were similarly described. When we faced the electors in 1910 and placed before them a definite and concrete programme our proposals were described as a wild revolution, which would ruin Australia, plunge the country over a precipice, break the marriage tie, and destroy the sanctity of the home. Every evil that the imagination could conjure up was predicted as certain to happen if the Labour Government should attain to the Treasury bench. The Labour party was nevertheless intrusted with the reins of govermnent. Por three years we had a majority in this House - ancl in another place, and, so far from Australia being ruined by our administration, those were some of the best years of prosperity that the country has known. So satisfied with our legislation were the people that there has been no attempt by those who had been prophets of evil to wipe our enactments off the statute-book. The Prime Minister said, also that if the present Government had no other policy than to keep the Labour party out of office the combination of parties would be justified. That is merely a policy of negation. He went on to say, repeating the platitudes that we hear so often, that he had great admirationand respect for the men who used to be in the Labour party, for those Labour Ministers who placed on the statute-book some admirable measures, and he gave his meed of praise to the legislation of Labour during 1910-13. In what political camp was the honourable gentleman when Labour was doing those things? Where were he and his colleagues of today, when we were placing upon the statute-book those admirable laws which have stood by the country i u its time of stress and trial? They were assailing us as bitterly then as they are today. Every one of those measures was described as involving r u into Australia. How, those gentlemen profess to have great respect and admiration for the men who did those things, but not for the present Labour party. When Labour was governing and legislating so admirably, where were those members of the Millions Olub whom the Prime M i nister addressed in Sydney, who cheered him as the representative of the new Government, and who supply the funds with which honourable members opposite contest their elections? There was just the same bitter hostility to the party that represents the workers and Democrats of Australia as there is at the present time. It is said that the Labour party has changed, but I remind the Prime Minister that the majority of those who are in the Labour party today were in the House when the measures to which he refers were placed on the statute-book. Many of those who now sit on the Opposition benches heljjed to formulate the programme which the Prime Minister described to us as admirable. But it is said that a change came over us, and that, although we are the same men, our methods are different. Even allowing that to be true, I ask the Prime Minister, and those who sit behind him, whether he will say that the men who left the Labour party in 1916, and who had helped in that legislation the honourable gentleman eulogized today, have changed. They were of the old Labour party, and they had been welcomed into the bosom of the auti-Labour party as everything that was good ancl noble and patriotic; but, as a reward for leaving the Labour party, and thus smashing it , they have been sent into political oblivion by the people. There are now only two of those members left in the House, ancl one who was acclaimed throughout Australia as the greatest man the Empire knew ha|s been thrown overboard, since he was discredited before the country. The day will come when those whom the member I refer to left, and who have a majority of the Australian people behind them, will govern the country and give the people the same, sort of admirable legislation as in 1910-13, and this legislation in its turn will no doubt be eulogized by even its critics. The Prime Minister repeated the old gibe of 1910 and previous years-the gibe that is used when our critics are not "" game "" to attack the real definite proposals of the Labour party-namely , that we are dominated from outside. What does that mean ? We who represent the great toiling masses of Australia share with them the responsibility of shaping our programme in the' interests of the country. We are not dominated by them, nor they by us, but we are here as their representatives endeavouring to give effect to the programme on which we are mutually agreed. I would sooner, however, be dominated-if there be any domination-h y the great rank and file of the honest men and women who are the workers of this country than by the Millions Ciub, Flinders!aue, or the money magnates of Australia. The Prime Minister, after making this general charge of domination from outside, placed before us a long list of the problems which faced Australia - I remind the honourable gentleman that the present Government have not inherited these problems from Labour Governments,, but from his own oolleagues and party. All these financial and economic difficulties have been handed down by anti-Labour Governments, and these difficulties the Prime Minister and his Government cannot surmount or deal with on their own authority and responsibility, but have to go cap in hand to the State Governments in order to ascertain how they must be met. The Prime Minister was very interesting when' he said that the Government and the party behind them were unitedthat they were one in common ideals, and were banded together on a common basis. This, as I have said, was very interesting in view of the emphasis laid by the other head ai the' Government (Dr Earle Page) on his contention that the Government is Ministei-. composed of two separate entities. If are .too judge by - the - Governor General'sPrime Speech, the Government ought, I think, be described as two distinct nonentities. But it is contended that the 'Government and bheir supporters are united common basis. They pretended in other the last Parliament to be antagonistic. What change has come over them? If they are one on a commonbasis, then surely, in the name of democratic gotions? vernment, the people are entitled to know gotiations? what is the basis. We are not .asking the Government to solve all the enumerated problems in a day-we are not - even askment ing the Government to settle them this session-but we demand, as the represenpolicy tatives of the people, - that the basis which this fusion was formed shall made known. That is information .which ought to have been givenin the Governor General's Speech, and that it I has not been 'given is the gravamen of public .our - charge. What - is this basis ? What compromises were made'? What election pledges were necessarily broken in order to 'bring the fusionabout? There has never heen an .election fight in which there was, at any rate, so much pretence of - antagonism as that shown between the two parties who are now sitting together in - support .of this Government. Unless this antagonism was all sham I want know what compromises - were made, what pledges .sacrificed, what public policy thrown - aside in order .to bring .about fusion - If the uniou is based on policy - and it should mot be hased on anything else--what is that policy? This people - of Australia have not beentoldthe public and Parliament are ignored. The Prime Minister ""himself, before sat down, said that 'he had not given the House his policy; and certainly he h.as not given us the basis on this Government and party are Why .should the secrecy and mystery served during the negotiations which place for the formation of this composite Government be maintained in regard the spolicy? I remind the Prime Minquestion ister and his - Government that this liamentary institution of ours is not secret society. The time has arrived when the people should be told what Ur. SculUn. been done in their name by their Prime The Governor General'* we Speech is undoubtedly a blank, .and the Minister's reply to the amendment to is a blank cartridge. The honourable gentleman gave - a number of alleged reasons why he did not present a policy on beon a half of the Government. Amongst reasons he gave was that there had not been time to consider a policy; but I ask what were the parties opposite doing during the whole period of the negotiaWhat was the basis of these oieSurely one would think that representative men, when negotiating for the eara-ying ou of the governo'f the country, would consider omo thing first and foremost, namely, (the - to he followed hy the - Government. on But on the admission of the Prime Minbe ister honourable members opposite (did nothing right tip to the imoment of ithe formation - of this .composite Government. t is clear that the negotiations must .hasro beeu .based on .'soniethiing other bhasi - policy. The Prime Minister tells us - bhat there are large pro'blems to face; but 'every 'Government has Harcge /problems to face. Every >Governinient, as - the honourable - member for Bouiike (Mr Anstey) said, from - the beginning of Federation up to the last Parliamen't, was able *to formulate a policy and place' it before Parliament in - a few weeks, although I may add the problems then were - bigger to than .now. The Prime Minister 'enumerated many problems in order 'to make them look like an array of work to 'be - the accomplished; but .the honourable gentleman admitted that he merely indicated the problems without indicating any the solution. He may, perhaps, have made one or two exceptions in this regard; 'hut, eveu in the case of these, there was he nothing .definite. As to the problem' yet of the Territory, we were merely told that it could not be developed which by agriculture, but that the work united. must be done on pastoral and obmining lines; file .honourable gentletook man did not tell us how that development was to be carried out. The proto blem of transport, which is a large agitating ""the people just now, parwas mentioned, but nothing was said as a to how it was to be solved. As to 'the Federal Territory, we were simply told has that the work would be ""pressed on."" Immigration is one of the burning tions' of the day, and the shocking way i which deluded people are brought to this country is a. grave scandal. a word, was said as to whether this, ful, policy is to be continued, or whether as most inadequate? ib is to be modified and work provided for' our own people before workers' from which will be considered."" overseas are dumped down here. IWe weremerely told thatimmigration would be ""pressed, o n "" - not a word as it to the method. The question of Federal be considered."" and' State finance has been discussed many times since Federation, but the Prime Minister did not tell us anything as what was to be done in the future. Are we not entitled to know what views the Pree Trade Government. Government are going to express when they meet, the representatives of the State Governments in Conference ? Has this Parliament. not a right to discuss thoseviews ? I submit that we ought to have placed before us the proposals which the Government intend to submit to the Conference. Until today, never heard anything of these subjectsor proposals-, although I think they mighttection very, well have been set oub in the Governor General's Speech. One might imagine that the Conference is to meetCountry round a table, and the representatives sit there until "" the spirit "" moves them. The> questions of health and science, uniform railway gauge-, industrial relaway tionsand so forth, are all dependent on the States for their solution. The Primewith 1 Ministertold us that these problems not besolved in a day, but, as I have said before, we do not ask that they I shall be-; all we desire to know is how the Government proposes to try to solveaire tliem. We heard nothing from the honourable gentleman but platitudes about tlieimportanceof Empire trade. Should the» Opposition, and also honourable memmembers of the' Country party. bersopposite-, be content with that sort of thingfrom the Leader of the Governof ment-? As to the postal rates; the Primebe Minister told us' that the Government policyisi clear - tha b therates, will beredefinite duced toa point which will', insurethe-revenue equalling the expenditure.

I could not imagine any Government in Australia calling itself a In fact, no Ministry would' dare to sit on the Treasury bench and so designate themselves; But there are brands of Protection, and some brands - are little better than Pree Trade would be to the industries of Australia. The Prime Minister has told us we that the National party and the Country party are one on the question of. Proand Free Trade. If theNational wing of this Composite Government hold the same views on the Tariff as the party do, the industries of Australia will be in. for a mighty bad time, so far as Protection is concerned.

86,Mr GROOM,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,It is because of the ral prosperity.,42
87,Mr SCULLIN,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"That is not so. The honourable member, who represents a Queensland constituency, knows full well that if the Colonial Sugar Refining Company could get back to the days, when they were untrammelled and uncontrolled, they could work their own sweet will on the growers, and force them to sweat the workers in the industry. It is no wonder the value of their shares is going sky-high at such a prospect. The Prime Minister says that he will not say one word as to what the Government propose to do upon that most important matter, the amendment of the Constitution, in which the people of Australia are so vitally interested. He has indicated that the Government have made up their minds upon this question, but why is it shrouded in mystery, and why are the people not told what the Government have at the back of their minds on the matter of the proposal to tear up the Constitution or alter it? It needs a great deal of alteration, but I can conceive of its being amended in directions that would not be progressive, but, on the other hand, would be of a most retrograde character. sonnel of the Government would lead me to expect that anything would be likely to .happen in the nature of retrograde steps. Now, having enumerated all these things about which we are told nothing, I come back to the big question confronting Australia today, the most serious problem of unemployment, which, day after day, as our amendment states, is being accentuated by the influx of unemployed from other countries. Yesterday, an honourable member .of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister whether he had noted a' statement in a cablegram published in the press that a dangerous and notorious housebreaker in B r it a in of the had been let off by a Court because it was stated he was being sent to Australia. I do not say that because this appeared in a cablegram in a newspaper, it is true; but if the matter was regarded as of sufficient importance to cable out to Australia it was also sufficiently important to cause the Government toi take some note of it . The answer made by the Prime M i nister was that he ""knew nothing about gene- dt, indicating that the Government are not watching these matters and are prepared to let any one be dumped into Australia. What is the experience of these men when they land here ? If they are lucky they are sent away to a job in a country district at £ 1 or £ 1 59. per week. In the midst of the harvest some of them got £ 1 10s. per week. These arc the "" good wages "" guaranteed to them. But when they have been at work foi a few months and have become a little skilled, if they ask for a rise they are sacked and new immigrants are put in their places. We see statements in the press by immigration officers and by the State Ministers in charge of immigration, that Australia is absorbing all the immigrants who arrive. It is true that in most cases they are absorbed, but in a few months they are transferred to the unemployment market. I have met scores of these men stranded in Melbourne, seeking employment. In many cases they are getting preference over Australian-born. I contest the statement of the Prime Minister that the policy of the Government is preference to soldiers. Theiir policy, as carried out by mostof the commercial houses of Australia with which the Prime Minister The per- and his colleagues are associated, is that of preference to imanigrants wherever possible, very often evom to the extent of sacking meu to make room for them. The unemployed problem in this country is seriou'si, and is being added to, because the Government are continuing the policy of dumping immigrants from other parts of the world, while they are, at the same time, parting with (industries that would absorb them. For instance', they have closed the Harness Factory, which, since it was established in 1911 with eighty men, has been doing excellent work, and is still capable of doing good work. It could supply the requirements of the Tramways Board and various other bodies. It s only crime is not that it is not being carried on successfully or doing splendid work, but that it is entering into competition with private enterprise as carried on by people who are supplying the party funds fortius Government. Consequently it has to go. The Woollen Mills are being disposed of for the same reason. One of the leaders of the party opposite, in discussing the question of the disposal of the Woollen Mills, said that he would also sell the railways of Australia under the same conditions. What are we to get from the Government? They are silent in regard to most important questions discussed last session for months, scandals so smellful that the Government responsible for them were discredited in the country and defeated. We have not heard a word about the wireless scandal, that impudent attempt on the part of a monopoly to get control of public money. Not a word has been said about the War Service Homes 1 word has been said about many matters first of all exposed in this House and later on condemned by the people of Australia. The things that led to the defeat of the National Government were virtuously condemned by members of the Country party', but the members of that party are now silent-no w that they are sharing - the loaves and fishes with the Ministers responsible. I would like to ask the head of this Composite Governmenb and hiis copartners if there is any agreement as to the Government's policy, because if there is-and there ought to be, otherwise on what basis did the Government come together?-the people ought to have it . There is only one thing that the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) boasted about when he met his own organization. He did not go to them and say, "" Gentlemen, the Country party has won upon the fundamental principles of its policy."" He did not point to anything which he had gained for the farmers during the secret negotiations which he held with the head of the Nationalist party; his only boast was in regard to the important portfolios which he had secured for his colleagues. The managers managed so well that they got a job each! I notice that the most [4] disgruntled men in the party, those who were the sorest, have displaced some of the old men on some of the Committees. By degrees other little things may come along which can be given to other dissatisfied members. These gentlemen posed here as the Simon Pures of politics, yet . the only boast.which they could make was that they had secured this and that portf o l i o ; not that they had secured this measure of reform, this legislation, this alteration of the regulations in the interests of the men who put them therethe men' who sowed the seed, and ploughed the furrow on the land; not a word about the alleviation of the condi- tions of those farmers; nothing .but that the managers secured important portfolios. I think that it is one of the most disgraceful things that has ever happened in the public l if e of Australia. If we cannot be content with their policy - o r the Jack of policy-w e are given to understand that we must be content with the personnel of this Government. I am _ not. going to enter on a personal descripscandals - Not one tion of each qf them, but I will show the opinion of some of the Leaders upon men who now are their colleagues. The honourable member for Bourke today made a quotation which was contradicted by the Prime Minister. The Melbourne Argus, on 3rd November, - reported the present Prime Minister to have said that the Country party was run by paralyzing leaders, men incapable of leading; men who, if they obtained power, would lead the country to disaster. I ask the other half of this Prime Ministership, the Treasurer, seeing - that he has had so many secret negotiations with the Prime Minister during the last few monthsdoes he think that the Prime Minister meant what he said when he described the Leader of the Country party as ""a paralyzing Leader "" ? Did he mean it when he described him as "" a man incapable of leading "" ? Did he mean it when he said that if the Country party obtained power they would - lead the country to disaster? He surely meant it , because such a paragon of all the virtues would not tell a l i e ; he would not attempt to fool or bluff the electors. He must have believed it . To attempt to fool or to bluff the people of this country is not done, or, as the Prime Minister would say, it is not proper. The honourable member for Richmond yesterday told us that there were two. leaders. The Prime Minister today, supported that view, and said, "" Yet are oue."" One Leader of this Govern-' ment described the other as "" a paralyzvelop ing Leader,"" as "" a Leader incapable leading,"" as one who would lead the try to disaster. The impeccable ""Stanley Melbourne"" so described "" the Hon. Earle Christmas Grafton."" Yet to man the Prime Minister has given the control of £30,000,000 of public money. It is extraordinary ! We have not forgotten - the present Treasurer's criticism of the Buclget last year. Nothing more scathing fell the lips of any honourable member in this House than the present Treasurer's critimethods cism of that Budget. Whose Budget? Bruce's Budget. The Country party said that if could only get rid of Hughes, they would do everything. After the secret negotiamost tions, during which the managers were running round the corridors, looking furtively around corners to see if any pressmen were in sight, the one great boast that I heard was, ""We have had a great triumph; we have got rid of Hughes."" I said to one man who made"" this boast, "" We got rid of him six years ago, and you. had nothing but criticism offer then. It is a great triumph now, but it was a tragedy when we-got rid him."" The criticism which was offered, of Hughes' Budget but of Bruce's Budobject, get, by the present Treasurer, was severe. Now they are sitting together, like Siamese twins, on the Treasury benches. Let us see what was the opinion of the present Treasurer regarding the party into which he has brought his party. 29 th November, at the Malvern Town Hall, he made a speech in support of a city lawyer in the interests of the try party of Australia. I quote from the Argus of 30th November. He said, "" The Nationalist party is bound toabandoned. gether by no definite principles."" indefinite, loosely-bound party, without any definite principles, is now united its former alleged antagonists; because, they say, their principles are the same-they are indefinite. I will quote again from a speech delivered by the Treasurer at Bendigo on 1st December, Mr Scullin. which will disclose some beautiful contradictions. He said, "" The Nationalist party's policy is Socialism disguised by we a fig leaf. The Country party do not offer election baits, but we are out to deself-reliance."" After preaching ""the of gospel of self-reliance, he said, "" The counWheat Pool should be financed by the Government. The Government should assist the primary producers."" I agree this with him that the Government should finance the Wheat Pool, and should assist the primary producers; but it is not consistent with his former declaration. The fig-leaf Socialists have now combined with'the Wheat Pool Socialists, and they from arc one in opposition to Socialism. As another sample of the secret adopted by this Government, and its policy of "" smother-up,"" I refer honourable members to the reply given to a"" they question which was asked in this chamber yesterday in relation to one of the serious charges that ever has been made in the history of Australia against an Administration. I am not now vouching for the truth of the charge. All I say is that a newspaper in this country, which is worth powder and shot, deliberately made a statement that the Prime Minister of Australia had sold land of strategic naval value to certain Japanese. to So serious did the ex-Prime Minister consider the charge that he strove to have of the newspaper-proprietors brought under the law governing criminal libel. He not took them before the Court with that but failed in his object. Then he considered the matter to be so serious that he issued a writ for libel, claiming damages amounting to £10,000. The people were awaiting developments; they were wondering what was going to be the On sequel; they wanted to have investigations made so that they might see what truth there was in this serious allegation. CounInstead of going on - with the action, which would have disclosed the falsehood or the truth of the charge, it was Surely it is the province of This the Government to tell us first why it was abandoned, and then to say what to were the circumstances. 'But the Prime Minister only says, "" I am aware of all the circumstances. The Government do not propose to take the action suggested."" The action-which I asked the Prime Minister to take was that he should make a statement to the publio. There may be no t r u th in this business, but surely - the people have a right to head aud another at the back. know the circumstances. If the Governth;s ment are aware of all the circumstances and there is nothing in them., are not people entitled to know all? If there a shadow of t r u th in the serious charge and which became the subject of attempted criminal libel action, then the country is entitled to the facts. It appears to me that the greatest qualification for office possessed by members of the Cabinet is to be found in their euphonious Christian names. The collection of names is really markable, however; and, in this regard, I suggest that a name of especial significance be attached specifically to those now sitting upon the Ministerial mentioned bench who were the Country pan» There managers at the recent secret and stupidly melodramatic conferences. propose that those gentlemen take tq_ themselves the additional name ot ""Jonah,"" because they have been swaling lowed-no t by a whale, however, but sharks. I could not help thinking yesreal terday, as they took their places on that side of the table for the first time, they looked as uncomfortable as an digested meal 1 In the course of his remarks on day, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) sought to give an tration, which would fit this composite unity. Government. ""The honourable member marked that the picture depended on point of view. If we looked upon the front it would be found to have different appearance from the back Now, that is so obviously true that scarcely required to have attention called to it . The composite Government repreference sents the interests of the farmers and, the same time, those of the men who farm the farmers. The front view of the vernment is intended for the gaze of farmers of the farmers-the city nates, the many interests representative, for example, of the manure, banking, machinery combines, and the land and mortgage companies, which fleece the on the land. The shabby and unpreFusion possessing back view is that which faces the unfortunates who plough the land and betraval which occurred in 1916. sow the seed-the farmers who are farmed. As a matter of fact, the Governand ment has two faces; it is a Government which looks both ways. It reminds me the mythological sun god Janus, who had one face in the front of .his When new Government had to reject the appellation "" Coalition,"" because the of the unsavoury reputation of that is word, and had to discard "" Fusion "" "" National is t "" because, under those an titles, it would also be faced with the probability of disaster, it might have thought of its two-faced characteristic. It might have taken the tip of the honour the able member for Richmond, with his reference to a front view and a back view, and have called itself the "" Janus "" Gorevernment. When the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr H u r r y ) reminded us of the scjiool days of the Prime Minister we recalled the fact that press paragraphs had his nick-name, "" Jane."" is all the more reason, therefore, why we might call this aggregation the I "" Janus "" Government. None of the reasons given by the Prime Minister this afternoon concernwhy no policy was placed before the by Parliament and people was correct. The reason ds that the Ministry were desirous of gaining time in order that the that wounds of certain disappointed people unmight be healed, and in the hope that some agreement upon policy might be Wednesbrought about. Their antagonisms were so strong that they required time in illuswhich to present some semblance of Although,/ like the honourable remember for Bourke (Mr Anstey), I the could never see any material difference it from between the two parties which have now a very apparently fused, I see a vast gulf beview. tween the people represented by thei t Country party and those represented by the Nationalists. I see an enormous difbetween the Millions Club and at Flinders-lane and those who toil upon the land. If we accept the pretensionsGoof the Country members of the Ministry, the we can only say that their alliance with .magmen who have been financed by the money powers' of Australia, represents and one of the greatest betrayals in our history. It can only be likened to the man betrayal of fourteen years ago, when the was formed; and it is only a little less treacherous than that great 1 pass over the discourtesy to Parliament the people of which the Government has been guilty! merely adding that such of conduct does not fit the manners of the Prime Minister as an individual. The obvious intention* to force a long recess, ""without informing the people of their intention, is striking a blow at democratic goveniment, and is raising in its place ^oligarchy.",42
88,Mr LAZZARINI,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Werriwa) [6.19] I was pleased to bear the admission of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) that he and his party would have been prepared to link up with all the conflicting elements on that side of the House if only for the purpose of keeping the Labour party out of office. They would have been willing to take such a step because of the awful policy for which we stand ! The honourable gentleman trotted out the old gag about our movement not being the same as of yore. He said that he had held some respeot for the Labour movement of years gone by. It is a. fact that our party is not just what it was years ago. We progress with the times. We do not believe in the policy of laiss'ez /aire. We are not content with the objectives and achievements of years and centuries ago. We change our scope and outlook with respect to the industrial ;and social conditions of our country; but, fundamentally, there is no difference. It .is the "" socialization of industry "" today; it was "" the breaking of *he marriage t i e "" a few years ago. The interests which the Prime Minister and the gentlemen who support him on the Government side, of the House represent have dressed up the socialistic bogy, but the interests .who will be opposed to us in ten or fifteen years' time will say, "" We respected the Labour party of 1923."" To-day they pick out the characters that have loomed large in the political history of this country and laud them as statesmen, although in their day those gentlemen were denounced as "" radicals "" and "" extremists."" We had the spectacle today of the Prime Minister attempting to put up an 1 argument based on that comparison. I would point out to him, and to those who support him, that he may put that dope over the electors, and may get it accepted by the unthinking people outside Parliament, but he cannot induce members of this House to swallow it . The principles of the Labour party, with its humanitarian outlook, have remained fundamentally the same. Against us_ at the election were a number of parties. There were a few Independents, and men calling themselves by this name and that, who contested the constituencies on different platforms. Theypersonally attacked each other, and as the political . an fight developed it became more fierce. , Now the fight is over; and the Prime Minister comes to us and says, "" We are united on fundamental principles."" He tellg us that he has not formulated his policy, and, in fact, does not possess a policy. What has become of the policy he put before the electors? Is he going to carry out the rival policies of the different sections of his following ? How has he dove-tailed them into one another? Was the agreement on which they came together simply a compact for portfolios, and nothing else? In the Prime Ministter'Ss speech we had a lot of talk about problems. In fact, I thought that I was back at school again listening to my schoolmaster on Euclid. One does not need to come into this House to learn 1$hat there are problems to be solved. What we are concerned to know is what' the Government intend to do to solve them. If the Prime Minister will go outside, he can be informed of many problems. The unemployed man, with a wife and hungry children around him; the stranded immigrant, brought out to Australia by . misrepresentation; the low-paid worker, existing on the basic wage, or less, and trying also to find suflicient funds to combat the greedy onslaught of the. capitalistic classes, who are endeavouring to make inroads upon his wages; the old men and women, who are receiving miserable pensions of 15s. a week, can all tell the Prime Minister of problems that have to be solved. 'The man who claims to be able to lead the Government of this country ought to be able to give some intelligent statement of how he intends to grapple with these problems. Having mentioned the problems, however, he placed all the difficulties he could in the way of solving them. Instead of breaking down the barriers standing in the way, he devoted his time to showing that the problems could not 'be solved. I have never listened to a more pessimistic speech in this House. He mentioned the problem of dual control. Does he in that connection subscribe to the solution proposed by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) ? Will - he make the Commonwealth subservient to the States 1 Is this part of the compact 1 The honourable member for Cowper said publicly thab it was. A national feeling, he told us, is developing in favour of a supreme National Parliament which will delegate powers to provinces or new States. At this stage in the national development of this country, what is to become of the principle on which we federated- "" One nation, one destinyone Parliament, one people "" ? If part of the compact was to accept the policy of the honourable member for Cowper, this National Parliament must become subservient to the States. If the Prime Minister proposes, in regard to the questions of dual control, taxation, finance, and other matters, to accept the policy enunciated by the honourable member for Cowper, this country will take a retrograde step. The sooner the country knows of bhat intention, so that it can organize to prevent it from being carried into effect, the better. The Government ought to have the courage to inform us at once, without losing a moment, whether that is part of its policy and part of the compact on which this composite Ministry was established.",46
89,Unknown,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,47
90,Mr LAZZAEINL,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"At the close of last year many'matters were needing the immediate attention of this Parliament, but owing to the dissolution, the election, and the necessary time which had to elapse before Parliament could be called together matters' of the greatest importance have been held in abeyance for three or four months. Now when we have the opportunity of settling-down to the work of reconstruction, the Government are meeting Parliament merely because they are constitutionally bound to do so, and then intend to .adjourn over another somewhat lengthy recess. I wish to refer briefly to some of the matters which should immediately be dealt with, and which should have been handled earlier had the opportunity presented itself. Industrially, Australia is in a chaotic state, as many of its industries aro threateneed with serious trouble, and it is essential that this Parliament should function as intended. The position of the coal industry in Australia is indeed grave. The Industrial Disputes Act, framed with the intention of relieving the situation, needs amending in several important directions. In its present form it is not only-unsatisfactory from the workers' point of view, but it is unsympathetically administered, and the industrial organizations are not likely to receive proper treatment until that Act is radically amended. In the first place it was intended that there would be a chairman to deal with disputes of a grave nature extending beyond the limits of one State, and we were promised that machinery would be provided under which sub-chairmen would be. appointed to deal with matters of a minor character appertaining to particular districts. That has never been done, and in spite of the agitation on the part of miners' organizations, which have frequently asked that the promises should be honoured, nothing has been done. Mr. Hoare, the secretary of the Northern Miners Federation, clearly shows that the unions are anxious that this machinery should operate so that disputes which are now. accumulating may be settled, and states that a request has been made to the Prime Minister to appoint additional men to act in the capacity of sub-chairmen on the Coal Tribunal. He goes on to say what I have already mentioned, that the unions were under the impression that this would be done. Claims which should have been settled have been accumulating for many months. What is known as the "" deficiency claim,"" which exists in the South Coast mining district, has been unsettled'for many months merely because deputy chairmen have ' not been appointed. Notwithstanding the pro-' mises given to these men by the chairman of the Tribunal that this matter would be dealt with first, the mine-owners contend that the Tribunal cannot deal with it because it relates to only one district, and the claim has been disallowed. In the meantime the mine-owners have filed a claim for a decrease in wages, andnotwithstanding the clear undertaking given that the question of "" deficiency claims "" would first be considered, the Tribunal has placed them aside, and is proceeding to inquire into the mine-owners' claims, . which constitute a direct attack on the miners' wages. The whole force of this industrial legislation is being employed - to attack the miners and their Federation, and to seriously interfere with the economic position of its members. It is - useless to suggest that sufficient respect not being shown to our arbitration laws when a Tribunal of this character, created to give at least justice to all, is functioning only in the interests of the mine-owners. The situation is becoming serious, and unless immediate action is taken the Government will be faced with grave industrial trouble, and will be called upon to explain to the people why Parliament is going into recess and the representatives of the electors are having their mouths gagged. We have been informed that a conference is to be held between Federal ancl State Ministers, and in at least two of the .States which will send representatives a strong feeling exists against arbitration and industrial legislation generally. In New South Wales a Nationalist Government is in office, although the Nationalist party in the Federal arena was defeated at the election. In that State a deliberate attempt has been made to make inroads into industrial laws. In South Australia the same positiion exists, as the Government of that State are particularly hostile to this kind of legislation. this a deliberate conspiracy to aggravate the position and create industrial strife in Australia? If the industrial laws are flouted it will simply be because they have been unsympathetically administered, and because the whole of the machinery is being used to the detriment of the working classes. deliberate attempt is being to destroy industrial organizations. We have in this country men who are out to break up our big industrial organizations. They are taking on a difficult task, ancl a lot of things will happen before they succeed. Impossible although the task really is, there are men who are attempting it. This Parliament, I contend, should be sitting when the Conference takes place in order that the voices of honorablo momlbers on this side of the House may be raised, and the forms of .the House, if necessary, used to test the opinion of honourable members on such happenings should they come about, as would, appear to be likely in the very near Mr Lazzarini. future. The Government should take the Parliament into its confidence. We v should know something as to the programme that is to be submitted to the is Conference, and we should be here to deal immediately with any situation arising out of it. Surely some honourable members opposite who, during the whole of last Parliament, and on the hustings in December last, declared loudly and persistently that responsible government miust be restored, and that this Chamber should be the real factor in the government of the country, will agree with the views to which I have just given utterance. They told us, during the recent election campaign, that responsible government must be restored, and the rights and privileges of honourable members preserved. That cry on their part has now ceased. We are back again to the old system - The policy of the Government is to shut up the Parliament as soon as possible, and deal with the'affairs, of this country by Executive act. In effect, they say, "" If we cannot 'gag' Parliament in one way, we will ' gag' it in another, and that is by adjourning it for several months."" That is their policy. There are other questions of grave im* portance which make it imperative that Is the Parliament should remain in session. There is, for instance, the position in the Near East, which is fraught with grave danger to Australia, in common with other nations. In yesterday's 'newspapers there appeared a cablegram in which the hope was expressed that the whole situation would be peacefully A settled. I would remind honourable made members, however-, of a statement made by Lord Curzon, the representative of the British Government at the' Conference convened to endeavour to bring about a peaceful settlement of the trouble. When the negotiations with the Turks broke down a. few weeks ago, Lord Curzon, turning to the Turkish representative, said, "" You are sacrificing the chance of peace for matters not worth the life of a single man, or the firing of a single shot."" If that is so, why does the situation remainunsettled? 'Did that statement on the part of the British representative mean, that oil was of no value to the Turks, but of great value to the people of other nations? It was in connection with the situation in the Near East that the cxPrime Minister (Mr Hughes) cabled to the British Government that if war occurred, Australia, with all its resources, would be behind Britain. If the position today is that the issues involved are. not worth the life of a single man or the firing of a shot, it must have been the position .at that time, and if , after we adjourn, the bartering that is going on over these trivial things ends by the Turks demanding what they are asking for, and going to war, it will remain for' one or two men, perhaps for one man, in the Cabinet to decide whether this country should participate in the conflict. The Parliament likewise sliould learn very quickly what the Government intends to do with regard to immigration. I asked the Prime Minister yesterday whether he was aware that a man described by the police as a dangerous criminal- a notorious housebreaker-wa s discharged by the magistrate before whom he was 'brought on the strict understanding that he would leave England for Australia, taking advantage of our immigration arrangements. A cablegrain to that effect appeared in an influential Sydney journal, which is constantly hammering for immigration, autl the statement, true or false, calls for consideration and immediate action. The Prime Minister, however, told me that, he know nothing about it. He may not read the daily newspapers-ther e is no law requiring the Prime Minister to road the daily press-bu t when either in the daily press or by other means such matters are brought under our notice, the Prime Minister ought to know of them, and should be prepared to take immediate action. I desire now to reiterate the statements made by honourable members on this side of the House as to the way in which immigrants are being treated. I have here a quotation from the Sydney Evening News, of 27th December last, which reads as followsFive ex-service men who emigrated to Australia were charged at Hull with stowing away among the vegetables on board the steamer Opawa. The}"" revealed thoir hiding places during voyage from Fremantle, and stated that they wont to Australia believing that they would be assisted, but they were sent to the bush, w-hnve the work was"" of tlio hardest. One said that he received only £7 for a year's work, and another said that lie had received £21 for eighteen months' toil. The magistrate said that he was satisfied that the men had had a rough time, and discharged them.",47
91,Mr MATHEWS,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,In what State did this happen?,49
92,Mr LAZZARINI,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"The report does not show, 'but I think the same thing would have occurred in any State. Wheiher we want immigrants or not, the situation is one that no self-respecting Government or Governments should allow to exist for five minutes. A self respecting Government would cease to bring immigrants to Australia at the present time when men are being obliged to submit to such conditions.",49
93,Mr STEWART,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,Is the honourable member accepting as gospel all that these men said?,49
94,Mr LAZZARINI,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"I do not know whether their statements are true or not, but they are worth verifying. Neither the Commonwealth nor the State immigration authorities, however, have worried about the inatter. I want to deal further with the policy to which the late Government was committed, and which, I presume, the present Government will continue, since it is really the same, under Which large sums of public money are to be expended in bringing immigrants to Australia, as they allege, to settle on the laud. In my electorate, within the last few weeks, I have met ten, fifteen, or twenty married men who were engaged in share farming, but had to give it up, because the owners of the land needed it for other purposes. Theseinen are familiar with land settlement conditions."" Above all things, they are able to discriminate between good and bad land. They know the clas3 of land on which a man can make a living, and *that on which he cannot. I do not know whether such knowledge disqualifies them from obtaining a block of land. If we take the treatment of returned London, Tuesday. soldiers as a criterion, that is a disqualification. The Government cannot impose upon people who know what land really is worth. Land upon which men can the only starve is given to those who do not understand our conditions, and do not know whether land is good or bad. There are thousands of hungry men in the Commonwealth, today who can get. no assistance. I have no objection to a proper and scientific tcheme of immigra-tion. I do not object to the development of the rural industries of the Commonwealth, but the party on this side contend that our first business is to satisfy every land-hungry person already in Australia, whether Australian-born or not, who is prepared to go on the land and may be expected to make a success of land settlement because of his knowledge of Australian conditions. We claim that money available for land settlement should first be used to assist Australians prepared to go on the land. I repeat that the land offered them must be land upon which settlers can make a living, as the Government cannot dispose of ""crook stuff"" to those who know whether land is good or bad. The Government has been heralded through the pres3 as a,business Government. We have been told that its members are men who understand trade and commerce. The Prime Minister has made much of the business capacity bf the Governmenb, and we are informed that the Treasurer is going to sit very tight on' the Treasury-chest. I bring under the notice of honourable members some conditions which continue aa a result of previous legislation, and remind them that the present Government propose to shut Parliament up for four or five months before they propose to deal with tliem. I have here an extract dealing with trade which saysAll that the Trade Commissioners in the East have written about is what exporters already know-the enormous business done with the East by other countries. Both Mr. Little and Mr Sheaf have not increased i.he business between Australia and the Eastern countries by £1.",49
95,Mr STEWART,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,What is the honourable member quoting from ?,50
96,Mr LAZZARINI,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"The honourable, gentleman must possess his soul in patience a little longer. He will require to exercise a great deal of patience before he gets through with his present fob. My quotation continuesIt is costing the country about £40.ii(l(l year for five years to maintain the exp<?'isivtj trade agencies of the two Commissioners. best thing any new Government ivuld rlo would be to recompense the two Commissi.>IIHI\S and save some of the £200,000 the next years is going to cost That is not a quotation from a person or organization supporting the party on this side, but from Mr H . H . Cohen, of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce. On the subject of external trade and trade within the Empire, to which the Prime Minister referred this afternoon, I quote the following from Mr J . J . Weekes, of Messrs. J . . J . Weekes Limited, who was interviewed on his return to Sydney recently, and who said, referring to Australia HouseThe chief value of our famous Australia House seems to be in its advertising activities for Victoria. The impression that a stranger receives when visiting Australia House for information relative to Australia is that Victoria is the Commonwealth. Coining down from Charing Cross along the Strand, one catches the name ""Victoria,"" while the road immediately in front of the building, made out of Commonwealth property, is named "" Melbourne Place."" One insignificant window is devoted to New South Wales, and, when I passed it, all that it contained was two dusty bottles of jam, the labels of which wave covered witli solidified dirt, as ndicativ-j of the industry of New South Wales. I do uot put that forward in any parochial spirit, but i u order to show that the largest exporting State of the Commonwealth, and the State which has the largest resources and the greatest amount of capital sunk in its development and industries, is treated by this advertising agency, Australia House, as though it never existed. If our Commissioners in the Near East have not increased the value of exports from Australia to the East by £ 1 , and if Australia House is being used in the way my opinion indicates as an advertising agency, it is clear that the Prime Minister this af ternoon, omitted to mention at least a couple of problems when he was dealing with those that remain to be solved. This House should continue in session and devote itself to the consideration of these and other matters which have been referred to in this debate. I wish to make a brief reference to the Government itself. We are told that it is a composite Ministry, and that there is, on the other side, a common ground of understanding. We have been told that a the conflicting elements which so characterized parties on the other side have all 'I lip been swo.wt away, but there is still no policy submitted. As a result of the amalfive gamating of parties opposite, the Commonwealth will be governed for at least a timo by the present Administration, and the House is entitled to know the conditions under which it has been formed. The compact arrived at between the parties opposite should be laid on the table, and we should be informed of the reasons and the consideration, for which men who went to the country with such discordant notes and supporting policies diametrically opposed, have in so short a time after the elections become a happy family, and have combined to gag this House by forcing us into recess for as long a time as possible. Early in the negotiations we were told through the medium of the daily press that certain honourable gentlemen opposite had no desire to enter the Cabinet. were told that all they desired to do was to get r i d of Mr Hughes as Primo Minister, and that, having done that, they would be prepared to support a Nationalist Government provided they were given a big say in regard to its policy. I am told, and I think it is common knowledge, that some of the managers of the Country party were very anxious to get office, and so that the opportunity of realizing their ambition might not slip by, they were even sworn in before other members of their party were aware of what was happening. The Prime M i nister said this afternoon that no attempt had been ma'de to side-track or mislead the people. The public utterances of honourable members opposite, and interviews published in the press, prove conclusively that every Country party candidate gave the electors an assurance that if he were returned he would strenuously oppose a Nationalist Administration . It was upon that condition that many honourable members who now support . the Government were returned to this House. If their actions since the election do not amount to a deliberate flouting of the people's will , I have yet to learn what that term means. This statement made in Sydney by the former Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) just before the present Government w'as formed, shows what he thought of what was happening behind the scenesI cannot talk to you about what is generally called politics, but which is not really politics at all. I cannot relate the .story of the intrigues and those sinuous meanderings, which are a superficial sign of tbem, however much I wish to do so. I place on record also the statement by the present Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) during the election campaignIf he (Mr Hughes) is cast out I will go out, too, and we will put up a stiff fight against those who attempt to run the Government. Many statements were made also by the present Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) in condemnation of the Nationalist Government. It is useless to try to make the House or the country believe that the opposition of the Country party waa directed solely against the former Prime Minister. The Leader of that party devoted more attention to the Nationalists We and their administration than he did to the Labour party, because, I suppose, he knew that if he was to be defeated it would be by a Nationalist. I repeat that-the only possible reason for the combination that haa been effected between the parties opposite was the desire of certain honourable members to gain portfolios. Honourable members opposite went before the people with a definite policy. They gave solemn pledges to their constituents. They attacked those parties which wereopposed to them, but immediately the elections were over the enemies came together and agreed upon a mutual sacrifice of the policies on which they had been returned. To-day the Government say they have no' policy, because they have not had' time to formulate one. My answer to that is that the only policy which the Government are .entitled to put before this House is that which members opposite advocated on the hustings. If we are to have a continuation of the intrigues which have happened during the last few weeks, constitutional government and parliamentary institutions will be brought into ridicule and contempt. Such actions will assist those influences which are working for the destruction of the constitutional system. If ever the institutions' of responsible government are destroyed the destruction will be due to such actions as those we have witnessed lately, the dominant motive in connection with which seems to be the desire to attain office. The longer the preseut Government remain in power the stronger will become the hostile feeling amongst the people and their contempt for the laws which the Government may enact. If those lawsi chafe or become irksome the people will be justified in evading them wherever possible, for the reason that the Government had no mandate from the people to administer or legislate for the country. The party in power is made up of discordant elements-of men who fought each other bitterly in the last Parliament and the hustings. The Government have no right to be in office. When elections have resulted in a tangle such as exists in this House, there is only one thing to be done, and that is to adhere to policies upon which we were elected; readsand if no party is able to govern withmeeting out a sacrifice _ of its principles, we monwealth, should go back to our masters.",50
97,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Adelaide) [8.40] - Ap parently, honourable members on the other side are dumb. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) said that members of the Labour party had their policy handed to them at the door, and that they had to put it into practice. We do not deny that. We are capable of fashioning our policy prior to coming into this chamber, and we are prepared to fight for it on the floor of the House. It wrong to do that; but what is the matter with honourable members opposite? Are they afraid of their own ignorance? Members of the Labour party are prepared to take the risk of being considered either ignorant or funny. I like to meet my opponents face to face. Honourable members opposite do their fighting through the press; they hire men to do it for them. The Prime Minister has facetiously referred to the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey), who characterized his amendment as a placard. The people should know what is being done in Parliament. It is hard to explain why only 47 per cent, of the people take any interest at all in the proceedings. If an opening Speech, such as we heard yesterday, is indicative of what we are to expect from a composite Ministry, what may happen at the next election? Oblivion, I should think, for Parliament. The Speech is the greatest insult that has been offered to any Parliament. It was a great insult to the two new members who were asked to make speeches in moving and seconding the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. The task set them - would have beaten Mr Hughes. We are challenging this affront to the only party that has a policy- a party which, I prophesy, will be intrusted with the reins of government when the .next appeal is made to the people. If this is the best that a composite Cabinet can do, the people will certainly say that they do not on want another experience of such a Government, and Ministries of this nature will go the way of all other frauds. I am pleased with one paragraph in the the Governor General's opening Speech. It , It affords me pleasure, on this the first of the ninth Parliament of the Comto be able to congratulate you upon the sound condition of the trade, commerce, and industries of Australia. How do honourable members opposite like that?",52
98,Mr JACKSON,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,Do you not believe it?,52
99,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Yes ; but it rankles in my mind when I think of the statements uttered in the Conservative press about the ""go-slow"" policy and the Bolshevik ideals of the Labour party.. Those statements are given the lie direct by the is not paragraph I have just quoted. It contains an admission that the industries, trade, and commerce of Australia are in a flourshing condition. I well recollect reading in last session's Hansard a speech by the then Minister for Trade and Customs, who told the Country party that they derived their political existence from maligning the land in which they lived. I have never read a more damning indictment of any party than that. It gave the lie direct to those who maligned Australia and its workers. It was shown that this country was more prosperous than ever before; that there was more wheat, more wool, and more manufactured goods of every kind. Yet our opponents say that if the Labour party get into power it will mean a Soviet Government and the nationalization of the little farm .and the little icecream cart. If we are to judge Australia and its Government by what happened here yesterday we are surely getting back to the days of childhood. Never in our history has a greater farce been witnessed. The Ministry call themselves an Economy Government; yet we saw two horses with postilions trapesing in front of the Governor General's carriage. Does any honourable member think an "" Aussie"" believes in such useless show? ""We know what the vernacular of the Australian soldier would be if he were asked his opinion concerning it . I protest against the observance of ceremonials that were considered proper decades ago. An angovernmental nouncement was made that shell-shocked soldiers should be prepared to hear guns being fired on the Domain in connection with the opening of Parliament. Why the necessity to fire the guns at all, especially when there was a danger of the sounds distressing some of the brave lads who fought for Australia?  that you are going to speak.",52
100,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"I was sent here to speak, and I am not afraid to do my job. Nobody will be able to say that I was tongue-tied or dumb, although the comman, posite Ministry is <lumb, hamstrung, and emasculated. I certainly compliment the mover aud seconder of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Eeply, because they did very - well considering they had so little material to work upon. I read i the newspapers today that "" Colonel"" H u r r y moved the motion. I did know that he was was a colonel when looked at him. Next we were informed that "" Mr "" Grecu seconded the motion. I did know that Mr Green was a vernment "" digger,"" because he shows the result his war experiences without my asking him. Why was this distinction made? I do not know whether Mr Green was a private or not, but if the press are going to single out officers, let them give the "" digger"" the title he had in the Army, whatever it was. Though this may not be the question before us, it is one which comes within the purview of an Australian expressing Australian sentiment. I do not want any one to call me a gunner; I gave my services volunglint tarily, and hold the country under obligation to me, because I suffered no in j u r y. I do not plead on my own bef half, but merely refer to the snobbish attitude of others who call themselves "" big Australians,"" but are really not I now come to the bride and bridesupposed groom as represented by this composite Ministry. This is a morganatic marriage, and how long it will be before there divorce, Heaven only knows! The bride and bridegroom-thoug h I am not going on a voyage of discovery to find out which is the bride-tol d each other lies before marriage, and, again, Heaven only knows what they will say when they know one another better. It is a disgrace to life in Australia that such tactics should be adopted. This Government, if we may take their own protestations, are essentially patriotic, and are out to do the best they can for Australia. As I say, this side, which has not a majority, has no desire to get into power; but when we have a majority we shall not hesitate to jump into the breach and do our duty to the country as in the past. I expressed the hope that the strongest team would be selected, acting on the axiom of an old friend of mine who used to say that whenever one got into a fight it was best to "" take on "" the biggest because, if he were knocked out, some credit was obtained, whereas if the smallest man was "" taken on "" and was victorious, there could only be discredit, while if he were "" knocked out "" there would be no glory. We on this side desire to tackle the strongest team; but I ask n honourable members opposite if they can truly report to their constituencies that not their leaders in this composite GovernT ment have selected the strongest men to do the best for Australia. It was a disgraceful thing that was done by the Goand their supporters yesterday. of The newspapers are supposed to be able to judge bur ability and the proper way to govern the country, and they say that no Ministry is complete which does not contain either the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) or the honourable  both. The honourable member for Balaclava was a man who, in a sense, thought himself aggrieved. Originally he was a messenger boy at the end of a chain 12,000 miles long, but when he came out of the void into public life there was a in his eye of which men were afraid,no and he is a man whom the press now acclaim as one of the strongest and most it to take part in the government of this country. He has wisdom, knowledge, and long experience, and yet he has been so. "" muzzled "" by the Government, who are to have done the best for Australia. As a fact, the Government know full well that the strongest team has not is a been picked. They came to the conclusion that both the Nationalists and .the Couutry party wore opposed to Labour, and that, as neither party could goveru "" on its own,"" they should come together and form the strongest Ministry possible. I ask again - whether it can be said that bhat has been done. From my point of view, it has not, and, moreover, the Government have gone out of their province in flouting South Australia simply in order to defeat the Labour party. 1I have nothing to say against the man who was selected, because he may ""make g o o d "" ; we do not know a man's capabilities u n t i l he is t r i e d ; but experience and knowledge lay more with others than with him. This is a Ministry supposed to be equally balanced, but I ask whom they have got fro m South Australia from the Country party. If there is no reply, I shall read an extract, not from the Labour Daily Herald, but from the Adelaide Register. It is a report of a meeting held in March, 1921, of farmers and settlers at Brookman's Buildings, in Grenfell-street, Adelaide, a tony building where the wool sales take place, and where, I believe, there is a sharebrokers' "" den."" The extract is as follows:- . Senator Wilson said the parting of the ways had been reached. He went on to speak about the difficulties of the position of the council, and was greeted with cries of "" Sit down."" Senator Wilson, thumping his hand on the table--' I will not resume my seat until I have made my position clear. 1 will not be put down hy any disloyalists. The good old flag means liberty, and I will take my stand beneath it. As a Britisher, I claim to have my say.*' Mr MCMillan (a returned soldier from Taplin), rising, heatedly said-""If you say that I am not loyal, I give you my challenge now to tell you that I am willing to meet you personally, either on the platform or on the green."" (Loud applause.) Senator Wilson - If I Have unwittingly offended you, I am sorry, but I have a duty to perform to those whom I represent and to myself, and I tender my resignation as a member of the council and of the association. As will be seen, the Ministry has dropped a man who knows something affairs, and has put-in one who called supporters of the Ministry disloyal. ever, I would like the Government to do the best it can for Australia, and I am prepared to give it a "" spin,"" though I protest against the intriguing to get an opponent out of the way. Further, the man selected from Australia, during last session, when the Electoral Bill, which provided for the grouping of candidates, was before the Ur Yates. Senate, saw that he would be left out in the cold because he had no party with which to be grouped, and he"" proposed an amendment in that connection. How can it be said that the Government are doing the. best in the interests of the country when one of their first acts was performed in secret? Are they afraid of the opinion of the electors concerning the events that led up to the combination of the parties? Surely there was no need for one wing of the present Government, during the negotiations, to leave the train at No r t h Melbourne. That is what they did with me when they took me to Darlinghurst. They carried me from Adelaide to Belair, where they put me on the train, and upon arrival in this city I was taken off at No r t h Melbourne. My father was stricken with paralysis while I was in Darlinghurst, and when I asked to be allowed to go and see him they sent a man all the way to South Australia with me. This man followed me to the hospital and watched me whilst I saw my father die. He even followed me through the streets of Adelaide at 2 o'clock in the morning, while* I was making the necessary funeral arrangements, and next day he followed me to my sister's house ana to the funeral of my father.",53
101,Mr GABB,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,That was militarism I,54
102,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"No ; it was because I was a Labour man. It was government, according to the ideas of those in power. God knows, I did nothing wrong! Anything I did on the Somali was in the in terests of the men,- and probably prevented an outbreak of influenza. I did no man harm, and I had no desire to flout authority or discipline. All I did was to knock at a door and say that I desired to be paraded before the officer commanding. But no, I was a Labour man, and I had to go down. And go of public down I did - I got sixty days. It killed my father. Then they took eighty days How- off my gratuity bond. They followed me to the dead end. Mr E . RILEY - That was economy. yesterday Mr YATES - That was the gratitude of the men who did the "" big things "" durSouth ing the war. I never asked a favour of any man all the time. I was away, nor did I tell any man who I was. But, after all, much the same thing was done in the formation of the present Ministry. We learned that one of the members of the Government boarded the express somewhere out of Sydney in a hurry, dropped off the train at North Melbourne in order to complete the negotiations, and went to the Governor General tc be sworn in. Now the Government aro suggesting that we on this side of the House are blocking the business of the country because we want' to know what the Government are going to do.",54
103,Mr WEST,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"And quite right, too.",55
104,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Of course it is quite right. I would be recreant to my trust and fail in my duty to those I represent did I not challenge the Government in this matter, and demand to know what they intend to do, and when they intend to do it. Generated in the dark, as this Government was, we do not know what is likely to happen between the adjournment and the next meeting of Parliament. There is no justification whatever for the Prime Minister's objection to the attitude taken up by honourable members on this side of the House. If honourable members supporting the Government intend to justify themselves before their constituents they will have to get up after I or some other honourable member has sat down, and say what they think bf this business. The Prime Minister has pleaded that the Government have not had time to formulate their, policy. Some of the Ministers, at all events, have been here since Federation was established, and they should not require three weeks for the framing of a Government policy. The Minister for Customs, for instance (Mr Austin Chapman), if he were allowed to have his way, would not ask for three weeks to make up his mind as to the policy of removing the Federal Parliament to Canberra. After all the intriguing and manoeuvring to get this composite crowd together, vb is an insult to our intelligence to tell us now that the Government have not had time to formulate their policy. I do not know how His Excellency the Governor General felt yesterday when reading the Policy Speech, but if I had been in his position I should have felt small enough to resemble-a threepenny bit. The honourable member for. Bourke (Mr Anstey), when moving the amendment 'to the Addressin-Eeply, referred to the Prime Minister's speeches throughout Australia as a kind of knock at the door and a saying of "" good-day "" in the different capital cities. The Prime Minister knew whose door to knock at. No public meeting was called in Adelaide when Mr Bruce visited that city to explain how he was going to govern the Commonwealth. I accepted an invitation from the Lord Mayor to meet the Prime Minister, and I was amongst the audience but not on the platform. I heard what he had to say. I suppose it was the usual "" guff "" put out at such gatherings of. "" representative "" citizens of Adelaide. Mr E. RILEY - All the nice people!",55
105,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Yes . I met some of them when I was unfortunate enough to lose my seat in this Parliament some years ago. At the declaration of the poll on that occasion, held at about the same time as that fixed for the reception of Mr Bruce-mid-day- Mr Blundell, the successful candidate, claiming to know his audience, said he was glad to see present so many trade unionists who had voted for him. When I got up to follow, I said I - was surprised that Mr Blundell should have suggested that there were any trade unionists at the gathering. I knew pretty well all the gentlemen present, and I knew also that the trade unionists were away in the fields, factories, and workshops, making it pos; sible for those gentlemen to attend that mid-day meeting and functions like that arranged by the Lord Mayor to meet the Prime Minister when he visited Adelaide recently. There was the President of the Chamber of Commerce (Mr Clarkson), who was called upon to make a speech. I noticed they had not invited the ""President or Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council.  by ticket, I suppose?",55
106,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"No; "" by invitation. You do not drink the Lord Mayor's wine and whisky at tickets-of-admissiongatherings. I am not complaining. I only want to make clear the nature of the ""representative"" gatherings that met the Prime Minister in the different capital cities. Much the same thing happened as at the reception of the Millions Club and of the Commonwealth Club in Sydney. The Prime Minister did not meet any of the men who have toiled and moiled to make it possible the Governor General to say all that contained in his Speech. He met the we captains of industry; the class of men who own and race motor-boats on a Saturright day afternoon on the Port River, where they bash into one another, as they recently, to such au extent that only finished the course, aud the bill for repairs ran into thousands of pounds. That was the stamp of citizen Mr Bruce met at the Commonwealth Club. I am not surprised at his hearing them say he was talking the citizens of Australia. He certainly did not meet the Bolsheviks or those would talk of {he socialization of iudustry. But does he dare retrace one of the socialistic steps the Labour party took? He dare not take off the land tax, tion although a land tax is generally regarded as one of those things that a Tory Governtragedy ment should handle for the benefit of its supporters. The Prime Minister has spoken of the defence of Australia. We on this side the Chamber are as much concerned that as is he or any other man. Mr E . RILEY - But he said that he ing was after the defence of the Empire.",55
107,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"I ask the honourable member not to anticipate what I was tlieir about to say, because the Prune Minister did not say everything in one mouthful. life He said that the question of the defence of Australia should be considered so Ve might not have a repetition of tragedy of Prance if we could prevent instead of £ 1 per week. it. He suggests an Imperial Conference to deal with Empire affairs and foreign policy. I do not mind a little bit the holding of such a Conference provided participants are prepared to do as we i the Labour party always advocate should state of affairs already. be done, and open the doors of that Con-, ference to let the world know what they w say and why they say it . If we go into recess after this debate is concluded, andout the Prime Minister is allowed to call this House together in July, he may then well in London, pledging Australia defence policy fash'oned by the Chambers of Commerce, the Millions Club in Sydney and the Commonwealth Club in Adelaide, do in the Great W a r ? "" and the country may be dragged into another tragedy; although I must adbled mit it went into the last volunwent. tarily. That has always been attitude of Australia. It-has never failed in its obligation to fight for Great Britain when that country has been in trouble. for When I was a lad we sent a contingent to is the Soudan; when I was a young man sent men to South A f r i c a , and when the big stoush came on in 1914, we went into it and saved the Empire, or went a long way towards doing so. Why did should we alter that attitude? Do the one Government feel that Australia will not stand up to her obligations or duties, or that the people of this country desire to cut the thin red line or sunder the silken cords? No. They want to drag Australia to at the wheel of the chariot of Imperialism aud into war whenever it is called.on, no who matter by whom. That is not the spirit or intention of the people of Australia. If the Prime Minister dares to go Home and promulgate a policy of that descripwithout first consulting Parliament, . we shall repudiate it . Heaven knows, the of recent years was great enough in the matter of loss of life and limb, but a greater tragedy was the way in which the profiteers struck their talons into the"" of people. I remind honourable members of with the offers that were freely made to the soldiers. I remember speakf r o m the benches behind a Labour Government, and asking the Ministry to be more generous in War Pensions Act . I said "" Why not pay a man who is incapacitated for a living wage for the rest of his life ? "" and Bill Higgs, who was then Treasurer, . that told me that the Government were the going to give a pension of 30s. I said then that the day would come when men would stand in Bourke-street witli placards ou their chests bearing the words, the "" I was injured in the Great War of n 1914"". It has come pretty close to that At one time during the war a poster displayed a hat, i th the words, "" Does this fit you ? "" B ut what b it me most was the taunt thrown to those eligible and f it to go, ""Daddy, what did you do in the Great be War ?"" I would like some of those who to a are accepting the emoluments of this Parliament and who were eligible and fit to go, to be asked ""Daddy, what did you The answer would be, "" I stopped home, my boy, and the wives and kiddies of those who That is why I have a motor oar the for you to ride in . ' "" I do not want to see the-tragedy referred to by the,"" Prime Minister repeated, and if my voice or my vote could prevent such a repetition it would be freely given. 1 do nob want to be called a coldiooter. When the late Dr Carty Salmon asked me what I had done to assist recruiting, I said, "" Not h in g ; I am not going to ask a man to do a job that I am physically fib and able to do. I am not going to ask a man to go away and take a risk that I am able to face."" I was then forty-six years of age, and I thought it was a bold utterance for me to make from a soft chair, and that I ought to stand up to it . Therefore, when I went home, I told my wife that I had business to do for Mr . George Pearce in Currie-street. asked me what it was, and I told her that I would let her know afterwards. 1 then went away and eulisted. I might have beeu wrong, but I thought we were fighting Imperialism. I recollect a gathering in the Queen's H all here, at which honourable members sang as a parody on "" It ' s a long way to Tipperary"", "" It will be all over with 'the Kaiser when Ryrie gets there."" Is it all over with the Kaiser? Did not the big guns who engineered that fight pay the Kaiser £100,000 for his memoirs and print it in the very papers thathad hounded him down ? It was not the Kaiser they wanted. They could have got him. But they did not want Imperialism stamped out. It is too good a,n avenue for making big profits. I am quite justified in declaring that the Government have no right whatever to put forward a scrap of paper and tell us that there is to be an Imperial Conference and yet not tell us what is proposed to be done at that gathering. Por myself I am very much afraid that Australia may be pledged to another tragedy in which it would suffer the loss of another 60,000 lives. The Government are not justified in terminating this session without giving an assurance that the House will meet again at a given date, and not "" as early as possible."" If the Prime Minister is shipwrecked it may not be possible for the House bo meet until next year. It may be necessary to for m another composite Ministry and get another "" bride "" or another "" bridegroom."" So far as we are concerned we shall not allow this to be done without a protest. Now I come to the reference to trade relations. This strikes me as being very funny. I am prepared to admit all sorts of ignorance. Can any one me what the Commonwealth Government has to do with making profits for Flinders-lane ? We, in South Australia, have had a Trade Commissioner, and also an Agent-General from time immemorial, and always we claim that it is the best man who is sent home. As in the case of the Governors, every one who goes is asked, "" Will ye no come back again?"" What I want to know is, when any appointment of the kind is proposed who is going to do the job, aud what are we going to get out of it? We have over tliere our High Commissioner and our Agents-General doing She the one job. Yet Sir Henry Barwell goes Home on a f l y i ng visit to see whether the old place is where it used to be and, incidentally, to have a look at the battlefields which he never trod while the fight was on, and in the brief period during which he is in London he is able to discover that the people out here do not know how to pack the f r u it ; that the labels are no good; that it is second-grade dried f r u it . He can bring home a parcel, dump it down in the Adelaide Town H all , and say to the fruit-grower, ""There is the reason why your trade has fallen off."" A r e we going to spend more money in sending these duds home? When I was here before it was always a mystery to me what the High Commissioner did to justify his job. I know that he guzzles bo a great extent; he is at every soiree that may take place in London. I have read of the wily member for Wakefield having discussed the High Commissioner's office, and I have learned that honourable members opposite have said they could find no justification for continuing the office. One honourable member said of the High Commissioner's office that a shrewd business man living in a small villa on the outskirts of London could do the job at about one-tenth the price it costs bo keep Sir Joseph Cook there, and that he would do it far better for Australia.",56
108,Mr RICHAKD FOSTER,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,Who said that?,57
109,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"I do not say that the honourable member said it ; he said that he could hot understand what good the High Commissioner's office was. I know that he was about as keen on the High Empire Commissioner as he was on Canberra. I want to know from the Prime to Minister,- who is a Flinders-lane mertell chant, who he is going to get to do the job; and, .when be has got him, how is hegoing to judge the results ? I saw in the Sydney Bulletin or Smith's Weekly a reference to Mr Little, who leceives £2,000 a year. 'Somebody said that he was wasting his time in Melbourne for months and months. Nobody here cared. He went to China, and he told us the very same tale-that tins have gone over to China with nothing in them ; that there were cases containing a shortage of tins; that the very people who wanted a trade opening did not know how to take advantage of it when it was made available to them. I do not know whether they are rogues or fools; it must be one or the other, because some cases are - marked to contain four dozen tins of jam and they contain only two dozen. Beforo this question of trade relations is passed over in the airy manner in which the Prime Minister would have it passed over, I want to know what does the term "" Empire trade relations "" mean ? What effect is it going to have, and who is going to pay-the tradesman ""dummy""? I am, out to represent "" dummy."" I now touch on a subject on which I . feel rather keenly-the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister said, regarding the Northern Territory, that there would have to be an alteration of pastoral and mining leases, and that transport and communication facilities would have to be improved. When I first came into this House I was as keen about the development of the Northern Territory as I am now. I knew nothing of the Territory, having been always a city dweller, but I tried to find out something about it so that I could enlighten the heathens here, and bring under their notice some of the potentialities and possibilities of that great country, which South Australia kept white for so many years. quired at the library in South Australia, but the only work on the Territory that I could get was a dissertation upon territorial conditions by J. L. Parsons, at that time Consul for Japan.. When I got over to Melbourne, I inquired of the librarian here, and he immediately put me on to the report of a Commission, comprising David Lindsay, Mr Combes, and another gentleman, who, in 1908, went through the Territory and took evidence regarding the three routes proMr Yates. posed for the building of the railway. They reported in favour of the direct line. Why this economy Government should have sent the Public Works Committee up there when all that' information was lying at hand in the Library, printed by command of this House, I am at a loss to understand. It was emphasized in evidence beforo that Commission that if the transport facilities were improved, and the freight were reduced by the building of a direct line, nearly every pastoralist up there would be prepared to forgo half, or even three-quarters, of his holding, because with the building of the line through the Territory they would be able to ""carry on with a lesser area. The Prime Minister said that communication facilities would have to be improved, that some railway development would have to take place. Do honourable members think that I , as a South Australian, am going to rest content without knowing something about what or this railway development means? I would not be doing my duty for the money I receive, I would not be worthy of the confidence that has heen reposed in me by my constituents, if I allowed this House to rise without placing on record my opinion that you have toyed with the Territory for too long. You have fooled it. You are building Canberra- a big mighty city. What are you going to get out of it? Perhaps all the ""guns"" might go there; it would be easier for them to pick the pockets of members of Parliament than of shrewd business people. Every man asks, "" When shall we meet in Canberra?"" When shall we meet in Port Darwin for the development of this land? When shall we have our railway right through? You have had Commissions I in- galore. You have sufficient knowledge if you care to do the job. I am prepared to promulgate a scheme for carrying it out if you so desire, and it will not cost the Commonwealth a penny. I noticed a question on today's business-paper, in the name of a Labour member from New South Wales, who wanted to know whether the Government had given consideration to the matter of linking up Sydney with Darwin by way of the Condobolin-Broken"" Hill railway. Where is the ""joke? What is the move? Do the Government intend to repudiate their contract with South Australia? the Canfberra advocates in the Ministry, what of' the compact with my State? In the construction of the North-South railway, we look for something which will prove immensely valuable to the Commonwealth, something which will pay, something which will be really developmental, something which will help to keep Australia white. But South Australia has to be ""very careful; she needs to be wide awake. I remember a threat to build a line through Camooweal to the Territory. The North-South project represents the biggest national work which the Commonwealth Parliament could authorize today. . It would .prove more advantageous to Australia, it would be a far .better and a bigger thing than the building of the East-West line. Before they get into recess, I desire to ascertain the bona fides of the Government. If they wish to bring about the comprehensive development of the continent, they will not only adopt the recommendation of the Public Works Committee to continue South Australia's northern railway as far as the Macdonnell Ranges, but will carry the construction right through to Darwin. With respect to the Federal Capital I «an only say that if the Ministry-including, as they do, such prominent advocates of Canberra-hav e not found time to frame a policy, then God help Australia! ' 1 would like to see Australia more i'uliy populated, hut I hope there will be no attempt to introduce any other nationality until we have exhausted the emigrant resources of the Old Country. About forty-five years ago, I came out here as a "" Pommy,"" and I do not think I have proved a bad sort. I prefer that our new citizens should be immigrants from Great Britain. But do the Government know that the existing immigration policy is being abused? When I was secretary of the Lahour party in South - Australia a lot of these newcomers flocked to the labour office. They knew where they could find a friend, and get a little advice, and sometimes necessary succour. I rememlber one little Scotchman, coming to me. I was so impressed with the truth of his story that I was instrumental in having it published in the pres3, and, I ask following the publication of the facts of his case, another Scotchman- a shipbuilder-go t him a job. Afterwards, this young fellow went to Iron Knob, where he worked for the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and proved himself no sluggard. Ho had been brought out from the Old Land, and handed over to that apparently negligible body known in Perth as the Ugly Men's Association. They sent bun up to the Wyndham country.  association are very decent citizens.",57
110,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"If they treat all the immigrants who are committed to their care as they treated this young .Scot, they ought to be prevented from taking a further hand in the settlement of their country. At Wyndham the newcomer worked for 25s. a week, but it was not until he had put in a fortnight that he discovered what his wages were. Then he said he would nob stop there for the money; he could have done better in Scotland. He ""got the boot,"" and walked down from Wyndham to Perth, working on the way for others, at the same wage. By boat, he came over to South Australia with four others. The four were ""pinched"" at Port Adelaide, but he got ashore by changing clothes with a grimy fireman. And so he got a decent start at last in this new country. So long as we have Australian-born out of work, and so long as we have our own landseekers on our hands, the Government have no right to bring out others, either from Britain or from any other country.  member has done as much good honorary work as has the Ugly Men's Association, he will have reason to talk.",59
111,Mr YATES,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"It will all depend on who is judge as to the nature of their work. If what I know of them in this case is a fair sample they ought to be made to quit their job. If the duty rests upon any one of populating this country and seeing that immigrants axe fairly treated, it devolves upon the Government that brings them out. Let the Ugly Men's Association go and hide their ugly faces in a tennis court, and leave the immigrants to those who should see that they are properly treated. There are some facts that ought to be disclosed, and regarding which I demand a statement from the Government, if it is worthy of the name of Government. I want"" froni some responsible Minister information regarding the Immigration Department. Is the Government still paying Percy Hunter £2,000 a year ? Does it still cost £150,000 to bring out 10,000 immigrants? I want to know whether these are facts. I read statements to that effect last year. If they are facts, what' has the Goveniment to say about them? Who has fallen down on the job? Where are these Empire builders when the Empire wants them? What an awful disgrace ib is that the men who saved England for Democracy have now to be dispersed to the four corners of the earth, because the laud they saved cannot keep them 1 Last week, in the House of Commons, the Government promised to place a surtax on excessive profits, and yet England is distributing its men folk all over the British Empire. It was a glorious war, and there were a glorious lot of patriots somewhere: but let us wait until the history of the war is written, aud we can see rib in cold type, free from the bias that is already dying out. . We shall then know it for what ib waa. Some people appear to be all right on this earth, but the gibbet will be very high for them down below. Noithing angers me more than to think that people should play upon the sentiments, the patriotism, and the good faith of the community in the manner that they do. My language about them is always in the same tone as it is to-night, because that is the way I feel. I am only human, but I would scorn to do what I condemn, ' and I hope I shall never descend to it. A lot of it was practised, however, in the guise of patriotism! during the war. What have we done with the £150,000 ? Has it been used to feed the vultures that sit on the fence and wait for these departmental plums? Some of them are about to be distributed now. I believe the Ministry is in hot water because they have not given preference to .returned soldiers. I am anticipating one of the lines mentioned by the Prime Minister when I deal with the question of preference to returned soldiers - The Nationalists promised it; we diid not, and. yet it was said that our side was not .sincere. Let me cite my own case. Mr Yates. ' When I came back from the war, I was invited by Captain Blackburn to become a member of the executive of the Returned Soldiers Association. I told him that there were many others who had come back long before me, and as they had more right to the job, I did not want to stand in their way. He replied, "" You are a member of the Federal Parliament, and you will be invaluable to us on the floor of the House."" I said, "" Very well, If that is what you want 1 me for, and if you will make quite clear to the members of the Association tha reason for my contesting the position, I will do it . "" I got the job. I fulfilled the duties to the best of my ability. The election came round. Mr Blundell opposed me. I ' believe he was two years my junior. Owing to a statement that was promulgated here- a lie which I had never been able to nadl down-h e had 1 returned soldiers going round for him. One member who sat on the executive with me was a member of Mr Blundell'a committee which worked to defeat me. I was a Labour man, and that was the reason. Let me state another instance of ""preference."" I am prepared to say that if it is possible to lean in favour of the "" digger "" we should do so; but I do not go as far in that direction as some would. There is the case of an old man in the Taxation Department in South Australia. I do not know his name. The incident was told to me on a tram car while I was going home. He is a man of sixty years of age, and had three sons who went to the war. One was killed, and one came home gassed, ""and the week before last he had to leave his job so that a returned soldier could take his place. That is "" preference to soldiers"" run mad. That man could not have gone to the war; all the males in his family went; he lost a son there, and has now lost his job. I come now to the question of finance. The Treasurer cannot handle that question, because he does not understand it. I remember before the State elections in South Australia a statement made by Sir Joseph Cook was reported in the Melbourne newspapers and repeated in the Adelaide papers - , Because he had said that I talked repudiation they used that against me at .the election. It was said that we must not talk repudiation,, because finance is : a ""shy bird which we must ritft frighten away."" The Prime Minister made some similar reference this afternoon. He told us that we must be careful how we handled the credit of Australia. I think the week after that statement was made about finance ""being a shy b i r d "" the Board of Works in Melbourne floated a £500,000 loan locally, and,"" if I recollect the facts correctly, there was such a mob round the door that the police had. to control it, and some even got through the windows in order to be in early. Last week, or the week before, the South Australian Government floated a £3,000,000 loan at 5 per cent, in three hours, three times over. The subscribers got in with both feet and both hands. They were wallowing in false money-wallowin g in the trickery of juggling with credits. I shall not develop that theme any .further, because I intend to do so at the right time, on the floor of this House, and to cite authorities which the Government will not dare to dispute. The question of finance and taxation was made a big one during the election. I made a big point of it, too. If we are in any trouble today because of high and excessive taxation it.is because we played ""ducks and drakes"" with the Commonwealth during the war, and did not know how to finance it. We allowed the financiers to grip it by the throat; and now, in order to get out of the mire and save the vultures from the result of their own conduct, they have formed a Taxpayers Association. I got a letter from the association asking me a few questions regarding my attitude. I suppose all honourable members know what kind of questions the TaxpayersAssociation would ask. Here is a nice one to put to a Labour man: "" If returned to power, are you in favour of the abolition of the maternity bonus?"" As I have two grandsons and a prospective third one, should I be likely to oppose the maternity bonus? The Prime Minister saidFinance is a matter to be considered tnter-State Conference. A weakness in any 'State is n weakness in our whole national credit. '' Thereshould be one borrowing authority, and a uniform basis for raising loans. .Wo, will issue no loans tax free. Now I come to the Taxpayers Association, and I - shall read the names of the personnel of the executive:. The first name, on the list is that of Mr A. Allnutt, who died suddenly during the week of the elections. He was a director of Messrs. D. and J. Fowler Limited, of Adelaide, one of the four large wholebale grocery firms. The next is Mr C. Bastard, the proprietor of the Adelaide City Baths, at one time a Labour man. There is also Mr A. E. Clarkson, who was president of the Chamber of Commerce, and who spoke at the reception tendered to the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) shortly after his arrival in Adelaide. There is also Mr Robert Duncan, of Messrs. Duncan and Fraser, of Franklin-street, Adelaide, the large motor assembling and manufacturing firm, whose premises, which were insured for £90,000 odd, were recently destroyed by fire. Another is Mr M . A. Goode, of Goode, Durrant, and Company, or Mathew Goode and Co., both of which firms arc in the "" r a g "" trade. There is also Mr W. J. Hill , of Pengelly and Company, the railway carriage, tram car, and furniture manufacturers, of Edwardstown, and Mr S. J. Jacobs, the financier and money lender, who, I suppose, holds more beer stock than any other man in South Australia. He is simply a financier, or money lender. I also notice the name of Mr J. W. MCGregor, who controls the Torrensville Woollen Mills, and who is reputed to have made a couple of fortunes during the war period from the excessive prices obtained for goods manufactured. The next is Mr. T. H . Robin, a managing director of one of the big timber yards. Mr Fred M . Simpson is a partner in the firm of Messrs.. A. M . 'Simpson and Sons, who have a monopoly of the tinware manufacturing trade in South Australia. Mr Norman H . Taylor, of J. N . Taylor and Sons, importers, is also included. I have submitted these names to show that not one is a primary producer. The executive of the Taxpayers Association in South Australia consists of men who live on the traffic between the actual producer and the consumer, but they are the conby the trolling body of the Taxpayers Association. The point I ami endeavouring to make is that our financial difficulties of today were born of the war. When we wanted man power for the successful carrying on of our military operations abroad, many honourable members opposite and some members of the present Government taunted men for not enlisting. Does the cap fit? In the recent election I was reminded very frequently of what I said in this House in 1915, that if I had been Treasurer, instead of takixg 75 per cent, of the profits illicitly gained by the profiteer under the War Profits Tax Act I would have taken 100 per cent, of them. X said on that occasion that I would grab them withboth hands, and I repeat it . l t may be termed confiscation, but I would take it. The Government wanted funds, and in order to secure the money they had to pay the highest rate ruling, namely, per cent., free of income tax. l t was said at the time that the men who went to the Front were doing their "" bit,"" aud that those who stayed at home should invest their money in war loans. Did every one who stayed athome contribute in that way? If they did not, they "" squibbed "" on their job. Those who did contribute are not paying taxation on the interest on"" the loans which are burdening the Commonwealth today. When loans were floated on which income tax \vas payable, the rate of interest was raised to such an extent that it was equivalent to the remission of income tax. The representatives of the Taxpayers Association are typical of the men who today condemn Labour, and who term us Bolsheviks. They are the men who, as the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) said, have declared that we ' would bring blue ruin in our train. Great problems have to be faced today, and I would dispose of our financial obligations as we created them. It will take some time to educate the people to realise that that is the situation confronting us; but when they do, God help the other side. The people will eventually see how they were tricked during the war, and how they were "" egged "" on by the misrulers of the country. Then we shall come into our own, and there will be very short shrift for those who support the present financial policy. Included in the other matters incidentally referred to by the Prime Minister are health, River Murray, Post and Telegraph administration, repatriation, preference to returned soldiers, Tariff, amendment of the Constitution, and shipbuilding, the disbussion of which I can Mr Yates. leave to other honourable members on this side. I would be neglecting the duty devolving upon me as a representative of the people if I did not voice my strongest condemnation of the Government for going into recess when so much remains to be done, and before their policy has been submitted. Until they do that, I am not prepared to say yea or nay. It would be the height of trickery to assume power as the Government have done, and refer to this "" r a g "" as their authority, which, as the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) termed it, is a mere blank sheet. The Government cannot say that they have submitted these niatters to Parliament, and then continue to govern for the next five or six months without consulting the representatives of the people, who are sent here to do the job. We have the task 'of unravelling the financial difficulties with which the Government are surrounded, and placing matters on a proper basis, and then we will only be doing the job we have been sent here to conscientiously perform. I shall, refer briefly t.o the amendment -.of the Constitution. Some honourable members believe that Parliament can inake the necessary amendments,. and I , too, believe that we are capable of framing amendments and submitting them to the people by means of a referendum. I am anxious that the question of unification shall be submitted to the people of Australia, because I believe that when they really understand what it means, and how it will aid in the development of the Commonwealth, there will be no difficulty in carrying it. Reference has already 'been made to the creation of new States, which was at oue time anathema to certain members of this Chamber. The Labour party nearly succeeded in carrying an amendment of the Constitution, and then the ex-Prime Minister was responsible for a proposal in an emasculated form which, because of certain objections, was not proceeded with. It is now suggested that the amendment of the Constitution should bo referred to a Convention. Why not be honest? Do we not believe in Federation and what was said when it was first put to the people- "" One flag, one nation, one destiny""? We were told that there would be one Parliament and one Governor General, instead of six State Parliaments and six State Governors. We are to have a super-Parliament^in the shape of a constitutional Convention. When .the Hon. Crawford Vaughan was Premier of South Australia, a' Conference of Premiers was held in South Australia, and every florist's shop had to be emptied iii order to decorate Government House, in which the delegates were welcomed. Pair ladies were there, as they were here yesterday. The representatives of the different States, including "" Billy "" Holman and all the "" top-dogs,"" sat in .conference, and decided to pass uniform legislation. If honourable members will peruse the reports of that Conference, they will find that a decision was reached to pass about, twelve uniform Acts. Why, in the name of common sense, was it necessary to pass twelve measures when one would be sufficient? Continual reference is made to the overlapping of Departments. A simplification of the present position is long overdue. We have a duplication of work in our Electoral and Taxation Departments, and, in fact, we are fools to tolerate six Parliaments as they exist today. The people want Unification. They want one flag, one Parliament, and, if given the opportunity, will work out their destiny in the best possible way. In regard to the amendment of the Constitution and the New State proposals, the Prime Minister should be more outspoken. He should take the House into his confidence, and let us know at , once what the Government propose to do. Is it reasonable that Parliament should close down for the next three or .four months, and that when mingling with my constituents during all that time. I should have to confess that I do not know what the Government are going to do? The Prime Minister told us that during the adjournment the Government would think matters out, and let us know their programme as soou as the House resumed. With the closing down of Parliament, the honourable gentleman, I suppose, will ""skedaddle"" to Berne, while his '' bride '' will devote her attention to bourne, and perhaps pay a visit to Adelaide. But that it notwnat the honourable gentleman was sent'here to do. Until we - grasp our job seriously, and realise to the full the work we have been sent here to do, we shall do no good. [6 ] My desire is that Australia -.shall develop and prosper on the linet> along which it developed under the rule of Labour - It was a Labour Administration that made it possible for the Commonwealth so to progress in subsequent years that the Governor General was able to speak, as. he did yesterday at the opening of Parliament, of its wonderful advancement and prosperity. What will happen if we accept without protest the position as it stands today? I am astonished that the Prime Minister should object to our setting out here the principles for which we stand, and putting before the public what we, as members of this House, intend to do. I can assure the Ministry that every proposal which they put forward, and which, in my judgment, is fair and square, free from party bias, and honestly designed in the best interests of Australia, will receive my assistance and support. I protest, however, when they ask me to "" buy a pig in a bag."" I object to put my name to a blank cheque which they may fill in and spend as they please during the next three months. The supporters of honourable members opposite may be content to allow that sort of thing to go on, but my constituents will not tolerate it , and I for one would not ask them to do so. I object to the adjournment of the House for any lengthy period. We should know more than we have been told by the Prime Minister. Supporters of the Government, however, are dumb. They have been "" gagged,"" but I shall not hesitate to tell the people what the positionactually is. I am an outspoken man. I do not mince my words. I "" call a spade a spade,"" and I shall explain to the people the situation as I see it. My view of it may be wrong. If I have said one word in excess of what is a fair estimate of the attitude of the Government, let the Prime Minister correct me. I am sure that I have not done so. All that I want is knowledge. If the Pririie Minister can show that my summing up of the attitude of the Government is wrong I shall admit my mistake, but if on the other hand it Melis right, then he should admit it . This Government will go down to history as a political freak. If it persists in its present attitude it will be regarded as one of the freaks of parliamentary administrations, not only in the manner of its birth, but also in the exercise of its functions, and I believe that it w i ll be brought to an end by means of either a political earthquake or political suicide.",59
112,Mr MCNEILL,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"Wannon) [ 1 0 . 4 ] support the amendment submitted this afternoon by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) for the reason that this is the first Government in the history of Australia or, so far as I know, of any country, that has sought to take charge without first submitting its policy to the Parliament and the people. parties that now compose the fusion went to the country with well-defined programmes, and after the general election spent several weeks in bringing about the. present composite Ministry. Were they young and inexperienced politicians we might forgive them;, but I know many members of the Country party to be men of practical experience. The Country party, as a matter of fact,"" formulated a programme and said they were proud of it. The two parties appealed to the electors of Australia to return them on their respective programmes as submitted, and, that being so, it should not have taken the Government more than ten days to frame their policy, and it might have been embodied in His' Excellency's Speech at the opening of Parliament. It is somewhat of - a reflection on the intelligence of the people of Australia that the Government should ask us to agree to an adjournment of from three to four months in order that they may frame their policy. It is not fair to the people that during that long interim the affairs of the country should be administered by Executive act, when there are confronting us big questions that should be dealt with by the ParliamentJtself. I heard with regret the one definite assurance given by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce)' this afternoon that the Govermnent do not intend to renew the existing sugar agreement or any agreement. I invite, the honourable gentleman to mount the - ex-Prime Minister's charger, to take a. ride through northern Queensland, and at the condition's under which the landholders there have laboured and lived for the last ""fifty years. If , having done so, he conies back and tells us that those who are cultivating the cane-fields of Queensland should not be controlled by an agreement, and that this great national industry should be thrown once more into the hands of the Colonial Sugar. Refining Company, I shall say - I that he does not possess the degree of in telligence for which I now give him credit. If there is in this Parliament today any representative of Queensland who, knowing the conditions of the sugar industry, and knowing hew the cane, producers in that State have been robbedI used' the word "" robbed "" deliberatelyThe two by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, is yet prepared to allow this great national industry to be thrown once more into the hands of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, he is hot afit and proper, man to represent the industry. No doubt there are in th® southern Statesthose who contend that we are paying too great a price for our sugar, but if the industry is handed over to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company we shall continue to pay a big price for it . In the short statement that he made on the subject today the Prime Minister said that his Government intended to control the sugar industry in a way that he would set out very clearly later on. I gathered from his remarks that it was proposed to impose an import duty on sugar-that , by that means, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company would be allowed to take control of the industry and the sugar supplies of this country in order that the people might obtain cheap sugar. But an import duty on blackgrown sugar, no matter what that duty may be, will not solve the problem, because today every one recognises that the whole of the sugar business of the country as controlled by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Sugar is grown in Java and other places with the assistance of black labour employed at 2s. or 3s. a day, and living under conditions that represent practical slavery. It is useless in the circumstances to say that the imposition of an extra duty of l d . or 2d. per lb. on black-grown sugar will solve the whole problem and insure te look a supply of cheap sugar to the people of Australia. I intimate, right here that novote of mine will be given to enable the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to once more obtain control of the sugar industryof this, country. Dr MiAioNSY - I would put tbem in gaol if I bad the power.",64
113,Mr MCNEILL,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"-There are men .in - gaol today, I venture to :say, for lesser crimes than some that have been committed by .the company. I wish briefly to supplement what has been .said by the honourable member for Adelaide .(Mr Yates) regarding the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister stated that a number of pastoralists and gentlemen representing mining industries in the Northern Territory are at present in Melbourne er about to arrive horc, and it is the intention of the 'Government to consult with them as to the best ways andmeans of settling the Northern Territory. I have lived in Queensland for a number of years, and have travelled through the centre of Australia. In view of the fact that the Queensland Government .have already a railway running from the port of Townsville duewest to Cloncurry, and that - there is a line constructed from Port Darwin past Pine Creek, and is view also of the fact that Mr Crompton Wood, the Britisb - cotton expert, has told us that in the cotton industry we have one of the greatest assets of the couutry, J say that 'we - shou'l-d be doing wrong to the peopleof the north - and of Australia if we were to again renew the pastoral leases of the Northern Territory. The lessees in the first instance socured .their land for something like 2s. 6d, per annum per square mile.",65

If railway communication is provided wo may have, a few more pastoralists in the Northern Territory, .but that will not settlo the great empty space we possess there, .and which.
