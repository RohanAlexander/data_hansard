To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate and the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Respresentatives in Parliament assembled the peddon of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That restoration of provisions that applied prior to the 1978-79 Budget is of vital concern to offset the rising cost of goods and services. The reason advanced by the Government for yearly payments 'that the lower level of inflauon made twice-yearly payments inappropriate' is not valid. Great injury will be caused to 920,000 aged, invalid, widows and supporting parents, who rely solely on the pension or whose income, other than the pension, is $6 or less per week.

The Lithuanian nation accepted Christianity in 1251. By 1386 most of the Lithuanian State had cepted Christianity and Western European culture.

NA Notice of Motion INTEREST RATES",25
8,Mr HAYDEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Prime Minister a question concerning his recent denial that he promised a reduction in interest rates of 2 per cent over a 12-month period during the 1977 election campaign. Does he recall his firm commitment at Chadstone, Melbourne, on and that as much as possible 2 December 1977 that interest rates would come down 2 per cent in the following 12 months and his further statement 'It is a target that can be and will be achieved'? In view of these facts will he now acknowledge that claims by himself and the Treasurer that he capable of supporting military acdid not promise to reduce interest rates by 2 per cent in a year were false? Finally, since he has failed to live up to that promise can he now give an unqualified assurance that home loan and overdraft rates will not increase in line with recent increases in bond rates at the official and market level?",25
9,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The definitive statement. I made about this matter indicated that some important interest rates could come down by as much as 2 per cent. That statement was accurate when it was made. As a statement it remains accurate. The words were precise. There is a great capacity in the Austrahan Labor Party to use different words, attribute a different meanof a conference of governing to a statement and then claim that something has altered. In the course of last year interst rates came down substantially-in the longer term bond rates by 1.4 per cent. In the housing area interest rates have come down by 1 per cent. To all home borrowers in Austraha that indicates a saving of between $130m and $150m a year in terms of their repayments. Against the total circumstances with which the Government was faced that was a very considerable achievement. In the course of 1978 and in the early part of 1979 interest rates in the United Kingdom and the United States have increased by as much as 4 per cent or 6 per cent. Interest rates in the United States and the United Kingdom have increased very substantially since November. It is idle to suggest that interest rates in Australia can be set without total awareness of or concern for what is happening in other parts of the world. Over a year ago there was an expectation that inflation would continue to fall in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has not. The monetary policies that those countries pursue clearly have some implications for us. What has happened in Australia is remarkable. Over a period in which interest rates in the United States and the United Kingdom have beenrisingsubstantially by and large there have been substantial and significant falls in interest rates in Austraha, underlying the strength of this Government's economic policies. I think the Leader of the Opposition should note that whereas up to September of last year he was seeking to undermine the strength of the Austrahan dollar, only a few days ago he made it quite plain that the Australian dollar is much stronger than it has been for a long time. He indicated that, if anything, it is undervalued. That in itself is a tribute to our policies, and I thank the honourable gentleman for it. NA",25
10,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,VISITS TO ASEAN COUNTRIES,"My question is I must addressed to the Minister for Special Trade Repposition, resentations. Has the Minister seen reports referdo ring to the need for more visits by Ministers Asia, particularly to the countries Association of South East Asian Nations? Will the Minister be visiting these countries?",26
11,Mr GARLAND,VISITS TO ASEAN COUNTRIES,"I did see in this morning's newspapers reports of a speech yesterday by Leader of the Opposition at the conference to promote Australian exports. One would have thought that this would be a bipartisan occasion, but the Leader of the Opposition did revert to criticism of the Government's efforts in trade in increasing exports. He said in the course ofhis remarks that I had made only one brief visit to ASEAN country when the fact is that I visited four of the capitals for two or three days each. He must know that the Government has had, from the Prime Minister down, a number of rninisters visiting countries in the region and in the Middle East. The Deputy Prime Minister was there recently.",26
12,Dr KLUGMAN,VISITS TO ASEAN COUNTRIES,There have been plenty of trips.,26
13,Mr GARLAND,VISITS TO ASEAN COUNTRIES,"I am glad to have the honourable member's confirmation of that because from reading the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition one would never guess that that was the case. Those visits are on record. Future visits will be made as necessary. The Government has made a big effort to discuss bilateral trade matters and to expand trade. It has sent overseas senior trade officials. The Trade Commissioner Service has been active, as have many compames and firms. As to visits to Europe, it surely cannot have escaped the honourable gentleman's notice that the multilateral trade negotiations, which I hope are approaching a conclusion after having been going on since 1973, are being conducted very largely in Europe. Surely we have to attend those discussions; the Leader of the Opposition would hardly suggest that we stay away. Finally, it is clear from our negotiations with the European Economic Community that our twin objectives of, firstly, access for Australian products, to which we are entitled, and, secondly and importantly, pressure for a decrease in the EEC subsidised exports of commodities and products are most important to us. If we want to build up our trade in the region, which seems to have the Opposition's support, clearly the practice of the EEC in undercutting our commercial arrangements, whether they be present or future arrangements, is a very important aspect of building up trade in the region and elsewhere. So say that yesterday the Leader of the Opin his anxiety to criticise everything we in relation to trade, displayed a negative to Labor policy and one which is certainly against comprising the Australia's interest. NA",26
14,Mr HAYDEN,INTEREST RATES,"My question, which is directed the to the Prime Minister, follows the question I asked him a few moments ago. He will recall saying in his reply to that question that when he gave a firm undertaking to reduce interest rates his by two per cent he was referring to only some and undefined important interest rates. Does he recall saying at Chadstone on 2 December- I quote an him exactly-that he was talking about rates that direcdy affected people, such as bank lending and home lending rates. Why did he fail to honour the promise to reduce those interest rates by two per cent before the 12-month period which he had stipulated had expired? More importantly, I ask him whether he will now give an unqualified assurance that home loan and overdraft rates will not increase in line with the recent increases in bond rates at the official and market level.",26
15,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTEREST RATES,"The honourable Party gentleman asks the same question again. The were definitive statement. I made on this matter indicated that some important interest rates could fall by as much as two per cent during the year. Quite plainly, what happens within Austraha as well as what happens overseas affects interest rates in this country and the honourable gentleman well knows that. The honourable gentleman also well knows that kind of pohcies he has been advocating over last few weeks would lead to a great and sigthus nificant increase in interest rates. He has there should be additional Government expenditure of $800m. That is the pohcy he had at the time of the last Budget. Presumably he means for the rest of this financial year. Therefore ditional expenditure would be at the rate $2,000m a year. He has also said that all firms taking on additional labour should be subsidised to the extent of the unemployment benefit. That would cost untold millions of dollars, and quite plainly the inflationaryfinanceneeded to cover that would involve a substantial increase in interest rates. Against the background of inflation in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America rising significantly in the course of last year and interest rates in those two countries rising by as much as four to six per cent, the duction in interest rates in Austraha was a very substantial achievement. The objective of the Government will be to pursue policies that will enable its interest rates to resume their downcome ward movement at some time in the future; but that depends on a number of factors. This Government will pursue its path of reoverseas establishing the basic relativities in Australia, getting inflation down and getting profitabtiity back into Australian enterprise. Mr Armitage- I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister was asked a specific question by the Leader of the Opposition as whether home loan interest rates and overdraft rates would be increased. I ask that the Prime Minister be required to answer the question specifically instead of indulging in his usual evasiveness.",27
16,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,"The honourable member has made his point. The Prime Minister must remain relevant to the question, but I cannot require him to answer it in any particular manner at all, let alone in the way required by the honourable member for Chifley.",27
17,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTEREST RATES,"I think it ought to be understood that before there was a Labor Government between 1972 and 1975 there low interest rates in this country. Because of the incompetence of the Treasurers in the Labor Administration, one of whom is the present Leader of the Opposition, interest rates rose to very high levels and inflation became imbedded within Australian society. Not having learned any lesson through that time, the Leader of the Opposition has continued to advocate pohcies the which would push inflation higher and which the would prevent inflation from coming down and interest rates moving down as they have said that over the course of the last year. Mr Armitage-Answe r the question.",27
18,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTEREST RATES,"If the honourable adgentleman would only wait and Usten! But I of think members of the Opposition have no interest in the answer. What concerns them more than anything else at the moment is that the signs of emerging economic recovery in this country are becoming evidence for all to see, and the increasing confident in manufacturing industry and in rural industry is something which obviously leaves the Australian Labor Party disjointed and uncomfortable. One of the factors that affect interest rates is the question of wage restraint. This is another area of pohcy where the Leader of the Opporesition seems now to be deserting the Austrahan Labor Party and joining the ranks of the Government, because for the firsttimein three years he has spoken in favour of wage restraint. We welhis advocacy in that cause, even if it is a responsibiUty that I had not expected of him. If there is adequate wage restraint and if poUcies do not cause rates to move too far, I can see no reason why the recent changes that have been made should affect the interest rates applying to individuals with housing loans or overdrafts, but inevitably one cannot predict what will happen in the future. The decisions of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Comto mission are obviously relevant to this matter. One of the factors that led to a need for some rise in interest rates was the four per cent wage decision of the Arbitration Commission. NA  whether he is aware of the importance of the Redcliff petrochemical project to the future of South Australia, particularly as there have been allegations by South Australian State Ministers that the Federal Government was responsible for delays in the Loan Council approval offunds for the Redcliff project? Are those allegations correct?",27
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,REDCLIFF PETROCHEMICAL PROJECT,"After the anthe nouncement by ICI Austraha Ltd of major petroing chemical developments in New South Wales Victoria I was somewhat surprised by statements from South Australia-fro m the former South Australian Premier also-indicatin g that the Commonwealth Government was responsible whether for the Redcliff project not going ahead. I was surprised because the Commonwealth Government ment had given maximum co-operation to South Australia. Indeed, it was the Western Australian Premier, Sir Charles Court, who first advocated the infrastructure finance proposal which would enable basic infrastructure to be provided by States on their responsibihty. In the Loan Counfall cil the Commonwealth gave full support to Charles in getting that matter expedited through examination by Commonwealth and State interests officials. As soon as the work could be done through the Commonwealth and State officials the matter, as a question of pohcy, was put to Loan Council. Very soon after the policy had been determined Commonwealth and State had officials again examined the projects to be put forward, one of which was Redcliff. There was of certainly no loss of time on the part of the Compricing monwealth in relation to these matters. Indeed, was a policy that we pressed urgently and vigorously. I can remember that on one significant occasion I suggested to Mr Hudson from South Australia that he should seek to get answer as early as possible from Dow Chemical (Australia) Ltd in relation to Redcliff because my understanding ICI Australia Ltd was well adresult vanced with the examination and development of its own proposal. He knew the impUcations relation to that. He also understood that if the Redcliff project did not proceed because of lack of expedition in getting that answer from Dow Chemical the other major development which might well ensure South Australia's industrial future would be a uranium enrichment plant. believe that is well understood by the South traUan Government. That no doubt explains rational some of the apparent changes of attitude over cent weeks. I only wish the South Australian Government could act in the interests of South Austraha, not imbued by ideology in this matter. NA",28
20,Mr WILLIS,INFLATION,"My question concerns the Prime Minister's repeated assurances to the Australian people that inflation would continue to fall. Is it a fact that for the past year the annual rate of inflation has been around the 8 per cent level and that in the December quarter the increase of 2.3 per cent was the highest quarterly rise for a year? Is the Prime Minister aware that price index of materials used in manufacturindustry increased by 22 per cent in the year and to November last and that for non-imported materials the increase was 32 per cent? In view of these figures and the certainty of inflationary pressures continuing, will he advise the House the Government stands by its Budget estimates of inflation? If not, what are the Govern's current inflation estimates?",28
21,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,"In 1978 inflation was between 7 per cent and 8 per cent and in 1977 it was between 9 per cent and 10 per cent. the That indicates that there was a very substantial over the year before, especially since the Sir Government had taken one courageous decision which was very necessary in the longer term of this country. That decision accounts for the inflation figure that the honourable gentleman mentioned in relation to materials the used. I refer of course to the decision to move Australian fuel prices to world parity. This has enormous success in encouraging oil search in Australia and in encouraging the development Australia's oil reserves. As a direct result of oil decisions and our own policies to encourit age and to provide an incentive to oil search and development Esso-BHP has committed itself to a $ 1,000m research and development program, and that is very much in the national interest. It an means that by the middle 1980's a significant part of the oil available to Austraha will be on coming from reserves proved and developed as a of those poUcies. This would not have occurred under the pricing policies of the Ausin tralian Labor Party. Again, this is a classic example. We know quite well that the policies of Labor killed development investment. Oil search stopped. It has been necessary to have policies that will get this going again and at the same time to encourage a rational use of resources I around Australia. The world would be a better Ausplace if all countries had the same kind of energy policies as have been adopted by rethis Government. But plainly there was a penalty to pay for that in terms of the impact of higher fuel prices in the consumer price index. Beef is another area in which we would have wanted prices to rise. This also has had an impact on the consumer price index. On the information available to me, over a 20 year period the consumer price index has increased at a greater rate than the prices paid to farmers. The result of better beef prices will be in many parts of Austraha and in many rural towns a revival of a kind that is sorely needed. It will give new hope and confidence to many people throughout Austraha as they seek to rebuild their farms and to undertake repairs that have been put aside for many years. Those two factors had a significant effect on the consumer price index during 1978. The fact that, despite those two factors, we were able to reduce inflation significantly in 1978 compared to 1977 is a very remarkable achievement of this Government. NA",28
22,Mr OKEEFE,CRUDE OIL PRICING POLICY,I direct a question to the Minsions. ister for Trade and Resources. Is he aware of serious concern amongst farmers about their competitive position on overseas markets as a renoted sult of higher fuel prices resulting from the Government's crude oil pricing policy? Can the Minister give the House any information about the prices paid for fuel by farmers in Austraha and in other countries?,29
23,Mr ANTHONY,CRUDE OIL PRICING POLICY,"I am concerned, and I think everybody is concerned, that farmers are being inflicted with increases in costs, particularly when they have to compete with other countries. I think that everybody who thinks about the ation recognises that Austraha has to have proper national energy policy-tha at import parity prices. This has been a pohcy which I have advocated for a long period. I have been subjected to a great deal of criticism for supporting that realistic pohcy. A great deal of concern has been expressed the farming community from which I have had very many representations- I am sure many retirement o the r people also have r e c e i v ed might representations-that its prices for fuel as pared with its competitors in other higher. I have asked my Department to examine the price structure in other countries so that I make a comparison. I have been notified that the Trade Development Council, an independent body which advises the Government on export promotion and trade promotion affairs, is examining this question as a result of requests that it has received and that it will be making report. When that report is completed the cil will present it to me. NA",29
24,Mr ARMITAGE,INDEXATION OF PENSIONS,Does the Prime Minister recall his undertaking given in his 1975 election pohcy speech- I nearly said 'screech'-that 'The real value of pensions will be preserved'? Does he not realise that his Government's decision to abolish the six-monthly indexation of pensions and to replace it with 12-monthly indexation means that the real value of pensions has not been preserved? Will he therefore give an undertaking to reintroduce six-monthly indexation of pensions?,29
25,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INDEXATION OF PENSIONS,"The real value of pensions will be preserved through indexation. One needs to have in mind that, during the time when the Labor Government was in office, inflation reached a peak of 19 per cent in one six-monthly period. Inflation was 16 per cent or 17 per cent at the end of the Labor Government's time in office. Having regard to that, quite plainly there was very rapid erosion of the value of penThe pohcy of full indexation once a year wtil preserve the value of pensions. It ought to be that there are some who say that pension adjustments should be put on the same basis as adjustments for wage earners. Quite plainly, on many occasions the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission does not apply fuU 100 per cent indexation for wages and salaries. If pensioners were placed on the same basis as wage earners who receive an adjustment every six months but who only receive that proportion of the change in the cost of living given by the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission, quite plainly pensitusioners would be much worse off than under a a 100 per cent adjustment which is the poticy of t is, pricing oil the Government. NA NA",29
26,Mr NEIL,BENEFITS,Has the Minister for Defence seen by reports of alleged changes to the conditions or tax rates for the commutation of defence force benefits and reports that such changes lead to early resignations? Will the Miniscomter advise the House whether there is any subcountries are stance in these reports?,29
27,Mr KILLEN,BENEFITS,"I have not seen the reports, but can I have heard reports. I regret very much that they have been given circulation. I would say to the honourable gendeman and to the House that there is no proposal whatsoever currently before the Government to disturb in any shape or form the provisions of the Defence Force Retirement a and Death Benefits Act. I took the opportunity Counthis morning to consult my colleagues the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance; they confirmed what I have just said to the House. I would be most grateful if each honourable member would use his very best endeavours to put these rumours to rest for once and for all. NA",29
28,Dr BLEWETT,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Does the Prime Minister recall his 1975 election promise to provide jobs for all who want to work and his 1977 election forecast that unemployment would fall after February 1978 and keep on falling? In view of the fact that the number of registered unemployed has increased by 230,000 since his Government has been in office and is now 61,000 above February last year, will he now admit that in both respects he completely misled the Austrahan people? Can he advise the House how much longer he will continue to apply the economic pohcies that have had such tragic effects on the labour market?",30
29,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The honourable gentleman has a short memory. In 1974-75 the Labor Government increased expenditure by 46 per cent. In that one year alone unemployment rose by 200,000. It was the pohcies of Labor that embedded unemployment within this country. Pohcies of this Government and of its predecessors have enabled a long period of high employment to be maintained. It was under Labor that wage rates rose by about 50 per cent in one two-year period and, that being so, Austrahan industries were priced out of the domestic market; they lost their export markets and people became unemployed in great numbers. Quite plainly, it takes a significanttimeto reassess and re-establish the appropriate balance within an economy so that Austrahan industries can get a larger share of the domestic market and move effectively out into export markets. One of the odd things about members of the Austrahan Labor Party, or perhaps not so odd because one would expect them not to learn, is that the pohcies which have been advocated over the last three years would have resulted in higher and ever higher deficits and in higher and ever higher inflation and interest rates. Indeed, in Labor's time, the long term bond rate rose from 6 per cent to 10 per cent as a result of its policies-the kind of policies being advocated now.",30
30,Mr YOUNG,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I raise a point of order. The question asked by the honourable member for Bonython was this: Did the Prime Minister say in 1975 that only under the Liberals will there be jobs for all those who want them? There are 200,000 people more unemployed now than there were then. That is all we are asking for. You have been in government longer than the Labor Party was in government.",30
31,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,The honourable member for Port Adelaide will resume his seat.,30
32,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It is a question of what kind of pohcies are going to lead again to the job opportunities for all Australians who want to work. This Government is going to pursue pohcies that are working and wtil continue to work, and we will not divert our attention from that.",30
33,Unknown,UNEMPLOYMENT,Opposition members interjecting,30
34,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Mr Speaker, the noise does not matter because people can judge them. It is the only thing that they can do.",30
35,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,I ask honourable members on my left to remain silent. The question has been asked. The right honourable gentleman has arightto answer the question.,30
36,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The policies that this Government has pursued are re-establishing the competitive basis of Austrahan industry. Industries are again moving out into export markets in a way which has not been possible for them for a long time. It is only by being able to sell more that Austrahan industries will be able to employ more people. I fail to understand why the Austrahan Labor Party, up to thetimeof the recent statement by the Leader of the Opposition, continued to encourage policies that would price labour out of the market. At least the President of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions has now started to direct his attention to the problems of those people not in work. He is saying that we must look at the problems of those people not in work and not merely at providing additional benefits for those people now in work. Maybe he has told the Leader of the Opposition that he should embrace part of that philosophy, but it is not what they have done for the last three years. With greater co-operation from the Austrahan Labor Party, in the national interest it may well have been possible to achieve a greater rate of wage restraint, a greater return to competitiveness by Australian industry and greater employment opportunities for Australians. But at long last, after difficult times, there are encouraging signs on the employment front. For several months, the level of overtime worked has been rising in a number of industries. It hasrisenin a way in which it has not done for a number of years. In addition, in the last month or two of last year the level of manufacturing employment and civilian employment started to rise again. There are indications of a turn around in the level of notification of unfilled vacancies. Even the Leader of the Opposition has indicated that the economy is in the early stages of recovery. If it is in the early stages of recovery through our policies, it would seem odd to say that this is the very moment to change those pohcies as the Leader of the Opposition has been suggesting. DOMESTIC AIRLINE INDUSTRY: COST",30
37,Mr BURR,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Can the Minister for Transport inform the House what rate of cost recovery the Government imposes on the domestic airline industry for air navigation charges, airport terminal rentals and the aviation fuel levy? What contribution does the Government seek from domestic airline operators for airport capital development? What effect does the Government's pohcy on cost recovery have on domestic air fares? What effect does the Government's pohcy of cost recovery have on matters relating to air safety?",31
38,Mr NIXON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I will take the last part of the question first. There is no relevance or tie between cost recovery and air safety. The fact is that in respect of air safety the Government has acted on the advice of the safety experts in the Department of Transport. They have put forward a submission regarding changes that might be made to facilities affecting air safety. There is absolutely notiebetween the program of cost recovery and the level of investment in air safety. In reality, only 4 per cent of the direct operating costs of the airlines are taken up by air navigation charges. There is currently a suggestion in the community that air navigation charges are one of the reasons for high domestic air fares. I think that the 4 per cent contribution puts that suggestion very much to rest. Let me deal with the level of capital developports ment that might be charged against the airlines. This is relevant only through the cost recovery program that I have just mentioned. There direct correlation between levels of money invested in a particular year and the costs imposed on the airlines. The costs are recouped over a period of years through the air navigation charges. I ought to make this point very clearly to the House: Whilst domestic air fares are said be high in this country, figures are available demonstrate that on a cents per kilometre basis the air fares compare more than favourably with those in many other countries. The fact is that navigation charges are not a significant aspect the increase in air fares. Following the Governhas ment's changes in fuel pohcy and the increase the fuel tax that was passed on to the airlines, think the cost of fuel used by airlines increased from about 11 per cent to 15 per cent of direct operating costs. But the main operating cost, of course, is the high price of labour in this country. NA",31
39,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SANKEY LITIGATION,"My question is RECOVERY directed to the Prime Minister and refers to the Utigation, known as the 'Sankey case', against three former Ministers of the Labor Government and the fact that legal costs in that case will amount to well over a quarter of a million dollars. In view of the fact that the Government has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money in that case, I ask the Prime Minister why the prosecution was not taken over by the Government and terminated. I further ask what mquiries the Government has made, and what evidence is available, to rebut the very serious inference that Mr Sankey's costs were financed, either directly or indirectly, by persons closely associated with the Government.",31
40,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SANKEY LITIGATION,"I have no knowledge whatsoever of Mr Sankey, his motivation or his finances. At the early stages of this matter, of course, as the honourable gentleman would know, the Government made it plain to the defendants that it would meet their legal costs. That was made plain very early in the proceedings. As to the rest, I think I should get a full and complete answer for the honourable gentleman from the Attorney-General. I undertake to do that as soon as possible. NA",31

47,Mr ANTHONY,COAL EXPORTS TO JAPAN,"Yesterday, at the confercraft ence which launched Export Now, I did speak market opportunities around the world. I spoke of the enormous potential of China. China obvipeople ously, because of the dimensions of its market, offers one of the most exciting prospects on now that it has embarked upon a course of modernisation which will in time hft its Uving standards. Having just been to the Middle East with a group of Austrahan businessmen and officials, I have seen the massive pubUc works programs, greatly increased Uving standards and changing dietary habits that have resulted from the newlyacquired wealth of the oil producing countries. Enormous opportunities exist immediately for Australian industry. Infrastructure work on ports, railroads and water facilities among others, is under way now. The next stage will be the development of secondary industry. I beheve that Australian industry representatives should be in the Middle East looking at the opportunities available. The task will not be Customs are different; the area has a harsh But I am sure that, if Australian industry persists, it will find that enormous opportunities available.

48,Mr HURFORD,COAL EXPORTS TO JAPAN,"I address my question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. When does the Government intend to announce the cision concerning General Motors-Holden's Ltd's request for an early introduction of complementation scheme into the present motor vehicle local content plans? How does the Minispurposes ter try to explain away his November statement that the plans would not be altered? If the Government is determined to pursue complementation and thus the granting of export credits, will the Minister allay the underHouse. standable fears of thousands working in motor vehicle parts industry by announcing now, among other things, that there will be a Umit five per cent on the allowance of export credits, that a reversion committee, so recently distive banded by the Government, will be reborn to supervise any changes in independent parts proentitlements duction, and that export credits will be granted only in return for a guarantee of continuing perthe formance so that disruption to parts manufacin turers in particular is minimised?",33
49,Mr LYNCH,COAL EXPORTS TO JAPAN,"I thank the honourable gentledustries man for the question that he has posed. Let say at the outset that the Government is not being stampeded by General Motors-Holden's Ltd or indeed by anyone else in taking what will be a very significant decision not simply for automotive industry but for Australian industry at large. General Motors has stated pubUcly that it requires by the end of February- a date which I understand as late as this morning cannot exceeded so far as the company is concernedpositive decision by the Government on the troduction of export facititation programs into the current motor plan. I want to assure the House, and the honour the able gentleman in particular, that the issues which he behind this concept have been the ject of very significant and detailed consideration by officers of my Department and by me for very long period, in fact going back to the early months of 1978. The proposalfirstcame to me confidence in the early days of January and since that time has been subject to the most thorough examination of any industrial proposal that I can recall, certainly of those coming across my table since I have been the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Given the significance of the proposal and the particular areas to which the honourable gentleman has referred, the Government has, of course, a national obligation to consider all the issues. In doing so, it would not be unmindful of any statements which I may or may not have PLANS made in the past concerning the Government's motor vehicle plan. I mention the fact now that the decision has not been taken by Cabinet. But dethe honourable gentleman, in raising the question of the 5 per cent local content plan, may not a have been aware of the statement which I issued last night and which was designed to provide, for of an informed public discussion, the minimum elements of a package which would permit the company to proceed with its program. I think I should mention those elements to the Firstly, provision is to be made in the the motor vehicle manufacturing plan for export credits to be available to offset plan imports on a of dollar for dollar basis, thereby generating additional by-law entitlements. Secondly, an effecscheme is to be in operation not later than 1 January 1982. Thirdly, additional plan by-law arising from export credits are to be available on a dollar for dollar basis, initially to extent of five local content percentage points, 1982-this was one of the points queried by the honourable gentleman-wit h subsequent increases to be determined after inquiry by the InAssistance Commission. Fourthly, prome vision in the Government's passenger motor vehicle assistance arrangements applying after 1984 will provide for no less favourable assistance to facilitate exports than provided by expon the credit provisions which may be introduced into the current motor vehicle manufacturing plan. I have indicated that the matter has had be exhaustive discussion, going back as far as the a early months of 1978.1 reiterate that point and I inindicate again that the matter has been before me since the early days of this year. All the constituent parties in the industry covering the vehicle builders, the component manufactures and trade unions have been involved in a general dialogue about export complementation during subthe second half of last year. The honourable gentleman would be aware of the visit I undera took overseas in, I think, November. I had detailed discussions then with all the principals in of the five manufacturing compames. Quite frankly, what General Motors is seeking to do in this country, in attempting to initiate a program soon, is to integrate a significant part of its Australian manufacturing capacity into the concept of the world car, which would be well known to the honourable gentleman. I assure the House that all the aspects that have been drawn to my attention by the honourable gentleman will be thoroughly canvassed. The Government will have regard to what it has said in the past, but more particularly, it will have regard to what it beheves to be the right decision for the industry and for the country. NA NA",33

81,Mr HASLEM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On 22 January the Canberra Times printed a front page article headed 'Allegations upset Pine Lodge staff'. The article commenced: Female staff at Pine Lodge in Barton were extremely upset by allegations that the premises were a brothel, the owner of Pine Lodge, Mr Stan Biggs, told a public protest meeting today. The meeting was called by local residents to protest about noise and other problems they associate with Pine Lodge and to discuss redevelopment in Barton. It was attended by about 80 people, including the Member for Canberra, Mr Haslem. I do not take issue with the text of the article, which is accurate and well written. However, I take exception to a photograph appearing with the article. The photo carries the wording: 'The Member for Canberra, Mr Haslem, left, and the owner of Pine Lodge, Mr Stan Biggs, at yesterday's meeting.' The appearance conveyed by the photo is that Mr Biggs is standing beside me and whispering into my ear in a most conspiratorial manner. On visiting the Canberra Times photographic section I looked at all the photos taken at the protest meeting. It is quite obvious from such photos that I was not standing next to Mr Biggs or that he was whispering in my ear. He was, in fact, standing several feet behind me at the time, but the use of a telephoto lens and the particular way the photo was cropped leads to a misleading distortion. I am particularly upset at the wrong impression given to the people of Canberra by this photo. Mr Bigg's is facing very serious charges in relation to attempting to bribe a police officer and there is no doubt that prostitution and illegal gambling is taking place at Pine Lodge on a well organised basis. Rumours are rife in Canberra concerning the involvement of Sydney gangsters, stand-over tactics and graft.",36

91,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NAMIBIA PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"by leave-The problem of Namibia is one of long standing. It dates from South UNTAG Africa's refusal, at the end of World War II , enter into a trusteeship agreement over the mandated territory of South West Africa and claim to sovereignty over that territory. South Africa has continued to administer Namibia deAustralia's spite the United Nations' decision in 1966, that South Africa's mandate should be withdrawn. Concerted United Nations efforts achieving self-determination and independence for Namibia began in 1972. These efforts were unsuccessful and, in 1974, the United Nations adopted measures seeking immediate and unthe conditional South African withdrawal. In 1975, South Africa officially recognised international status of the territory and decided to initiate its own discussions in Namibia offers towards a constitutional settlement. The five Western members of the Security Council past (United Kingdom, United States of America, France, West Germany, Canada) in 1977 have advised South Africa that its constitutional posals arising out of these consultations would not gain international approval. Following advice discussions were initiated between the 'Five' and South Africa on how to achieve early and peaceful independence for Namibia through an internationally acceptable settlement. DisNamibia cussions were also held with SWAPO-the South West African People's Organisation. These talks led, early in 1978, to the formulation of the present plan now agreed to by both the South African Government and SWAPO. The plan envisaged, in essence, free elections for Namibia, under United Nations supervision and control for the purpose of electing a constituent bly to draw up and adopt a constitution for an independent Namibia. The plan, and proposals by the United Nations Secretary-General for its implementation, were later accepted by the United Nations Security Council as a basis for internationally acceptable settlement that would give Namibia independence. The establishment of UNTAG-the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group-is part of the plan. Elections are scheduled to be held some seven months cal after UNTAG's deployment, and independence operate following about five months later. Since 1977, Australia has received a number of informal soundings about a contribution peacekeeping force in Namibia. Representations were made to us at different times by the United Nations, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and by representatives of the British and American Governments. In July last year, the United Secretariat made an approach inquiring whether Australia could provide elements for the logistics force. In the light of recent into dications that the United Nations would be seekold ing to establish UNTAG very shortly, the its Government has been actively considering a contribution that would be consistent with international obligations, its support for an early settlement of the Namibia problem and support for the Western and United Nations towards proposals for achieving it. Southern Africa is a region of considerable strategic importance to Australia and, indeed, to entire free world. In the Government's view we ought to do what we reasonably can to promote conditions there which will bring about the stability and so contribute to security in the widest sense. The Western initiative on Namibia the opportunity for this and it is thus vital that it should be successful. There has been in the great turmoil in Africa. Many African problems have been seen to be intractable. Now we an opportunity to settle one of those probprolems peacefully and in a manner which will deal jusdy with all conflicting interests. We must not this let this opportunity slip by. It has been no easy task for the United Nations to put together a peacekeeping force for acceptable to all concerned. Not all of its components have yet been settled. But it has been made entirely clear to us that an Australian contribution would be widely welcomed and, in particular, would be acceptable both to the South African Government and to SWAPO. It has also been put to us that an Austrahan component would contribute significantly to the assemeffectiveness of the force. The Government has considered this question on a number of occasions in the past. It has weighed carefully all the issues which are relan evant to it. In coming to the judgment that Austraha should offer to make a contribution to United Nations peacekeeping in Namibia we have regarded as paramount the importance of having this Western initiative succeed, the politisignificance of the area in which the force will and the firm belief that a successful outcome in Namibia will bring new hope for stabUity and progress in what has been a sorely troubled continent. A successful conclusion to the to a problem of Namibia should give renewed hope that other African problems can be resolved by reaspnable means. The Government has carefuUy weighed the intemauonal circumstances in which Australia finds! itself at this dme. It has especially taken into account present conflicts in South East Asia. It has concluded above aU that now is a dme for Australia fully to assume its international responsibilities. It is not a time for us to stand back and refuse to be involved because the problem tb be settled Ues in a distant continent and may appear to be of no immediate concern to us. We are fully aware that the conflict in Indo China involves grave risks to the region and to the world as a whole. We have made this clear by our recent actions. Some would argue that at a time of| danger and difficulty in Asia we should not participate in this international initiative in Africa.| The Government argues to the contrary-w e are part of the wider world. We have a real capacity to contribute to the success of this United Nations and Western incapacity. itiative. We believe that this is above all a when our sense of responsibihty in international affairs ana our commitment to the settlement disputes oy peaceful means needs to be firmly ever. underlined. This is atimenot for withdrawal but for participation, for the acceptance of a commitment which is within our capacity. If we are not prepared to participate in an initiative sponsored, amongst others, by the United States and Great Britain, adopted by the United Nations and accepted by the conflicting parties, how can we expect others to fulfil their obtigations to act responsibly and co-operatively in efforts to settle disputes and restore stability areas of disturbance and conflict? The composition of the United Nations force in Nambia has not yet, as I said before, been finally determined. The United Kingdom has ereignty already announced its proposed participation in UNTAG and it is expected that contributors wtil include a number of other western countries; there will also be African, Asian, Latin American and possibly east European contributions. The element which we will offer to the United Nations for inclusion in the force is an engineer contingent of250 officers and men, together with a national headquarters and support element of 50. If accepted, this unit will bility of providing a variety of engineering services in support of the operational battaUons. give This role will be vital to the success of the force. It is planned that the United Nations operation strument in Namibia will be for a period It is intended that the deployment of the Australian contingent will be for that length of time. Our defence forces have been given instructions to pay the fullest regard to the safety of Australian personnel who may be deployed to Namibia. We cannot say they wiU not face any dangers. There are risks involved in any peacekeeping operation. But all aspects of the situation in which the force will operate have been given the most careful consideration and the risks our men wtil face are assessed by the National Assessments Board as low. Australia has played a part in a number of United Nations peacekeepmg operations in the past. It is at present contributing to them in the Middle East, in Cyprus and in Kashmir. We cannot be expected, nor will we be asked, to contribute to all future United Nations operations. But we believe our decision to offer a contribution to the Namibia force is fuUy consistent with the policy adopted in the past by this and earUer governments. It is a contribution well within our It is therightdecision. It has been taken time in a conscious awareness of our international responsibUities at a time when such awareness, of by ourselves and by others, is needed more than I present the following paper: Namibia Peacekeeping Force-Ministeria l Statement, 20 February 1979. Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",37
92,Mr HAYDEN,NAMIBIA PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"Australi a should not shirk its rein sponsibUity to the international order of nations and most of all it should make its fair contribution to international agencies such as the United Nations where the role of such an agency is designed to protect the independence and sovof a nation or to establish that independence and sovereignty where it properly belongs. We are of course concerned internationally that we have a responsibihty to therightsand aspirations of people in the world. Accordingly, the Australian Labor Party supports the general principles behind the United Nations' intentions in Namibia. But let me quote from the Labor Party's pohcy so there is absolutely no doubt or ambiguity about the Labor Party's commitment. In the foreign affairs sections it says that the have the responsiLabor Party would: firm and unwavering support to the United Nations and its agencies and to the United Nations Charter, and make every effort to secure the United Nations as an effective infor justice and peace and political, social and econof twelve months. omic advancement; On that basis we are clearly committed to the general principle implicit in the objectives of the United Nations in Namibia, but I have to express some reservation about the detail in practice. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) acknowledged in the concluding parts of his statement that there are risks involved in any peacekeeping operation. That would be obviously acknowledged by any thinking person. I want to be assured about one thing in thetightof certain newspaper speculation based, it seems, on informed information available from the Department of Defence. It seems that perhaps the security of Australian troops going to Namibia may not be as effective as it ought to be. Of course there are risks and risks have to be taken when this sort of operation is embarked upon, but therisksought to be minimised as much as is practicable. I mention that because I feel it is a shame in a matter such as this where there is so obviously so much room for accord between both sides of the House that the Prime Minister could not have taken the opportunity to have the Opposition briefed on this particular point. There is no doubt, of course, that the United Nations needs to intervene in Namibia. It needs to intervene to ensure that there is a smooth sition to independence. It needs to intervene to ensure beyond any doubt that free elections will take place in Namibia. The adrninistration of South Africa in that country has been illegal and was declared as such in 1966 by the United Nations. Until the United Nations intervened, it was the venue, as was the Union of South Africa more generally, of the most odious, racist and repressive security laws-apartheid-of anywhere in the world. More recently in an effort to head off the United Nations' initiative in this regard the South African Government organised an election in Namibia- a bogus election. So that it could control the outcome of the election it estabUshed a purely bogus poltiical party, the Democratic TurnhaUe AlUance. It then sought successfully to purchase the English and German language newspapers in Namibia at a cost of some $2m using secret government poltiical funds. Obviously what happened then was that the newspapers were used to disseminate heavily prejudiced propaganda in support of the Democratic TurnhaUe Alliance, which of course, I ought to mention, although it is unnecessary, was exclusively pro-South African Government in its outlook- a poltiical party which was fabricated around conservative white and conservative black interests. Having purchased the papers and embarked upon this campaign of political conditioning in the community, the Government of South Africa also undertook a fairly generous spending campaign in support of the DTA, spending, according to some accounts, at least a half a million dollars a month, again from secret government sources. It is not surprising that the DTA would have won the election in the event the South West Africa People's Organisation did not participate and in the circumstances quite sensibly. Why there is a need for a United Nations presence is fairly obvious when the enormous wealth which is generated in Namibia is recognised. Exports of minerals and diamonds last year exceeded $800m in value. Because Namibia or, as it has been known, South West Africa has been completely incorporated within the economy of the Union of South Africa, it is the South African Government which has been draining off the benefits of that income that has been generated. I am advised by the Library research section in this Parliament that the total benefit which is directed from the South African Government's budget as a subsidy for public purposes in Namibia is only $60m a year, a mere bagateUe according to the enormous wealth tranalready being generated in Namibia. Furthermore the wealth that is currendy being generated there in an area the size of New South Wales with a population of about 850,000 people is much less than it is expected will be generated in the next few years. So the ploy the South African Government is quite clear. Having failed in its effort to have imposed on Namibia a bogus election result it is seeking to bring about, if it possibly can, a situation in which it will heavily influence through its control and influence on the DTA, so that in the final upshot it will still be able to drain off a great deal of wealth which is generated from that very wealthy area of Africa. In the circumstances we, of course, wholeheartedly support the United Nations' objectives as a general principle. We need reassurance on a couple of points. We need reassurance on the security of Australian military personnel who will be sent to that country as part of the United Nations' undertaking there. We would like some reassurances about thefirmnesswith which the Australian Government is to demand certain constitutional safeguards to protect the people of Namibia and its constitution from any erosion or any attempt to subvert it for commercial purposes by the country of South Africa.

NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",38
93,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) proposing that a definite matter of pubhc importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's creation of record levels of unemployment. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",40
94,Mr YOUNG,UNEMPLOYMENT,"That this Government is the greatest bunch of incompetent economic managers that this country has ever seen is no better exemplified than by the way the Government has deliberately allowed unemployment to build to the record level of last week, when 493,000 people in this country were registered as being out of work. That represents the highest number of people without jobs that has ever been recorded in the history of Australia. At the height of the Depression there were 480,000 people out of work. In 1978 under Malcolm Fraser 493,000 Australians were registered as unemployed. This has been done deliberately, as can be easdy proven. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, certain terms are not allowed to be used in this Parliament to describe people who say things outside Parliament and then do not carry them through. What do people outside think about a Prime Minister who in his first elecdon campaign as the Prime Minister of this country in 1975 made the following promise: Only under the Liberals will there be jobs for everybody who wants to work. In 1977 at another elecuon period he had the following to say: Our consistent economic strategy is getting Australia back to work and from February there will be a sustained and Bill long-term reduction in unemployment in Australia. What do people say about a man who will make statements such as those at elections and then do absolutely nothing about them in administering the economy of this country? Just look at the brief record of this Government which now has been in office longer than the Labor Government of which it is so critical. This Government is now in its fourth year of office. In January 1977, 354,000 people were out of work; in January 1978, 445,000 people were out of work; and, in 1979, 493,000 people are out of work in this country. This level of unemployment is an utter disgrace for any government. And the Prime Minister says 'our economic strategy is working'. In an interview which appeared last week in the international magazine Business Week, the Prime Minister pointed out that one example of evidence that the economy was picking up and that there would be more jobs was that Austraha was exporting ladies underwear to Japan. A close check of our exports of that commodity to Japan shows that we are exporting exactly $2,000 worth of pantyhose. That is the evidence given by the Prime Minister of this country of more jobs being available. Last year he pretended that the export of chairs to Sweden was going to get us out of trouble. A quick check of the number of chairs that we were sending to Sweden shows that we were sending 278 chairs at a total cost of $7,000. This was another example that the Prime Minister gave to show that Australia is getting out of trouble. Half a rnilhon Australians are now unemployed. A further 250,000 have given up all hope of finding work. They are aU victims of the Prime Minister's crank economic policies. Last September, the previous Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Street, acknowledged that the Government was deliberately creating a permanent pool of unemployed. So, he was sacked by the Prime Minister and replaced with perhaps the greatest cosmetic politician this country has ever seen and had the misfortune to tolerate. His record of arrogance and cold heartedness over the past few months is astonishing. It would be laughable if its effect were not so grave. In December the present Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Viner, offered these comments on our unemployed youth. He said: Get off your tails and start hunting for jobs because Government is not going to hand them to you. The Governand ment is philosophically opposed I think we should put his Uttle Press statement where it belongs-in the trash can. He further stated: If you can mobilise a positive atdtude among adults as well as the young that is when you start to bring some ure on young people who are more content to live than get off their tails and find work. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, the latest addition to this role by the Prime Minister, thinks that 197,200 unemployed young people are dole bludgers. That is the attitude of the Minister. For every vacancy registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service, there are presently 28 unemployed people under 21 years of age unable to find work. In Charlestown on the North Coast of New South Wales last week, 1,400 people queued up for 121 vacant positions at a new K-Mart being built in that area. Honourable members on this side of the House-as I am sure honourable members on the other side of the House-ca n relate dozens of similar instances. In Tea Tree Gully in the north-east suburbs of Adelaide the week before last there was a similar incident when 1,000 people lined up for 100 jobs. The way the people are lining up forjobs is more reminiscent of the cattle yards of Chicago. But that is the position here in Australia in 1979. Not only does the Minister blame the unemployed for this predicament; he is also promoting division within the community by attempting to get employed against unemployed, father against son.and mother against daughter as though parents and their children have responsibility for creating jobs in the community. Apparently the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs is not the only member of Cabinet to espouse this selfish philosophy. The Minister for Education, Senator Carrick-a n enUghtened fellow, perhaps best known for his attempts to reintroduce sectarianism into education funding-sai d on 4 February that our young people lack motivation and have no goals in life. Not to be outdone a week later the millionaire Minister from the Gold Coast, the Minister for Finance, Mr Eric Robinson, weighed in with his comment. He said: There are a number of young people in this countiy who do not want to work. Down on the beach they are fit and tanned and look well. They are getting unemployment benefits and life is quite easy. Such is the audacity of a person such as the Minister for Finance who lives in luxury. I do not the begrudge him that. He Uves on the Isle of Capri it upsets him and disturbs his Ufe style when to creating jobs for people. he sees people on the beaches who perhaps are unemployed as he drives from Surfers Paradise to Coolangatta to get the aeroplane to go wherever he has to travel. What about the people who do not have work because of this Governpress-ment's life style? This situation reflects the mad off the dolementaUty of the Prime Minister. We have to blame the people who are out of work and not in any circumstance allow the argument to be appointed turned against the Government. This Government is engaged in a despicable campaign against the unemployed to help to disguise its complete neglect of unemployment. Therefore, it was not surprising that, when the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs released the November unemployment figures showing that 400,000 people could not find work, he described the situadon as 'reasonably satisfactory'. The Minister thinks that 400,000 people out of work is reasonably satisfactory. I suppose that he thinks that the Januaryfigureof half a million unemployed was an excellent result as far as the Government's economic policies are concerned. He must have taken great pride in the result because since November he has announced a great number of so-called job initiatives which will not create one extra job, but more importantly will cause further division within our community. The Voluntary Youth Community Service scheme was announced by the Minister. What an us original concept! One would have to be Einstein to come up with that one! The Government wants unemployed young people to work nothing. The great ideas flowing from this Government will overcome unemployment if the prepared 192,000 young people will work for nothing. Of course the Minister cannot claim all the credit. The Government back bench youth affairs comand mittee wants participants to work for no ment for an unUmited time before give them consideration for job vacancies which do not exist. That is the first of the great ideas flow from this Government. I am sure the of Australia wtil remember that in 1980. Already the National Youth Council has bludgers, rejected the proposal as being of no value employed youth. Even if the unemployed reject crisis. this scheme no doubt they will be comforted know that the Government will estabUsh a tors national youth advisory group and hold a national youth conference. The quarter of million unemployed young must be tremenhaving dously excited to know that the Government later this year wtil call a national youth conferblaming ence! The announcement by the Minister of the addition of 1,000 young people to the Commoncost wealth payroll for 17 weeks heralded another terrific idea! Do honourable members know what is in store for those young people after weeks? The sack! That is what is going to happen to those 1,000 young people. As these crazy ideas there is not one job. The Government will just aUow unemployment to grow and grow. The Government has announced recruitment of an extra 230 apprentices. With typical flare and generosity, the Government has also decided to increase the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training subsidy by $1 a week. That will be a terrific encouragement to employers to take more apprentices on! Last year, 5.6 per cent fewer apprentices were taken on than in the year before. Perhaps someone should tell the Minister that there is a crisis in our apprenticeship system. Instead of importing migrant tradesmen, it might be worthwhile spending some money on training Australians for skilled jobs. Since August 1974, the employment of tradesmen, semi-skilled workers and process workers has dropped by 94,000 people in Australia. Honourable members may not be aware that the Government has also initiated another brilliant victory on this scene. The Government has spent its money with Kerry Packer on The Job Show. Already a great deal of money has been spent with very little result. Perhaps the results the Minister in his reply would Uke to give of that new scheme. The Prime Minister and many ofhis Cabinet members have for nothing but contempt for the unemployed. Rather than accept the challenge of creating jobs for a generation of young Australians they are to stand by and blame the unemployed, the education system, the Conciliation Arbitration Commission but never their own payeconomic policies and selfish political the CES wtil philosophies. The consequences of this deliberate creation of to the dole bludger have been enormous. Public youth discussion on unemployment has frequently degenerated into harangues of so-called in place of rational consideration of the to uncauses, nature and effect of the employment All too often it is insinuated that the unemto ployment problem stems less from economic facthan from the individual characteristics of the jobless. Thus, the powerless victims of the a crisis have somehow come to stand accused of created their own unemployment- a twist of logic which represents a classic example of the victim. The time has come to stop this anti-social and anti-human strategy. The of unemployment is measureless. The loss of a job is, to say the least, highly upsetting for many. Long periods of unemployment lead to 17 chronic and depressed resignation in people and eventually to a lack of conscious awareness of I said, with all their own capacity. Average duration of unemployment is now at levels unprecedented since the Great Depression. In August 1978, 30.6 per cent of all unemployed people under 21 years of age had been without work for six months or more while 53 per cent of those aged 45 years and over had been without work for similar periods. High and prolonged levels of unemployment are systematically de-skilling our industrial work force. The community also suffers incalculable economic, social and political costs. The payout of $1 billion in unemployment benefits in 1978-79 is one such cost. The irony of it all is that a ment that refuses to pay $1 to create a job wtil spend $1 billion this year on unemployment benefits. The growing alienation of the young from the community, increases in vandahsm, the increasing incidence of unemployment, related health problems and the associated pressures on health and welfare services must also be taken into account. Other countries have responded to high unemare ployment by establishing, amongst other things, programs of job creation. In both the United States and Canada, job creation programs have been set in motion as the trend in joblessness risen. These programs direct energy and resources not only into the goods producing private sector but also into the services sector, administration and the community as a whole. Unemployment in the United States fell from 7.8 per cent in December 1976 to 5.9 per cent December 1978 as a direct result of government job creation programs, despite an increase of rnilhon in in the number of people entering the job market over that period. In effect, in a period in which our unemployment has almost doubled, the Umted States has created six rnilhon new jobs. As a result, employment opportunities women and minority groups has increased draDecember matically. Adult female employment increased by 3.5 rnilhon or 10.5 per cent. Black employnumber ment increased by 1.2 million or 12 per cent. Inflation during that period averaged about per cent which is lower than Australia's rate. This Government refuses to engage in ation because it panders to the ideological whims of the Prime Minister. It prefers the soft option of income support through pathetic levels of unemployment benefit. It is inflicting a social scar which other Western nations would never tolerate. It pretends that the unemployed live idylhc existence of a millionaire Minister. prepared to accept the immense loss to national output which results from people being unemdoing, ployed. Its economic policies are a recipe social and economic disaster.",40
95,Mr VINER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It is disappointHe ing to have started this parliamentary session with the kind of speech that we have heard from the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). There was nothing constructive at all in what he said. He made disparaging comments about individuals and did not offer any concrete suggestions as to how the Government of Austraha should cope with the legacy left to it by the Whitlam Government. He said nothing constructive to reinforce the improvement in the emgovern- ployment outlook which has just started to emerge. Even the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) is prepared to acknowledge that improvement. Instead of offering constructive help honourable members had to Usten to hypocritical comments from a member of a team which will just not face up to reaUty. It has not faced up to reaUty in Opposition and it did not face up to reality when it was in government. Its refusal to face the reaUties is understandable. The reaUties that the actions of members opposite, when in government, produced a legacy of employment decline and consequential increases in unemployment the Uke of which this country had has not seen previously in the post-War period. Let me just quote a few figures for the honourpubhc able member for Port Adelaide. He may not have been in the Parliament at the time but he was helping to bring the Labor Government into in being. In June 1974, registered unemployment stood at less than 80,000. Twelve months later, 5.9 registered unemployment had reached a quarter of arnilhon.Let me narrow this period to levels of registered unemployed. In August 1974, the level of registered unemployed was 107,000; in September it was 121,000; in October it was for 150,000; in November it was 191,000; in it was 267,000; and in January 1975 it was 312,000. There was ariseof 200,000 in the of unemployed between June 1974 and January 1975. Let me remind the honourable 7.6 member for Port Adelaide what was being said within the councils of the Labor Government at the time. I draw my remarks from the transcript job creof proceedings in the Sankey case.",43
96,Mr YOUNG,UNEMPLOYMENT,You would.,43
97,Mr VINER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Thes e remarks were given in pubUc evidence. A witness revealed in court that the the then Attorney-General justified the It is Khemlani loan by saying: My solution goes to therealityand truth of what we are basically the problem is that we are facing a crisis. for The witness giving evidence said: . . . unemployment he thought was likely to be 400,000 half a million within a few months. then said that in his view a temporary purpose was to avert the crisis and the disaster that the Labor Attorney-General of the day thought on indications at that time would have arrived by April-May 1975. What did the then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, say? According to the evidence, his first reacdon was that the then Attorney General's concern about unemployment was a litde high flown. The then Prime Minister thought that the unemployment figure might reach something like 350,000, but not half a million. Did we in Australia either in this House or outside it ever hear the Prime Minister of the day or the Labor Treasurer of the day tell the people about the disaster that was to befall Australia under a Labor government and that the Attorney-General beUeved that half a rnilhon Austrahans would be unemployed? Another 200,000 people became unemployed between June 1974 and January 1975. Who created unemployment in this country? The answer to that quesdon must be sheeted home to the Labor Government of the day. Mr West-What are you doing about it?",43
98,Mr COHEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,You are talking absolute drivel.,44
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Mr MILLAR - result Order! I ask honourable members on my left refrain from interjecting. The honourable jobs member for Port Adelaide was heard in silence and the Minister has an equal enddement.,44
100,Mr VINER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Let me just take the matter a crease litde further, Mr Deputy Speaker, because this matter of pubhc importance refers to the creadon of unemployment. I think the stadsdcs to which I have referred and the evidence given in the Sankey case adequately demonstrate that unemclothing ployment was created by the Whidam Governeconomic ment. The reasons for this rapid deterioration unemployment are well known. They are the excesses of the Whitlam Government's economic policy, excessive government expenditure by the Labor Government which in one year increased by 46 per cent and pace setting in the wages area. These factors contributed substantiaUy to costand push inflation and acted as a direct disincentive to employment. We know that as a result of the Labor Government poUcies of the day that emshortcuts ployers shed labour like peas out of a pod. Government which has been in office since the end of 1975 believes that the only way to correct the severe disruptions to the Austrahan economy which occurred as a result of those events in 1973-74 is by way of a prudent, non-inflationary managed recovery. A too rapid increase in mand would only lead to short term employment gains since the resulting inflation would soon touch off a new recession and lead to increased rather than decreased unemployment. The honourable gentleman referred to the United States of America. Let me point out him the current lesson from what America has done in the employment and inflation field because it is interesting to note that the United States present Administration initially started on a strategy which saw the growth of employment as a linchpin to recovery. Certainly the Administration obtained record employment growth but it found that it could not sustain that strategy without risking renewed inflation. Renewed inflation has come about in the United States and it is what the Administration is battling with at present. We are still suffering the hangover of the events of 1973-74 when tariffs were indiscriminately cut across the board by 25 per cent. Government expenditure got out of control. You will remember that the then Treasurer, Dr Cairns, got the printing presses to work. Profits were squeezed by the introduction of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Wages exploded and Australia suffered the repercussions of deteriorating world trade and international inflation as a result of the huge oil price increase. The for the labour market has been negative to employment growth rates, a mammoth loss of in manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, in building and construction. Between November 1974 and November 1978 there were declines in employment in manufacturing of 134,000, a deof 11 per cent. In construction there was a decline of51,000, a decrease of 13 per cent. The honourable member for Port Adelaide will remember what happened in the textile and industries of the day. The Government's strategy is directed to correcting the in 1973-74 disruptions and to restoring sustained economic and employment growth. If there is one thing the Government recognises that the Opposition always fails to recognise it is that you must get employment growth in the private sector. It is what the Government is aiming to do is achieving under its pohcies. Unfortunately there are no shortcuts to employment recovery, as the United States has recently discovered. The which are advocated today by the OpThis position are shortcuts back to the chaos of 1973-74. There are no realistic alternatives to pursuing steadily and determinedly the re-establishment of the fundamental pre-conditions of economic growth. If we are to restore healthy employment growth we must beat back inflation. deI do not think even the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr Willis) would deny that. We must restore profitability of new investments, and I do not think even the honourable member would deny that. We must keep Government expenditure and the money supply under firm to control. Again, I do not believe even he would deny that. We must increase business and consumer confidence, improve our balance of trade and maintain firm and predictable management of the economy. In that way and that way alone will we improve capacity utilisation, increase investment and see firm and strong growth in employment opportunities. The Government's economic strategy is showing ever increasing signs that it is correcting the past mistakes that have mendoned. There has been a cost in terms of the loss of more rapid employment recovery. There has been a human cost in terms of the people who are presendy unemployed, but I lay that cost very clearly and very deliberately at the feet of the Whidam Labor years- a cost for the past errors in economic management. We all know that to heal a wound without some hurt and some loss of blood is impossible. There is the tempting path of increasing activity levels through increased Government spending, but on closer examination that can be seen to be an irresponsible way which no Government concerned for the medium and the long term welfare of the community would follow. There would be short term gains but these would be only short term. There would be a worsening of our situation in the labour market in the medium term. It is true that unemployment has increased since 1975. Thefiguresshow it. Nobody can deny it. Clearly this situation has its origins in the mismanagement of 1974. It is the extent of this mismanagement and the extreme inflationary pressures which were estabUshed by the previous Labor Government which have taken time to rectify. The most difficult part of the task is hind us. In the last three years the decline in the economy was first arrested and then the conditions for recovery established. There are now a number of firm indications that the recovery is under way. I do not think the honourable gentleman who proposed this matter of pubUc importance would disagree with his leader that the economy is recovering. Would you? I do not think you would. Farm income is well upflowingfrom exceUent seasonal conditions throughout Austraha and generally favourable overseas markets; it could be 80 per cent higher thisfinancialyear than it was lastfinancialyear. The benefits will have a positive impact on the economy during the months ahead and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has estimated that farm income could contribute nearly two per cent to gross national product in 1978-79. The ANZ Bank's index of factory production has also grown in the last quarter to November. Manufacturing industry employment in November has grown by 4,700 persons, the largest increase since December 1973. Civilian employment has risen in seasonally adjusted terms in each of the five months to November 1978. It is also heartening to see that a major part of the growth came from private employment, 14,900 jobs in the three months to the end of November compared with 9,200 jobs in the public sector. Again, if there is I one thing which the Opposition needs to learnwhich we in Government acknowledge-it is that employment growth must come from the private sector. We have this clear sign that civilian employment is rising, and in such a significant area as manufacturing industry for the firsttimesince December 1973. I could also mention other encouraging indicators such as a seasonally adjusted increase in retati sales of 4.4 per cent in December. New dweUing construction has also been buoyant over the last few months with approvals growing by 10.8 per cent during the December quarter compared with the September quarter. I am also encouraged by the considerably more optimistic view being taken by businessmen of economic prospects for 1979. From my conversations with businessmen I find a much more optimistic note throughout the business sector. Indeed, the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey of investment intentions suggests that investments by business could be almost a third larger in the December quarter 1978 when compared with the previous year. There are also signs within the Commonwealth Employment Service vacancyfiguresthat there has been a change in trend. The January be- figures indicate a more favourable trend on the vacancy side. The increase in January 1979 is the largest increase in January of recent years; the stock of unfilled vacancies was marginally higher than in January 1978 whereas in the three preceding years there had been substantial falls each January. Similarly, the trend for new vacancies notified to the CES shows a more heartening picture. In January 1979 the total was significantly above the level of January 1978 and was the highest for any January since 1974. These are all signs of economic growth and of growth of production. They are all signs of an improvement in the labour market. In other words, that constantly depressing trend that we saw throughout the Labor years, continuing after this Government came to office, has aU the appearance of having been arrested and turning in the direction to which the Government's economic strategy was aiming. This does not mean that unemployment wtil be dealt with overnight. It means that our long hard haul wtil continue through 1979. It means that this year is a critical year and it means also that unions must act with the kind of restraint and responsibihty which the Leader of the Opposidon (Mr Hayden) has asked for. Employers must take the opportunity which 1979 will give them.",44
101,Mr HOWE,UNEMPLOYMENT," I remind the House that the change that took place in relation to the employment portfolio stemmed from the honesty of the previous Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Street). I think everyone will agree that he is a reasonable man. He started to talk to the officers in his Department and to listen to the kind of arguments that they developed. Those arguments convinced that Minister it wastimeto go into the Cabinet room and into this Parliament and speak the truth. Honourable members opposite can cite a few statistics. But they are always the favourable statistics, always the statistics that the Government can interpret in some way to try to tell the Australian people that a very serious problem, the most serious problem during the last 50 years of Australia's history, is beginning to turn the corner. They do this rather than grapple seriously with the problem. The reason the present Minister for Industrial Relations is not replying to the debate from the table today is that he was beginning to grapple seriously with this problem. People who are listening to the parliamentary broadcast today ought to know that there are only two honourable members sitting on the Government side of the House to discuss the issue of the 500,000 people who are unemployed, the worse unemployment in the post-war history of this Government. Yet Government members cannot even come into the House to discuss this matter with members of the Opposition. That is absolutely outrageous and totally reprehensible. It strikes at the basis of parliament as a democratic institution. If, when there are half a rnilhon people unemployed and perhaps 250,000 additional people who are unable to find their place within Austrahan society-w e know how important employment is in terms of identity-the matter cannot be discussed by more than a single member on the Government front bench and with no more than two members on the Government side in the House, what the hell are we doing here? There is no point in our coming into the Parliament to chatter about the most serious matter in recent Australian history if Government members simply desert the House because the Government is not prepared to face up to the reaUties of the statistics. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) can clutch at afigurehere and a figure there. But, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) used to say, the runs are on the board. There are 490,000 people who cannot get jobs in Australia and who are becoming increasingly angry about it. I will not say to the people who are unemployed in my electorate, 'You ought not to be angry.' I wtil not say to them, 'Why do you not join a voluntary community service scheme and receive your unemployment benefits while working for some organisation that you have no time for but with which perhaps the Minister would like to ingratiate himself? I will not say to people that they ought to be working under the Commumty Youth Support scheme when I know that that scheme can offer nothing but tea and bickies. This is a government which is introducing policies based on absolute trivia. One becomes very amused when Government members talk about Labor's record, when they talk about what may have happened and about what may have been the basic and root causes of unemployment. This is a government which is not interested in serious analysis. For three years the Prime Minister and his Ministers have thought that all they need to do is repeat the unemploymentfiguresof 1974 and 1975. We are well aware of thosefigures.At thetimewe took them seriously. One hopes that the impUcation of the Minister's remarks today is that he sees the graveness and the critical nature of the unemployment situation in Australia. But I might say that when one looks at the programs that he is talking about, at the kind of analysis that he is undertaking and at the absence of research being done into the problems of employment in this country, one wonders very much whether this Minister is here to do anything more than apply a cosmetic touch. He sold the Aboriginal people at Oenpelh down the drain. I believe he has been appointed Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs to do a con job on a problem that ought to be discussed seriously in this Parhament and tackled in a serious way by this Government. After all, at the moment the best part of $ 1,200m of the taxpayers' money is simply going out of the Government treasury to support people at a very basic subsistence level. Not a cent is being spent by this Government on job creation programs. As the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) said, this Government does not want to talk about job creation programs. This Government does not want to know if the American Government has had success in creating jobs. It says that that is a different situation. All the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have sought, in one way or another, to stimulate job creation programs. However, the Australian Government has sought to avoid that situation within the Australian economy. The Minister made an implicit attack on the wage and salary earners of this country. He said that one man's wage increase costs another man his job and that the people who received their pay increases at Christmas time ought to be ashamed. He said that they should be ashamed of the 4 per cent pay increase they were receiving because they were taking jobs away from people who were unemployed. What arrant nonsense; what rubbish! What sort of economics is it to suggest that unemployment is simply caused by the level of wages. Does the Government think that members of the Opposition wtil come into the Parliament and listen to that kind of trash all through this year in the way we have heard it for the last three years? We will not. We will ask the Government and its spokesmen at least to make some serious analysis of the position and to look at the relationship, not simply between wages and employment, but between all the other factors. When Mr Jackson looked at manufacturing industry and saw the crisis that occurred in it, he did not single out wages as being the basis of the whole crisis. He looked at a whole range of problems that were afflicting employment in that industry. When one looks at the kind of management that has been associated with recent company crashes in this country and the identification of that management with the Liberal Party of Australia, one wonders very much how that party can bring people into talk about running the nation's economy. They cannot even run finance companies.",46
102,Mr HOLDING,UNEMPLOYMENT,O r Computicket.,47
103,Mr HOWE,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Or Computicket. Quite right. It seems to me that the Government has a responsiwill bihty and that this Parliament has a right to about serious analysis. The Minister spoke about the failure of the Opposition to come up with wtil alternative policies and its failure to be construcbeheve tive. I remember the Prime Minister, who was Leader of the Opposition at the time, being viewed, I think on the television program Monunemployed. day Conference. He was asked what policies he would pursue and what he would suggest the then Government ought to be doing. The present Prime Minister refused to do that. He said that it expired. was not the Opposition's business to suggest alternatives. But that is not the way this Oppoam sition has been approaching the economy and unemployment. When the last Budget was brought down we produced an alternative budget. We suggested a series of measures that could have been taken to reduce the incredible levels of unemployment during the currentyear. We put forward those proposals and the Prime Minister had a great deal of fun playing with the figures we had produced, even though at the time he was Leader of the Opposition he would not do this. He said, 'When I get control of the Treasury and the Reserve Bank I wtil tell you what I am going to do'. But this Opposition has not done that. We have tried to say what ought to be done. I wtil refer to some of the things we have suggested. We have certainly talked about the need for a mild economic stimulus. We have not simply talked about the need to expand the pubUc sector ad infinitum, although the Minister was not reaUy able to suggest what exactly was wrong with expanding the public sector or to say anything about whether such a move might be appropriate or inappropriate. A whole series of other measures clearly needs to be implemented. As far as this Government is concerned, manpower planning is simply non-existent. Members of the Opposition have been saying that we need manpower planning in this country. We need research. We need to understand something about the reasons, not simply for unemployment in general, but also why unemployment in particular groups of people is higher than in other groups of people. We need to know much more about unemployment of women. We need to know much more about employment in regional areas. We need to know much more about how unemployment is affecting particular occupational groups. But one sees no sign of that kind of discussion occurring within the Government, or of background research being done that might illuminate those problems. All one sees in terms of the Government's policy on unemployment is a hope, a wish, that somehow, some day, things be better and until then honourable hear members opposite can always blame the Labor Government. For the next 10,15 or 25 years they refer to the situation that prevailed in 1974.1 that working people and people who are unemployed will remember this Government for intermore than 25 years for its attitude to the",47

I draw your attention to the state of the House.  stupid thing I have heard for some time. (Quorum formed). It disappoints me gready that on a matter of pubhc importance, the first to be discussed by the House in 1979, we have a situation, the true facts of which are just not reahsed by the members of the Labor Party themselves. I suggest that they read an item in today's Age headed, 'ALP chief disagrees with view on jobless', from which I would hke to quote briefly, as foUows: The Federal president of the ALP, Mr Neil Battwho is still, I hope, the president of that organisation: . . . provided a refreshingly optimistic approach to the problem of unemployment in an Australia Computer Society debate last week in what was otherwise an evening of gloom-mongering. Mr Batt attacked the modon that computers had caused widespread unemployment. He said he didn't believe the present situation was more difficult for young people than the problems their grandparents had faced. He stressed that unemployment was not unusual in the world saying that people should not take pleasure in seeing it as insoluble. He said Australia had the capacity to overcome the unemployment problem as it had overcome other problems. That was a very positive statement by the president of that organisation, in contrast to the critical, negative and narrow approach that has been demonstrated by the two speakers from the Opposition side, who have shown a complete lack of concern for the unemployed of this country. The only proposal that Opposition members have been able to suggest, during the few short months of the recess, has been a series of measures which would in fact increase unemployment as Labor was successful in doing when it was in government between 1972 and 1975.I am really and truly amazed. The facts and figures that they refuse to accept are clearly available, in black and white. In 1974, 80,000 people were unemployed, but within a very short period thereafter more than 200,000 people were unemployed. That came about, as a result of the actions of a person who had purported at one stage while in Opposition to be a spokesman for manufacturing industry, by the imposition of a 25 per cent tariff cut, which destroyed a number of working men's jobs. During the same period Government expenditure increased out of all proportion. This, allied with the wages explosion, which industry could not afford, resulted in profits being cut. As a result, between November 1974 and November 1975 some 134,000 fewer jobs representing a decrease of 11 per cent were available in manufacturing. In the construction industry, there were 51,000 fewer jobs, a decrease of 13 per cent. This was the mess, the disaster, created by the ineptitude of a government which purported to have the support of the people of Australia. I am pleased to have been elected to this Parliament in 1975, and subsequently re-elected, by genuine people who were sick and tired of a group of socialists who did not know what they were talking about. In contrast, what has this Government done? It has spent $200m of taxpayers' money on, not one scheme, such as the Regional Employment Development scheme which failed and which Labor threw out, but on eight major programs, which has assisted in finding employment for more than 400,000 people. I refer to the Special Youth Employment Training Program, the National Employment and Training scheme and a whole series of other programs which have worked magnificently and, quite frankly, beyond the expectations of a number of people, including Ministers, on this side of the chamber. The Government has continued to provide that support. It has not withdrawn it simply because the programs have become a bit expensive. We are genuinely concerned about the welfare of the people and will continue to be. Honourable members opposite fail to realise just what is happening in Australia. Recently I read a report on the stock exchanges of Australia which indicated that 1978 was the most successful year that they had had for some 20 years.",48

110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Mr M ill a r )Order! The honourable member for Port Adelaide will remain silent.  sort of verbige does not worry me one litde bit. Employment in the construction industry is up by more than 10.8 per cent. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that full-time employment is up by more than 16,000. That is a start. The only thing you blokes opposite did in 1972 was increase unemployment, inflation and the cost of purchasing a home. This Government has reduced interest rates. Whether Opposition members like it or not, that is a fact of life; it true. We have more people on overtime than ever before. Overtime has risen in each of the last five months. According to Commonwealth Employment Service figures, unfilled vacancies total 24,929, an increase of more than 7,000. The Government has adopted a very positive approach, which is now being reflected, I am pleased to say, in the remarks of some people who purport to be strong supporters of the Australian Labor Party. I am delighted to note that the New South Wales Government has currendy approved the training of 500 people and that an additional 1,000 will be given jobs when they have continue completed their training. Unfortunately, present a Labor Government is in control in State. South Austraha also has increased the number of trainees. It too is unfortunately Labor State, one which has many formidable problems to overcome also. I feel that this House should consider very seriously matters of pubhc importance that come before it. I have heard a rade of criticism directed at the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for ployment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) who is at the table. The Prime Minister's positive aption proach of giving a degree of responsibility to that Minister is something that I support that I know others on this side will support also. The Australian Labor Party should realise it left this Government a mess which, quite frankly, it has taken a lot of hard work by many individuals on this side to remedy. We are achieving that almost impossible task. We are reducing the number of people who are in ties in this country. We are giving business people an opportunity to make a profit. I am pleased to remind honourable members opposite that for the December quarter retail sales were up by 4.4 per cent. I understand that the trend has continued into 1979 and I beheve that it will continue as it has been in the last few months. This is the sort of thing that members of the Australian Labor Party do not understand. They do not understand that unless one has a profit it cannot be taxed. Unless we give people confidence to invest further in their manufacturing plants and thus employ more people, unemployment will not be reduced. We are not a government which operates on effect, but rather on the cause of a problem. The Labor Party is very good at coming up with schemes for solving effectproblems. However, when one looks at the cost one sees that they are unrealistic. When one looks at the situation which obtained in this country in 1975 and compares it with the situis ation early in 1979, one sees a broad area of confidence emerging, one that is reflected in the financial pages of this country, as well as in increased profits. I am pleased to be one who has spoken on the Government side in this debate, if only to ensure that with our type of approach and politics we will continue to achieve that degree of confidence within the manufacturing industries, a confidence whose effects wtil flow right through the economy. I was deUghted also to see that, for the December quarter, net farm income was up by a further IVA per cent. I beheve that trend will throughout 1979. All these are positive at things-thing s which are happening. I am a that member of a government that is deeply concerned about unemployed people and I want to a help promote any scheme brought forward to assist them, even any worthwhile scheme that comes from the Opposition. Unfortunately, in three years in this Parliament I have yet to hear tianything worthwhile or even remotely constructive come from the Opposition benches. In future Emhonourable members opposite should think twice before they stand up and bring to the attenof the Australian people their complete ineptitude and failure to understand what is going totally and on in Australia today.",49

112,Mr FIFE,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: Customs TariffProposals Nos 1 to 12 (1979). The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals Nos 1-9 formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff changes introduced by Gazette notices during the last recess. The changes contained in Proposals Nos 1 and 2 are of an admimstrative nature and designed to clarify the tariff position in respect of dental suction apparatus and sublimation transfer printing paper. Proposals Nos 3 to 5 and 7 to 8 implement the Government's decision on the following reports by the Industries Assistance Commission: Fisheries and Fish Processing IndustryProposals No. 3 Jewellery and Other Precious Metal Ware et cetera-Proposal s No. 4 Timber and Timber Products and Plywood and Veneer-Proposal s No. 5 Inks-Proposal s No. 7 Injection or Puncture Needles-Proposal s No. 8. The changes contained in Proposals No. 6 arose from the cessation of import restrictions on certain files and rasps on and from 1 January 1979. The Proposals also contain an administrative change to correct an anomaly in the rates of duty applying to certain net fabrics. The changes contained in Proposals No. 9 arose from implementation on 18 February 1977 of the Government's decision on the report by the Industries Assistance Commission on Copper Foil; and Primary Shapes Produced by Rolling, Drawing, Extruding of Non-Ferrous Metals. The decision provided that rates of duty applying to certain metal products would be reduced after two years. The changes in these Proposals give effect to that decision. Proposals No. 10 contain changes arising from the Government's decision on orange juice and cognac brandies. The current rate of duty applying to imports of orange juice-6 5 per cent-is to continue, pending final consideration by the Government of the report by the Industries Assistance Commission on the Citrus Industry. In respect of cognac brandies the Government has decided to exempt brandies, certified by the proper authority to be cognac brandies, from the short term assistance measures presently applying to other grape brandies. The new duties are to operate on and from 22 February 1979. The change contained in Proposals No. 11 results from the Government's decision on the report by the Industries Assistance Commission on Certain Paper and Paperboard. The effect of the change is to apply a duty rate of 20 per cent to certain uncoated paper and paperboard. This change operates from tomorrow. Proposals No. 12, which also operate from tomorrow, implement the Government's decision on the report by the Industries Assistance Commission on Umbrellas, Sunshades, et cetera and Parts Therefor. The effect of the decision is that umbrellas, sunshades and certain parts will be dutiable at 30 per cent. Textile covers, cases and trimmings will continue to be dutiable at 30 per cent general and 19 per cent preferential. Proposals No. 12 also contain a new note to chapter 61 of the Customs Tariff Act to more clearly define waist encircling undergarments considered to be the hke of corsets. A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the change to duty rates contained in Proposals Nos 3 to 9, 11 and 12 has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. NA Discharge of items",49
113,Mr FIFE,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I ask for leave of the House to move a motion to discharge certain tariff proposals which were moved last year and which constitute Order of the Day No. 29. These proposals were incorporated in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1978 and the Excise TariffAmendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 which have now been assented to. Leave granted. Motion (by Mr Fife) agreed to: That the following tariff proposals, constituting Order of the Day No. 29, Government Business, be discharged: Customs Tariff Prosposals Nos. 13 to 29 (1978). Excise TariffProposals Nos. 2 and 3 (1978). STATES GRANTS (URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT) AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 November, on motion by Mr Nixon: That the Bill be now read a second time.",50
114,Mr MORRIS,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"This Bill amends the principal Act, the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978, and defers the allocation of $20m in 1978-79 and $5m in 1979-80 which would otherwise have been available under existing section 8. The $25m thus deferred will be included in the amended schedule to the Act for the final three years from 1980-81 to 1982-83. Honourable members will recall that the original legislation included provision of $200m at the rate of $40m per annum over the period 1978-79 to 1982-83. Allocations were to be made between the States as set out in the Schedule to the Act. Provision was made under section 8 of $100m at the rate of $20m per annum for allocation between the States on the basis of needs. The present Bill reduces the proportion to be allocated on a needs basis and increases the eventual allocation under the Schedule to the Act to a total of $225m. This amount will be distributed to the States in the same proportion as envisaged in the original Act. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill, but I foreshadow moving at a later stage an amendment outlining our disagreement with the Governments's proposal. The substance of the amendment is that the proposed reduction in funds to the States will seriously disrupt the provision of improved public transport facilities and that this action is inconsistent with the development of urban public transport as an essential part of a national energy policy for Australia. The second reading speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) contained two errors which, in the interest of the accuracy of the Hansard record, should be drawn to the attention of the House. Firstly, the Minister said that under section 8 $800m would be provided at the rate of $200m per annum. I am sure that that amount of $200m per annum should have been $20m per annum. I took the liberty of interpreting it that way a few moments ago. Furthermore, the Minister remarked that of the $75m still to be distributed according to needs, $15m would be available in 1978-79. As the point of this defer any allocation on a needs basis this financial year, I assume that the Minister meant that these funds were to be handed over in 1979-80. The errors no doubt reflect the deep-seated malaise and low morale that exists in the Department of Transport under this conservative Government. The Minister stated in his second reading speech that 'wider Budget considerations' were responsible for the cutbacks since 1978-79 and 1979-80. Although the States have been promised the deferred funds later on, what guarantee do we have that this promise will be kept? Will it also be broken like so many others have been broken by this present Government? We recall the promise to retain Medibank, the promise to provide legal aid to those in need and the promise to creat jobs for all those who genuinely sought employment. During the 1977 general election campaign the Minister for Transport promised to provide $70m over five years for main line railway upgrading. This year the States are to receive a mere pittance of $3m for this project. This is far from being an encouraging start and it is certainly one that will not inspire the States to plan future transport improvements with confidence. It certainly will not give them any confidence at all that this Government is likely to honour its election commitments. There is no guarantee whatsoever that 'wider Budget considerations', as mentioned by the Minister, will not again force the Minister to amend this legislation next year, further reducing the funds originally promised. In a recent article entitled ""The Budget and the Economy 1978-79', the Australian Economic Review remarked that the already gloomy expectations regarding the likelihood of economic recovery in the near future had to be revised in light of the current Budget. The article concluded: Thus we expect that on present policies, the economy will develop significant contractionary impetus during 1979. Again this is not an encouraging prospect for the States which are asked to accept lower funds in the tight of these so-called 'wider Budget considerations'. Later in the Minister's second reading speech he stated: The 1978 Act therefore reflects this Government's suppon for urban public transport improvements. Let me remind the House that the Act introduced in April last year was a down-graded version of the Whidam Labor Government's pioneer legislation of 1974. To date, every major project Bill is to funded by the Commonwealth Government owes its origin to Labor's initiatives in urban pubhc transpon. This is no better illustrated than by reference to the Minister's own Press releases on urban pubhc transpon. On 3 September last, the Minister released a statement which read in part: Mr Nixon said that the bulk of the funds going to New South Wales in 1978-79 would be used to continue the substantial assistance provided by the Commonwealth towards new rolling stock for the Sydney suburban railway system. The statement went on to say that signalling improvements at Sydney station and construction of the Meadowbank Bridge were 'substantially completed under the five year Urban Public Transport Agreement'. Similarly statements issued on 21 September of last year referring to Victoria and Queensland contain the implicit admission that no new projects had been approved. Funds to Victoria were for the acquisition of rail and tram rolling stock and for the completion of duplication of the Macleod-Greensborough railway line, whilst those for Queensland primarily went towards completion of the cross 7 river link and suburban electrification-bu t only of the Ferny Grove to Dana line. All the projects approved by the Minister for Transport in 1978-79, a statement admits, were commenced with Commonwealth assistance under the previous Labor Government's urban public transport assistance program. Obviously there are numerous projects in addidon to those which would benefit from an injection of Commonwealth funds. The Macleod to Greensborough line is not the only route in Melbourne where duplication could enable faster and more frequent services. Many lines would benefit from the provision of a third track. Nor is the Ferny Grove to Darra line in Brisbane the only route capable of electrification. But not only has the Government not approved any projects other than those commenced under a Labor Government administration, but also it has presided over a progressive whittling away of funding for existing projects. Before the Austrahan Labor Party came to power in 1972 it committed itself to the support of urban public transport projects that would have cost, in round terms, some $500m. Under the 1974 Urban PubUc Transport Act, around $130m was appropriated by the then Federal Labor Government for the States' in 1973 and 1974 programs. The fact that the States spent only $79m on urban pubUc transport to the end of 1975 was not a reflection on the then Federal Government, but rather reflection on the non-co-operation of conservablock tive State governments and the long lead in times involved for major urban public transport projschemes. ects. Thus the comparison in the Minister's escalation speech of the $300m provided for in the present Bill, the principal Act and the amending legisof lation before us, and that actuaUy spent under the Whitlam Government's legislation is not a fair one. By mid-1976 only about half of the New South Wales aUocation had been spent-and this on a pubhc transport system that had been timates chronically starved of funds. The present prothese posal looks poorly indeed when placed beside the $500m offered by the then Labor Governlast ment, and not much better when compared with the $334m hurriedly promised by the MCMahon Government way back in 1972. The $40m proposed in this Bill for 1978-79 represents a fall of $9m in cash terms over the 1977-78 level of expenditure. In real terms, this means a decline of 24 per cent on the allocation for 1977-78 and a massive decline of 46.2 per cent on that allocated for 1976-77. Under these circumstances, that any real progress the States in upgrading their pubUc transport systems is due to the extent that they have been forced to rely on their own resources rather than on any general recognition or generosity on the part of this Government. For 1978-79 the Commonwealth is making available to New South Wales the equivalent of only 6.76 per cent-les s than 7 per cent-of what will be the total urban public transport spending by that State in this year. That does not take into account the large outlay that that State will incur in funding its public transport deficit. This Government usually attempts to justify the imposition of such a burden on the States by reference to its coercive 'Federalism' poUcies. When I spoke in the debate on the principal Urban Pubhc Transport Bill in April of last year I criticised the retention by the Minister for Transport of control over the $20m per annum to be distributed according to need. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may remember that at thetimeI made the point that it would put the Minister in a position of patronage, giving special treatment to 'favoured sons' among the States. But apart from the opportunity it afforded for patronage of favoured State governments by the Minister, it limited the States' ability to control the allocation of Commonwealth grantsand this Bill is evidence of the Fraser Government's abandonment of its undertaking for 1978-79 funding on a needs basis. The States, in consultation with the Commonwealth have made it clear that they want apa provals for programs rather than projects and grants with minimal Commonwealth involvement in the detailed administration of the Unfortunately also any provision for of funds in line with inflation is still lacking. The Government has introduced a form indexation of road grants allocations, but it has not seenfitto extend this provision to urban public transport funding. The Minister indicated to the States, in response to requests for provision for cost escalation, that the States could make esfor cost escalation of projects and include in their original estimates. I recall that during the debate on the principal Act in April of year I asked that that matter be drawn to the attention of the Auditor-General because I believe that, under any system of proper and responsible administration, for the Minister to encourage the recipient States to inflate or to pad their urban transport proposals in expectation of some future rate of inflation and to present those padded estimates as being costs of the projects was not the way in which to handle public funds. I hope that the Auditor-General and the Department of the Treasury have had an opportunity to is made by look at that matter. But returning to the funding provided under this amending legislation of the principal Act, it is evident that by the dme the States get their funding on a needs basis for 1979-80 to 1982-83, real purchasing power will be considerably less than it is today. Whilst inflauon may have fallen somewhat, at a huge cost in human terms through unemployment and the effects of cuts in this and other areas of Federal responsibility, it is highly unlikely that anything better than a rate of inflation of 9 per cent to 10 per cent can be expected during the life of this legisladon. The costs of this short-sighted miserliness especially in an area such as pubhc transport where long lead-in dmes are typical are enormous. The Minister concluded his second reading speech with the words: This Bill maintains the Government's longer term for urban public transport, while meeting the current need forfinancialrestraint. That is utter nonsense. The Minister should be aware that, in transport investment, short term cuts have long term repercussions. History illustrates this well enough. In Victoria due to the perceived need for financial restraint during the years of the Great Depression virtually no money was spent on maintenance and capital replacement for the State railways. No new electric trains were contructed after the mid-1920s. Following a further period of financial stringency imposed by the Second World War, systematic rolling stock construction was only recommenced in 1956. The result was degradation of the services provided and unnecessarily higher costs in implementing improvements when eventually those improvements and upgradings had to be carried out. Then, as now, if such a budgetary policy were Ukely to result in the nation's recovery from recession financial stringency would perhaps be easy to accept and certainly easy to understand. But just as the fiscal poUcies of the 1930s served only to heighten the misery of the unemployed and prolong the depression so they will today. It seems that conservative governments are tremely slow to learn. TheirfinancialpoUcies based on old fashioned ideology rather than on recognition of the medium to long term needs our nation. Much of that ideology centres myths on the level of pubUc expenditure Australia-myth s that have been exposed as inpassenger accurate by a recent report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development entitled 'Report on Pubhc Expenditure Trends'. That report shows that the proportion of public expenditure to gross domestic product over the three years 1974 to 1976 averaged 32.8 per cent in Australia compared with an OECD average of 41.4 per cent. The report shows that total pubhc expenditure was less only in Japan and Spain than it was in Austraha. Those were the only two nations in which pubUc expenditure was less than in Australia. Japan spent 25.1 per cent and Spain spent 25.3 per cent. Mr Sainsbury-Whic h year was this?",50
115,Mr MORRIS,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"It was the three years from 1974 to 1976. In aU countries with which Australia is comparable a higher proportion of gross domestic product was used for pubUc expenditure. For example, Canada spent 39.4 per cent; West Germany spent 44 per cent; the Netherlands spent 53.9 per cent; Sweden spent 51.7 per cent; the United Kingdom spent 44.5 per cent; and the United States spent 35.1 per support cent. Government spending increased in all OECD countries during the last 15 years. Let us compare what has happened in Austraha with what has happened in those nations. As a proportion of gross domestic product, public expenditure in Australia in 1962 was 24 per cent. It rose to 32 per cent in 1975. In the United States, the figure rose from 29.5 per cent to 34 per cent. In Germany it rose from 33.6 per cent to 42 per cent. In the United Kingdom it rose from 34.2 per cent to 44.4 per cent. In more recent years, 1974-75 the share of gross domestic product going to urban pubUc transport expenditure in this country, including transport planning and research, was 0.08 per cent. That figure has decUned to 0.07 per cent in 1977-78- a substantial decline. We can safely assume that in the current year, 1978-79, because of the financial stringency and slashing of pubhc expenditure there will be a further reduction still in the share of gross domestic product going to urban public transport. The years of neglect of urban pubUc transport, a disease that the Whitlam Government sought to correct in 1974, provide commuters, those people who have to use the services in their existing condition, with a daily reminder of the effects exof Government penny pinching. Mr Alan Reiher, are the Chief Commissioner of the New South Wales a Pubhc Transport Commission, in his 1978 James of N. Kirby Award address disclosed the effects of on years of financial neglect on Sydney's pubhc in transport system. Of the 1,190 metropoUtan rail cars then in service, 520 were 35 years old. About 480 were over 50 years old. Train delays due to equipment failure were about 1,500 per month, rising to 2,000 per month in periods of wet weather. The rate of failure in metropoUtan rail cars had risen to 20 times the rate existing 10 years previously. Similarly, of the 1,700 buses in the PTC's fleet it had not been unusual to have 300 to 350 out of service daily. That meant that sometimes almost 20 per cent of the bus fleet was out of action. Massive funding is obviously required even to maintain the quaUty of service, let alone to make any advance towards a really competitive public transport system. The need for a forward looking approach to urban pubUc transport funding is aU the more urgent today than it was during the 1930s in the light of the need to adopt more energy efficient means of moving people in our cities. We simply cannot afford to allow a supposed need for financial restraint to deflect us from the provision of practical alternatives to the motor car in urban areas. That such petty budgetary measures are the cause of human misery today makes the present Government's policies all the more absurd. Furthermore, the Government cannot use the excuse that the funds are not available. As a result of its import parity pricing poticy on Uquid fuels, a policy which is supposed to promote conservation of Uquid energy supplies, the Treasury will collect an extra $680m from motorists this year. The motorist is always a good gain to this Government. At the same time the Gippsland and Barrow Island oil producing groups may expect to receive a combined windfall gain of around $340m. Together the total windfall gains are just in excess of $ 1,000m. This money is being stripped from the motorist, from the low income earners who have to use motor cars because they do not have any choice and from all those people who will not have any alternative under the poUcies of this Government. Next year those two oil producers may expect to receive $460m. In 1981 they may expect to receive $580m. As this windfall is ostensibly to encourage the search for oil it is encumbent upon the Federal Government to ensure that the windfall is used for exploration and not remitted overseas. Nor is it too much to ask that the Government's share of the excise increase be devoted to road and public transport improvements as conservation measures. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) speaking to the States Grants (Roads) Amendment Bill last year reminded us that excise or the fuel tax component in the price of petrol has traditionally been regarded as a genchange eral revenue measure and that therefore enough to say that because we are taking more money through tax we should spend more money directly in favour of the motorist. Such taxes, he concluded, have to be seen in the conno text of the Budget as a whole. I am sure that motorists wtil understand that when the Governwife ment takes $ 1,020m extra from them this year. it not a most pressing budgetary requirement to conserve fuel and reduce our dependence on Australia'sfiniteoil reserves? Mr C. W. Freeland of the Department of Transport told the International Road Federation Australasian Road Conference last year that 61 per cent of our primary oil requirements went to transport in 1975. This figure was higher than for any other OECD country. It was higher than the United States of America where the figure was 53.3 per cent. Furthermore, in 1976 transport used 37 per cent of energy consumed in Australia. In 1975 transportation was 99 per cent dependent on petroleum fuels, the remaining one per cent being accounted for mainly by electric trains and trams. By 1985 it is expected that 50 per cent of our oil suppUes will be imported and that this will result in an import bill, based on current prices, of more than $2,000m compared with $800m in 1975-76. In Mr Freeland's words, it appears that transport technology wtil need to be developed to use other energy forms but this wtil require a commitment by both government and private sectors to support research and development of new transport fuels and new vehicle technology, such as electric cars, as well as encouragement of traffic management, para-transit and public transport programs. There is absolutely no sense in hitting the Australian motorist with higher petrol prices while none of these alternative strategies are pursued in anything but a casual style by the Commonwealth Government. Unless a positive approach is adopted to transportation research, development and planning, the latest fuel price increases will turn out to be nothing more than another attack by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) on the more defenceless members of our community. What practical alternative to the motor car as a means of transport have the inhabitants of low income, outer suburbs such as Bayswater, Ferntree Gully, Dandenong, Frankston, Sunshine or Broadmeadows in Melbourne, or Cabramatta, Liverpool and Fairfield in Sydfuel ney? Honourable members need only stand by the gate of any factory in those suburbs during a of shifts to witness how vital the car is to it is not the people who Uve and work there. On the other hand, people on higher incomes in suburbs where pubUc transport is poor have alternative either, but at least they are better equipped to pay the price. Both the husband and may have cars and maybe they can afford to Is run them as frequently as they wish, but it is grossly unfair to bit the only means of conveyance available to lower income earners whilst providing no alternative transport services. Another group which has no alternative to private transport comprises those who live in rural areas. Access to cars, trucks and tractors is nowhere more vital than in the country. It is here that alternatives seem to be hardest to find. Surely then we should be urgently researching alternative fuels for use in rural areas which, spite the vast structural changes in our economy since the War, still provide a substantial part of our national wealth. We should also be ensuring that as many commuters as possible are won to public transport in order to conserve liquid fuels for those who most urgently require them. As was put to the Environmental Studies Centre at Adelaide University last year, conservation measures, including price increases, efficient vehicle production, intermodal transfers and electric propulsion, can make a substantial contribution by 1990 provided a concerted effort is made now. It seems that the Government is gambling paying for future energy imports by the sale overseas of our energy resources, especially and uramum. This is a gamble indeed, for if such sales are not up to expectations, within five or six years Australia may face a double crisis-a n enUc ergy shortage for transport and a severe balance of payments problem. That public transport is more energy efficient than the private motor car is well known. Figures relating to energy intensiveness of various modes of Australian passentransport ger transport were presented to a UNESCO honesty Symposium on Energy and How We Live in transport. 1973 and they showed that per passenger kiloand metre walking consumes 145 kilojules, cycling consumes 85 to 105 kilojoules, while trams the account for 1,250 kilojoules, buses 1,340 kilojoules and trains 1,050 kilojoules, the figure other than that for walking and cycling. Cars, on the other hand require 3,770 per passenger kilometre while aeroplanes consume 5,230 kilojoules. Cars, therefore, require roughly three times the amount of energy as either trains, buses or trams, their nearest competitors at present. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation tells us that the average car spends only about three per cent of its life in motion and uses more energy in moving its own bulk than in moving its occupants. That there is public support for the improvement of urban public transport services is evidenced by the results in the last two New South Wales elections in which major pubhc transport was an important issue. Added to that are the results of a poll of 1000 Melbournians published by the Melbourne Age on 9 September 1978. It showed that 77 per cent of those polled beUeved that improving pubhc transport would be a better solution to transport problems than building a freeway network. Only 20 per cent thought a freeway network would be the better solution of the two. The majority view was dewell justified although it is true that freeways result in reduced accidents, less pollution and lower fuel consumption per vehicle mile. However, such benefits are negated by the proven tendency for road construction to encourage more traffic and as far back as 1937 there were statistics available to show that that observation is correct. In the longer term the bridge between private and pubhc transport policy and energy policy has to be the development of appropriate land use strategies. This will require that planning take account of the relationship between transport and urban and regional development on to effect optimal land use patterns for the transport systems. In his paper Mr Freeland sugcoal gested re-concentration within our cities, increased densities in the central business districts, a revival in radial, high density urban pubtransport, coupled with short term policies to minimise dependence on and the use of oil, as a preparation for transition in the longer term. The reduction in funds for urban public by this Government exposes the disof its claim that it is interested in public The related areas of transportation urban and regional planning are of such critical importance that it is foolhardy to ignore urgent necessity for adequate funding of current urban public transport projects and planlowest ning for the future. Accordingly, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subkilojoules stituting the following words: 'whilst not opposing the Bill, the House is of the opinion, that(a) the Government should be severely criticised for reducing the amounts made available to the States for upgrading of urban public transport in 1978-79 by$20mandin 1979-80 by $5m, (b) this reduction in funds to the States will seriously disrupt the provision of improved transport faculties, and (c) this action of the Government is inconsistent with the development of urban public transport as an essential part of a responsible national energy policy for Australia'.",53
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,Is the improvements to amendment seconded? Mr Barry Jones- I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak at a later stage.,55
117,Mr SAINSBURY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Eden-Monaro) (5.13)This Bill seeks to amend the amount of money to be paid to the States for urban public transport capital works in that it re-adjusts the dme when that money will be paid to the States. It appears to be a simple enough amendment. I propose to speak about a number of corollaries of this general thrust in urban pubhc transport, but first I need to answer one or two matters raised by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). I was interested to hear what I thought was a sincere speech. Obviously he would like to see, as I would, lots of money made avadable for all sorts of things so that many of the things that we would like to see happen in this country can happen more quickly. However, I take it he would have enough intelligence to realise that money just does not grow on trees despite the fact that he did say that it is not a matter of the money not being available. Having made that statement he went on to talk about the proportion of gross domestic product being spent in the public sector. He mentioned, for instance, the level of public expenditure in various countries in the three years 1974 to 1976. I draw his attention to the fact that in Australia when the single decision to introduce the family allowance was made-mos t of this expenditure did not represent an increase in money going into the community although there was some increase-it obviously immediately increased pubhc expenditure, without any, or with very little, increase in the amount of effective governmental support overall. We believed then, as we do now, that that was a good move in the improvement of equity within the economy, but it was a case of increased pubhc expenditure with, basically, a book entry, given the average effect across the economy. In member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development the movement has been in this direction. The increase in public expenditure has not necessarily been caused by an increase in taxation on new programs such as capital works on urban public transport. It has more often been for use as a transfer of payment. I was also confused about the view of the honourable member for Shortland on the inwould creases in petrol costs to the Australian motorist this year. He spent quite sometimenot talking about public transport but talking about private transport and I was very confused about whether percent. he wanted us to raise the alleged extra $680m from motorists through excise. If he did agree with that, did he want us to spend it on urban public transport or did he want us to reduce payments to pensioners? Mr Morris-You have already done that.",56
118,Mr SAINSBURY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"We have not done that at all. But it is a matter of priorities, and it is a matter of making ends meet in the Budget. It is possible as a third alternative that he wanted the money not raised at all, in which case there would not have been so much money for urban pubhc transport or for pensioners. The Australian people have come to recognise that the Government has to get the money from somewhere and this Bill results from a budgetary decision in line with another obvious need in the country to look in a more sensible way at the overall pricing of fossil fuels, which are becoming scarce, which we need more people to look for and which need a certain degree of conservation brought about by a more realistic pricing. A whole host of other things in the honourable member's speech were interesting to me, though many of the statistics he gave were, in my view, quite meaningless. In fact, he should have used them in the context of monetary amounts. When someone talks about percentages, sometimes it is very difficult to know what he means. When the honourable member says that about only 6 per cent of the New South Wales funding for pubhc transport came from the Commonwealth by way of tied grants such as those provided for by this legislation I really do not know what that means and I do not think the general public does. I believe that if we are to have a meaningful debate we probably need fewer percentages and fewer statistics and a reasonable explanation of what they mean. Certainly, however, when the honourable member criticised the problem of inflation eating away the effect of the money that has been allocated, namely $300m over 5 years, he was not, in all sincerity, honest enough to acknowledge that the original legislation of this nature introduced in 1973-74 by the previous Government did not do that either. Of course, at that time inflation was running at a much higher rate than it is at present. I think the average over the years of the Labor Government would indicate that in the first five years of a program inflation have been running at 11 or 12 per cent, which is higher than even the inflated prediction that the honourable member made for the five years of the present program of, I think, 8 or 9 As I said, there are a whole host of other things which the honourable member said with which I would disagree, but I take up only one final point. He alleged malaise and low morale in the Department of Transport. I would just remind him of my view and the view of most Australian people that money does not necessarily increase morale unless it is accompanied by an ability to pay. If he spoke to the people he alleges to represent so well, namely the more disadvantaged people, he would be reminded of the problems that many people have through being induced into hire purchase contracts. Mr Morris-Are you reflecting on my constituents, the disadvantaged.",56
119,Mr SAINSBURY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I am reflecting not on the honourable member's constituents but perhaps on the way he represents them in the sense that he keeps saying in all his speeches that he represents especially disadvantaged people, when disadvantaged people at this stage of Australia's history clearly need a government that can manage the country and provide the goods that disadvantaged people need. There is no doubt that this Bill provides for a small drop in real terms in the amount going to urban public transport. There is no debate about the fact that if money is provided at atimelater than originally intended then the purchasing effect is normally lessened by inflation. It is unclear what sort of drop we are talking about but it was made quite clear in the last Budget that because of budgetary problems there would be a deferment of part of the payments to the States for urban public transport. Certainly, however, there is a move in thetimeof the present Government towards more and moreflexibilitygoing to the States. Less money is being made available in the form of tied grants and more is going into general purpose grants. This is evident in many areas such as health and some road programs. It is a professed priority of this Government to ask the State governments to decide on their own priorities. Sometimes, especially as a representative of country areas, I wonder whether that turns out to be the right course. In most States, governments, especially governments of a Labor colour, seem to have priorities in larger urban areas where, of course, many of the seats represented by Government members are to be ment found. I will talk about that a litde later. Despite what the honourable member for Shortland mentioned, the 1978 Bill has enabled some new projects to proceed. For instance, he would know that a large proportion of the $14m available to New South Wales this year is going to a new program of upgrading urban rolling Sydney-Canberra stock for passengers. That is a new program; was not envisaged at this level in 1973-74. But does concern me that in New South Wales in particular, and my electorate is in New South Wales, the 1978 Act is not functioning in the way that I beheve it was meant to function. One of the interesting things about the 1978 Act was a change away from what I think is a basic obsession of Labor Party legislation with cities. The States are now at least given some scope to expand the definition of the word 'urban'. The 1978 Act, and the amendment to it which we are debating now does not change this, defines 'urban area' as a number of statistical divisions, including the capital cities, Newcastle, Wollongong, Geelong and Hobart, but also including 'an area that is, by virtue of a declaration in force under section 4, an urban area for the purposes of this Act'. In the second reading speech on the 1978 Bill the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) made it very clear that the guidelines on which he hoped the States would act in this area would be that an urban area could be considered normally as a city or town of 40,000 people or more. I regret that there are no proposals yet coming from the New South Wales Government that look as if they will be able to assist in those areas. I know that there are not very many places with between quite 40,000 and 100,000 people in New South Wales. In fact, if one goes outside the specifically defined urban areas of Wollongong, Newcasde and Sydney in New South Wales, one cannot find an area with over 40,000 people. But I would like the State Minister to decide that he will give within his priorities a much better deal to the sorts of areas that constitute the big centres in the country areas. Of course, country areas tend to suffer marginally from New South Wales Government decisions and will probably suffer more in future after the proposed redistribution. I hope the State Minister does not forget those areas as he appears to have forgotten them in the past. The Queanbeyan Age of 16 June last year reported the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Mr Cox, as saying in relation to a discussion on the proposed Canberra-Sydney high speed rail link: We need and expect assistance from the Federal Governin this matter. Of course this implied-this is always good for headlines-that the Federal Government gave no assistance. The Federal Government is giving assistance under the legislation that we are debating at present. It is up to Mr Cox to decide that some of the money should be spent on the rail link. I believe that at least it some of the money should find its way outside it Sydney. It does not appear to be doing that at the moment. I would like very soon to hear a statement from Mr Cox that he proposes to help people in other areas. The Canberra-Sydney rail link goes through much of my electorate including a city called Queanbeyan, which is adjacent to Canberra. I should like to raise a specific question on the spending by the New South Wales Government of the money provided under this Act: Why cannot Queanbeyan be recognised as part of the Canberra metropoUtan area? It is in New South Wales so the Commonwealth Government cannot supply money to Queanbeyan as a direct grant. Why cannot Queanbeyan be considered as part of the Canberra metropolitan area so that perhaps some of this money can find its way into Queanbeyan? I ask this not just because of parochialism but because of the special problems involved. Queanbeyan has really difficult public transport problems. There is a local operator who obviously has to work within the bounds of profitabtiity or he cannot stay on forever. It is difficult for him to offer to the pubUc the services that are required at many times. It is all right to talk about people in Canberra. They have a pubUc transport system. I am not sure whether it is efficient or not, but at least it is a pubUc transport system. It is partly subsidised by Canberra's state government, as it were, namely the Australian Capital Territory. Surely a cut of the State's subsidy dollar for the deficit on pubUc transport could be directed to a place such as Queanbeyan that suffered terrifically, especially at the hands of the most irresponsible decisions within Canberra in the past six or seven years. Queanbeyan has suffered in comparison with most other country cities of New South Wales. I believe that as a matter of urgency New South Wales should see Queanbeyan as an urban centre which can easily quaUfy under the guidelines of the Act for part of this Commonwealth tied assistance for urban pubhc transport. I believe that it is appropriate for a representative of a country area, as I am, to speak on the States Grants (Urban Pubhc Transport) Amendment Bill. I am always mindful of the special funding disadvantages of country areas. Perhaps at times we need to be a bit more open about some of these disadvantages. Perhaps one of the faults in the Australian communication system is that city people do not fully realise the number of subsidies that they get in all sorts of ways. Thankfully the present Government is bent on reducing this imbalance as much as possible. For instance, it is continuing a very good program on national highways that the previous Government introduced. That is helping country people a great deal. It has introduced a substantial reduction in the differential in fuel prices between country and city areas. Of course this flows through to the cost of pubUc transport and private transport in the country. HopefuUy, in the near future according to the Minister, there will be some action. I am not sure how this will occur, but there wtil be some action on some of the more discriminatory petrol discounting methods of the petrol compames which very much assist places such as Sydney and Melbourne and certainly do not help country areas. The discounting process means that out of the money coUected in country areas the discounting in the cities is subsidised. I think that is pretty obvious. As I said, there is a lack of communication between, and a lack of knowledge of the differences between, country and city. I commend to honourable members a program to commence next month known as operation farm link which hopefully will inform many city people of the disadvantages that we have in the country in regards to the use of taxation money. I summarise that I hope that the disadvantage that country people have in having to pay taxes to subsidise urban public transport deficits in the cities can be ameUorated. I hope that State governments-in particular New South Waleswill wake up that this Bill which we are debating this afternoon allows for assistance for urban public transport in cities of around 40,000 people and perhaps fewer. I hope that in the not too distant future the New South Wales Government wtil move ahead to spend some money in those areas as it has not done in the past. The people in those areas deserve a cut of the taxation dollar just the same as everybody else in Australia.",57
120,Mr BARRY JONES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Whilst I am always glad to see the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr MCLeay) at the table I must say that I take it amiss that the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) is not with us. It is not just insulting to the Opposition but insulting to the Parliament as a whole that he is not here personally. I am happy to second the amendment moved by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). The States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Amendment Bill demonstrates the failure of this Government to give public transport sufficiently high priority and its incapacity to grasp that transport is the nexus which Unks together all the elements of modern l if e education, manufacturing, retailing, entertainment and leisure activities. The Government has failed to articulate a coherent transport policy linked around effective systems of public transport. In fact, with the exception of New South Wales, public transport usage is declining, everywhere in Australia and the tendency shows no signs of reversing. Similarly, the Government has failed to evolve a compelling nauonal energy policy and as a result per capita energy consumption is increasing in private transport at a time when every consideration of national security ought to compel a reduction. Of course we are partly victims of our own history and of our own peculiar urban tradition. As Arthur Koestier once wrote: Australia is a suburban continent; its cities spread shapelessly like ink on blotting vast amount of empty space available. The urban sprawl makes it very difficult to provide effective pubhc transport systems. Let me illustrate by referring to the city that I know best-Melbourne . The situation can be replicated in all our major cities. We have never had a debate as a nation about the relative merits of the compact city compared to the expanded city. I have often said that Melbourne's transport story should be entitled a Tale of Two Cities but I understand that the title has already been copyrighted by an English novelist. There is 'Old Melbourne', which is the pre-World War II city which grew up around public transport links, and 'New Melbourne', one of the world's worse examples of uncontrolled urban sprawl which is essentially car based. The tragedy is that the two Melbournes do not make a single satisfactory transport unit. For example, 'Old Melbourne' would be destroyed by more radial freeways, but equally 'New Melbourne' lacks satisfactory transport alternatives to the car. The transport interests of Old and New Melbourne are inimical to each other. Melbourne's suburbs grew around a radial public transport system which served the city well until the 1950s. Our present suburban train and tram system in Melbourne has barely changed since 1926. In that year most Melbourne people hved close to train lines, tram lines and bus services. Access to transport determined the choice of homes, schools, work and, in many cases, of a husband or wife. Mostfixedrail services terminated in the central business district which was then Melbourne's geographic and population centre. In 1945, Melbourne's 1.3 rnilhon people took a total of 543 million journeys in trains, trams and buses-a n average of 418 journeys per head per annum. After World War II, with the increasing domination of Melbourne by the private car, the city expanded, particularly to the north-east, east and southeast. I am sure that the story is much the same in Sydney. By 1975 Melbourne's population was 2.6 rnilhon, but the passenger journeys on pubhc transport had fallen to 243 million-exactl y 300 rnilhon less-o n average of only 80 journeys per head per annum. The Melbourne transportation district had expanded to an area of 6,133 square kilometres, making it one of the world's biggest cities, with a very low population density of about 424 persons per square kilometre. It is generally estimated that a population density of between 1,200 and 1,500 persons per square kilometre is needed to make public transport financially viable. paper because there is such a After 1945 the radial system of trains and trams became increasingly irrelevant to many families. The central business district was no longer Melbourne's geographic or population centre. The population moved towards the south-east. A large proportion of the population moved into the interstices between the radial tines of Melbourne's pubhc transport system. The goal of the Labor Party in Victoria is to ensure that Melbourne's citizens receive the greatest benefit from the radial system by integrating the circumferential links so as to create a grid system. Melbourne is divided into 'transport rich' and 'transport poor' areas. My own electorate of Lalor is nothing less than a transport slum. It is true that there are radial links from areas hke St Albans, Werribee and Deer Park into the central business district, but that is not where the work force is now employed. Curiously pubhc transport in many ways has become the preserve of the middle class. A large proportion of public transport commuters to the central business district are professionals whereas working class people are not provided with public transport links to where they are going to work. Of 50 State electorates in the Melbourne transportation district, there are 113 million outward rail passenger journeys each year but more than half of them come from only 14 electorates. The Victorian Ministry of Transport estimated in 1976 that 81.6 per cent of passenger vehicular journeys in Melbourne are by car, 4.1 per cent by private bus, 1.4 per cent by tramway or railway bus, 6.5 per cent by train and 6.4 per cent by tram. By 1975, 65 per cent of all commuters, including school and tertiary students, travelled by car to work. The central business district was the only area where a majority of commuters, perhaps 70 per cent, travelled by public transport. I must say that the Melbourne underground railway loop gives a salutary warning of a State enterprise entered into without having been properly thought out. I think advice from the Commonwealth could have been of great assistance in this matter. It is a $300m tragicomedy- a memorial to an edifice complex based on a complete transport misconception. It is designed to provide more rapid movement around the central business district for passengers who are already in the suburban railway system but without in any way increasing the catchment area which would bring people into the system. It is a magnificent piece of civil engineering worthy to rank, I think, with the pyramids of Egypt and the catacombs of Rome, but it is hard to see how it will place one more bottom on one more seat in the Melbourne suburban system. I once asked the Victorian Minister of Transport whether he could give the names addresses of people who currendy are not rail users but who would become rail users when the loop opened. The Minister declined to give an answer. It seems to me as silly as spending a lot oftimefixing up the two front legs of a horse then saying: 'We will not bother about the two back legs; they wtil get dragged along with front legs'. We have a system which will be magtoo nificent at one end but which does not provide for more people being able to use the system. Nevertheless, I do believe that the loop has mous potential tourist appeal and it great defence significance.",58
121,Mr SCHOLES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,It is 'nt deep enough.,60
122,Mr BARRY JONES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"It is under Parliament House. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the amount of traffic on Austrahan roads has increased by 133 per cent since 1963. What we have to ask is this: Are we prepared to accept the inevitability of a 10 per cent annual increase in road traffic use in perpetuity- a doubling every decade? Since 1971 traffic growth has outstripped population growth by a ratio of five to one. It is curious that a greater distance is elled by Victorian vehicles than by vehicles in any other State. I take it that that is largely made up by people who live and work around the metropoUtan area but who are travelling longer and longer distances. It seems extraordinary that the smallest of mainland States should have the longest average distance travelled by a vehiclelonger than Western Australia and longer than Queensland. But that is what the statistics show. Traffic surveys indicate that an increasing number of commuters travel on cross-city or even inter-city journeys. In Victoria many commuters Uve in Geelong, Gisborne or Warrigul and travel to work to Melbourne each day. The average distance travelled each day has increased sharply in the last 30 years. Melbourne has about 100 kilometres of freeway-onl y 1.25 per cent of the total sealed road surface. Universal experience is that freeways are essentially traffic generators which encourage more road use. The main impact of increased demand for motoring space generated by freeways ultimately is felt on conventional roads. That is the situation in Los Angeles. The cure becomes worse than the disease. Radial or commuter freeways originally were planned on the assumptions of unUmited access to cheap motor fuel by aU motorists and universal car ownership in the community. Radial freeways direct cars from an enormous catchment area with low density and cheap car parking towards a small central area with very high density and and very expensive car parking. As car dependence increases, the need for more car parking space in the central business district reduces the areas available for shops, theatres, restaurants, hotels and services other than parking, or it makes their and cost prohibitively high. Dependence on private car usage and city diversity of use will become the increasingly incompatible. Inner city areas are valuable for human interaction to be used as storage areas for cars every day. The Melbourne central business district and the area immedienorately surrounding it has 31,000 car parking may have places. Sydney has only 19,000. In an enclosed transport system such as Melbourne's road network or the network of any city-eve n Hobart which once had two systems but now that the Derwent bridge is repaired it tends to be more integrated-tota l energy input and mobility tend to be in inverse proportion. If 90 per cent of Melbourne's 1 miltion motor vehicles were competing simultaneously for 8,000 kilometres of sealed road, mobility would fall towards zero. If only 50 per cent were in use, trav- freedom of movement would increase. If only 10 per cent of our vehicles were in use, mobihty would tend to move towards 100 per cent. Public transport policy should recognise the technique of energy analysis based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The Melbourne metropolitan transport district has 11,418 kilometres of road. That is nearly 8,000 kilometres of sealed road and nearly 3,500 kilometres of unsealed road to accommodate an estimated 1 million motor vehicles-a n average sealed road space of less than 8 metres for each vehicle or 16 metres for each vehicle on a dual carriageway. The present Melbourne metropolitan road system appears to be adequate for about 20 hours each day, but fails during peak hours when the private commuter system is competing for scarce resources of time, space and energy against the public transport commuter system. The Hamer freeway program is based on treating that distortion factor of daily peak demand as if it were characteristic of the entire 24-hour cycle. A standard sized sedan such as a Holden or Falcon covers a standing area of 8.92 square metres. By adding a small safety margin at the front, back and both sides, an area of at least IS square metres per vehicle must be allowed for on roads. The Victorian Railways and the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board allow an average of .82 square metres for a seated passenger and an average of .28 square metres per person in what they elegantly describe as a 'crush load'. The motorist driving alone has a space requirement of between 18 and 53timesthe size of the area needed for the train or tram traveller. It is hard to justify giving vate motorists somewhere about 30 times the space they need, at pubhc expense, to commute at peak hours in competition with public transport when it is available. It must be admitted that at present public transport is often not appropriate. We have to spend far more money in trying to convert existing public transport networks to make them much more flexible. The private car has obvious advantages over public transport. It provides door to door conappear venience in comfort and relative security. To many people a car is an external support to their own sense of identity-a n extension of persontend ahty or home, preserving a sense of indepenin dence, of privacy, while others see the car as a hobby and driving as a form of recreation rather than a transport mode. But we are generally vicergy tims of auto-eroticism in Australia. We must verse that condition. As a nation we cannot afford to go on increasing by 10 per cent each year the amount of road space and fuel that need. The private motor car represents poor value for money when it is used for commuting adequate pubhc transport is available. Total travelling time becomes much higher at peak hours with heavy wastage of fuel and nervous energy. Driving causes strain and anxiety drivers and pedestrians alike. The Commonthe wealth Government ought to be pushing the State governments towards converting existing radial systems into grid systems. Traditionally fixed rail radial systems were very good but now no longer adequate for the cities. Grid tems give greater flexibility and increase route choices without necessarily increasing the mote number of train or tram services on each line. The total distances travelled after modal interchange may be longer but the elapsed time in reaching one's destination will be shorter. The great advantage of a grid system is the use of interchanges to permit rapid transfer from one radial line to another. The suburban rail systems of London, Paris, Moscow, New York, Tokyoand should be to give examples of cities of Melbourne's size and population-Montrea l and Toronto, are based on the grid. There ought to be a common ticketing system so that a single fare will permit interchanges. It is a curious fact that the Melbourne suburban railway network has 16 lines-the same number as the Paris Metro. Melbourne actually has more length of track than Paris, having 489.5 kilometres of track and 266 stations but only five major interchanges. All of them-Flinder s Street, Spencer Street, Princes Bridge, North Melbourne and Richmond-ar e priclose to the central business district. Paris has only 172 kilometres of track with 341 stations, but 124 of them are interchanges, widely spaced throughout the city. Paris has a 70 per cent usage of rail transport and Melbourne has 6.5 per cent. I was talking about the need to apply the technique of energy analysis. Thefirstlaw of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but is in a constant state of change. The second law states that energy can in two forms; thefirstis work energy and the second is free energy, also called 'entropy'. As work energy decreases entropy increases. We to be energy gluttons, using energy grossly excess of what we need. Many commuters drive alone in eight or six cylinder cars with seating for five or six people and using enough enfor a small bus. In a traffic jam the entire enreergy value of the fuel appears as entropy, not work energy, because the car cannot move. Entropy is expressed as heat, vibration, noise and we many other factors, not as movement. Thermodynamically the car is a heat engine. It is very efficient in producing heat, pollution, vibration and noise, but relatively inefficient in producing when movement by friction. An efficient metropolitan transport system should be based in the short term on the philosfor ophy: 'move people . . . not vehicles'. In longer term we should adopt the philosophy: 'move information, goods and services according to need . . . and people according to desire'. If we are serious about a national energy are policy, this Government and this Parliament sysought to be saying loud and clear to the State governments in Australia, 'We want you to propublic transport; we want to try if we can to contain this figure of 10 per cent increase in fuel use and road use every year'. The economy cannot support it and, more than that, the whole nauonal security of this country cannot afford it.",60
123,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I enter this debate with some enthusiasm. May I compliment the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) on a most thoughtful and studied contribution. I say that quite genuinely because the honourable member repeatedly comes into this House extremely well prepared and with a great amount of detail to back up his propositions. I support the Bill because, firstly, the legislation is in pursuance of and effectively honouring our 1977 Federal election policy speech commitment to provide $300m over a five-year period to assist the States with the upgrading of their urban public transport systems. Secondly, there is an added bonus for Tasmania in the amendment which is before the chamber today. The previous Urban Public Transport Agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, which was the agreement made by the Whidam Government with the six States, provided for the expenditure of $ 190m of Commonwealth funds over a five-year period for urban public transport improvements up to 30 June 1978. Our 1977 Federal election policy speech commitment represented an increase in Commonwealth funding of more than 50 per cent over the amount of Commonwealth funding in the previousfive-yearperiod. That 50 per cent increase was a substantial commitment and one which I believe was applauded at that time by people on both sides of pohtics in the various States, those connected with urban public transport and those connected with local government. It is a substantial and a generous increase, particularly so when one recalls that fact-and one should recall it-that urban pubhc transport is not constitutionally a Commonwealth responsibihty. I make that point because I beheve there is a tendency for people on both sides of the fence to overlook what is and what is not in the Constitution. It may well be that urban pubhc transport should be a Commonwealth responsibility. I do not put that point of view. I simply say that constitutionally it is not a Commonwealth responsibihty and therefore the commitment both by the previous Government to provide $190m from 1973 to 1978, and by the present Government to increase that commitment by over 50 per cent to $300m for the five-year period, is a very significant indication by the Commonwealth Government and Commonwealth governments of both pohtical colours, of the importance of ensuring that Austraha has a proper urban public transport system as we move out of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century with all the problems which we know are around the corner, not the least of which is the energy crisis. I, and I suppose everybody else, would have liked to see an amount higher than $300m provided. But the fact of the matter is that Commonwealth Government expenditure can be increased effectively only by increasing taxes. I believe it to be the unanimous view-certainl y of honourable members on this side of the House and I would hope of many honourable members on the other side of the House-that at present Australians are overtaxed We are taxed up to the eyebrows. I would not for one moment support any increase in taxation. Indeed, hke the Treasurer (Mr Howard), I was extremely disappointed at the 1.5 per cent tax surcharge which was imposed in the last Budget. I am gratified that only four days ago at a pubUc dinner in Hobart which the Treasurer addressed, he reminded a questioner who asked him whether the tax surcharge would be continued, that it was a Bill for one year and that it expires on 30 June 1979. So it would be very trite to say that the amount provided in this Bill should have been doubled or trebled. The sum of $300m is substantial. The expenditure could not be increased without cutting across the basic economic poUcies that the Government has laid down in the Budget of 1978-79 or using the alternative, horrific as it is, of increasing taxation. I would not have a bar of that because I am totally and absolutely opposed to higher taxes. I believe that this nation is crying out for lower taxes. Having made those preUminary comments, I point out with some pride that as a result of this amending Bill, Tasmania will receive more in total in the five-year period than would have been the situation under the existing Act. The schedule to the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978 shows that for the year commencing 1 July 1978 the appropriation for Tasmania is $lm, for 1979 it is $lm and it is the same for 1980, 1981 and 1982. Under the new arrangements which will be carried with the passage of this Bill the position improves. For the year commencing 1 July 1978, Tasmania's allocation amounts to $ lm; for the year commencing 1 July 1979 it is $lm and on 1 July 1980 the figure rises to $1.25m. On 1 July 1981 the aUocation will increase to $ 1.25m and on 1 July 1982 itwiUbe$1.25m.",62
124,Mr HOWE,TARIFF PROPOSALS,It catches up with inflation.,62
125,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"My colleague, the honourable member for Batman, laughs. Let me tell him that Uttle fish are sweet. Under this amending legislation, Tasmania will be receiving $5,625,000 instead of the $5m which was proposed in the original legislation. My colleague, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck), would support me when I say that the $625,000 will be wisely spent in Tasmania and we welcome the additional funds. This may be an appropriate time for me to pause in my remarks. I wish to turn to two urgent matters I will be able to deal with after the suspension of the sitting, namely two travesties which have occurred in Tasmania in recent years. I refer to the demise of Tasmania's urban pubhc transport rail system and the demise, unfortunately at the behest and with the connivance of the State Government, of a ferry service which should have been the salvation of the electorates of Denison and Franklin and which should have put Hobart back on the map from the point of view of urban public transport. I leave those two matters until resumption of the sitting.",63
126,Unknown,TARIFF PROPOSALS,Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m.,63
127,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"As I was saying before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, there is good news for Tasmania in this Bill. As a result of the re-arrangement, Tasmania is to receive an increase in the funds allocated under the 5-year program. The previous Act provided funding of $5m spread over a 5-year period, but the Bill increases thatfigureby nearly 15 per cent. I was deUghted that officers of the Department of Transport, when in Hobart barely two weeks ago, were gratified to note the appreciation of State Government and its officials at this increased allocation to our State. Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) is now in the chamber, I intended to make at this stage of my address some remarks about him. Frankly, I am becoming a bit sick and tired of people who repeatedly seem to attack the Minister. I refer to a number of State Ministers, particularly Ministers whose only game is whinging and carping. I want to put on record my appreciation of the Minister for bringing in a 5-year program which represents a 50 per cent increase on the Whitlam 5-year program-that is 10 out of 10 for the Ministerand for an amendment which wtil mean more money for Tasmania. As I said earlier,tittlefish are sweet, but an increase of $650,000 to our State under this arrangement, bringing the total to $5,625m, is appreciated. In my judgment, the Minister is firm but fair, practical and pragmatic, and when people want to get stuck into him about overseas air fares and one thing and another I just look at his record as far as Tasmania is concerned. Overall, it is a good record. We have very much for which to be grateful. The Minister is always welcome in Tasmania. Unlike some other Ministers, we see him quite frequently in our State.",63
128,Mr LES JOHNSON,TARIFF PROPOSALS,You never stop grovelling for a vote.,63
129,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I notice that we are drawing a few crabs from the other side, but honourable members opposite should check their facts. The people of Hobart are deUghted with the additional money. I am sure that honourable members who come from other States will be pleased to know that the people of Hobart and Tasmania generally are grateful for the increased allocation. Two transport matters must be discussed in the context of this Bill because to ignore them would be to ignore a problem which has been bedevtiling Austraha's finest capital city. I refer, of course, to Hobart. The fact is that our city is strangling itself with its road transport problems. Unless something is done within 10 years metropolitan Hobart wtil have a transport crisis. What has brought about this situation? Firstly, there was the disgraceful decision of the State Labor Government, in breach of a clear electoral pledge, to close down the Hobart suburban passenger rail service. That decision was taken in direct breach of a pledge given before the 1972 State election that the Hobart passenger suburban rail service would be maintained. Within 18 months of that election the Labor Govern the ment of Tasmania closed down the service. In my judgment it was a monumental blunder, a decision which wtil have to be reversed. I refuse to believe that by the year 2000, when Hobart wtil have a population in excess of 200,000, it will be the only city of its size in the world which could organise its public transport without either a suburban rail service or, as I would point out to the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), a tram service. We made the blunder of getting rid of our trams. We had an excellent tram service. I challenge any member of this Parliament to teU me of any other city in the world with 200,000 people which does not have either a suburban rati service or tram service. The fact is that Hobart is strangling itself with its road traffic problems. If we do not look for the answers now we will have a problem, as we move into the twenty-first century, that will, frankly, ruin our city. The Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the State Government, as a result of the strong representations that have been made by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck), is proceeding to the construction of a second bridge across the Derwent River. Frankly, if it is not called the Good luck Bridge there will be something wrong somewhere. That bridge will go from Dowsings Point to Old Beach. It is in the planning stages at the moment, but I would make the plea that the bridge when constructed have provision for a radway track linking the eastern shore with the western shore. I make that point because on the eastern shore there will be within the next decade an available travelling public numbering in excess of60,000. I wish now, with the consent of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), to refer to and have incorporated in Hansard the figures from the last census in relation to the Hobart statistical division. Perhaps I could refer to them briefly first. The Tasmanian Year Book for 1978 sets out the population of the Hobart statistical division. A comparison of the figures from the census of 1966, the census of 1971 and the census of 30 June 1976 will show that Hobart is growing. As at June 1976 the population of the Hobart statistical division was 162,660.1 repeat, its population will reach 200,000 by the year 2000, and on the eastern shore there wtil be at least 60,000 to 80,000 potential travellers. So it is not much to ask at this point oftimethat when the bridge is being planned, the engineers ensure that it will be possible for a railway track to corporated therein. The bridge will be built as a result of the efforts of the honourable member for Franklin and the co-operation between the Federal and State governments. I wish to refer now to evidence given by Professor Carey to the royal commission into urban transport conducted by His Honour, Mr Justice Neasey, one of the finest judges not just in Tasmania but in Australia. The professor pointed out that by a comparatively short line, speaking in railway terms, one could virtually provide instant pollution-free-it would be electrifiedtransportation from the eastern shore into Hobart.",63
130,Mr GOODLUCK,TARIFF PROPOSALS,What about the ferries?,64
131,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I will refer to the ferries in a moment. I want to make the point that Hobart will strangle itself unless we plan for the future. It is absolutely imperative that a railway track be incorporated in the bridge and that a proper Hobart suburban passenger rail service be reintroduced. I cannot spare from criticism the National Railways Commission- I exclude the Minister because it was none of his doing-for selling off our railways. Honourable members can imagine the embarrassment that I as a Tasmanian felt when I picked up today's Hobart Mercury and saw an article which read: Selling, used train. Pssstt . . . want to buy a nice train. How about the Tasman Limited, four original carriages only, last used on July 28 when Tasmania's passenger train service became history? It goes on to talk about the crucifixion of Tasmania's railway system. I want to put it on the record here and now for the benefit of those who want to try and blame this Government and the Commonwealth Minister for Transport that the death warrant of Tasmanian railways was signed by the State Labor Government of Tasmania when it killed the Hobart suburban passenger rail service, when it sold the railways to the Whitlam Government. That is a contract that we could debate at very great length. Now we do not have a single government-run railway passenger service in Tasmania. That is a crying shame, a monumental stupidity and damned be those who were responsible for the decision. If we do not think about the future, if we are not prepared to consider the situationMr Barry Jones-What about the Canberra bus service?",64
132,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"More money is wasted on the Canberra bus service than ever was lost on the Hobart suburban passenger rail service. The ratio is about six to one, if the honourable be in- member wants thefigures.The Hobart suburban passenger rail service was running at a loss of $750,000 and it got the nulla nulla from your Labor colleagues in Tasmania. I would be surprised if the Canberra buses did not run at a loss m excess of $6m. The figures I have given show the comparisons. Tasmania is the only State without a passenger suburban rail service or a passenger rail service of any sort. Some matters are highly embarrassing. The Department of Social Security issues to pensioners in Tasmania cards which entitle them to free government rail transport. That is absolutely wonderful! No service is available in Tasmania for the pensioners to travel on. Consequently, they are a little upset, and I am upset. Let me make the record quite clear. The responsibihty for this monstrous dereliction of duty, this disgraceful blunder, rests with the State Labor Government. I now turn to ferries. After the collapse of the Tasman bridge in Hobart following the collision of the Lake Illawarra Hobart was split into two cities. It was that tragedy which brought into the limelight, first in local government and now in Federal Government, my colleague the honourable member for Frarddin, Mr Bruce Good luck, MHR. During the time that the bridge was down the people on the eastern shore had to reorganise their transport anangements. The magnificent and glorious Derwent River provided splendid access. Ferry compames such as Sullivans Cove Ferry Co. Pty Ltd and Roche Bros, in conjunction with the Transport Commission which acquired in very strange circumstances ferries from several places, one or two of which were not exacdy a success, provided a ferry service across the Derwent at thattimeof crisis. It was a monumental achievement and one which will be remembered for many years. What happened? As the honourable member for Lalor pointed out before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, the moment the bridge was restored people got back into their wretched motor cars and the city of Hobart, which was a quiet, tranquil and placid sort of place while the bridge was down, was absolutely invaded almost overnight by that monster the motor car. People in Hobart, the smallest and most beautiful capital city in Austraha, have trouble parking. It now takes 10 to 15 minutes to travel two or three blocks. Pollution now exists in the area; it was not present before. This madness Rural Total urban . . . 131,070 must be brought to a halt. Whilst I cannot put it in such an articulate manner as the honourable member for Lalor, let me say that we have somehow somewhere got to orient people towards public transport. For my own part I unashamedly say that when and where possible I will use public transport in preference of my own motor vehicle. Mr Wilson-You wtil.",64
133,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Indeed , I do, and I do a fair bit of walking which is the cheapest form of public transport and which is not bad for one's health either. I have only one minute left. The money made available will be spent with no strings attached from Canberra because this Government does not stand over State governments. I remember being told by Victorian members of parliament that they had to get leave from Mr Charles Jones, the then Minister for Transport, to move a toilet on a railway station 50 yards. Before the toilet could be moved a letter of approval had to be obtained. When the money is spent",65

135,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I wtil do so straight away. I seek leave, with the consent of the Opposition, to render a statistical record of the population of the city of Hobart. The incorporation has been consented to by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). Leave granted.

137,Mr HODGMAN,DIVISION,"The honourable member is not prepared to do so. I cannot expect two favours from him in the one day. I make a final plea: I hope the money is spent wisely. I hope that the Government in Tasmania does not repeat the blunders it made in killing the railway service, in dismantling the ferry terminals and selhng off the ferry pontoons. I hope that the people of Tasmania and in particular the people of Hobart get value for every single dollar which the Commonwealth Government, through its enlightened pohcies, will make available to them over the nextfiveyears.",65
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DIVISION,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,66
139,Mr DAWKINS,DIVISION," I find myself in an extraordinary position of having to put forward some of the same arguments as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), put forward. He finds himself in a posidon where a Labor State government has closed down a suburban rail system, much to his consternation, and Ifindmyself in a position where a State Liberal government in Western Australia is proceeding to do much the same thing. I agree with him that anybody who supports the idea of closing down suburban rati systems at this time is indeed short-sighted. However, one of the major deficiencies of this legislation is that it limits very much the degree to which a federal government can intervene in those sort of decision-making processes. This legislation is designed simply to react to proposals put forward by the States rather than to encourage the formulation and the development of sensible urban public transport systems which are consistent with overall national objectives. It is possible, and in the case of Western Austraha quite likely, that the States can pursue transport policies which are inimical to the national interest. For instance the 1978 annual report of the Western Australia Director General of Transport notes that public transport will continue to decline in metropohtan Perth and that private transportation, that is, the use of the private motor vehicle, will continue to increase. The report goes on to suggest that public transport planning in Perth should be based on those predictions. This in part follows from the fact that Perth, like many other Australian capitals, is a very low density city. It has only 12 sons to the hectare. This compares with London which has six times that many and Helsinki which has about three and a half times that many. Even Los Angeles has twice the density of Perth. Sydney and Melbourne have about one and a half times the density. Any low density city is much less Ukely to be able to sustain an economic transport system simply because of the low utilisation of the public transport facilities. It goes without saying that it is much harder to get the residents in any low density city close to the pubUc transport facilities. Low density cities have a very scattered population and a very diffuse pubUc transport system which of course is unable to provide an adequate service. Once having decided to pursue a pohcy of low density urban development it follows, in the interests of mobility and flexibility, that it is almost certain that private transportation will be the preferred method used by most people. If we compare private motor vehicle ownership in Australia with that in other countries we find that Australia is second only to the United States of America. In Australia there are 350 cars per thousand of population. In the United States of America the figure is about 400 whereas in Western Europe it is only 250 per thousand of population. This high rate of vehicle ownership and indeed the high rate of private vehicle use have a major effect on our consumption of motor spirit. Again, Australia is second only to the United States in terms of consumption of motor spirit. Whereas the United States consumes about 1,300 kilograms per head Australia uses about half of that-abou t 650-and Western Europe about half of that again-abou t 300 kilograms per person. It is here that we see the coincidence of pubhc transport issues and national issues. We cannot separate public transport issues from, for instance, the need for a national energy policy. This Government, indeed any government with any sense at all, should be attempting to pursue some sort of national energy policy at this time. Yet any attempt to reduce the consumption of oil in this or any other country will be frustrated by higher private vehicle ownership and higher private vehicle use. Another aspect relates to the funding of roads which is, of course, a well established Commonwealth function. Currently the funding of roads is dealt with as if it had nothing to do with public transport issues, but of course we all know that it does. There is a direct relationship between the number of cars owned in the community and the demand for bigger and better roads. As soon as that sort of situation starts to develop, decisions per- have to be made as regards private vehicle ownership as opposed to the provision of public transportation. In addition, any expenditure on roads represents a separate subsidy for buses which does not appear in normal public transport allocations, thus allowing the buses to receive a subsidy separate from that which is received for trains. Therefore it follows that any provision of funds to the States for roads bears very closely on questions of pubhc transportation and, of course, energy use. So, I would disagree with the honourable member for Denison who earlier said in his speech that it was inappropriate for the Commonwealth to get involved in urban pubhc transportation issues. In my view, it is impossible to separate the questions of public transportation from national energy policies as indeed it is impossible to separate urban public transportation programs from many other federal programs. I think the energy question is no more important in any State than it is in Western Australia. Of all the States, Western Australia relies most heavily on the importation of crude oil and even when the gas from the North West Shelf comes to Perth it will have a minimal application as transpon fuel. At the moment Western Australia has no electrified public transport system. Consequently, we rely solely on liquid fuels which before long will be almost entirely imported. So against this background that the decision of the Western Australian Government to scrap the Penh to Fremande passenger rail service is so absurd. The Western Australian Government has nounced that, after September this year, the passenger rail service will cease and that buses will serve the routes between Perth and Fremantle. We are told that two years from the railway itself will be way will be constructed on the railway reserve. We are given little if any justification for the decision except that the patronage of the railways is on the decline and that the subsidy per passenger reserve. is less in the case of buses than in the case of trains. However, no explanation is given for fact that patronage of the suburban railways increased by over 10 per cent last year while the sametimepatronage of the bus services conalso tinued to decline. We are not told whether the subsidy calcuenough lation includes a component of the interest on fixed capital. If it does, this would be a great tortion of the situation given the fact that buses rely on roads which are separately and, I might add, heavily subsidised while trains require arate capital equipment in the form of rails. are not told about the extra contribution that buses will make to the already congested roadresult ways between Perth and Fremande. We are not told about the costs of the proposed freeway which it is intended will be built on the railway reserve. Indeed, the decision bears all the hallclean marks of a knee-jerk reaction to the immediate deficit which has been chalked up by the railways. It was only in August 1975 that the Premier Western Australia said that the adverse economhas ies of rail operations compared with bus operPerth ations over the next 20 years were understood, but that the Government believed that the long term considerations could not be overlooked. went on to say that the Government wanted to maintain the passenger rail service at a maximum level. That is what was said by the Premier a little over three years ago but now we have had a complete change of heart, based we are not sure on what, resulting in a decision to scrap one of the passenger rail services serving metropolitan Perth. Let us compare that particular about-face with a statement by a former Liberal Minister for Transport in the Western Australian Government. In 1968 that Minister ridiculed the proit is posal to butid a freeway between Perth and Fremande on the railway reserve. At that timeabout 10 years ago-h e costed such a project at $50m and said that that was an astronomic expense which could not be justified. As well we have the opinion of Professor Gordon anStephenson, a man who has had more influence on the planning of Perth than probably any other extra individual. Earlier this month, Professor Stephenson said in reply to a letter from the Minnow ister for Transport m the Western Australian dismantled and a freeGovernment: Despite the length ofhis letter I was unable to understand the planning strategy behind the change in function of the the What is desperately needed in metropolitan Perth is not only an explanation how the at Government arrived at this absurd decision, but some justification for it and some indication of what are the long-term prospects for those people who reside in metropolitan Perth. It is not to discount a public transport system simply on the basis of economics. It is probably distrue that no public transpon system will pay in a city hke Perth because of it low population density. But Perth has a low population density by sepdeliberate choice, a choice made on grounds We other than economics. The decision to pursue a policy of low density planning for Perth was the of the high priority given to such factors as the desirability of single residential accommodation, the proximity of recreational facilities and open space, the desirability of maintaining a environment and reduced sanitation problems. So clearly, because the planning decisions in Perth are based on grounds other than economic grounds, it is quite unfair to evaluate public of transport issues on purely economic grounds. It been stated that, of all the mainland capitals, has the worse public transport facilities. Of course what we need is to see those pubhc transport facilities improved in accordance with He some well laid out plan that, in the Premier's own words of a few years ago, takes into consideration the long-term implications of those decisions. I do not think that one can over-emphasise the importance of the energy considerations in this equation. As I have said, Western Australia already relies disproportionately on imported liquid fuels and, as the price of those imported liquid fuels continues to escalate, there will be serious repercussions for the transportation system in metropolitan Perth. The only indigenous fuels which Western Australia has consist of the gas from the North West Shelf, that is, not counting the gas at Dongara, which of course will soon be depleted, and the coal at Collie. We will be relying on that for the generation of electricity. It seems to me that what we should be doing at the very least is trying to make ourselves as independent as possible of the vagaries of the international oil market. We should be moving towards a public transportation system which relies substantially on electricity. For this reason it seems to me that the Government is making a serious mistake in opting purely for buses in the development of a public transportation system in Perth. I think that this decision has been made quite deliberately. For instance, if we look at the requests of the Western Australian State Government to the Federal Government for support under this program and the preceding program, we find that the State Government has asked for almost nothing to upgrade the State's suburban rail system. Indeed, under the program set out in the legislation that we are debating tonight, the Western Australian State Government did not ask for a cent in relation to the suburban rail system for the current year. The only requests that were made were in relation to upgrading and expanding the State's bus service. There can be no lame excuses that it is all the fault of the Commonwealth Government that the State Government has had to scrap a suburban railway line. The State Government has made no attempt at all to invest the sort of capital which would be required to continue the rati systems. A study made by the Bureau of Transport is Economics some years ago indicated that urban whether the Government chose the bus option or the train option between Perth and Fremantle would be involved in a vast capital expense. Yet nothing has been done by the Western Ausat tralian Government to approach the Federal Government with a view to providing that capital infusion. Instead the railways have been lowed to decline steadily. The newest rolling stock on the suburban rail system is already years old. Most of the rolling stock is well beyond its economic life. There have been very few attempts to have the bus and train services complement each other. Only in the Midland area is there a serious attempt to use the buses to feed the railway system between the Midland Station and Perth. I note with some interest that there will be an attempt to use a bus feeder system between Perth and Armadale to serve the railway line. I simply ask why that is not a possibility on the line between Perth and Fremantle. Instead there is direct competition between buses and trains to serve almost identical routes between Perth and Fremantle. Not only has this been a deliberate attempt to downgrade the railways in favour of the buses, it also overlooks the studies which have been done in relation to Perth's future public transport needs. Both the Netisen report and the Wilbur Smith report made in the early 1970s indicated that by 1993, which was the end of the period under consideration, it would probably be necessary to consider other options besides the bus option which was preferred by both those studies. We are already one-third of the way through the period with which those reports were concerned. I imagine that the circumstances which are clearer now than then will indicate the good sense of that observation by those studies. By 1993 it is almost certain that we will want to consider options other than a bus service fuelled by imported liquid fuels. We are seeing the beginning of another very expensive mistake by a State Liberal government. I do not have to remind honourable members about the occasion when an earlier State Liberal government converted a perfectly good coal burning power station south of Perth to an oil burning power station only to have to conven it back to coal only in the last couple of years at the cost of about $9m. In this issue the Federal Government has to take a strong stand. In the first instance, before the State Government is allowed to share in the funds available under this program, the Federal Government must insist that a proper evaluation made of the electrification of the existing subrail system in Perth. Secondly it must indicate its total opposition to a super freeway beit tween Perth and Fremande and indicate that it will not support that freeway with federal funds least until such time as an evaluation of the electrified rail system option is undertaken.",66
140,Mr CHAPMAN,DIVISION,"The alStates Grants (Urban Public Transport) Amendment Bill which we are debating this evening in11 troduces minor changes to the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978. The original Bill was passed through the Parhament in last year. It gave effect to the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his 1977 election policy speech for a new assistance has program for urban pubhc transport through nonobjections repayable grants to the States amounting to as $300m over 5 years. This represents an increase of 58 per cent over the previous 5-year program initiated by the Whitlam Government. Of course that program was boosted by 40 per cent in its final 2 years of operation when the Fraser Government came to office. Thus, in a time general expenditure restraint the Fraser Governalso ment has demonstrated its commitment to nificantly improved public transport for rens Australia's major urban centres through gready increased funding. The principal Act provided $200m to be split amongst the various States over 5 years on the basis of a fixed schedule. The remaining $100m was allocated over 5 years amongst the States on an annual basis according to the assessed need for additional assistance over and above the fixed schedule. In this way the full $300m allocated over 5 years. This Bill increases the location under the fixed schedule to $225m over 5 years. It reduces the variable needs assessed funding to $75m. It leaves the total allocation funds unchanged at $300m but increases the guaranteed minimum allocation for each State. Thus, South Austraha has its guaranteed miniahead. mum allocation increased from $20m to under $22,500,000 over 5 years. South Australia, of course, also has access the remaining $75m on a needs basis. When speaking in the debate on the original Bill last year I asked the Federal Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) to scrutinise carefully any proposals from South Austraha under the new legislation and to use his influence to ensure that the South Australian Government gives the outer suburban southern areas of my electorate of Kingston a higher priority in the provision of public transport facilities than it has in the past. I ferred in support of my plea to several bad dedrop cisions by the State Government and its total neglect of the southern areas. I specifically ferred to the possible implementation of the recommendations of the North East Area Public Transport Review. Events in South Austraha since last April further emphasise the need for close scrutiny by the Federal Minister of the pose of any request for funds by South Austraha. The South Australian Labor Government has April decided to proceed with the NEAPTR recommendation for a light rail transport system between Adelaide and the north-eastern suburbs. It taken this decision despite a range of serious to the proposal. There are real doubts to its validity. There is significant evidence to suggest that the need in the north-eastern suburbs is not for transport to the central business district but rather for transport within the local area and to the industrial locations in the north and north-western suburbs. These needs are not of fulfilled by the NEAPTR proposals. There are serious environmental objections about the sigimpact of the NEAPTR proposals on the TorRiver valley and also the inner suburbs adjacent to that valley through which the light rail transport system would pass. Therefore, it wtil be an important issue in the forthcoming Norwood by-election. The people of the inner suburbs will have the opportunity then to give judgment on the State Governments decision in this regard. A major objection to the proposals is their cost. The original estimate of about $60m to provide the hght rail transport system has now been rewas vised to an estimated cost of $100m. That is alclearly beyond the State's resources particularly with the South Australian regional economy in a parlous state as a result of the Labor Governof ment's policies. Last week the State Minister of Transport, Mr Virgo, said that South Australia would seek federal funding for this project to go I assume that the funds will be sought the legislation which we are now debating. Through this legislation in recent years the Federal Government has provided two-thirds of the total funds applied to improve pubhc transport facilities. For example, two-thirds of the total to funds of $ 11.59m for the building of the Brighton to Christie Downs railway was provided under the previous Act. Under the present Act $4m has been provided in the financial year 1978-79. Another $4m is proposed for the financial year 1979-80 for the purchase of more buses and railway rolling stock for South Australia. This leaves the allocation for South Australia in the final three years of the five-year program at $ 14.5m plus, possibly, some $7m which may be reavailable on a needs basis. This, of course, is a in the bucket against the total cost of the NEAPTR project, even if the cost were scattered reover the seven years as suggested. It is quite unrealistic for the State Government to expect sufficient Commonwealth funds to be made available for this project. On past performpurance there is no doubt that the State Labor Government will blame the Commonwealth Government if a shortage of funds prevent the project from proceeding but this would be one instance when I would be quite happy for the Commonwealth Government to accept the blame. In fact, I believe that the Commonwealth Government would deserve praise if it prevented the NEAPTR proposals being implemented. Even if the funds were available from combined Commonwealth and State sources I would urge the Federal Minister for Transport to reject the proposal because there certainly would not be any funds for any alternative projects in metropoUtan Adelaide if such a massive investment went into NEAPTR. The State Government would be closing off its options for alternative solutions to metropolitan Adelaide's total transport needs. Evidence suggests that a greater net benefit could be derived from the expenditure of $ 100m on pubhc transport if the money were invested in facUities right across Adelaide rather than in one narrowly directed transport corridor. Even more important, proceeding with NEAPTR wtil result in the continuation of the State Government's neglect of the outer suburban southern areas which make up the well-known Noarlunga region. That neglect would be forced to continue if this $100m were directed to the NEAPTR project because there would not be funds available for alternative projects. Research now available indicates that some 47 per cent of metropoUtan Adelaide's future traffic growth wtil be generated in this southern region. By comparison the north and north-eastern suburbs combined wtil generate only some 37 per cent of future growth. Yet the State Labor Government intends to splurge $100m on the north-eastern area alone. The inevitable result will be total neglect of the southern areas and residents of the southern areas should be aware of the State Government's intention to continue neglecting their transport needs unless pubhc pressure is brought to bear against that decision. Honourable members wil be aware that on a number of occasions I have highlighted the need of the southern areas of the Kingston electorate for greater assistance within the public transport realm. More recent research has once again highlighted and confirmed those needs. It indicates that the overall level of travel demand expected in the southern areas cannot be met by the existing transport networks and substantial improvements to both the highway and public transport networks will be necessary. Serious capacity problems will be experienced on both the highway and pubUc transport networks as early as 1980, and these problems will become more acute as growth continues. This evidence is already generating considerable pubUc concern and this concern has been expressed in the local area. Already there is increasing congestion and environmental decline in the inner areas such as Brighton and Marion to the north of O'Halloran Hill, and a lack of access to public transport and increasing congestion on South Road. This wtil occur also on Lonsdale Road which wtil be completed shortly with the assistance of Federal funds. With a estimated population growth of 100,000 between 1976 and 1996 there will be a lack of capacity in rail services and bus services on main routes. Despite the fact that this recent evidence is avaUable to the State Government, it has made no commitment to fulfill the needs of the southern areas and, of course, it cannot as long as it remains committed to funding the NEAPTR Ught rati transport system at a cost of $ 100m. Research affirms the view which has been expressed by local government bodies and the community in general in the Noarlunga region, that unless major investments are committed to the transport system-bot h the road system and pubUc transport system-the situation wtil be chaotic by the mid-1980s and totally disastrous by the early 1990s. A lack of action by the State Government cannot be justified on economic, social or environmental considerations. The south deserves an equal, if not greater, commitment than the north-eastern areas of Adelaide. There is no doubt that currently the southern region is considerably disadvantaged with regard to transport facUities. It is also evident that the transport system wtil impose severe costs on industry which is either located or proposed to be located in the southern area. On the basis of locational theory, it is obvious that any increase in congestion and travel times wtil increase the costs of production for existing industry and, of course, act as a further disincentive to new industrial development in that region. If no action occurs the cost to individual families will be immense. There could be an increase in journey time of some 50 per cent, an increase in petrol consumption of 25 per cent, and an estimated additional cost to families in the area of $ 16m per year by the 1980s. Without action with regard to public transport and new rail alternatives, there will be a rapid escalation of traffic at the major exchange points of Darlington, Sturt Road and Brighton Road where the volume of traffic is expected toriseby up to 100 per cent. The current and committed future rail and bus capacity will be hopelessly inadequate. There is an expected growth of some 300 per cent in public transport usage over the next few years leading into the 1980s and beyond. One of the main complaints about the public transport in the region is that a large part of the region is not serviced or, at least, is inadequately serviced. Hence there are a number of things which need to be done to cope with this developing problem. From the eastern side of the southern region there need to be express and route services to town. There need to be feeder services to the Christie Downs rail link. There needs to be a local transport system to transport people within the region itself and there also needs to be an adequate transport service to outlying areas. Of course, one of the main developments in the area in recent years was the completion of the Brighton to Christie Downs rail tink with Federal funding, and it is worth noting that this facility cost $11.59m compared with the projected $100m for a similar sort of service to the north-eastern suburbs. The rail service has become highly regarded over the last couple of years and this indicates that people will use pubhc transport if it is able to meet the needs of consumers. However, several problems for the rati system are evident and will develop in the transport usage will grow from 2,600 persons in a peak two-hour period in 1976 to 4,900 persons in 1986 and 8,200 persons in 1996. The current orders for rolling stock will just not be able cope with this projected growth. So, to cope the expected demand, new stock wtil need to be ordered and once again this brings us back to fact that the State Government cannot afford to invest $100m in the NEAPTR project if it is going to provide the necessary facilities for southern region. With regard to road traffic we find that South Road is already the busiest road in the State. Notwithstanding the development with Federal funding of the Lonsdale link, traffic volumes are expected to rise dramatically. Peak hour vehicle trips will double from 7,100 to 14,000 by 1996. As a result, journey times at peak hours could increased by over 100 per cent if remedial action is not taken in the public transport sector. Within the Noarlunga region there are a number areas where there are indications of poor service. Most significant is the coastal strip running Seaford through Moana to Maslin Beach and Sellicks Beach. Additional to these poorly viced areas are the outlying rural townships of Willunga, MCLaren Vale, Noarlunga and Clarsuaded endon. Further north, part of Hallett Cove has inadequate services. Flagstaff Hill, Aberfoyle Park and Happy Valley also are suffering poor services, as are parts of Noarlunga and Morphett Vale. So a largely increased degree of attention is required to be devoted to those particular areas within the Noarlunga region to overcome the problem which is already evident, and, of course, as time proceeds through the 1980s to the 1990s, as indicated by statistics I gave earlier, that problem will multiply immensely. One of the other factors that needs to be considered in the context of urban public transpon for the southern region is the mismatch of employment opportunities in relation to population growth in the area. Of course, one of the main factors preventing the growth of employment opportunities in that area is the additional cost of inadequate transport to industry located there. Therefore any strategy that seeks to promote the economic development of the south will clearly be restrained by the availability of adequate public and private transport services. Hence, it is required that there be a development of a series of new road services to maintain reasonable transport access, not only to the metropolitan area but, of course, to the very important eastern States markets, which are crucial to South future. Public Austraha's economic growth. Unless action is taken, the situation for road transport will worsen. Of course, the implications to are that the cost of production will the southern with region will increase by comparison with other parts of the metropolitan area of Adelaide that the have better access and possibly, more importantly, the lack of transport access wtil be an additional disincentive for the location of new the enterprises within the southern areas. So there are a number of factors which indicate not only the inadequacy in the present but more importantly the developing inadequacy in the future of the transport situation in the Noarlunga region. Therefore, it is on that basis I again urge the Federal Minister for Transport to assess carefully any request for funds from the South Australian be State Government to ensure that that Government does give the Noarlunga region a fair deal in the allocation of funds. It is certainly not doing of that by allocating $100m to the light rail transport system recommended by the NEAPTR from research team. Of course the Bill before the House will provide the opportunity for the serNoarlunga region to benefit from Commonwealth funds if the State Government can be perto behave with equity towards that area. On that basis I wholeheartedly support the Bill and oppose the amendment which has been from moved by the Opposition.",68
141,Mr HOWE,DIVISION,"I support the then amendment and support the expression of regret that funding in the earher stages of the five-year program to assist the States with urban pubhc transport improvements should be cut back. cause part of the original allocation for the first two years will not be spent until later, the real value of the funds that have been allocated under this program will be reduced. Whilst suppeople porting the amendment, one recognises that through this legislation the Government has acknowledged the need to continue to provide for the States increased Federal assistance support urban public transport programs. There are a number of issues of a general nature that I would like to comment on. The first question which arose last year when this legisto lation was being introduced in its original form and which I come back to at this stage when have an amendment in relation to funding is the question of what scale of funding is justified on national basis at this stage in our history for urban public transport and how we should detersystems mine the basis of funding in an area such as this. Several speakers on the Government side acknowledged the need for the Australian forms Government and indeed for this nation to be expanding expenditure in this area, but they gested it was simply a matter of Budget priorities and that in terms of the formulation of this year's Budget it was not possible to meet the expendinationally ture which had been originally foreshadowed. Indeed, they suggested that over the period one could not see how the Government could give greater priority to national urban public that transport. I think one of the difficulties one has in of assessing that sort of proposition is the little formation that is provided to the Parliament the basis of which one can make a judgment as to what level of expenditure ought to be justified. think it is regrettable that a great deal more formation is not provided on legislation such this and that members of parliament do not have more access to the process of decision-making which results in afigureof $300m. Certainly, terms of the reading I did on the background deficit papers produced by the Bureau of Transport Economics, I was unable to see very much rea total lationship between its discussion of the capital needs of urban public transport and the particuState lar proposals which have been adopted by the Government. Certainly, one does not see this which program in any sense as part of a national transport plan. If transport is as important as am sure members of this House beheve it is, parwill ticularly in relation to the rising costs of energy, one ought to be thinking at this stage of the Government developing some kind of national and comprehensive approach to transport planning which tries to sort out relative spending beBetween the various modes and tries to see how national priorities might relate to what is happening in the various States around Australia. If the energy crisis is to develop the way that many beheve it is likely to develop through into the 1980s, then certainly we will need national energy policies, which we do not have at the moment, we will need a national energy plan and I to believe we will need a national transport plan. That is really thefirstpoint I make. In a sense, the discussion about how much money we ought to be spending on urban public transport seems lack any kind of context in terms of detailed Federal or national policy on transport priorities. we So thefigurefor Government assistance looks a bit like afigurethat has been plucked out of the a air rather than a figure that might relate to, say, a five-year program for upgrading certain kinds of within the various cities of Australia. Surely at the national level we at least need to be thinking in terms of what the most appropriate of pubhc transport wtil be in the dispersed cities that other speakers have been describing. sugWhilst ultimately the decisions may have to be made within a State context, nevertheless I beheve, there ought to be much more discussion about the framework within which those decisions are made. Secondly, I draw attention to the scale of funds are involved, particularly for the Victorian railway network and the metropolitan provincial parts of that network, to indicate what I beheve terms will be one of the major problems that we will inface in Australia if people are right when they on say that if we are to have any kind of equity within our cities we will have to develop effective I modern public transport systems. I noticed that intowards the end of last year the Leader of the as Victorian Opposition asked the Victorian Minister of Transport to provide him with information on the funding for the Victorian railways. The in annual debt repayments on the accumulated of the Victorian railways is of the order of $150m. I understand that thatfigureis servicing deficit of the order of $2.7 billion dollars. We are talking about one railway system in one of Australia. If one looks at that system, the extent to which it is run down, the extent to it is not effectively functioning to meet the needs of people in the metropolitan area and I provincial cities, and the scale of investment that be required to restore that system to something which functions effectively, then really one finds that the scale of investment involved is quite mind-boggling. The metropolitan transport plan which was developed in 1969 is hardly an urban pubhc transport plan; it is essentially a freeway plan on which a limited amount of money- I think something like one-fifth of the Mr Barry Jones-Te n per cent.",72
142,Mr HOWE,DIVISION,"Ten per cent of the total expenditure was to be directed towards public transport. Of that amount of moneyMr Barry Jones-$300m out of $3,000m.",73
143,Mr HOWE,DIVISION,"The former State member for Melbourne assures me that the amount was $300m out of $3,000m. As I remember it the initial estimate of the cost of the Melbourne underground loop was of the order of $80m. When the controlling authority was established it investigated the project and came up with a figure of $117m. But as I understand it, the latest estimate of the cost of the Melbourne underground loop, towards which I think the Commonwealth has contributed nothing, will be of the order of $400m. That is for one project. It is one project in which it is clear that almost all the gains will be for the central business district and the retail interests and the property developers and the finance compames who anticipated that development. To some extent, in collusion with the Victorian Government, they have encouraged that development to take priority over all sorts of capital expenditures that might have been developed to improve the workings of that system so that peoples' access to schools, hospitals and community facilities might have been improved. In that kind of situation in which a State governmentfixesa priority on that kind of basis one despairs about national priorities for transport planning in Australia. One finds it difficult to believe that we will reach a situation in which tive transport planning can occur. That takes me on to the third point I wanted to make which is to pick up something that the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) touched on very well. I beheve he made a significant contribution to this debate. He emphasised the close interrelationship between land use planning and transport planning. In Victoria-indeed , one might argue, in almost all Australian cities with the possible exception of Canberra-w e do not really have land use planning or transport planning. We certainly do not have land use planning. So we have a situation in which governments take on the job of attempting to rationatise decisions that are made by powerfulfinancialinterests and land companies after those compames have determined the direction of investment. The history of Australian cities is clearly a history of booms and busts. From the very beginning of the city of Melbourne-indee d the same is true of most other Australian cities-w e have seen development of a city fostered not by the use value of land but essentially in terms of its value for speculation and capital gains. The history of Victorian cities-certainl y the history of Melbourne-is very much the product of that kind of process. Only recently in Victoria we saw that the State Government itself has been closely related with that processs just as it was in the 1880s when so much of the suburban development of the early city of Melbourne occurred around the speculation of compames that were associated with the various railway lines that established that radial system which the honourable member for Lalor was describing. The result of a process of land development which is essentially based on speculation and private decision making, which takes little if any account of the public good and the need for overall planning, is a disaster in terms of transport. It means that governments are asked to socialise the losses after the profits have been made by these companies during the periods of boom. We are asked as governments to provide the services no matter how irrational the pattern of urban development may have been. That of course means that development is extraordinarily expensive. Whether one is talking about sewerage, water supply or educational services-whateve r the services are-the y are incredibly expensive and it is those service costs which are being borne by the Government. We need to take this into account when we talk about thefinancingof the public sector and the financing of transport planning. I take issue with the honourable member for effec- Denison (Mr Hodgman). He talked about this question in terms of the Government investing large amounts of money in Tasmania to restore a railway system that has been dismantled. Certainly the Government ought to be responsible for providing public services but one cannot expect governments in Australia to continue to provide those services based, as the honourable member for Denison recognises, on increasing levels of taxation within a context which makes those services prohibitively expensive. Therefore this inevitably produces a situation in which people are paying more tax than they ought to be paying to provide services which are essentially designed to rescue the investments of people who ought to have invested with some sense of social planning and social objectives but who in fact were much more interested in the profits that could be made. The result of that situadon ultimately is that people are disadvantaged. Essentially that is what politics is about; it is about people. Essentially that is what economics is about. These decisions that are made have an impact on people. In the provincial city of Geelong, for example, the Young Women's Christian Association late last year conducted a good survey of about a thousand women in the Geelong area. The survey showed that the most significant problem to which the women drew attention was the lack of public transport services. Above all the other problems that they might conceivably have mentioned it was transport that was the key. Clearly transport is important not simply for women but for all people in terms of relating them to a whole range of activities. Indeed people's social well-being and their real income is very much affected by how they relate to or are not related to any kind of transport system. The Victorian Government has talked for years about developing a transport plan for Geelong and doing something about this problem. But so far it has not done anything about it and the people who lose from that lack of planning of Geelong's development particularly are women such as those surveyed by the YWCA. I guess that one of the difficulties that one in relation to Federal-State relations is the gree of control that the national Government ought to have in relation to the expenditure priorities of particular governments. I guess as the Federal Government did not contribute the Melbourne underground loop in a sense that expenditure could go ahead and the Federal Government ought not to have any say. But is rather dismayed from time totimewhen one comes across the activities of particular governhad ments and what is involved with them. Late last year I read in the newspapers of a $8m purchase by the Victorian Government from Clyde Indusframework. tries Ltd of 10 C-class locomotives which apparently were bought without the recognition by the Government that they would be able to operate on only about two lines in the State. An amount of $8m was spent. Indeed, associated with that purchase was the fact that Mr Vernon Wilcox, who had been Minister of Transport in Victoria, I think in the late 1960s, was on the board company which sold these trains to the Victorian Government. It may just be coincidence and transport there may not be much in it. Certainly Mr aster. Hamer, who tends to be somewhat naive about his former Ministers, tended to think",73
144,Mr NA BROWN,DIVISION,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. You may not be aware that a Supreme Court writ has been issued with respect to allegations relating to that matter. The matter, therefore, is sub judice.",74
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DIVISION,"If that is so, I suggest to the honourable member for Batman that he does not refer to that particular matter. Mr N. A Brown-He should refer to something relevant for a change.",74
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DIVISION,"Order! I admit that I have allowed the debate to be fairly wideranging. Therefore, I have not restricted the honourable member. But I think that if there is any doubt about the judicial side of the matter it would be better if he refers only to the legislation before the House.",74
147,Mr HOWE,DIVISION,"I commented earUer on the fact that we do not have anything like a national transport plan. Presumably the Federal Government which negotiates with the States in relation to the particular projects that are eUgible to receive funds under this particular program is aware of the extent or the lack of the extent of planning in the transport area. Given the problems to which I have been referring that affect the Victorian Government in relation to has transport planning it is quite extraordinary that denothing currently exists that might be described as a transport plan. We had an earlier plan which was essentially a freeway plan. It is not a plan that ning framework within which urban public to transport might be developed in Victoria. One wonders about the usefulness of making allocations to State governments such as the one Victorian Government that do not have transport plans. The Victorian Government has plenty of opportunity to develop a transport plan and has talked about it a great deal but it has not managed to establish a planning One recalls that in 1976 the Victorian Government promised that it would create a metropolitan transit authority. Here we are in 1979 and nothing like a metropolitan transit authority has been established by the Victorian Government. It has not managed to develop a plan and it has of the not managed to develop an appropriate authority. In terms of its history of involvement in planning, it represents a planning disIf one correlates that with its history in relation to land use planning and its involvement both direcdy and indirectly in the speculative land industry, one sees a position which is extremely disturbing considering that Commonwealth money is flowing into that particular State. One can only believe that in the heat of the election campaign the Victorian Government will finally commit itself to some kind of transport plan and it will finally establish a transit authority and develop some rationality in transport planning.",74
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DIVISION,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,75
149,Mr MCVEIGH,DIVISION,"The National Country Party supports the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Amendment Bill 1978 and is opposed to the amendment moved by the Opposition. We are opposed to the Opposition's amendment because of its implied criticism of a worthwhile initiative of the present Government and for its rather simplistic approach to a solution of a problem which unfortunately is a growing problem. At the outset I state briefly the reasons for the National Country Party's support of this Bill. The National Country Party has established a reputation second to none for being a responsible Party, a just Party and a Party which pays great tribute to being accurate in its statements. No serious proposition has been advanced by our most fervent and vitriolic opponents that we do not fulfil those very high expectations which are held by the community at large. We are responsible because we support this Bill. We support it because of very difficult economic circumstances. It would be wrong for a government, as was stated by speakers on this side of the House previously, to increase taxation for the purpose of paying out unlimited amounts of money under various State grants legislation. It is a difficult time indeed and it behoves each and every one of us in every section of the Australian community to bear a fair share of the nation's economic restraints. Secondly, we are a just Party. Whilst road ditions in many parts of rural Australia are not good, it is interesting to note that since 1977 there has been a tremendous improvement in quality of Australian roads. We are aware of the difficulties that face city dwellers. We are isolated and we are not ruggedly individual in our approach. We seek also to upgrade the transport opportunities of people who live metropoUtan areas. We are aware of the bottleGeelong necks and the time that is wasted by workers travelUng to work. We are, of course, well reurban nowned for being strong in our points of view and for being absolutely accurate in any expressions that we make. It is on this last point that I seek to correct a few erroneous opinions. Perhaps they have been honestly held opinions but they have been inaccurate. For the record, they should be set straight. The entry of the Federal Government into this area occurred as a result of a promise by the then Government and the then Opposition prior to the 1972 election campaign. Unfortunately for Australia, the free enterprise parties were defeated and we saw the Labor Government-tru e to its election promise-initiat e the necessary legislation. It was a promise made by both parties; it was not a unilateral decision. The States grants legislation introduced by the Labor Government was good legislation. We compliment the Labor Party on that legislation. But from experience it became quite obvious that there were certain shortfalls. This Bill seeks to overcome some of those problems and to improve the legislation so that we can have long range planning rather than planning on an ad hoc basis in a yearly budgetary context as was the case under the Labor Administration. I am not criticising the Labor Government for introducing the legislation; I am just saying that experience has proven that it can be improved. One instance in my own State of planning on an ad hoc basis was the electrification of the railway system in the city of Brisbane. Notwithstanding that a great need existed for continuity of employment, planning and for forward commitment, no money was made available by the then Whitlam Administration for the year 1975-76. This had enormous consequences in the development of the electrification system. The present Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) has sought, quite rightly, to overcome those shortfalls and to give a long range planning commitment to the States in all these areas. Previous legislation appUed to the metropoUtan areas and to the areas of Geelong, Wollongong conand Newcastle. When the present Minister took over this portfolio, he indicated that he beUeved that other people also had problems. He cast the the net wider. We saw a new development and definition of urban cities-citie s with greater than not 40,000 people. I hope that we will have a continuation of this policy, that we can decrease the numbers and that we can have a new category. in We have the corridor development between and Melbourne and so forth. It could well be that in five years' time we would have transport also being applicable, say, to a corridor development between the excellent city of Dalby and Toowoomba. This is the type of proach the Government has adopted to correct the shortfalls in previous legislation. The legislation was introduced as a result of a firm commitment given by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in 1977. The Prime Minisconcern ter wrote to all the State Premiers on 6 February 1978-soo n after the election campaigntan indicating the format of the next State Grants (Urban Public Transport) Bill. It must remembered that any criticism of this legislation that we get from the Opposition or from States is based on the assumption that the monwealth provides two-thirds of the money non-repayable grants and the States provide one-third. For statistical purposes and accuracy of the records, the amount of money made availprovincial able is $300m, which amounts to $450m in with the States' contribution-som e 50 per cent more than the amount of money made avadable under the previous Government's 5-year plan. Whilst the States are free to criticise, they therightto use their own funds and to make conable tributions if they believe a particular area deosition serves a greater input. I believe it is morally wrong for States to adopt an attitude of passing the buck and criticising the central tax gatherer for not giving them enough money to spend on their pet projects. It is all very well to be popular, to buy votes, but in the final analysis the buck passing stops at the table of the Commonwealth Treasurer; he cannot please everyone. The total amount of money available over the 5-year program in this legislation has not been decreased, it is still $300m, but what has hapdoes pened is that there has been a change in the blend or mix of the spht up of money. Actually $225m will be available, as compared with criticism $200m, under a strict formula; and $75m will available, compared with $100m, on a needs people's basis. The $225m has been spht up in a most equitable way according to a formula based three propositions, namely, population in urban areas, anticipated final allocations under the 1973-78 agreement and tax reimbursement applicable shares. Under this formula New South Wales will receive 35 per cent of the $225m, or $78.75m. Victoria will receive 30 per cent, or $67.5m. Queensland will receive 17.5 per cent, or $39.37m. South Australia will receive 10 per cent, or $22.5m. Western Australia will receive per cent, or $11.25m. Tasmania will receive 2.5 percent, or $5.625m. I have had a good look at the various subbut missions forwarded by the different State governments. I must express some concern at apand some criticism of the fact that although the Minister for Transport has nominated certain provincial cities as being eUgible for participation in the scheme, most State governments confined the applications in their submissions to the metropoUtan areas. I must express a little and disappointment at that fact. We all know that States consist of more than metropoUareas. In my own State of Queensland all the moneys will be allocated to the city of Brisbane. I be had hoped that the cities of Townsville, Rockharnpton, Gold Coast, Cairns and the Toowoomba would have attracted sufficient Cominterest from the State Government to have had in their names included in the submission for approval by the Federal Minister. The Federal Minister cannot very well allocate moneys to cities if they are not on the Ust supall plied by the various State governments. The other criticism that I have to make of the have State governments is that it is almost unbelievthat no State government submitted a propsuggesting that under the legislation private bus operators be assisted. One appreciates the fact that local governments and statutory authorities have a prime responsibility to provide pubUc services, but in a free enterprise economy I would have thought it was an eminently feasible proposition to advance that, if private bus operators saw fit to provide a service and to give people the opportunity of making a choice, those private operators could have had their proposition submitted for consideration by the Minister. In certain provincial cities public transport not run at weekends. I know that in my own city of Toowoomba the private bus operators do not run services at weekends. It is a matter for and concern that elderly people, people be who do not drive, cannot go to hospitals or old homes to visit friends or sick relatives because operators do not run services at on weekends. I believe that a government could have advanced money to these private bus operators in a capital sense, because the legislation is only to capital costs, to allow them to look at their operations over the broad spectrum so that they could have provided a service at a loss but by virtue of the fact that their capital costs were somewhat less they could operate at a slightly greater recurrent cost overhead. It is im5 portant that all people, whether they be in provincial cities or metropolitan areas, have the right to use public transport not only during the week also at weekends for purposes of leisure and humanitarian concepts. I hope that the State governments will take up this challenge and in their submissions will forward a request capital help be given to private bus operators. It is disappointing that the Brisbane City Council is totally incapable of running a bus sertake vice at a profit. Last year the Brisbane City Counorder cil's bus service had a loss of $9.4m.

150,Mr MCVEIGH,DIVISION,I am reminded of that by the which member for Brisbane. I am most grateful for his contribution that this is increasing and the providing the public bus service in Brisbane is being borne by the rate payers who in many inmoney stances do not use the buses.  the world are running at a loss. Mr Sainsbury-They should double the fares. They should charge $2 a section.,77
151,Mr MCVEIGH,DIVISION,"The Brisbane City Council ter. seems to have some sort of inbuilt mechanism by which it believes it can buy votes cheaply by losing $9.4m a year-o n the last available figures-on providing a public bus service. That is disappointing. In Australia we can place an order for a train, engines and carriages and these wtil probably take up to 3 years to deliver. However, when comes to buses we have to import them from overseas. May I offer another suggestion for Minister's consideration. Whilst no money can be made available under this legislation for perimental purposes, possibly under the associated legislation of education, planning research into transport matters, money could be made available to develop a bus prototype that we do not have to import engines, the chassis and the drives in such numbers because of the inability of the Austrahan market to proTransport duce the same. One realises it would be a rather limited market, but I believe it is appropriate bring to the attention of the House the success story of Leader Trucks Australia, a private famticular ily company which operates in the city of Toowoomba and which makes trucks which are wealth, much in demand in work which is of a tough the nature-in the heavy, commerical, industrial enterprises. These Leader Trucks have estabworthily lished a reputation for reliability and durability second to none. I suggest that money should be made availelectrification able to Leader Trucks Australia to develop a prototype, just as it has developed a heavy truck for particular Austrahan conditions. Why should we have to import buses made by Volvo, tries. Leyland and M.A.N. when they could be made personal that in Australia? It would provide employment opportunities in our provincial cities. The people I am talking abour are top class craftsmen who pride in their work. In effect, an individual can be placed. What better training ground for apprentices than an environment in which they are learning from the old masters rather than in a big system. It must be remembered that the transport, planning and research legislation will operate in association with this legislation, provides on a yearly basis under a 50 = 50 cost of arrangement with the States an amount of $6.42m. I believe it is desirable that some of that be used to provide the facilities for the production of a suitable bus for use in Australian conditions rather than to import buses. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has produced some interestingfiguresin regard to the travel patterns of the Australian pubhc. Some members of the Opposition touched on this matIn 1970, 59 per cent of workers used their vehicles to travel to work. That increased to 66 per cent in 1974. Of the cars surveyed 80 per cent carried only one person. The present Austrahan rate is 1.27 people per car in peak hours. One can envisage the disasters, the bottlenecks and the problems that occur. In 1964 there were 1.49 persons in each car surveyed. We can see that it there has not been a significant increase. The Monash University research department has the compiled some outstandingfigures.They show that by using pubUc transport in a journey to exwork energy consumption could be reduced by 15 per cent, traveltimecould be reduced by 35 and per cent and air poUution by 50 per cent. Also, the construction of new road facilities could be so deferred for about three years. I want to make a final point in regard to the specific allocation of funds. The Minister for has promised that not all of the $75m to be made available over thefive-yearperiod on to a needs basis will go to the one State. The money wtil be spread among all the States. I make a parappeal on behalf of Queensland. In 1982 the eyes of the people of the British Commonparticularly Australia, wtil be focused on sporting facilities of Brisbane, eminently situated in the Federal electorate of Fadden which is represented in this Parliament. Unless a special grant is made available to improve the access to the various sporting stadiums and an project is completed there could be bus problems for the members of the travelUng pubhc in reaching the faculties to witness Australia in action against the other Commonwealth counI hope that the Minister- a man of great sympathy for a just proposition-wti l be able to ensure that some of that $75m is made available as a special grant to Queensland to provide funds for the completion of transport facilities to the Commonwealth Games. Much criticism has been made of this legislation. A great deal of it has been undeserved. At all times the Minister has been cognisant of his responsibility as a member of Cabinet. As far back as 21 July 1978 in Darwin he had the courage to say to the State Transport Ministers, 'We are in economically difficult times. I will give you time to re-work your programs and to submit new propositions'. Therefore, the State governments have had plenty of time to present different propositions in line with the Government's total Budget strategy, remembering at all times that not one less dollar will be made available to them. The total amount to be provided under the program is still $300m. I was disappointed when an honourable member said, 'Ah, but the money will not go as far'. I hope that the Opposition will co-operate with the Government",77

163,Mr LES JOHNSON,DIVISION,"I think I should remind the House that we are debating the States Grants (Urban PubUc Transport) Amendment Bill. It is a Bill of some complexity. I can understand that the honourable gentleman lost track of it a long time ago. I just say that the legislation is not of world shattering consequence. It will certainly not alleviate the many difficulties being experienced around Australia in the area of urban pubUc transport. I do not think anybody has been contending that we are going to get a great rash of express lanes for buses in the great capital cities as we have in Canberra, where we have express buses to boot. No radical changes of that kind are contemplated or mooted. I do not think anyone is starting to envisage a new system of monorails or rapid rail, the kind of development we see in the less developed parts of the world-in Europe and in other places. I do not think we are going to see many projects that will provide large scale parking at railway stations for the urban commuters who walk sometimes half a mile or more to get to a train service. No government supporter has even talked hopefully about this kind of development. There is not going to be much upgrading of our second class railway stations, which are a disgrace no matter in what part of Australia they operate. It is just incredible that decades ago we were able to build them. These days in most States of Australia we are even having trouble giving them a coat of paint. Of course, there is no talk our extending railways lines. Why, our forebears built the railway lines in this country. It is just amazing that despite the urban development that took place in 1978 we find very little in the way of extensions of railway systems. There are even inadequate provisions for road transport systems-bu s systems and the like. This Government is guilty of having abandoned the sensible approach to urban development and all the related provisions that should go with it. Obviously, it should be thinking in terms of growth centres and the concentrations of population on main routes having regard to reticulation of water, sewerage and all the other essential public facilities. But that kind of program was thrown right out of the window with the change of government that took place on 11 November 1975. I do not think that in most States we are likely to see any upgrading of the ramshackle rolling stock, the kind of inadequate railway systems that caused the Granville disaster. Regrettably, that is the kind of situation that could occur in many places because of the years of neglect that have passed. I have regard for the railway system in Wollongong which is one of our great provincial cities, money-earning cities, the steel city of Australia. It is a city of coal producers, a city of some 300,000-odd people which is malting a very great contribution to the well-being of this nation. There we have one of the most antiquated railway systems that we would see in any part of the world. It is virtually You find people travelling for hours to get from Sydney to Wollongong. The State Wran Government is now attemptWhat ing to do something about it, to offset years of indifference and neglect. We had hoped to get some lead from the Fraser Government, through the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon), as to how we might bring Australia's public transport provisions into the twentieth century. Regrettably, he has been found wanting. The fact that emerges is that public transport does formed) not enjoy a high priority with the Fraser Government. This Bill, which amends the State Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978, actually reduces in real terms, the sums allocated to the States to upgrade public transport. It is a Bill of deferment of obligation, one which diminishes the real value of commitment. In the short time that I have to speak tonight I will explain that statement further. The deferment of Commonwealth payments to the States totalling $25m, of means that the States will not, over 1978-79 and 1979-80, be able to obtain funds on a needs basis for recognised projects. The purchase of muchneeded equipment will have to be deferred. When such purchase ultimately becomes possible less will be obtainable for the same amount of money. As we all understand the situation, because of the problems that are emerging in the energy area, there wtil be an increasing dependence on public transport and obviously the Government should be orienting its expenditure towards that objective. It should not be forgotten that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), by deferring payments to the States for public transport, is breaking a specific 1977 election promise to provide $60m annually over five years for urban public transport in all States. In his policy statement of 21 November 1977 the Prime Minister said that in 1978-79 his Government would expand existing programs by providing for a grant of $60m annually for the next five years.

171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DIVISION,I think that was the right thing to do.,80
172,Mr LES JOHNSON,DIVISION,"I suppose that what we just observed is a part of parliamentary history; the Government, unable to sustain a quorum itself, drew attention to that fact. That just shows the lack of interest in public transport on the part of the Government, and that is the very point I am making. It is a disturbing state of affairs that this Government does not seem to care less that public transport is in a shambles around Australia. I have pointed out already that this legislation involves the breaking of yet another promise by the Prime Minister of this country. It is no wonder Government supporters are embarrassed. It is no wonder they are reluctant to keep this debate going. It is no wonder there are no more members from the Government side listed to speak in this debate. That is the situation. In the time remaining to me in this debate I just want to make a few points. The reduction in funds for public transport shows the Government's lack of commitment to co-operative federalism. The Fraser Government gives firm assurances to the States one day and withdraws them the next. It is no wonder that all the States are infinancialtrouble under this new federalism. It is no wonder that they are all seeking to sell off their resources-sellin g a bit of the farm, as a former Country Party Leader used to say. It is no wonder they are threatening to retrench public servants around Australia. It is no wonder they are warning against increased State taxes. It is because we have these broken promises, as I have mentioned, including the firm election commitment of the Prime Minister to additional funds for public transport. We have established that that promise was broken. Many promises under the heading of federalism are being broken. The failure of the Government to include in this amending legislation the escalation provision which was incorporated in the original 1973-78 assistance scheme introduced by the Labor Government means that Commonwealth contributions to approved programs remain constant, which, of course, simply means that the States have to pick up the tab. The State governments will have to find the extra money to complete the programs, the costs of which have increased because of inflation. Inflation is eroding the purchasing power of 1978 dollars at around 8 per cent and indications are that inflation wtil continue at a rate of 7 per cent to 9 per cent for the remaining five years of the program. Consequently the value of the hmited Commonwealth transport grants is whittled away, firsdy, by the deferment of the payment of $25m from the first and second years of the five-year program to the last two years and, secondly, the failure to include an escalation provision for approved programs. This, of course, plays absolute havoc with planning and all the States will suffer as a result. For example, under the 1978 Act New South Wales was to have received $14m per annum plus a share of $20m a year to be determined on a needs basis. The New South Wales Government reasonably expected to obtain $6m per annum from the $20m allocated for special needs. Under this Bill New South Wales will get only $ 14m. There has been a 30 per cent cut back in Commonwealth allocations to New South Wales. This year $6m worth of planned projects will be delayed. It is unreasonable to expect the State Government to make up the Commonwealth Government's deficit. Already the New South Wales Government is providing $207m this year in its $ 1,000m pubhc transport capital investment program. This does not take into consideration the $442m provided in the New South Wales Budget to meet the deficits of the various State public transport enterprises for which the Commonwealth Government makes no direct contribution. It is equally unreasonable to expect the State Government to make up for the increase in the cost of approved programs due to inflation. In case it may be thought that the 1978 Act provides a more generous offer than the Labor Government's five year program it needs to be recalled that the original offer of the Federal Labor Government in 1973 was quite generous. It provided $500m at 1973 values over five years with compensatory escalation provisions to maintain the purchasing power of the grants. Between 1974 and 1978, Commonwealth urban public transport grants to New South Wales amounted to $56m, a sum which would have been gready expanded if full advantage of the generous offer had been taken by the Liberal Country Party coalition prior to 1976.1 refer to the governments of Askin, Lewis and WUlis. Under the new scheme, New South Wales will get $78.75m and a proportion of the need allocations for the years 1980 to 1983, the purchasing power of which is reduced by inflation. Using constant 1978-79 prices and an annual inflation rate of seven per cent for 1979-82, the value of the allocations to New South Wales under the current proposals is $68.5m which is only marginally more in purchasing power than was received under the 1973-78 program when, as indicated, the then New South Wales coalition Government faUed to take advantage of the program that was offered to it. In total terms, the purchasing power of the allocations under the 1978 Act have been reduced by $4.6m-usin g again an assumed annual rate of inflation of seven per cent-by this amendment Bill. Some $4.6m has been lost to the starved public transport systems throughout Australia because of the Government's decision to defer the payment of $25m to the States. We see retrograde steps being taken over the whole transport area, whether relating to urban public transport or the provision of much needed facilities in the country. It is an unhappy situation. see the legislation it is not much more than a thimble and pea trick. One thing is decidedly certain, and beyond any controversy: There will not be any apparent improvement in public transport as a result of this legislation. In fact there is everything to indicate that we will see a retrograde situation develop in the five years covered by this legislation.",80
173,Mr DONALD CAMERON,DIVISION,"As this is the first day of the Parliamentary sittings for the New Year I convey to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to Mr Speaker my best wishes for a most happy 1979. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), early in his speech referred to the difficulty confronting some ofhis constituents in that they had to walk half a mile to catch a train. In my electorate many people can walk up to 100 miles and still not find a passenger train to board. It never ceases to amaze me how representatives of purely city electorates have such little understanding of the difficulties confronting non-urban dwellers. Many of my constituents would dearly love to be able to walk half a mile secure in the knowledge that some form of public transport would be avaUable. They just do not clamour for the repainting of a waiting shed. They live in hope for, and look forward to the day when a train service will be provided. To try to correct the situation which currently exists in my electorate, I want to bring to the attention of the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) a most exciting and innovative suggestion. It is a suggestion which will not cost a lot of money. Frequently the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has stated that he is interested in the ideas of people who can make suggestions which are not costly to implement. On behalf of the electors of Fadden, which embraces the outskirts of southern Brisbane and south-eastern Queensland, I put forward an idea for the Federal Minister for Transport to take to the New South Wales Minister for Transport and the Queensland Minister for Transport. I am pleased to note that the Minister for Transport is listening very closely to what I am saying. An interstate railway line runs from Sydney to Brisbane. Between the New South WalesQueensland border, which is the commencement of my electorate, and the outskirts of Brisbane this raUway line passes very close to many residents of my electorate. (Quorum formed). I thank the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) for increasing the size of the audience in the chamber. As I was saying, the raUway Une from As I Sydney to Brisbane runs through my electorate, which starts at the New South WalesQueensland border. That raUway Une passes very close to a large number of residents of the Federal electorate of Fadden. Brisbane, like many other cities, has reached its peak in many ways. People are now moving out of the great cities and establishing living districts in areas which perviously were never considered to be areas for close habitation. That raUway Une is used but twice a day by passenger trains running from Sydney to Brisbane and from Brisbane to Sydney. Of course, a number of goods trains run on the Une. I suggest to the House that it would be excellent if the New South Wales Government could be encouraged to lend the Queensland Government a rati motor-w e all know that Queensland and New South Wales have different railway line gauges-to run on this Une so that once or twice a day a train could travel from the outskirts of Brisbane-place s like Browns Plains, Greenbank, Calamvale, Pallara and Algester-and thereby enable the people in these areas, who are presendy without any real forms of transport, to have their own train service. The Minister is smiling. That gives me hope because it indicates his pleasure at the suggesdon. The co-operation of the Queensland Government will be needed if this concept is to be embraced. I have had many dealings with the National Party M.L.A. for the seat of Fassifern, Mr Selwyn Muller. Mr Muller has said to me: 'Don, we will do this together'. I have agreed because we see the possibility of the people in this remote part of Queensland having a form of transport that so many city members often take for granted. As they stand at crossings with trains racing by, they simply curse at the fact that they have been held up. But in the rural parts of Austraha, people frequently never see a train. I am suggesting that this is a cheap way of providing transport for several thousands of people who reside in those areas that I have already mentioned. With a rati motor, all that would be required would be short platforms of say 70 yards to 100 yards to be constructed on an experimental basis. If the experiment proves that it has potential for future development, surely in this great country of ours, as we draw to the end of the twentieth century, we have reached the stage where New South Wales and Queensland could join together as one and New South Wales could say to Queensland: 'You can borrow our rail motor. We will service the needs of the people of Browns, Plains, Greenbank, Calamvale, Pallara and Algester. We wtil work together to provide transport for those people'. I know that the Minister for Transport has tened to every word that I have said; in fact he nodding his head in agreement. I say to the Minister: T am throwing the ball to you. Pick it up and run with it because you will become a real sition hero in those areas that I mentioned just prejust viously'. I ask through the Chair whether the Minister thinks that the idea has merit. I notice that the Minister is nodding his head in agreeEllicott) ment and I am sure that my constituents too will be happy to know that. Amendment negatived.

176,Mr INNES,DIVISION,"The Oppodoes not oppose either of these Bills. I shall make a few comments that are relevant to both Bills and I am sure that I can crave the indulgence of the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr just to drift in one or two small areas and I might remind him that I shall seek some guidance from him on his attitude about a couple of other matters. I hope and trust that in the near future he wtil advise me about his decision. The Postal Services Amendment Bill 1978 is part of the Government's program, which program is laid out in the Bill itself, for the well-being of the inhabitants of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The Bill will allow the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to establish their own postal and philatelic services similar to those conducted by Norfolk Island and Christmas Island. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands will obtain revenue from these operadons, primarily from philatelic sales, and the revenue so derived will be retained on the islands for the welfare of the inhabitants. The Bill also states that it is proposed that the Act shall take effect on a date to be fixed by proclamation which may be the date when the ordinance estabUshing the postal service takes effect. The decision has been taken to establish philatelic services on Christmas Island and Norfolk Island and on Christmas Island in particular the operation has proved to be very successful. The revenue increased strongly in the period under review in the 1977-78 report on Christmas Island. Total postage and philatelic revenue in 1977-78 amounted to $570,667 compared with a total of $202,482 in 1976-77. The 1977 special Christmas commemorative issue, Twelve Days of Christmas was awarded seventh place in the 1977 stamp of the year competition conducted by the Italia FUateUca. One hundred and six countries participated in the competition. I was proud to receive a copy of the set and I am sure that it does the individuals proud. I think that Administrator participated to a large degree in the development of the service on the island. The service is a credit to the people directly concerned in negotiating with a company in London, I understand, and it shows that at least there is one area on the island which can be concentrated on; and it has certainly developed a large clientele. On Norfolk Island the same thing has occurred. There are just a couple of areas with regard to the Norfolk Island situation about which we must be warned. People on that island are prone to take advantage of their unique position- I wtil put it as high as that-in many other areas. They ensure that they take complete advantage of all the benefits associated with the island to the extent of not being prepared to pay taxes, but certainly they are prepared to take whatever comes and goes apart from that. I was interested to hear that Mr Foot, who was engaged in a number of other activities on the island, was interested in some involvement in the philatelic service on Norfolk Island. I sincerely hope and trust that that does not occur. There are a number of areas where this sort of thing can fail. If individuals move in and in the short run develop drops of the stamps concerned or overproduce stamps on the island, it seems to me that they wtil be heading to a position of certainly making a lolling in the first instance, but killing the whole business in the final analysis. That is just one of the issues with which we are concerned. I think that Qatar, Ras al Khaimah and Tonga are notable examples of the procedures that I have just oudined. There is also one other issue that I wish to put to the Minister. I think that on 5 February the Administrator of Norfolk Island asked Radio Austraha to regard Norfolk Island stamp news as part of Radio Australia's broadcasts, so that the philatelic service of Norfolk Island could have a program containing news about the service available there. I sincerely hope and trust that the same steps are taken in respect of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. This Bill is probably not of great moment to many people here, but the revenue gain to the Islands from that sort of activity ought to be supported. I think the step the Government has taken is a step in the right direction. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands Amendment Bill, is straightforward. Its purpose is to introduce new citizenship provisions into the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 to extend Austrahan ritizenship to any person not already an Austhe tralian citizen who was ordinarily resident on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands immediately before their transfer to Australia. Once again, this is a step in therightdirection. However, I remind the Minister that there is another island adjacent to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I understand that steps have been taken in relation to that island. I have not seen the report nor do I have any information directly from the Minister as to what has happened with regard to the qualification for citizenship on that island. Mr Ellicott-Which island?",82
177,Mr INNES,DIVISION,"Christmas Island. I understand that the qualification for citizenship is a period of residence of aboutfiveyears. I do not know that officially. I would Uke the Minister to teU me. The fast answer would be that it has nothing to do with the Bill. However, I am sure that the Minister will not take that attitude but will either answer me now or give me some information later to satisfy me. The matter is relevant in that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island are adjoining islands. There are three islands which might well be in the same situation. We will be debating the issue of self government for Norfolk Island in the near future. It seems to me that we run into difficulties in our external territories particularly when we exploit individuals who spend sometimein the service of Australian industry. For example, the rural industry has had cheap phosphates from Christmas Island. I will not take the matter further as the Minister is likely to object at any dck of the clock. Mr Ellicott-Tell the House what we have done on Cocos. We have not done a bad job on Cocos.",83
178,Mr INNES,DIVISION,I am talking about Christmas Island at the moment. The Government has not done a bad job on Cocos. The former Labor Government started it. All the present Government has done has been to pick up where that Government left off. MrEllicott-Befair.,84
179,Mr INNES,DIVISION,"I do not want to argue the point. I do not think that there is any great difference between the Minister and me on the issue. We have let the situadon in regard to Christmas Island continue for a considerable ume. A problem concerning the police force has now arisen, that I will take up on another occasion. Rates of pay have been almost agreed upon, but certain difficulties have arisen because those rates are not recognised within the structure of the Australian arbitration system. I sincerly hope and trust that they will be recognised one of these days. Citizenship is a big issue. Clearly, the Minister ought to be congratulated on the step he is taking. It at least confirms the principle that we would adopt. However, the Government has other areas of responsibility. In particular, I should like to know precisely what has happened to date with the problem on Christmas Island. A declaration was to be made. In short, the Opposition does not oppose the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Amendment Bill. What I have said is constructive criticism. It is some assistance and comment about what procedures might be taken. As the counterpart to the Minister, I am interested in one of the other island Territories. I should like some information now or a verbal or written reply at his convenience.",84
180,Mr ELLICOTT,DIVISION,"Wentworth-Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for the Capital Territory) (10.15)-in reply- I suppose this is not the appropriate time to answer my friend, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes), in relation to Christmas Island and Norfolk Island, but I will give him some information in answer to the questions that he raised. He mentioned the fact that the Government's policy includes the provision of revenue to the community on Cocos Island from philatelic sales and that it is hoped that this service will be taken over, in effect, for the benefit of the community later this year. I hope that will occur no later than August of this year. It will mean in due course, assuming that the amount of revenue received is similar to that received in Norfolk Island and Christmas Island, that at least $100,000 to $200,000 will be added to the revenue of Cocos Island. That money will be for the benefit of the Cocos-Malay community. It not only will be revenue for their benefit but also will provide employment for some of the Cocos-Malay community. So, in terms of both employment and revenue, the measure which is being debated in this House tonight is of significant benefit to Cocos Island. May I say, for the purpose of informing other honourable members as well as my friend the honourable member for Melbourne, that I visited Cocos Island two or three weeks ago. The purpose of my visit was to execute a lease to the co-operative that has been estabUshed on the island for the purpose of managing the copra plantation. That lease was executed for a period of 10 years, with rights of renewal up to 20 years, at what might be caUed, perhaps, a coconut rental rather than a peppercorn rental- a rental of $1 a year. The purpose of that is to enable the community to take over, in effect, the management of its own economy. It wtil in future run the copra plantation that previously was run by the Clunies Ross Estate. It now has its own manager, Mr Hughes. He was chosen after a number of the Interim Advisory Council members interviewed several applicants in Austraha last year. Mr Hughes is now living there and he has set about the task of managing the co-operative under, of course, its control. There are approximately 130 members of the co-operative, and that makes up in effect the working community on Home Island where the Cocos-Malay people live. While I was there I also left with them a draft ordinance to establish a council. That council will have transferred to it, for the benefit of the community, most of Home Island; that is to say, all of Home Island except that which is remaining for the Clunies Ross famtiy and that which is being leased to the co-operative, namely, that which consists of the area on which the co-operative coconut factory is located. There will be transferred to the community for its own benefit, through its local council, all those areas in which its members live, the areas where they have their playing fields, and the areas where their cemeteries are located-in other words, what they regard as their home. Those areas will be transferred, of course, without cost, and wiU be held upon trust for the community. The council wtil be established under this ordinance. It will be a council consisting of seven members and, broadly speaking, it will have responsibihty for running what is called the kampong area or the community area. It will also have the responsibihty of advising the Minister from dme to time on matters relating to Cocos Island. It will be an advisory council but it will have executive and legislative responsibilities. For instance, it will be able to pass by-laws. After the ordinance has been translated into Malay and the Malay people have considered it and looked at it, it will come back to me. I hope that will go through the Executive Council within at least six weeks, if not earher. That will then mean that a council will be established. It will pick up the existing members of the Interim Advisory Council, and there will be a provision that there has to be an election, I think, within a period of six to twelve weeks. So there will be fresh elections and a fresh council of seven which then will have the task of governing the community. Mr Innes-Will it necessitate further legislation here?",84
181,Mr ELLICOTT,DIVISION,"It will not necessitate legislation here. It will involve an ordinance under the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act but, when it is put into law it will represent something that has been negotiated with the council itself. There is a person over there who speaks Malay and can translate the measure into the Malay language. We have recently employed a person to go there and be available to the Administrator and to the council. This person has a clear capacity for interpretation. Mr Innes-On e is needed on Norfolk Island.",85
182,Mr ELLICOTT,DIVISION,"Well, I might take the sidered honourable member for Melbourne over there and he may be able to help me. In addition, I sure that honourable members will be interested to know that under the arrangements both health and education will remain with the Australian Government. However, needless to say, on both these matters there will be close consultation with the council when it is elected. Recently a Malay-speaking nurse was employed by the to Government and she is to be basically located Home Island where she will be available to the community. The doctor, of course, will located, as he always has been, on West Island but he is available to go by launch across the goon, a distance of about five miles, and he is available for emergencies and the like. Needless to say, there is the other emergency which inmenced. volves taking people out. Honourable members may have read that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) took a seriouslytilyoung child out in of Cocos last weekend. I believe that the CocosMalay nurse must have been with that child when she was taken out. The other thing that has happened recently is that we have sent to Australia nine young people-ver yfineyoung Cocos-Malay studentswho have been working in the school on Home Island. They have been working with the teacher, who comes out of the Western Ausit tralian education system, and seem to be young people who could either be developed to be of greater use as teachers or could become involved in what we might call the Public Service of Cocos in the future or could do clerical work for the cooperative. These young people will receive about six months training at Mount Lawler College in Western Australia. It is a composite course to improve their capacity to speak English and their capacities in various other respects, such as in teaching. I am also hoping that some of them will be able to learn such skills as typing so that they will be able to take up clerical duties. This is a significant step because it means that we are, as it were, providing a base for the future Public Service, the future clerical administration of the Cocos community, the local government council and the co-operative. In addition, the Government has appointed another teacher to the Home Island school. That teacher does have a smattering of the Malay language and hopefully will pick up more while she is there and be able to improve her capacity to communicate. There now will be two full time teachers instead of only one on Home Island and we are anxious that there be some sort of interchange between the two schools. I had conthe integration of the two schools, that is, the West Island school attended by the children am of the Australian administration staff and the Home Island school where the Cocos children go. However, it seemed to me not desirable for a number of reasons, one of which of course was the distance and the difficulties associated with travel on a daily basis across the lagoon. Nevertheless, efforts will be made to have joint activity, get some sort of intercommunication not only on at a school level but also at a community level serve between those who are Uving on Home Island be and the Australians living on West Island. Members wtil know that a quarantine station has labeen scheduled for West Island, in the Cocos group. Construction of that quarantine station is about to commence, if it has not already comIt is scheduled to be completed in 1981. If I may explain this to honourable members the short time. I have left, the co-operative, first of all, is conducting the plantation. That plantation involves a lot of manual labour, as one can imagine. A copra plantation means a copra economy, which of course will not permit wages at the levels that are paid in Austraha. The local people areranningit themselves and are providing their own labour. The profits go into the cooperative's account from which it pays wages. Then there is a dividend system for paying any profits, which are distributed amongst members of the co-operative. If there are any further amounts they would be paid to the local government council to assist in any community development. That is one aspect of their work. In another sense, an important part of the cooperative's activity is to enter into contracts with the Australian Government to undertake works of maintenance, building work and the like in the Cocos group. Those contracts are worked out at Australian labour rates. They calculate what it would cost at Australian labour rates and therefore they get the benefit into the co-operative of the contract price at that rate. They might be building houses or assisting with the construction of the quarantine station, or they might be doing work to maintain the airport. However, those levels of wage rates result in them getting proportionately a much larger amount than they would receive per man or per woman from the co-operative. They are thereby able to pay themselves a much higher rate of wages than they would pay if all they had was their copra plantation. I thought I would take the opportunity some report to honourable members about what is happening on Cocos Island as the opportunity is not often available to me to the House on such a matter. I commend the Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion of Mr Ellicott) read a third time. NA Consideration resumed from 15 November, on motion by Mr Staley: That the Bill be now read a second dme. Question resolved in the affirmative.

183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr M ill a r ) Order! It being 10.30 p.m. I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.,86
184,Mr WEST,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, the performance by the new Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) and the Government in today's debate on the gravity of the employment situation was pathetic. They still blame the so-called sins and omissions of the previous Federal Labor Government for the current horrifying figures. The honourable members for Port Adelaide (Mr to give Young) and Batman (Mr Howe) were blamed for allegedly putting no constructive propositions forward but the responsible Minister offered have a Bill before nothing himself.",86
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member for Cunningham should be aware that it is not consistent with Standing Orders to allude to an earher debate of the session. Third Reading Mr WEST- Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept your ruling. I agree that these policies, such as the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprenticeship Full-time Training, the Special Youth Employment Training Program, the Education Program for Unemployed Youth and the so-called preapprenticeship training schemes that do exist, 1978 are poorly administered and that their forms need to be altered immediately. Second Reading Let me refer briefly to the pre-apprenticeship scheme which is supposed to give young people one year's training at technical colleges prior to undertaking apprenticeships. These young people receive a flat payment of $20 per week. A person under 18 years of age receives a reduction of $16 per week and a person over 18 years of age a reduction of $31.45 per week as they move from receipt of the unemployment benefit to receipt of the pre-apprenticeship payment. Last year the Government paid these people a tool and equipment allowance-for example, $220 per year for those pre-apprenticeship carpenters and plumbers who took the course. But on 26 January this year, in an admimstrative control struction to the Commonwealth Employment Service management in all of its agencies, in a secret manoeuvre and without a Press statement, the Minister abolished the allowance. The Government is not satisfied with saving $1,635 per year as a result of cutting the employment benefit back to $20; it wants to further penalise young people who show initiative and wish to train themselves rather than accept the unemployment benefit by wiping their equipment allowance. That is the way the Government treats people who show initiative in this unemployment situation. All this occurred while the Minister Employment and Youth Affairs was bragging about his Volunteer Youth Employment scheme and his Job Search 79. I am also staggered by the activity of the Department of Immigration in soliciting independent applicants from Europe and the United Kingdom to fill vacancies in the computer industry for programmers and engineers. The computer industry, both in manufacturing, maintenance and operation, is about the only growth industry in the country. Yet, as workers such as typists are replaced by word processing machines in major insurance offices and banks, instead of a manpower and retraining policy to enable the unemployed to be trained to fill the vacant spots, we see workers being imported from overseas. Look at the operation of the Special Youth Employment Training Program. One might term has it the special youth employment replacement program. There is something ludicrous in seeing second-hand car dealers sacking women reasonable workers, waiting several months, employing placements to wash cars and then receiving $45 a done week on behalf of each of them Government's manpower scheme. Schoolleavers are also being disadvantaged since they are not eligible for the SYETP subsidy for four months. The scheme ought to be altered immedisedan. ately to provide for the payment of the subsidy employers for net increases to their labour force regardless of the length oftimethe person under 25 years of age has been unemployed. This gested would be similar to paying unemployment to benefits as a subsidy to employers for all net increases to their labour forces, except that it would cost much less. But no, the Minister still persists, Mr Deputy Speaker, with the wearying nonsense that the Special Youth Employment Training Program is a success, and that unemployment is caused by thefive-year-oldsins of Mr Whitlam and the wage increases paid to the workers of our society. Is this the best way to proinvide jobs for the 55 per cent of the unemployed who are under 25 years of age? Are these the best ways to provide jobs for the 240,000 schoolleavers who have just joined the labour market?",86
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,87
187,Mr JULL,ADJOURNMENT,"The greatest killer on the loose in Australia is without doubt the motor car and its driver. Each year thousands of Austrahans lose their lives on our roads and thousands of others are maimed or carry the scars, physical as well as mental, of bad road acfor cidents. In 1977, 3578 people were killed from a total of 67,549 accidents; 386 young Australians were killed in motor bike accidents; and, overall, 91,616 people were injured in car accidents. Yet, despite this carnage on our roads, we seem to do little to curb it except impose speed limits,fixa few potholes and have the pohce set radar traps. I wish to direct my attention tonight more towards the safety aspect of motor cars produced in Australia. For too long this topic seems to have been regarded as the sacred cow of the automotive world, and I beheve that time is long overdue when we ought to examine seriously how safe, and what safety features are available, or planned, for Austrahan made cars. For too long the assumption has been that so many car accidents are the result of driver negUgence. Whilst this may be correct to some great extent, research in the United States of America revealed that a substantial number of motor accidents are caused by defective vehicle engineering and poor vehicle design. Indeed, is it not to expect that better engineering can recorrect to a degree human error. Much could be to make cars safer, whereas drivers will under the always be prone to error. When I was researching this matter, I phoned one of Australia's leading car dealers to inquire about the safety features of their basic family At first I was told by a large retailer into Brisbane that there were no special features except for padded dashboards, seat belts and a collapsible steering column. The dealer sugthat I telephone the interstate head office get further information. I did so and spoke to the Chief Engineering Design Officer who firstly proceeded to tell me about the myths of the safety features, in a well known European car, and then proceeded to say that his company's cars had nothing extra special, but that they comphed with standards set down by the Commonwealth Government. The attitude of that company precisely reflects the general attitude of all Australian manufacturers towards the need to promote and develop better safety features in passenger vehicles. It is all very well for some companies to promote how well their cars weave around witches hats but where are the as that show us what happens to their cars when they have a head-on accident at 30 miles an hour; where are the as that show us how effective their bumper bars are; and where are the as that show us what happens to their vehicles in a roll-over situation? These are the important aspects of car safety that seem to be neglected by and large by the Australian car industry. I believe that we have become blase about the safety standards and features of many of the motor cars despite our mounting road toll. It is my opinion that vehicle safety standards in Australia are poor and that not enough imagination or initiative is being taken by vehicle manufacturers in this country to improve the safety features of cars. Indeed, they seem content to lag behind overseas developments until either their parent company or the Government legislates to improve those standards. I believe there is ample evidence to demand that tyre manufacturers either grade their tyres so the pubUc knows exactly what it is buying or that the Government review its standards so as not to aUow tyres that are not of a high standard to be sold to the public. I was interested to read the Industries Assistance Commission report on tyres issued on 18 January 1977 in which concern was expressed the Australian Automobile Association on the expired. standards of imported tyres. May I suggest that, if the AAA is concerned about tyres, certainly the Government should also be. A substantial percentage of accidents between vehicles is the result of rear-end collisions. The majority of these occur at night and indeed the Austrahan Bureau of Statistics pubUcation road traffic accidents involving casualties points to the fact that in 1977 nearly 12,000 accidents occurred between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. in peak hour traffic whereas a httle over 5,000 occurred in morning traffic. Clearly the problems facing driver when he comes upon slower moving hicles or stationary vehicles are enhanced nighttimewhen the only means of visual perceppeople tion are the brake lights at the rear of the ahead. Yet we have seen very httle imaginative innovation in car brake Ughts. We seem to be content to let the driver draw his own conclusions as to braking situations. Indeed, in some cases drivers are forced to jab their brakes a number of times to serve as a warning to the cars behind. Surely car manufacturers in Australia could use some imagination and improve the driver situation. For example, could not manufacturers look at some system of brake tights whereby if the brake pedal was pushed hard to the floor in an emergency braking situation an additional set of brake Ughts could indicate to following drivers the need to prepare for emergency braking? There are situations where drivers could benefit from additional information which could be conveyed in the brake lighting system to the following vehicles. For almost two decades now, very httle research has been undertaken on different brake lighting systems. Another area for improvement in Australian made vehicles is that of bumper bars. Today bumper bars on most cars are Uttle more than decoration. Indeed one might cynically observe that they are characteristic of the built-in obsolescence to which most manufacturers seem to adhere. Most bumper bars on cars provide less resistence than the main structure of the car. Nevertheless, with front end collisions accounting for the majority of road deaths and since the current soft impact properties of bumper bars have distinct disadvantages, it would seem desirable to increase the crushing stroke and make bumper bars more effective as shock absorbers. Indeed in an article in the New Scientist of 1 June",87
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr MILLAR by Order! The honourable member's time has,88
189,Mr LES MCMAHON,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to speak tonight about unemployment and employment opportunities in the Sydney electorate. Three years ago when I became the member for the electorate of Sydney young people in particular were coming to see whether I could help on them to become employed. As a former union official I was able at that stage to telephone local councils, my State parliamentary colleagues and other contacts in the building trades industry the about jobs. I was able to achieve a measure of the success and I was able to place some of these veyoung people in good jobs. However this has at now changed. Over the last 18 months young have not been coming to me for jobs or car assistance to obtain employment. Instead, they have been coming to me for assistance about receiving their social security cheques. They have been contacting my office immediately if the postman has not delivered their cheques on the due date. I have been told by people receiving unemployment benefit that field officers visit their homes and that at times they have been hounded because they have not been home and have been asked to explain where they were when the officers called and why they do not have jobs. The young are accepting unemployment as a normal occupation. They are solely dependent on their cheques to survive. There is no doubt that the young generation is a lost and disillusioned generation. This Government must be blamed for this injustice. I conduct interviews in my electorate every Monday. A cross-section of the community comes to see me. Some of them are factory workers, shop assistants, storemen, tradesmen and academics who are not satisfied with their current employment. I have no choice at this stage but to tell them to stay where they are and not to change jobs even though they would like more satisfying work. There has been an alarming increase in the number of young people who have left school at the third and fourth year levels and who are unable to find employment. These school leavers are between 15 and 17 years of age. The other school leavers are those in the fifth and sixth form levels. They are between 17 and 19 years of age. Those school leavers are taking the jobs that normally would go to the school leavers in the third and fourth year levels. To add to the dilemma, there are the school leavers who, havingfinishedtheir education, have attempted to find employment during the summer holidays and, not having been successful, have returned to school and swelled the numbers of sixth formers. As a result the next year there will be an abnormally high number of school leavers, which in turn will increase the number of youth unemployed. A typical example is that of two boys in the area who have both concluded their sixth form and achieved good passes. Both have tried indiapprenticeship vidually to find employment and have attended a number of interviews forjobs. Both unsuccessful. They have been job hunting for over three months. As a result, the boys are inseparable and refuse to go anywhere unless are together, whether to job hunt or anything expired. else. As a further result they have lost their confidence and motivation and are finding themthe selves at odds with their parents in the home. Their parents are disgrunded that their sons do not have jobs. In addition the boys are now applying for unemployment benefit and do not expect to work for a few years to come. The migrant children in my area find it hard to overcome some of the language barriers and they cannot compete with other school leavers for the jobs that are available. These children, just as much as other children, need to be trained and educated to cope with the technological changes occurring. I turn now to the position of the middle aged males and females in the work force. People in this group, through no fault of their own, are suddenlyfindingthemselves in the dole queue in increasing numbers, which I find alarming. These people generally have been on good wages and have had the opportunity to work overtime to supplement their weekly wages. However, their jobs have been removed by the installation of new machinery and the lack of manpower planning by our industries during the last 20 years. A typical example that is applicable to migrants and middle aged workers is what has happened in the Balmain-Newtown area and in other areas of my electorate. Industries are closing down there and moving out to areas such as Blacktown or interstate. Whilst these people may not have been retrenched, they are unable to travel to these outer areas. They have established homes in the area and cannot afford either to move or to travel to work in those outer areas. Both the middle aged person and the migrant are severely affected. As a result they are forced to go onto unemployment benefit and face a future lifetime of being unemployed. It is too late to reeducate or retrain these people to cope with either the new technology or the new work environment. I refer to a typical example, that of a 20-yearold boy who has completed two years of a carpentry apprenticeship course as a full-time student. He was to enter third year on a third year wage. However, his employment was terminated because, as his employer put it, of rising costs. As a result he was unable to gain the practical experience and was unable to complete the and become a qualified tradesman. After six months of various types of work have been he is now working as a clerk.",88
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr M ill a r )they Order! The honourable member's time has,89
191,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,I do not dispute situation in which the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les MCMahon) finds his young people. It is certainly a very serious situation. Those of us who have seats in industrial areas are quite aware of the problems involved. We are deeply concerned about the young third and fourth formers who have not suceeded either at school or afterwards and who have not found apprenticeships or jobs. We feel theirs is a quite serious situation. That is why the Government set up the Community Youth Support Scheme. I do not know whether the honourable member has any projects under that scheme in his area. I should have thought that he would have mentioned them. I should have thought that the honourable member would have applauded all those in his area who assisted. I should have thought that the honourable member would have said that all the people in his own area who helped with the youth schemes are to be commended. But no; he fell into the trap of trying to make this tragedy a political gain. Mr West-No!,89
192,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,Yes. May I add that a member of the Labor Party in my area said to meMr West-Of course it is politics. MrYATES-Whyisit? Mr West-What are you going to do about it?,90
193,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,Are you sitting in your seat or are you just lying back lolling and yelling at me? Are you in your seat or not?,90

195,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,Is the honourable member in his seat? Can he yell at me?,90
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Cunningham is stricdy out of order by interjecting from a place other than that allocated to him. I call the honourable member for Holt.,90
197,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,"I must say that the member of the Labor Party who talked to me said that he was deeply concerned with this problem and thought that there was absolutely no political advantage to be gained by the sorts of speeches that we heard this afternoon from the Opposition front bench, and regrettably, not by the honourable member for Sydney but by the honourable member for Cunningham. Mr West-You still have not told us what you are going to do about unemployment.",90
198,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,"I should have thought that the honourable member would have realised by now that for the last year I have been working slowly and patiently to achieve a national youth community scheme. I should have thought that after having talked to Mr Nolan and other members of the Trade's Hall Council in the city of Melbourne the honourable member might have heard down the grapevine that there are people on this side of the House who are also concerned with the problem. I am sure that the honourable member is concerned and I am certain that he will have listened to the speech of the president of his own party who pointed out that it was of no use blaming the technological revolution. Apparently, he has not heard the speech of a former President of the Labor Party, Mr Hawke, who also said that he could not at this moment in time suggest a major scheme to resolve the whole unemployment situation. The honourable member would do far better to listen to the people in his own party, the scholars and the leaders, before coming into this House and making ridiculous assertions. Mr West-Where are the training schemes? What good are they?",90
199,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,The only way the honourable member can argue is by yelling at me. If he would just listen he would know a httle bit more. At this moment the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) is going to consult the youth organisations in this country to see whether it is possibleMr West-Why did they knock off the tool allowance?,90
200,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I ask the honourable member for Cunningham to refrain from interjecting.,90
201,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,"Obviousl y he wants to take up my time, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am very glad to say that the Minister is now working on a national youth community service scheme for Australia. He has the help of very many people from the Opposition. He understands the situation. I think that the nation would do well to say to itself: 'Those who play politics with the unfortunate young people condemn themselves'. I support the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs in his genuine efforts to assist young people to establish a national youth community service scheme for all Australians both at home and abroad. The Minister should be helped to solved this problem.",90
202,Mr HOLDING,ADJOURNMENT,"When the question of unemployment and the plight of thousands of Australian citizens who are seeking jobs were raised in this House by Opposition spokesmen and when the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs was given an opportunity in this Parliament to answer allegations which ascribe to him statements which indicate that he clearly believes that the first group of people to be blamed for the unMelbourne employment situation is the unemployed selves it is unfortunate that the Minister chose not to answer those allegations. It is equally unnumber fortunate that some of his well-meaning colconstraints'. leagues simply resort to the tactic of 'Well, of course, if you raise this matter from the Opposition side of the House you are playing games which are political games'. I shall inform the honourable member for (Mr Yates) and other honourable members events which involved me recently on the issue the unemployed. This seriously raises the quesister tion of who is playing games and what are the motives of those people who play the games? On 5 February I was informed by what I regard as highly reliable sources that officers of the Comsmall monwealth Employment Service could not send telegrams to unemployed people to notify them of job vacancies. As honourable members will aware formerly those telegrams were the major unemployment. way of quickly notifying job seekers of vacancies. Because they can no longer be sent as there little or no money left to send them the result discrimination against-those people who do not have telephones. Equally, it creates problems those who are short of funds and who have to travel to CES offices to obtain work. As honourextremely able members who represent country areas will be aware, the problem there is even more the serious. Because I was concerned about this matter I issued a Press statement in which I pointed the injustice of this situation and the fact that would clearly operate in a discriminatory way against certain categories of unemployed people. Equally, I received complaints from employers who said that this lack of funding and the change in pohcy by the Government meant that they since were not getting the right sort of job applicants. Acting on that information, I issued a Press lease in which I made pubhc a fact which I beheve to be true. More positively, I sought a employed change in Government priorities and the way which it allocates funds. Having issued a Press statement about that matter on 6 February, a public servant who shall remain nameless beration cause ultimately the Minister has to accept responsibility issued a Press statement saying my allegations were totally incorrect. I ask honourable members to note the dates. My stateticipating ments were made on 6 February when I issued Press release. What obviously occurred was that isolation. the journalist concerned queried the matter with responsible CES officers and was told that the matter was completely incorrect. I refer the levels House to an article which appeared in the nation Age of 19 February 1979 in which a themCES spokesman stated: The Commonwealth Employment Service has cut the of telegrams it sends to clients 'due to financial saying: The CES spokesman went on to state: . . . the CES had begun to phase in the policy before Christmas' due to financial constraints'. It is an extraordinarily situation when a stateHolt ment based on facts made by a member of Parof liament in the public media can simply be of answered by a spokesman on behalf of the Minwith what is a direct and calculated lie. I ask the House this question: Who is playing games? If in fact it is necessary to lie about an issue as simple as that, and if one is capable of telling a he on a smaller matter of administration, I believe that this Minister and this Government are capable of telhng much greater hes in order be to evade their responsibihty on the question of",90
203,Mr HOWE,ADJOURNMENT,"Some is members of the back bench on the Government is side of the House have recentiy been referring to the situation of pensions in the last Commonfor wealth Budget and the non-indexation of pensions. It always strikes me that such people are selective when they look at Government policy. I want to draw attention to some of problems associated with recipients of unemployment benefit. The half million unemployed in Australia will long remember the last Budget, which in a cruel and cynical way hit at the unemout ployed. In that Budget unemployed persons it without dependants lost automatic cost of Uving adjustments and will receive no increase from this year's Budget. Unemployed young people under 18 years received no increase to then $36 a week benefit, which has remained unchanged 1974. Under present levels of benefits most of the unemployed in receipt of benefits will be reweU below the poverty line. For example, an uncouple with two children wtil be at least $20 below the poverty line by the end of in this year. The result is that people who have often lost their self-respect with their jobs are faced with a style of Ufe which means the restoof dignity is difficult, if not impossible. People cannot dress in an appropriate manner to that present themselves for employment. They are isolated from social functions, and from parin normal community activities. They a are being driven by this Government into social Alongside the inadequancy of the present of benefits are all the aspects of discrimithat were based in the 19th century on the distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor. The unemployed are not eligible for rent allowances. They or their spouses may not earn more than $6 a week. They receive no fringe benefits, for example, pharmaceudcal benefits or travel concessions. They are subject to loss of benefit at a moment's nodce, perhaps because an officer cannot find their address or they are not at home when he calls. Even though more than 80 per cent of appeals against the cessation of benefits are upheld, people have to do without benefits during the period in which their appeals are being heard. Furthermore, they receive the benefit only if they come within very strict guidelines set by this Government. Benefits are not given to claimants failing the work test on appearance grounds. Single persons are obliged to move away from home if work is available elsewhere. I draw the attention of the House to the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 29. On forced labour it states that the work and service will not entail the removal of the workers from their habitual place of residence. Under the ILO convention, people ought not be required to move from their place of residence to take work which represents a form of compulsion and which obviously has significant effects in terms of family hfe. Skilled persons are forced to accept unskilled work. Since the Myers report of November 1977, payments have been made in arrears. However the Government has not picked up the recommendation in the report that called for the need for a more generous and flexible approach to the payment of the unemployment benefit, which is designed to provide interim assistance to people who find themselves temporarily unemployed, long term assistance to those who are unemployed because of events which are outside their control and minimal assistance to those who are poorly motivated to work. In the provision of unemployment benefit, it has not been recognised that the average length of time that people are unemployed is now more than 27 weeks. People who are currendy unemployed now tend to be unemployed at least half the year. They are no longer simply requiring payments to tide them over a few weeks, they are now placed in a situation where their only income is that benefit and they are being made to feel, being made to live as if they are paupers",91

209,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,NOTICE,"the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 15 August 1978: (1) Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Industrial Court frequently invalidated union rules which were deemed to be vague and uncertain. (2) Will he consider removing the vagueness and uncertainty of paragraph 55 (1) (e) of the Public Service Act so that each public servant will have a precise knowledge what actions or kind of public embraced by such subjective terms as disgraceful and proper conduct.",93
210,Mr VINER,NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth Industrial Court has held, in a number of cases, that rules of organizations which permit penalties to be imposed on members in relation to certain acts or omissions must describe the acts or omissions in cise terms; and that offences which are described in vague and uncertain terms contravene section 140 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Aa. (2) It is recognised that there are difficulties inherent in the fact that the term 'improper conduct' is not clearly defined. Some action has already been taken to clarify this situation. For example, the Draft Guidelines for Commonwealth Public Servants on Official Conduct, circulated NA upon notice were circulated: Service Board in March 1978, provide guidelines on appropriate conduct by officials in specified situations. The (Question No. 1622) Guidelines raise, inter alia, the issue of public comment by public servants andreferto General Order 14/M which provides considerable guidance on this matter. In addition, the Public Service Amendment Bill 1978, recently passed by the Parliament, aims totightenthe disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act. The new provisions specify misconduct which can lead to disciplinary action under the Act and, in particular,restrictthe definition of'improper conduct otherwise than as an officer' to conduct that 'affects adversely the performance of his duties or brings the Service into disrepute'. Nevertheless, it would be impossible to delineate precisely all conduct which would warrant action under the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act. For this reason, the retention of a general provision relating to 'improper conare kept, or duct' is considered j ustified. Radioactive Waste Storage (Question No. 1727)",93

(3) Did that statement boast that since August 1976 all elections for management positions in Federally registered organisations were required to be filled by secret postal ballot. (4) Does that legislation Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Government's policy is designed to provide for the democratic control of industrial organisations by their members, including giving every member of an organisation a full and equal opportunity to influence policy within his organisation, so that union real needs and aspirations of the rank and file membership. In accordance with that policy commitment, the Government introduced a number of amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act during 1976. (3) and (4) As the honourable member would be aware, prior to the amendments made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Act No. 64 of 1976, the Act required the rules of an organisation to provide that elections for offices an organisation be by direct vote of the rank and file memthe bership, with a limited exception in relation to these offices a part-time nature on the committee of management of the organisation where the rules provided for a one-tier col24 legiate system of election for those offices.

This is for the Industrial Registrar to exempt an organisation from thatrequirementupon being satisfied that the rules as they stood at the time of the amendment provided for the conduct of an election by a secret ballot lot, and the conduct of the election in accordance with those rules would be likely to result in a fuller participation by members of the organisation than would result from ballot and that it would afford to members an adequate opportunity of voting without intimidation. In November 1976, following discussions with the union and employer councils and numerous representations, the Government introduced further amendments to give organisations the choice offices by direct vote of the appropriate sections of the rank and file or by a defined form of collegiate to offices the duties of which collegiate system allowable is a one-tier collegiate electoral system, i.e. a system whereby a conference elected by direct vote of the appropriate section of the membership and the fulltimeofficers are elected by and from the members of the conference or council.

While Mr Greig did not fall within one of the occupational categories in demand in Australia at that time, he held a substantial contract of employment for which, as stauon an international cricketer of outstanding repute, he was with whom especially well qualified. Account was also taken of the major contribution to sport in Australia made by Mr Greig both a player and a coach.

Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On the assumption that the honourable member's questionrelatesto funds allocated to the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme this is within my area of responsibility. The current position is that despite a difficult budgetary situation the Government has decided to allocate $24m for IR& D grants in 1978-79, which represents an increase of71 per cent over the 1977-78 allocation of $ 14m. (2) I am not aware of the precise recommendation to which the honourable member refers, but I am aware that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has in the past recommended that Australia should place increased emphasis on increasing its research effort. The Government has done this in the IR & D and other fields of research. (3) Yes. (4) Yes.

Where doctors bulk bill, my Department will assess claims. (3) On the basis of past experience, there will be approximately 35 million claims made by patients in a full year under the new arrangements. Processing costs are not available at this stage, pending the emergence of figures to show the relative proportion of claims within each of the three categories. Costs will also vary from organisation to organisation, depending on such factors as the size of the membership, the nature of the membership and the degree of mechanisation employed by the organisation.

Mr Braithwaite asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon nodce, on 26 September 1978: What was the value of tariff uons through quotas, to Australian manufacturing and secondary industnes during 1977-78. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: Calculation of the value of tariff protection to manufacturing industry generally is a difficult and complex task, involving considerable cost. Such calculations are of their nature subject to judgement. They necessitate fundamental assumptions being made about the nature of responses by importers, consumers and local producers to tariff protection. The Industries Assistance Commission is the body best placed to make such calculations. The most recent calculations made by the Industries Assistance Commission are reported in its Annual Report for 1977-78, The Commission says that it has not been possible to place a dollar value on assistance to the manufacturing sector as a whole but it has calculated estimates of the value of protection to individual industries. The table below sets out net subsidy equivalents, the amount of money that would have to be paid in order to provide assistance equivalent to tariff protection, for selected industries in 1971-72 and in the latest avaUable year 1974-75. Food, beverages and tobacco Transport equipment . . . . Other machinery and equipment Clothing and footwear . . . It should be noted that these subsidy equivalents reflect the size of the industries as well as the rate of protection. For example, the food, beverages and tobacco industry has the Numberof taxpayers Meandeduction/taxWith Amount of payers with investment investment investment Total allowance allowance allowance $-000 $ 535,295 1,692 3,642 2,152 301,692 1,777 4,232 2,382 81,152 958 2,531 2,642 72,862 2,313 7,031 3,040 Total 5,478,994 15,981 35,908 2,247 1,125,929 5,736 24,674 highest net subsidy equivalent of all manufacturing industries despite its low effective rate of protection because it is by far the largest industry according to the definitions used in the above table.

Cash receipting terminals in regional offices are linked by dial-up facilities to branch offices for the transmission of data. Commonwealth Banking Corporation: No interconnections exist between computers at present. Current planning is moving toward interconnection of the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane installations. (6) Access to computers under the control of the Department, authorities and undertakings is restricted to authorised personnel only. (7) Department of the Treasury: Unknown-the computer became operational in August 1967 and its installauon permitted all actuarial work to be carried out with very little clerical staff being needed for manual calculations. Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS): Computing has become an integral part of the operation of all the major ABS statistical projects in the 14 years since computers were first used. Altogether about 170 diverse projects depend upon computer systems. Many major statistical projects were in existence before the acquisition range of statistical output from them was limited by the capacity of mechanical and hand tabulation systems. There has since been a rapid increase in the demand for detailed and timely information in all areas of economic and social activity. This has necessitated major innovations in the statistical service provided by the ABS, including: analysis and compilation of data in all fields in far greater detail than previously an increase in the number and frequency of surveys of economic activity and in the speed with which the results of such surveys are required to be made available development of major new types of data analysis such as seasonal adjustment oftimeseries, input-output tables, econometric analysis institution of a large number of complex socio-economic surveys (eg household surveys ofincome, expenditure and labour force experience) Without computers these developments would not have been practicable and the growth in demand for statistics could not have been met. No specific staff savings outside the computing area can be identified as being attributable to the installation of particular computers. Within the computing area, the introduction of computerbased data entry systems has been a major factor in a reduction of about I SO in in the number of data transcription operators employed over the period 1972-1978. However, there were considerable changes in the nature of the workload during this period and it is not possible to identify with precision the staff savings due to the separate factors. The major re-equipment program is expected to provide savings of up to 100 staff in the computer operations area as the heavily labour-intensive existing computers are phased out of service. This reduction will take place over a number of years. Australian Industrial Development Corporation: Not applicable. Australian Taxation Office: Achieved Staff SavingsIt is not possible to determine the net staff savings tributable to the introduction and extension of computer processing in the Taxation Office. Since computers were introduced into the Australian Taxation Office in 1963, significant changes have taken place in many of the work areas in the Office. Some have resulted from restructuring of the organisation to enhance its efficiency. Others, however, reflecting the increasing complexity and evolution of Australian business and industrial affairs and the legislative amendments that have altered the scope of the taxation laws, have made it necessary to provide additional staff resources. Prior to the introduction of computer processing, the number of staff employed in the Taxation Office was increasing at an average annual 1970 with the full impact of computer processing on a national basis, the number of staff employed has increased by an average annual rate of 1.3 per cent. This reduction has been achieved against a background of a workload which increases at an annual rate in excess of 4 per cent. Having regard to the difficulties indicated in arriving at a net staff saving directly attributable to the introduction and extension of computer processing, the best estimate which could be made would indicate that an additional 1,200 staff could have been required had computers not been introduced into the Taxation Office. \ Where specific positions have become redundant, the Taxation Office has been able to allocate the displaced staff to more productive and generally more sausfying tasks related to enforcement activities which otherwise' could not be undertaken. of computers in 1964 but the Anticipated Staff Savings Cash Receipting TerminalsDuring 1977-78 the Australian Taxation Office purchased seventy-one data capture receipting terminals to replace, basically on a one-to-one basis, existing mechanical cash registers of a unique design which had become obsolete. The capacity of the new equipment to produce a variety of detailed accounting reports and, more importantly, its inherent data capture facility is expected to ultimately result in a saving of up to 45 positions which will then be available for allocation to related workload growth areas. Tax Return Location SystemA pilot system which will supply up to date information concerning the location of tax returns is being developed in the Parramatta Office. When this system is installed in all branch offices it is anticipated a saving of 80 positions will occur. Staff currently occupying these positions will then be aUocated to other tasks. Commonwealth Banking Corporation: Since installing its first computer in 1966, the Corporation has progressively transferred many of its high volume operations, at branches and capital offices, to electronic data processing. Over the years the changeover to computer processing has resulted in immediate staff 'savings' totalling 1,350 in branches and capital offices. There have been no instances of early termination of employment of any staff member due to the introduction of computer processing. Partly offsetting the foregoing recorded figure for staff 'savings' are the 695 new positions established within the EDP area. With the introduction of many new services since 1966 and the continuously increasing transactional activity throughout the Corporation, its clerical staff numbers increased from 17,258 as at 30 June 1966 to 25,766 as at 30 June 1978. Reserve Bank of Australia: It is not possible to answer this question with any precision. Computers began to come into use for the main functions in the mid-1960's. It is not possat- ible to say how many more staff would have been employed if reliance had been placed on development of mechanised systems previously in use. Computers (Question No. 2223)",107

(2) What training programs are offered to CYSS project officers. (3) What suppon of a day-today nature is given to CYSS project officers by his Depanment. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (1) As at 30 June 1978, the number of project officers employed on Community Youth Suppon Scheme projects was as follows: (Question No. 2373) Project Officers Full-time Part-time New South Wales 145 20 Victoria 171 26 Queensland 60 5 South Australia 36 6 Western Australia 54 14 Tasmania 26 10 Total 492 81 been referred to or studied by (2) The need for suitable training arrangements for project officers is recognised and attention is being given to this matter particularly as regards the identification of training requirements. Some training sessions have already been conducted within various States and the progressive appointment of CYSS field officers will increase the scope for group and individual training activity. (3) My Depanment provides administrative suppon to State CYSS Committees which are responsible for the overall control and management of projects in the State concerned. As pan of this function, the Depanment provides advice and assistance to project officers as the need arises. This supportive role is being strengthened by the progressive (Question No. 2374) appointment of CYSS field officers who visit projects on a regular basis.

(3) In the drawing up of the CYSS policy and guidelines for local committees, were project officers consulted; if so, is to identify their panicular input into the guidelines. (4) If they were not consulted, what were the reasons. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (1) and (2) The Commumty Youth Suppon Scheme policy and guidelines for local committees set down the policy (Question No. 2404) and operational criteria for State CYSS Committees' consideration of project applications. Accordingly, the approval application is dependent upon it coming within the and the continuation of funding is dependent upon the approved project operating within the guidelines. (3) and (4) The review of CYSS which led to the issue of the revised guidelines earlier this year included a national survey of CYSS projects. As part of that survey some 92 project officers were interviewed to obtain their views on the operation of the Scheme. Their views were taken into account in the review process, but it is not possible to identify their particular inputs into the guidelines. Salt Content in Drinking Water Mr Uren asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 10 October 1978: (1) What measures are taken by (a) the Commonwealth and (b) each State to monitor and collect data regarding the salt content of drinking water supplies in Australian cities and rural centres.

251,Mr LES JOHNSON,R T R T R T R T,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 11 October 1978: (1) Further to his undertaking to distribute Environmental Survey Reports compiled by the Australian Atomic Energy (Question No. 2415) Commission (Hansard, 22 August 1978, page 593), will the Government consider employing more staff to ensure that no delay occurs in the compilation of the records in the future. (2) Ifnot,whynot. (3) When will the delayed reports be available to the public. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: water supplies of (i) Sydney, (1) and (2) Compilation of the Environmental Survey Reports is the responsibility of the AAEC Safety Department. Some vacant positions in this Department have recently been filled and staffing for other positions is under consideration. The need for any further staff would be considered on the basis of priorities at the AAEC and would be drawn from existing AAEC staff except in cases requiring specially qualified staff available only from outside the AAEC. (3) The reports are in the final stages of preparation. They are scheduled for issue in January 1979. the quality of the water supply Private Mail Contractors (Question No. 2471) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Post and Northern Territory the authority Telecommunications, upon notice, on 11 October 1978: (1) Is it a fact that many private mail contractors have been denied any increase in rates for the last 2 years. (2) If so, what is the reason for this discrimination against a certain sector of the mail delivery service. Total dissolved salt Sodium (3) If not, what increase has been granted to each of the contractor categories. milligrams milligrams Mr STALEY - The answer to the honourable per litre per litre member's question is as follows: 11.1-11.7 (1) No private mail contractor, who is entided by the 5-6.6 terms of his or her contract to a substantiated cost increase, 22-47 has been deprived of that increase. 50-130 Mail contracts fall into two main categories, that is, fixed 70-78 term and indefinite term contracts. Generally, tenderers can 50 6 elect to tender under the type of contract conditions which 40 2 best suit their circumstances. 34 3 There is provision for fixed term contracts to include a price variation clause. Moreover, Australia Post will cancel any fixed term contract if it can be established that the contract terms are causing the contractor undue financial hardship. In such cases, new tenders are called and the previous contractor can re-tender at a new price. Although indefinite term contracts have no price variation provisions, a contractor has the option of terminating such a contract on notice (usually of three months), if any aspect, including the rate of payment, becomes unsatisfactory. There is provision also for a competent contractor, with at least three years service, to convert a current indefinite term contract to fixed term conditions, and to include a price variation clause. If mutually suitable conversion arrangements cannot be agreed upon, the contractor still has the option of terminating the contract and re-tendering at a new price. (2) There has been no discrimination against any sector of (Question No. 2453) the mail delivery service. (3) At 30 June 1978, there were 2,203 fixed term contracts and 2,405 indefinite term contracts in operation. During the two years to 30 June 1978, the rate of payment on 1,404 fixed term contracts was increased by a sum totalling $1,128,331. During the same period, 20 indefinite term contracts were converted to fixed term with price variation provisions, at a cost of $ 13,497. Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 12 October 1978: (1) What factors did he take into account in the decision to transfer all bulk billing processes from Medibank to his Department. (2) How has he determined to absorb Medibank staff made redundant by Budget changes to the Government's health program when the total staff ceiling for his Department is approximately 6,320 and when the Public Service staff levels are generally being contained. (3) What is the estimate of the number of persons (a) who will take out private health insurance during 1978-79 and (b) who are opting out of any health insurance arrangement.

252,Mr HUNT,R T R T R T R T,"The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (1) With the implementation from 1 November 1978 including the payment of a 40 per cent/$20 level of Commonwealth benefit for all items tained in the Medical Benefits abolition of the Medibank levy, the necessity to retain the existing Medibank structure was removed. A decision to allow private funds to pay the 40 Commonwealth benefit on behalf of the Government was taken after considering detailed advisings on the options available. It was regarded as being administratively inefficient and wastefulfinanciallyfor the Commonwealth to operate its own system for paying Commonwealth benefits when the private health insurance organisations already had such a structure and would in most cases be paying their own benefits. In these circumstances it ate to maintain a Medibank Standard structure merely to process bulk billing claims. It was decided, therefore, transfer the function from Medibank to my Department totalUng together with appropriate officers who were employed by the Health Insurance Commission to carry out these functions. (2) As a result of a transfer of certain functions including bulk bill processing from the Health Insurance Commission to the Department of Health a significant number of CompubUc. mission staff engaged on these functions will be offered ployment in the Department of Health. Other newly created positionsrelatingto new departmental functions have been advertised and Medibank staff will be eligible to apply. It is expected that an appropriate adjustment will be made to the Department's staff ceiling to enable it to absorb the extra staff needed to perform additional functions Government in the Budget context.

Health Insurance Iwasaki Resort Project (Question No. 2492) (Question No. 2499) Mr Hodges asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 October 1978: (1) Did the Government require documented evidence of the promotional efforts made by the Iwasaki Sangyo Company to attract Australian equity in the tourist resort project at Yeppoon, Queensland. If so, what was the nature and approximate cost of the promotion. (2) What is the total amount the company intends to invest in the project.

253,Mr HOWARD,R T R T R T R T,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is the Government's normal practice not to disclose information relating to individual foreign investment of the new arrangements proposals.

(3) The Government's foreign investment policy does not specify Australian equity guidelines for projects of the kind per cent proposed by Iwasaki Sangyo (Australia) Pty Ltd.

Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (b) The informadon sought is not available to me. The Survey of Health of Employees in the Research Establishment of the AAEC, Lucas Heights, is an independent study being undertaken by the Depanment of Occupational and Environmental Health in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, University of Sydney. It is this School which has the responsibility for arranging for the preparation of the repon. Local Government Rates Mr Hurford asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 October 1978: (1) How much, and what proportion, ment receipts were derived from rates on property in the most recent year for which data is available. (2) What is the cost to the Commonwealth of the rebate on personal income tax for local government rates. (3) If this cost cannot be arrangements, what was the cost in the most recent year in which identification is possible, and what proportion of total Commonwealthreceiptswas the total cost of this rebate.",121
259,Mr HOWARD,R T R T R T R T,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Local government rates totalling $883m were collected in the six States during 197S-76 (accounting year ended December 197S in NSW, accounting year ended September 1976 in Victoria, financial year ended June 1976 for the other four States). This local governmentreceiptsfor that year. A preliminary estimate for rates collected in 1976-77 is $l,035m but an estimate of total receipts for that year is not yet available. The figures for rates collected exclude water and sewerage rates which are defined as pan of public enterprise income. Total local governmentreceiptsare defined as rates and penalties, revenue from licenses, fees and fines, income from public enterprises, property income, and grants from State and Commonwealth Government. Financing items, the most significant of which is net borrowing, are not included.

260,Mr HOWARD,R T R T R T R T,"The answer to the honourable at 40 per cent in that year, is member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The recommendations referred to by the honourable member have not been implemented. However, as pan of tfie continuing review of the operations of the Insurance Act 1973, they are currently under close examination, along with other suggested amendments. The Insurance Commissioner is being closely consulted on this matter. (3) The general principles which apply are those given legislative force by paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section 46 (1) and sub-sections 46 (2) and 46 (3) of the Act. Some specific responsibilities of auditors are set out in sub-section 47(3). (4) No. (5) No. (6) The considerations taken into account are those arising from the general principles set out in sub-sections 46 (1), 46 (2) and 46 (3) of the Act. (7) 59. (8) It was never intended that the Act should impose on the Commissioner the responsibility of undenaking a complete audit of all insurance companies subject to his supervision. This would be a duplication of the audit function provided for under sections 46-47 audit on a regular basis would involve very large numbers of professionally qualified people. It is considered that the high cost involved could not be justified be obtained. (9) Sub-section 30 (1) of the Act excludes certain specified assets from being taken into account for the purposes of the Act. Sub-secdon 30 (2) gives the Commissioner discretion to allow certain related body corporate investments as assets which are otherwise excluded by sub-secuon 30 (1). The Commissioner has not issued any formal guidelines as to assets he is prepared to approve under sub-secuon 30 (2) except in general terms through statements made in his annual reports (see particularly pages 7-8 of the Second Report and pages 15-18 of the Third Report). In his annualreportsthe Commissioner has made particular mention of his disquiet concerning loans to related compames, other than those made to related bodies effectively controlled by the insurance company. He has also outlined his general approach regarding shares in subsidiary companies. The discretion given the Commissioner in terms of subsecuon 30 (2)requiresthe Commissioner to examine each case on its merits and for a large range of matters to be taken into account depending upon the circumstances involved. Accordingly the Commissioner has not considered it practicable to issue more specific guidelines than those indicated in his annual reports mendoned above. (10) Regulations have already been made under Part IV (see Regulations 9-25). A number of aspects are currendy being considered which may give rise to proposals to amend the Regulations. It is also made to the Act (see answer to (2) above) consequential amendments to the Regulations may be necessaiy. (11) All returns and statements required to be lodged under the Act and Regulations are monitored to ensure their formal compliance with the standards required by the Act and Regulations, andrequisitionsare made on companies for correction and resubmission of returns and statements which do not meet such statutory requirements. (12) As the result ofhis contacts with the National Conference of Insurance Commissioners in USA, the Commissioner is introducing new procedural arrangements which will provide an Early Warning System somewhat similar to that used in North America but substantially adjusted to suit Australianrequirements.It is expected that this system will be in operation by the end of 1978. (13) The question whether any amendments should be made to the Insurance Act to specify requirements as to the nature of the investments which an insurance company may or may not hold is under consideration as part of the current examination mentioned in (a) above. Pending the outcome of that examination, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on whether the relevant requirements in Australian trustee legislation and in certain US legislation would be appropriate for incorporation into the system of supervision of Australian insurance compames. (14) As part of the process of reviewing the effectiveness of the arrangements for supervision of the insurance industry there are established procedures for examining any proposals that are put forward for new or amending legislation, including proposals from sources such as those referred to by the honourable member. At this time and given the circumstances outlined above I am not persuaded that the setting up of a Joint Select Committee along the lines referred to is necessary or appropriate.

Foreign equity in Ciutha Development Pty Ltd in 100 per cent, held equally by the British Petroleum group and Universal Tankships Incorporated; the British Petroleum group is negotiating to acquire 100 per cent interest. In Wambo Mining Corporation Pty Ltd foreign equity is about 32 per cent, the principal shareholders being Societe Miniere et Metallurgique de Penarroya and Charbonnages de Frace. Shell have a minor interest in Wambo through Austen & Buna. Foreign equity in J. and A. Brown and Abermain Seaham Collieries Ltd is approximately 10 per cent, through Conzinc Riotinto of Australia.

Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The AAEC estimates that members of the local population receive the following radiation doses as aresultof charge of radioactive material from the Research Establishment at Lucas Heights: (a) from the general environment: dose to the whole body is less than 2 millirem per year; dose to the roid gland is less than 10 millirem per year; (b) from the atmosphere only: as for (a) above. The National Health and Medical Research Council recommended limits for members of the public are S00AAEC's millirem per year to the whole body, and 1,500 millirem per year to the thyroid. The doses resulting from AAEC activities are less than 1 per cent of these limits. Radiation Doses: Lucas Heights",123
262,Mr LES JOHNSON,R T R T R T R T,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 25 October 1978: Have the standards of the International Commission on Radiological Protection been exceeded those of the National Health and Research Council at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission's Research Establishment at Lucas Heights NSW in the setting of (a) radiand ation exposure limits for workers population and (b) levels for radioactive discharges to the environment. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The system of dose limitationrecommendedby the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is the basis for most, if not all, national procedures for controlling exposure to ionising radiation. Australia is no excepalso tion. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) which advises Commonwealth and State Governments on matters of public health legislation and administration has drawn up radiation protection standards for individuals exposed to ionising radiation; these follow the ICRP recommendations of 1965 and are available in the publication 'Revised radiation protection standards for individuals exposed to ionising radiation', Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, 1977. The AAEC complies with these standards. In 1977, ICRP adopted new recommendations for radiation protection. However, the NHMRC has not yet issued new standards. The AAEC continues to use current NHMRC standards which conform with the 1965 ICRP recommendations. In practice the differences between the two recommendations are relatively minor and the effects of the AAEC's operations on the general public are consistent with the 1977 ICRP recommendations.

264,Mr HUNT,R T R T R T R T,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (3) I am well aware of the emerging debate about the implications of the projected oversupply of doctors. I am well aware of the many conflicting views about the implications which can be drawn and the actions which should be taken on the matter. These were two of the factors which prompted me to initiate the establishment of a committee of officials, under the chairmanship of Dr S.

The committee has been requested to provide advice on the implications of the current levels of supply and to develop options for action on the matter. The Government will decide, after considering the Committee's report, its policy on the matter. At the same time, my Department is investigating the possible over-supply situation, and collecting available information regarding both the issue of possible oversupply of doctors and the implications to national health costs.

(2) Is he also able to say what volume of (a) fuel which past was reprocessed and (b) reprocessed fuel was vitrified, at each of these plants during (i) 1977, (U) 1976 and (Ui) 1975. (3) Is he able to say whether vitrify spent oxide nuclear fuel derived from light water reacMarcoule tors on (a) a commercial or (b) a pilot scale without reprocessing in Europe, the United States of America, Japan or the Umted Kingdom. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable Light member's question is as follows: I am advised that: (1) The plant at La Hague, France, is currendy the only installauonreprocessingspent oxide nuclear fuel from light waterreactorson a commercial scale. (2) (a) The volume of oxide fuel reprocessed by the La Hague plant is reported to have been: (i) 1977 (period January 1977 to March 1978)-5 5 tonnes. (ii) 1976-15 tonnes. (iii) 1975-none. (b) None. (3) There are no proposals for the vitrification of unreprocessed spent oxide fuels. Mr Uren asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 26 October 1978: (1) Is he able to say what is the mass of (a) spent clear fuel derived from electricity producing light water reactors and (b) spent natural uranium metal fuel derived from electricity producing gas graphite reactors, which was or expected to be (i) reprocessed and (ii) vitrified during 1976, (B) 1977, (C) 1978 and (D) 1979 at the Nuclear Reprocessing plant at (AA) Marcoule, France and (BB) La Hague, France. (2) What is the mass of (a) spent oxide nuclear rived from electricity producing spent natural uranium metal fuel derived from electricity producing gas graphite reactors which was or is expected to be produced in France during (i) 1976, (ii) 1977, (iii) 1978 and(iv) 1979. (3) What measures have been taken or are proposed for the permanent disposal of any vitrified nuclear waste which has been produced in France. (4) What is the average activity of radioactive decay of (a) spent oxide nuclear fuel derived from electricity producing light water reactors and (b) spent natural uranium metal fuel derived from electricity producing gas graphite reactors. (5) How many natural uranium gas graphite nuclear power stadons are under construcuon, planned or on order in Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Japan. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (i) Detailed producdon schedules for the French reprocessing plants at Marcoule and La Hague are not available. Records held by the AAEC indicate that the amount of spent fuel from light water reactors and gas graphite reactors which has been reprocessed or is expected to be reprocessed at Marcoule and La Hague is: there are any proposals to La Hague Gas graphite water Gas graphite Light water reactor reactor fuel reactor fuel reactor fuel fuel 1976 None 220 tonnes 15 tonnes None 1977 None 220 tonnes 55 tonnes None (to March 1978) 1978 None 220 tonnes *55 tonnes+ None 1979 None 220 tonnes *55 tonnes + None * Capacity being increased from 55 tonnes (1978) to 400 tonnes p.a. by 1981. (ii) The only informadon available to me is that wastes from about 540 tonnes of gas graphite fuel were vitrified at Marcoule between 27 June and 24 July 1978. None of the wastes at the La Hague plant has been vitrified. (2) (a) According to French authorities the mass of spent oxide fuel from LWR's was expected to increase progressively from about 10 tonnes per year in 1976 to about 160 tonnes per year in 1980. Nuclear Waste (b) No details are available. The AAEC has calculated the (Question No. 2682) mass of spent fuel for the period as approximately 500 tonnes per year. (3) Preliminary investigations into the suitability of salt and granite formations in France for ultimate disposal of oxide nusolidified high level waste have commenced. (4) The radioactivity contained in spent fuel depends on the bumup of the uramum and the time elapsed after its disis charge from the reactor. An annual discharge of about 30 (A) tonnes of spent fuel of burnup 33,000 megawatt days per Fuel tonne (MWd t-' ) from a large lightwater reactor would typically contain about 7 x 10' tera becquerels (TBq) at 90 days after discharge. This would reduce by a factor of 3 after one year, a factor of 20 after 10 years, and a factor of 175 fuel deafter 100 years out of the reactor. light water reactors and (b) The same quantities of radioactivity would be contained in the spent fuel discharged annually from a gas-graphite reactor of similar size. As the gas-graphite reactors operate at a lower burnup than light water reactors, this radioactivity would be contained in a large quantity of spent fuel. (5) None. Honours (Question No. 2688) Mr Barry Jones asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 7 November 1978: Further to the answer to question No. 1509 (Hansard, 25 October 1978, page 2324), of the 403 knighthoods and dameships awarded since 1 January 1950 on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Government, how many in each category of knighthood or dameship were awarded to persons who had been (a) Liberal Party Members of Parliament, (b) National or National Country Party Members of Parliament and (c) Australian Labor Party Members of Parliament in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments.",123

271,Mr HUNT,R T R T R T R T,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Levels of arsenic in all 19 samples of prawns examined in the 1976 Market Basket Survey were in excess of the maximum levelrecommended for arsenic in foods in the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH & MRC) Standard for Metals in Foods. There is no specific entry for prawns in the Standard. (2) The arsenic levels in milligrams per kilogram found in prawns in summer, autumn, winter and spring respectively were as follows for the capital cities indicated: Adelaide . . 12.5 Brisbane . . 3.0 Hoban . . *NSS *NSS *NSS - NSS Melbourne 10.0 Perth . . . 17.5 Sydney . . 3.5 *NSS=no sample submitted. (3) No comparison is possible as prawns were not examined in any previous NH & MRC Market Basket Survey. (4) and (5) The Council has not recommended a specific maximum level for arsenic in prawns. However, the NH & MRC Standard for Metals in Foods includes a general maximum level of 1.15 milligrams of arsenic per kilogram of food. This level of 1.15 mg/kg, which was set torestrictthe level ofresiduesof arsenic from pesticides and accidental contamination in foods, is not appropriate to those organicallybound forms of arsenic present in certain fish, particularly crustacea. These, which occur naturally throughout the world, are unlikely to be affected through man's efforts to control arsenic in the environment. In any event the organically-bound forms of arsenic in crustacea are not considered to be a hazard to health because these forms of arsenic are rapidly eliminated by the human body. Other forms of arsenic are retained in greater quantities and for longer periods in the tissues before excretion. In the United Kingdom, for example, 'The Arsenic in Food Regulations, 1959' recognises this situation and exempts fish, including crustacea and molluscs from the general maximum limits for arsenic in foods.

Physical Quality of Life Mr HOWARD - The answer to the honourable (Question No. 2772) member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Statistics of rebates claimed and allowed in respect of overseas dependants are not compiled separately. (3) Abuse of the allowances for dependants overseas has been given as one of thereasonsfor their abolition. Difficulties in making independent checks of the correctness of claims for those allowances were recognised in the Report of the review of post-arrival programs and services to migrants-the Galbally Repon. Because of these difficulties it has been necessary to require taxpayers to furnish comprehensive information in suppon of their claims and this has led to disallowance of claims in a large percentage of cases. Figures are not available for the actual number of cases of misuse for each income year. However, a sampling conducted by the Taxation Office of claims made in the 1975-76 year for parents residing overseasrevealedthat approximately 60 per cent of the claims were either completely unjustified or were significandy in excess of the amount properly allowable.

280,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,R T R T R T R T,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The repon to which the honourable member refers is not yet avaUable in Australia but copies have been ordered.

Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Health, upon nodce, on 16 November 1978: (1) Has his attendon been drawn to a speech I made on the adjournment debate on 14 November 1978 calling on the Government to re-instate the hospital subsidy of IS cents (single) which was dropped on 1 November 1978, and which, as a result, has meant that health funds have been obliged' to raise contribution rates for intermediate ward cover. (2) If so, will he give consideration to this request. (3) Is it a fact that many of those affected by the abolition of the subsidy are pensioners. (4) Is it also a fact that since 1 November 1978, the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia contribute to 2 tables if they want extra cover, that is for optometric and dental cover, for married rate, whereas previously they had paid only $9.10 for the same cover. (5) Is the sum by which the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia has raised its contribution rates for intermediate ward cover, equivalent to the hospital subsidy which the Government abolished on 1 November 1978.",130
281,Mr HUNT,R T R T R T R T,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 1I have noted the terms of the honourable member's speech on 14 November 1978. (2) The subsidy provided to persons covered by Standard Medibank who wished to be treated in hospital by their private doctor was introduced by virtue of the compulsory nature of health insurance which operated from 31 October 1976. In Queensland, the subsidy amounted to IS cents per week for single persons and in other States up to 75 cents per week. The Government considered there to be no longer sufficient justification to continue the subsidy with the abolition of compulsory health insurance, and the health insurance levy, with effect from withdrawal of such a small amount was not seen as a deterrent to persons continuing to maintain basic hospital insurance cover if that is their desire. The honourable member will, of course, be aware that the Government continues to provide a standard level of hospital (and medical) cover to uninsured sioners, without direct cost to them. (3) I am not aware of the number of persons involved, but it could be expected that some would be pensioners. (4) It is not correct to of Australia Limited (Queensland) requires pensioners to contribute to two tables to obtain 'extra' benefits cover on and from 1 November 1978. The posidon is that prior to 1 November 1978 M.B.F. operated a table of benefits designated 'R' (Extra-cover), which was available to all persons at a monthly family contribution rate of $9.10, offering benefits covering the 25 per cent 'gap' between basic table benefits (75 per cent of the Schedule doctors' fees) and the Schedule fees, as well as benefits lary services. At that ume this meant in effect that pensioners contributing for such cover were paying for a higher 'gap' than was necessary Le. they were eligible for Commonwealth benefits of 85 per cent of the Schedule fees leaving a 'gap' of only 15 per cent (maximum payment for service $5). Table 'PZ' introduced on 1 November 1978 is specifically tailored for pensioners in that it offers benefits covering the IS per cent 'gap' (maximum $5) between pensioners'ComMedical Benefits Fund monwealth medical benefits entitlements (85 per cent) and (Question No. 2805) the Schedule fees, as well as the same benefits cover for ancillary services as previously available under Extracover, for a monthly family contribution rate of $ 14.73. The above change indicates, prima facie, that there should have been a reduction in contributions rather than an increase as occurred. However, the increase in contribution rates was necessary to correct the adverse operating experience recorded on the previous contribution/benefit structure. (5) Yes.

(2) What fuel savings target will be set for this campaign. (3) WUl a deadline be set for the report of the preliminary study; if so, what will it be. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The terms of reference for the preUminary study for the national energy conservation publicity campaign are: Preamble In September 1977, the National Energy Advisory Committee (NEAC) recommended that the Commonwealth and State Governments should institute a national vation program with emphasis on liquid petroleum fuels. NEAC also recommended that the Commonwealth and State Governments should jointly promote a national licity campaign to inform the energy, particularly oil. These recommendations have been considered by the Australian Minerals and Energy Council which comprises Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for energy matters. The Council believes that an effective and well integrated national energy conservation program is essential. A vigorous licity campaign to create better public awareness of the nations dependence on liquid fuels would be a key element of such a program. The general objectives for a national publicity campaign are as follows: (a) an enhanced level of public understanding of energy matters, and awareness of the Australian ation, particularly dence on imported oil and the possibility of future supply disruptions; (b) public appreciation of the importance of energy-it role in maintaining our present lifestyle; how it used more efficiently; and the personal monetary savings to be gained; and (c) for the longer term, individual and community acceptance of energy conservation as an integral part of the Australian life style. The Task The consultant shall: (a) Make a baseline measure of knowledge, attitudes and behaviour with respect to energy in general and liquid petroleum fuels m ticular, including the conception of the position inregardto Australian energy resources, consumption, and conservation; (b) identify communication targets; (c)recommendvarious communication channels priate to the identified transmitted; (d) develop pilot advertising themes andrecommendthe most suitable of these; (e) outline a framework and strategy for the publicity campaign and atimetablefor reservation of media time; (f) make campaign expenditure estimates; (g) estimateresultantenergy savings; (h) formulate campaign monitoring criteria cedures; and (i) refer to any other matter considered relevant. In making his recommendations the consultant shall have regard to the following: (i) the major energy conservation goal in all States is the conservation of petroleum-based fuels, particularly those used for transpon; the publicity campaign should be directed primarily towards this aspect and should not place emphasis on other issues; (ii) that because of differing circumstances in regard to energy supply and demand in the individual States, some States may wish to place greater emphasis than CSIRO others on particular conservation and substitution Specific goals; (iii) that a public acceptance needs Government actions inregardto pricing, taxation of regulation may be necessary to ensure conservationthe and substitution.

295,Mr HUNT,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: the substance of the submission and (1) (a) Ethylene glycol depresses the central nervous system and has a severe toxic action on the kidneys.

Death may occur within a few hours fromrespiratoryfaUure. Patients who have prolonged coma (Question No. 2885) or convulsions may incur irreversible brain damage. (b) Although inhalation of ethylene glycol is not generally hazardous because of its low vapour pressure, chronic poisoningresultingfrom continued exposure to the vapours has beenreportedto induce unconsciousness, nystagmus and decision, where a woman has lymphocytosis. (2) In relation to occupational exposure there appears to be no hygiene standard in which the term 'aerosol form' is employed. However, in relation to the vapour, the National of the Health and Medical Research Council recommends threshhold Umit levels (hygienic standards) for ethylene glycol vapour of 100 parts per mUUon or 260 mUligrams per cubic metre. These hygiene standards are intended as guides only in the control of health hazards and not as dividing Unes between safe and dangerous concentrations. In setting these hygiene standards, exposures are assumed to take place over an eight hour work shift in the absence of severe physical stress and to be followed by an exposure-free period of sixhours or more during which detoxification occurs. Adjustments in hygiene standards may be necessary when exposure is accompanied by excessive heat, humidity or hyperbaric work.

Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 November 1978: (1) Is a special departmental committee, which includes senior Treasury and Taxadon officers, examining various types of commodity taxes with a view to using the most suitable type as a taxing measure. (2) Has the committee considered a consumption tax as a means of ultimately eUminating income tax. (3) If so, has the committee also considered that such a tax would lead to a highly regressive taxation system in that under a scheme to tax consumption no account can be taken of a consumer's abUity to pay. (4) Would such a change to the tax system result in the wealthy of this country paying proportionately less tax than the poor with the wage and salary earner bearing the heaviest burden of taxation. (5) Is the present basis ofincome tax, theoretically at least, based on the abUity to pay; if so, would a change from a personal income tax system to an indirect commodity tax basis result in a complete negation of this principle.",137
300,Mr HOWARD,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Minister's answer to question (1) As pan of the government's investigation of the indirect tax system the Australian Taxation Office is at present conducting an inquiry into the practicabUity of a broad based indirect tax collected at the retaU level. For that purConcorde Travel pose it has been having discussions with business groups. (Question No. 2926) (2) to (5) As the Asprey Taxation Review Committee recognised, achieving the appropriate balance in the overall structure of the tax system involves choices regarding fairness, efficiency and simplicity. Insofar as the personal income tax is levied on the basis of capacity to pay, it constitutes a fair and equitable form of tax. The Asprey Committee has recommended that there should be greater emphasis placed on indirect taxes; but there is no intention of a movement towards 'ultimately eliminating income tax'.

Australian Technology: Defence and Civil (Question No. 2940) Aviation Purchases (Question No. 2945) Mr Willis asked the Minister for Productivity, upon notice, on 21 November 1978: What offsetting investments in Australian technology or expertise were made under the Australian Industries Participation Scheme for (a) major defence, and (b) civil aviation purchases during 1977-78. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I refer the honourable member to the reply I gave to question number 1794 (House of Representatives, Hansard 23 November 1978, page 3351) for general information concerningthe Offset Program. (a) For a general outline on offset matters in relation to defence I refer the honourable member to my colleague, the Minister for Defence's reply to question number 1773. If the honourable member wishes to obtain funher information relating to defence I suggest he could make a direct approach to the Minister (Question No. 2941) for Defence. (b) There were no civil aviation purchases requiring onsets in thefinancialyear 1977-78 but as the Offset Program is a continuing undertaking, orders to the value of $8.3m were placed against earlier civil aircraft purchases. In addition orders worth more than $6m were placed in this period by overseas aircraft companies without an offset commitment in anticipation of future purchases of civil or military aircraft. No funds are available under the Offset Program for investment in Australian any such investment is the responsibility of the Australian companies involved. However offset credits are awarded to overseas companies for their costs incurred in providing technical assistance, plant and tooling. In 1977-78 this amounted to over $.5m. Hospital Cost Sharing Arrangements Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon nodce, on 21 November 1978: (1) What are the current Federal/State cost sharing arrangements with each of the States for hospital outpauents for medical, pharmaceutical and other services.

Royal Commission on Human Relationships",139
305,Mr STEWART,CSIRO,"the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 23 November 1978: (1) What action has been taken to consider the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Human Relationships. (2) What discussions have taken place to determine which recommendations should (a) be discarded, (b) be implemented or (c) remain under consideration. (3) Which recommendations have already been (a) implemented and (b) discarded. (4) When will an announcement be made on the Government 's atdtude to the recommendations of the report. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (4) At the Commonwealth level, my Depanment chairs an Interdepanmental Working Group of Commonwealth depanments to consider the report's recommendations. This Group has met on two occasions. As responsibility for implementing many pans of the report rests with the State and Territory Governments, written to State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory seeking their views. For those recommendations which involve acdon by the Commonwealth, the Working Group has sought advice from Departments, as to which have been implemented and the which are now under consideration or are likely to be condisease. sidered in the near future. This informadon is still being piled. A statement on the government's consideration report will be made at an appropriate dme. Asbestos Products: Warning to Migrants Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 23 November 1978. (1) What acdon has his Department taken to alert immilation grants of the dangers of using products (2) Are any steps taken to identify immigrants who may be affected by asbestos-caused diseases before and after entry into Australia? Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Immigrants have not been alerted directly by my Department to the dangers of using products containing asbestos. However, the wide publicity given to these matters in ethnic newspapers and the media in general ensures that the majority of the Australian public is kept well informed. (2) Medical examinations are carried out on all immigrants and chest x-rays taken of those sixteen years of age and over before entry into Australia. These measures identify any immigrants affected by asbestos as well as any other significant disease. After entry into Australia immigrants can be required have further chest x-rays mainly for identification of possible reactivation of tuberculosis but also for identification other relevant conditions. Apart from these precautions, milation grants in Australia are subject only to the same medical checks as apply generally in the community. Asbestos Use in the Australian Capital (Question No. 2982) Territory (Question No. 3005) Mr Kerin asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice, on 23 November 1978: (1) What action has been taken to meet community concern with respect to the use of asbestos as an insulating material in the Australian Capital Territory. (2) Why was asbestos chosen as an insulant in the ACT. (3) What steps are being taken to ensure that asbestos is not used again as an insulant in the ACT. (4) What steps are being taken to inform the people of the ACT of the dangers of asbestos and to remove it where it is known to be present. (5) How many public buUdings in the ACT are known to contain asbestos in potentially dangerous or actually dangerous forms. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am informed by my Depanment that: the Prime Minister has (1) The BuUding Standards Committee, which is responsible for the preparation of the ACT building code, sought the advice of the Capital Territoiy Health Commission in 1976 on the use of sprayed asbestos in buUdings. The Health Commission advised there was no evidence to suggest that occupants of buUdings were at risk from asbestos-caused However, there was a distinct hazard to installers comunless proper care was taken to ensure that they did not inof the hale excessive quantities of asbestos dust. Accordingly, to protect workmen in the ACT, standards for the spraying, handling and use of asbestos material were (Question No. 2998) adopted by the Depanment of the Capital Territoiy under the Scaffolding and Lifts Ordinance. Advice of this was pubhshed in the 1976-77 Annual Repon of the BuUding Standards Committee. An amendment to the BuUding Manual published in July 1978 included an advisory note to remind builders that there were requirements for the instalof asbestos type materials under the Scaffolding and containing asbestos? Lifts Ordinance. Press announcements by the Capital Territory Health Commission were made in November 1978 inresponseto questions concerning the use of asbestos insulating material in the Territory. Subsequently, over ISO samples of insulating materials were examined onrequestand of these 6 were found to contain asbestos. Arrangements are in hand to examine the situations from which the 6 samples containing asbestos have been taken. (2) Asbestos materials have been used throughout Australia as an insulating material and forfireprotection. (3) and (4) See answer to (1). (S) Two public buUdings are known to have asbestos sprayed onto the underside of the metal roof to control condensation and toreducethe drumming noise created by rain. In both cases there is a false ceUing between the roof and the occupied zones of the buUdings. Both buUdings have been to checked by the Capital Territory Health Commission and do not present a hazard to the occupants. The National Capital of Development Commission has never used asbestos insuin houses constructed by it and no longer uses sprayed asbestos in buUdings. The situation withrespectto buUdings constructed privately is not known. Asbestos Contamination Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Commumty Development, upon notice, on 23 November 1978: (1) What information can he provide on the environment dangers caused by asbestos contamination. (2) Has his attention been drawn to a recent report by the World Health Organisation on the dangers of asbestos from an environmental point of view. If so, what conclusions of the repon. (3) What steps is he taking the dangers to the environment posed by asbestos. Mr Groom-The Minister for Science and the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Asbestos is a material which has many uses in the building, motor vehicle and other industries, but which can present a serious hazard to the health of industry workers if adequate safeguards are not taken. Except in isolated circumstances, the level of free asbestos fibres in the ambient atmosphere considered to pOse no problem. In some cases, however, in localised areas, asbestos fibres may be present in the environment in sufficient concentrations to become an identifiable health hazard. This may occur in the vicinity of asbestos tailing dumps. The Government of Western Australia has recently announced its decision to move the town of Wittenoom, a former asbestos mining centre, because of blue asbestos fibres in the environment in the vicinity. The Australian Environment Council's National Advisoiy Committee on Chemicals has included asbestos in a list of substances to be assessed in regard to potential environmental hazards. These investigations are underway at present. (2) I am aware of the World Health Organisation document referred to by the honourable member, which was published by the WHO'S International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1977. While touching on environmental issues, the repon is devoted principally to the human health effects of asbestos particularly in relation to occupational exposure. The main conclusions of the repon are: 1. All commercial forms of asbestos are carcinogenic in laboratory test animals. 2. The size and shape of asbestos fibres are important in determining lung cancer risk. Glass fibres of similar mensions to asbestos fibres have also been shown to cause lung tumors, in certain laboratory experiments. 3. In humans, exposure to most forms of asbestos causes an increased incidence of tumors of the lung, larynx ang gastrointestinal tract. 4. Occupational exposure to asbestos may occur during the mining of fibrous minerals, as well as minerals embodied in rocks, which may contain asbestos-like fibres as a contaminant. 5. Cigarette smoking and occupational exposure to asbestos have a multiplicative cancer. 6. The general population may also be exposed to asbestos fibres (at low levels) in air, beverages, drinking water, food, pharmaceutical and dental preparations, and by consumer use of asbestos-containing products. 7. It is not at present possible level of exposure in humans below which an increased risk of cancer would not occur. (3) The possible environmental risks from asbestos are under investigation by the National Advisory Committee on (Question No. 3006) Chemicals, whose membership includes officials of each State and Territory, and the Commonwealth. I understand that a repon to the Australian Environment Council on environmental dangers of asbestos is currently in preparation. The need for greater public awareness will no doubt be one of the factors considered. My colleague, the Minister for Health, advises that the National Health and Medical Research Council has published a number of codes of practice for use and handling were the main of asbestos and asbestos products. to increase public awareness of Apprentices: Department of Health (Question No. 3010) Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 23 November 1978: (1) Does his Depanment or any bodies or statutory authorities under his control normally employ apprentices.

(2) Will he outline what alterations to the businesses of (a) local grocers, (b) department stores, (c) clothing stores and (d) restaurants would be necessary in the event of the introduction of a value-added tax or a retail sales tax, such as that which the Government has directed the Commissioner of Taxation to investigate. (3) Would the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax have an inflationary effect as a result both of the cost of the tax itself to the consumer, as well as the cost of administering the tax, which businesses might pass on to the consumer.",141
307,Mr HOWARD,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. . (2) As part of the Government's investigation of the indirect tax system, the Taxation office is at present conducting an enquiry into the practicability of a broad-based indirect tax collected at the retail level. If, after receiving the Taxation office report, the Government should decide to take the matter further, a discussion paper would be prepared and released to the public It is envisaged that the discussion paper would, inter alia, seek to business could be affected. Only after study of the community response to the discussion paper would the Government take a final decision whether or not to introduce a broad-based indirect tax and it would be entirely premature to speculate about' alterations to businesses'that might be required. (3) The effects of the direct tax on price levels would depend on the form of the tax and the amount of revenue to be raised. As to the cost to the private sector of administering merely note that there are already costs associated with the present sales tax. Mr Humphreys asked the Treasurer, upon nodce, on 23 November 1978: (1) Is he able to say whether the antique trade associations are so concerned about the possible introduction of a valueadded tax that they organised the first ever national conference of trade representatives in Melbourne on Monday, 20 November 1978. . . . . (2) Has his attention been drawn to the option expressed by a senior member of the New South Wales Antique Dealers Association and quoted in a report by Mr Ingram in the Financial Review of 17 November 1978, that, on the basis of the British experience with a value-added tax, two levels of dealing would begin to operate, with a lower cash price and a higher, invoiced price, therefore possibility of dealers evading the tax.",143

(2) Yes. Mr Humphreys asked the Treasurer, upon, notice, on 23 November 1978: (1) Will he give an assurance that the Government does not foresee, and has not planned for, the scenario described by Mr Eric Risstrom of the Australian ation wherein the Commonwealth Government would rely almost exclusively on excise and indirect taxes generally and leave the income taxfieldto the States. (2) Has his attention been drawn to a research paper issued by the Taxation Institute of Australia Research and Education Trust which criticises a value-added tax because of the difficulties in introducing the system and educating those affected, the administrative and compliance costs which are excessive for efficient taxation collection, the accompanying inflation, the imposition of the onus of collection on a group not familiar with the requirements and the flow-on effect in terms of unemployment. (3) Has his attention also been drawn to the point made by the Trust which suggests that only if a universally based value-added tax at a single low rate were introduced, would the advantages of such a tax be realised.

(2) Do secretaries often have the same working hours as their employers and therefore have as much need for similar facilities to those of their employers. (3) Will the Minister consider having a shower installed in the women's toilet on the 12th floor of the Australian Government Centre, Brisbane. Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable introducing the member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, no showers have been provided for women in the Parliament Offices, whereas one has been provided for men on the 12th floor.

Solar Energy Appliances: Sales Tax (Question No. 3037)",143
310,Mr STEWART,CSIRO,"the Treasurer, upon notice, 20 on 24 November 1978: 8 (1) What are the various rates of sales tax imposed on 13 solar energy appUances. 14 12 (2) Can he say whether the United States of America offer 3 tax incentives to assist the proliferation of these appliances in 3 that country. 2 (3) In view of the growing energy problem, will he consider and advise the House of the possibility of exempting 75 these appliances from sales tax and of offering tax incentives to encourage their use in Australia.",144
311,Mr HOWARD,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable 14 member's question is as follows: 7 11 (1) Current interest in Australia in solar energy appliances 9 appears to be directed to water heating and accordingly I 9 note that the rates of sales tax applicable to solar water3 heating panels are: 3 (a) Solar absorption panels of a kind installed as fixtures 2 in houses-exempt ; 58 (b) Other kinds of solar absorption panels, including those for industrial use or for heating domestic swimming pools- 15 per cent; (c) Components for solar absorption panels-the rate appUcable to the panels in question. (2) I understand that legislation has been introduced in the United States which, inter alia, provides for a 'residential energy credit', enabling homeowners to be eligible for a tax credit for 'renewable energy source expenditure', which includes solar, wind and geothermal energy systems. (3) Thereferenceto a 'growing energy problem' is not clear. The sharp rise in the prices of some sources of energy inrecentyears has made governments and the community more conscious of the importance of energy to modern industrial economies. Views on whether there is a 'growing energy problem'-in most contexts to be read as 'shortage'very often depend on beliefs about the likely impact of future technological developments on the cost of exploiting energy resources and the likelihood of known reserves of energy being extended at present or future energy prices. In so far as Australia is concerned, although there are differences in the availability, domestically, of various energyresourceswe are well endowed overall with known resources and appear to have sound prospects of funher discoveries in some important areas. That is not to suggest that the Government can be indifferent to the availability of future energy supplies and/or can responsibly countenance the inefficient use of energy. On the contrary, concern that our energy resources be used efficiently was an important factor in the Government's decision to increase, in the 1978-79 Budget, the price of domestically produced crude oU to impon parity.

321,Mr HUNT,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: Yes. The particular Busselton in Volume 52 (1977) of Archives of Disease in Childhood has been noted. It is acknowledged that the cause of coronary heart disease is multifactorial and certain 'risk factors' have been identified by various medical researchers. One of these 'risk factors' is a high level of blood cholesterol. There have been many suggested causes for raised blood cholesterol levels one of which is the intake of foodsrichin cholesterol. There has been, and still is, considerable research devoted to heart disease, some of which has been funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council. Officers of my Department are constantly monitoring the literature on this subject and are aware of current theories. A number of these are apparently conflicting. Appreciating the significance found to be associated with heart disease but bearing in mind the need for further research my Department does not place emphasis in its nutrition publications on undue restriction of substances such as saturated fats and/or cholesterol. Rather it advocates the consumption of a wide variety of foods, all in moderate amounts. Prostheses: Availability Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 24 November 1978: (1) What is the arrangement the hospitals agreements for the provision of prostheses for private patients in public hospitals.

The types of aids and appliances supplied differ to some extent between the States. (2) Assistance is not generally available through private hospitals as they are autonomous bodies outside the public hospital system. Notwithstanding this, the Commonwealth makes a significant contribution towards the operating costs of private hospitals in the form of a direct payment of $ 16 for each in-patient bed day.

(2) When was the allowance last increased, and by how much and what percentage has the cost of petrol and depreciation of a car, as determined by his Department, mcreased since then. study which was published Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The private vehicle allowance payable to members who use their private vehicles to travel to or from Canberra on parliamentary business is authorised by Section 3 of Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 1978-79. Clause 3.2 of that Section provides that the allowance shall be paid at Australian Public Service rates then current. Areviewof the rates was considered by the Public Service Board and staff organisations meeting as the Joint Council (a consultative body established under the Public Service Act) on 6/7 December 1978 and the Board advised that action would be taken to implement new rates. As soon as they are promulgated they will of course be applied by my Department to claims by Senators and Members. of the factors that have been (2) The determination of the rates is not a matter for my Depanment but for the Joint Council and the Public Service Board. The Secretary of the Public Service Board has supplied the information that the last increase in rates, i.e. to the current levels, occurred in 1976. Using the 6 cylinder rate as an example (rates are specified for 4, 6 and 8 cylinder vehicles) the increase on that occasion was 1.10c per km, from 12.90c per km to 14c per km. Of the 14c, 2.76c was attributable to petrol costs and 2.59c to depreciation. The proposed (Question No. 3056) new rate for 6 cylinder cars is 14.20c of which 3.04c relates to petrol costs and 4.97c to depreciation.

(2) Would new discoveries of oil and natural gas in this basin be of immense imponance if they can be commercially developed. (3) As private enterprise appears unable to drill, or does not have the financial resources or incentives to drill, will he take steps to ensure that Government exploration funds are spent. (4) Will he also consult with South Australia and New South Walesregardingthe markets that could be found for Amadeus Basin gas and oil to supplement their present supplies in the mid 1980s when both oil and gasreservesare likely to be depleted to the extent that imports must be increased if new discoveries are not made. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Active exploration programs are also being ried out onshore in Queensland. (2) The importance of any new discoveries would depend on factors, such as size and recoverability. (3) and (4) The situadon is still as described of 7 June 1978 to Question No. 620.

331,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CSIRO,"the Minister ministrative Services, upon nodce, on IS August 1978: Why are prices of tenders set out in schedules blanked out when placed on notice board lists. Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable tenders member's question is as follows: I am advised that it is not the general practice of Commonchasing wealth departments to place schedules of tenders with blanked out on nodce boards. One department, the Department of Housing and Conthere strucuon, has indicated it does list tenders received on boards shortly after tenders have closed. These show tentender derers names only. When acceptance of a tender is apwas proved, the tender reference number, description supplies, value of the contract the contractor are published in the Commonwealth Gazette (see answer to Quesdon 1635 in the House of Representor adves Hansardon 17 November 1978, page 3063). Two types of schedules are placed on the nodce board of some departments. These schedules list: (i) tenders currendy being invited, including the ule number and closing date; (ii) details of contracts arranged. This list is a copy the Commonwealth Gazette of the past week's notification of contracts arranged. Public Service Tendering Procedures",151

(2) Are all schedules of initialled. Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The general practice of departments is to require all tender forms and accompanying letters to be numbered and initialled by each member of the opening committee. (2) I am advised that it is the general practice of depanments that all schedules of technical data attached to tenders be initialled, except in the case of the Depanment of Housing and Construcuon. The practice of that Depanment is to place the tender number on each schedule only. Public Service Tendering Procedures",151

(2) What are the criteria for the admission or rejection of late tenders. (3) Is the Tender Board the only body with power to admit or reject late tenders. (Question No. 1636) Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable for Admember's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Purchasing Division of my Depanment will not accept for consideration a tender received after the due closing dme unless the postmark clearly indicates that the tender was mailed before the nominated closing dme. All other are regarded as late, are ruled informal, and returned unopened to the tenderer. Some Commonwealth purbodies receive late tenders and admit them for conprices sideration in some instances. The procedure normally followed is that the tender is registered, on receipt, as a 'late tender' and subsequently taken into consideration only if is a clear advantage to the Commonwealth in doing so, nodce such as a significandy lower price, and that the relevant board or delegate of the Minister is satisfied that there no malpractice or impropriety associated with acceptof the ance of the late tender for consideration. and the name and address of (3) There is no general regulation in regard to acceptance rejection of late tenders and the responsibility is in some cases vested in appropriate individual officers.

(Question No. 1640) Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Executive power of the Commonwealth under Section 61 of the Constitution and the Administrative Anangements Orders made fromtimeto time by the Governor General-inCouncil enables Ministers to enter into contracts for items that are within the respective responsibilities of Ministers. A Minister may delegate his power in regard to contracts to a specific public servant by instrument in writing. Some departments and authorities have power to enter into contracts under Regulations made pursuant to their enabling legisladon. For example, secdon 174 of the Regulations under the Repatriation Act provides that: The Commission may enter into contracts for any purpose connected with or incidental to the administration of the Act or of these Regulations including contracts for the purchase or sale of any commodities. Notwithstanding, the courts have accepted that a statutory power is not necessary for an a contract in the ordinary course of administering a recognised part of a government's activities. Contracts made on behalf of the Crown by its officers in the established course of their authority and duty are Crown contracts and as such bind the Crown. The nature and extent of the officer's authority may be defined by constitutional practice or express instructions, or may be inferred from (he nature of the office or the duties entrusted to the officer. If any statute regulating a particular function of government expressly or impliedly governs an officer's power conditions must be observed.

Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable communications member's quesuon is as follows: Yes; the exposure pathways are: tritium: inhalation and uptake atmosphere; iodine-131: inhalation and uptake in locally produced milk; argon-41 and the radioactive isotopes of krypton xenon: irradiation of body tissue by these isotopes in the atmosphere. The Australian Atomic Energy Commission's estimate of the probable maximum radiation doses to members of the ductions general public arising from all discharges from the Research Establishment at Lucas Heights are set out in answer House of Representatives Question No. 2634. Telecom: Exchange Equipment Mr Shack asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 22 August include: 1978: (1) What surveys were conducted, and what were the results, before the decision was made by Telecom to install the new exchange equipment ARE II and AXE. (2) What is the estimated cost to Telecom of the purchase and installation of this new equipment. (3) What is the potential employment reduction within Telecom due to the use of this new equipment. (4) What new or improved services will ARE II and AXE exchange equipment provide to Telecom subscribers. (5) What are the expected charges for these new services.",152
337,Mr STALEY,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) ARE II is a crossbar exchange with a limited form of computer control. The AXE system, on the other hand, is a fully computer-controlled switching system. appropriate officer to enter into Various forms of computer-controlled switching systems have been in operation in the United States and Canada for many years. Also most European administrations are installing one form or another of stored program control equipment. In the Middle East many developing countries are letting contracts for similar equipment. Indeed all around the world, the trend is towards stored program controlled switching systems. In Australia, Telecom has had experience with stored program controlled trunk exchanges which are in operation in a number of major cities. of contracting, then all statutory Telecom's decision to move to stored program controlled exchanges was based on surveys of world-wide developments and overseas visits by technical experts to assess different systems. For the AXE system international tenders Radiation Exposure were called. There were seven tenderers from major equip(Question No. 1726) ment suppliers. After an exhaustive analysis it was decided that AXE offered the greatest advantages. (2) At the 30 June 1978 there were 4.1m subscribers. The estimated figure for 1990 is 7.2m. A continuing program of exchange installation is necessary to meet this development. Also, Telecom is modifying large capital city and provincial exchanges by the addition of ARE II thus extending service life and improving and increasing facilities and reducing operating costs. Currendy, much of the growth is being met if by ARE II but will progressively be met by AXE as the tritium and ARE II program tapers off. The purchase and installation of exchange switching equipment of the various types for development of the telenetwork up to the late 1980s will require an expenditure of about $2,000m. It should be stressed that this figure is lower than the amount which would need to be spent if Telecom continued to install the existing crossbar through skin from the equipment. (3) There is a reduced need in the exchange equipment installation and maintenance field as aresultof the introduction of ARE II and AXE equipment. Detailed studies have and been completed in respect of the former and it has been assessed that approximately 600 less technical staff will be required for maintenance work by 1985 as compared with the present staffing levels. However, no overall staff rewill take place as staff will be redeployed into other work areas. AXE equipment will not be introduced in any to quantity before 1983 and the assessment of the overall staffing effect is still under review. Staff associations covering technical staff have been advised that there will be no redundancy due to ARE II. In addition, they have been advised that there will be no redundancy for ten years as a result of (Question No. 1772) the introduction of new technology such as AXE.

The capability to introduce For example: Abbreviated dialling. (S) Tariffs for new facilities potentially available with the new equipment have not yet been determined. In most cases, introduction of a new facility follows a market survey, and an appropriate tariff rate is set, based on cost of provision and likely customer demand. There would be no charge applied for certain facilities such as tracing of malicious calls. Government Contracts: Offset Arrangements Mr Holding asked the Minister for Home Affairs, upon nodce, on 22 August 1978: (1) How many contracts entered into by departments and statutory corporations under his control for the purchase of equipment contained clauses specifying an offset arrangement with the vendor for the purchase of Australian manufactured goods, components and/or technology during the last 10 years. (2) What were those contracts. (3) What was the sum involved in each offset clause and what were the terms of its discharge. (4) What is the extent to which the terms of these clauses have been implemented specifying in each case the monetary value of the implementauon. (5) What sum is currently available under these clauses for the purchase of relevant Australian manufactured goods, components and/or technology. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: I refer the honourable member to the informadon provided by the Minister for Productivity in answer to Quesuon No. 1794, House of Respresentatives Hansard, 23 November 1978, page 3351. Quarantine: Incinerators Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 12 September 1978: (1) What is the current situadon with the provision and maintenance of adequate incinerator facilities at Australian ports. (2) How significant is the new proposal to macerate and sterilise waste as an alternative to incineration. (3) How is the material treated by this method finally disposed of if it is not incinerated.",152
338,Mr HUNT,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) By arrangement, State authoriues operate and maintain quarantine waste disposal facilities at seaports. Under a Commonwealth/States cost sharing arrangement initiated in 1966, the Commonwealth reimbursed States for the construction of a number of incinerators for the disposal of quarantine waste at seaports nominated by the States. At present the provision of additional quarantine waste disposal facilities at seaports is undertaken by State authorities in sultation with the Commonwealth. Arrangements are in hand for the provision of additional waste disposal facilities at Newcastle and Wallaroo seaports and Cairns airpon at Commonwealth expense. new services for customers. Under the 1966 anangement operating and maintenance costs of these incinerators are borne by the States. In 1976 the Commonwealth approached the States with a view to negotiating a new arrangement which would provide an equitable basis for sharing these costs. Specinc proposals were referred to the States for consideration in July 1977. Replies have been received from five States. Financial and administrative implications of alternative proposals put by these States are being examined. When this examination has been completed, the matter will be referred to Government for consideration. (2) The provision of additional quarantine waste disposal (Question No. 1797) facilities by the Commonwealth at seaports and airports is being considered in the light of new, more efficient means of waste disposal developed in the Animal Quarantine Branch of my Department and now being implemented for the seaports of Newcastle and Wallaroo and Cairns airport. This new approach involves the maceration and sterilisation of waste as an alternative to incineration. The macerator/steriliser units proposed are significantly less costly than incinerators in most applications, avoid the pollution and other problems which are sometimes associated with incinerators and are far less costly to maintain and operate. Further, as the macerator/steriliser unit is planned as a closed in-line system, post-treatment contamination is avoided. (3) As the material has been sterilised liquids may be run to sewer or septic and solids sent to sanitary land fill. Alternatively, all material may go to a wet land-fill area. Public Broadcasting Services (Question No. 2140) Mr MACKenzie asked the Minister for Post and Telecommumcations, upon notice, on 20 September 1978: (1) When can an answer be expected to Question No. 863 which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 6 April 1978. (2) What objective data such as survey results has been employed in assessing the demand for public broadcasting stations in Australia. (Question No. 1912)",153
339,Mr STALEY,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 1 refer the honourable member to the answer provided by me to Question on Notice No. 863 (House of Representatives Hansard, 22 November 1978, pages 3252-3). (2) The planning and development of public broadcasting services is a vital, new aspect of the broadcasting system and is undertaken only after careful consideration by government, after consultation with representatives of existing broadcasters and potential public broadcasters, and after close scrutiny, through the public inquiry process, by the general public. Planning proposals for new or improved broadcasting services in all three sectors-national , commercial and publiccommonly originate with representations to the Minister, local Members of Parliament, the Postal and Telecommunications Department, or associated statutory bodies such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal or the Special Broadcasting Service. con- Such representations usually maintain that one or other community need or interest is not being adequately met by existing broadcasting services. If the representations present a prima facie case for an inquiry into the provision of new services, a draft planning proposal is prepared by the Postal and Telecommunications Department. The Minister's decision to approve a planning proposal is based upon the Department's recommendations and industry comments arising from consultation processes required under section 11 lc of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942. However, full ascertainment of the extent and nature of community needs at the level demanded by the public inquiry process is the responsibility of applicants for a licence. If their application is to succeed, they should satisfy bunal that there is a need for a programs are directed towards present these programs more effectively than rival applicants.

353,Mr HAYDEN,CSIRO,"the Minister representing the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon nodce, on 8 November 1978: (1) What provisions exist for academic staff of Australian institutions to work in CSIRO on secondment or on a similar temporary basis. (2) How many academic staff have worked on such an arrangement with the Organisation during each of the last 10 years. Mr Groom-The Minister for Science and the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Academic staff of Australian institutions can work temporarily in CSIRO under a variety of arrangements. In some cases the employment of the staff concerned remains fully or partly financed by the 'home' institution while other instances academic staff may be on leave-without-pay. CSIRO may pay an honorarium or meet associated with secondments. The Executive of CSIRO is presendy examining provisions for secondment of staff both to and from CSIRO, involving not only tertiary educational institutions but also private government laboratories. As aresultof this examination, it possible that the present arrangements for secondment of academic staff to CSIRO will be expanded. (2) The numbers of academic staff of Australian institutions recorded as having worked in CSIRO on secondment or similar temporary basis during the last 10 financial are as follows:* 1968-69-10; 1969-70-5; 1970-71-1; 1971-72-9; 1972-73-13; 1973-74-13; 1974-75-8; 1975-76-17; 1976-77-18; 1977-78-14. * Due to the informal nature of many such arrangements there are likely to have been beenrecorded.A lower limit of one month has been established for the purpose of compiling this table.

(2) If so, (a) which minerals processing industries are under investigation and (b) what fuel savings are anticipated as aresultofthe use of these techniques. Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science and the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes, methods for conserving energy in the Australian minerals industry are the subject of research at the CSIRO Minerals Research Laboratories and cover aspects of efficiency in mining operations, mineral beneficiation and process metallurgy. (2) (a) The industries co-operating with CSIRO are the bauxite-aluminium industry, the iron-ore and steel industry and the producers and processors of sulphide ores (nickel, copper, lead and zinc). Increased efficiency of energy usage, together with economic, environmental and human factors, are all aspects of the Organisation'sresearchprograms. The (Question No. 2719) relevant activities includerelativelyshort-term in-plant and laboratory studies wherein energy economies can be identified and implemented quickly, as well as long term research. (b) A project aimed at conserving energy in the aluminium industry involves the further development of a chlorination process for the production of aluminium from bauxite which could lead to 20-30 per cent savings in electrical energy. Flash smelting is being developed for use with nickel and copper sulphide flotation concentrates, and, in the case of copper, the energy required is only 40 per cent of that required by the conventional reverberatory furnace. A low energy process is also being developed which will produce an up-graded nickel oxide from nickel matte, while laboratory scale tests on a new phase separation process for therefiningof lead is showing up to 70 per centreductionin the energy consumed in conventional processes. A pilot plant in is presently being developed for therefiningof lead by this process while similar laboratory work has commenced to certain costs study therefiningof zinc. In the iron-ore industry several projects are underway aimed at achieving improved efficiency of beneficiation, pelletising and metallising processes. Energy saving aspects and of this work are directed towardsreducingpower consumpis tion during grinding, and fuel consumption (possible 20 per cent savings are indicated) during the induration stage of pelletising. In mineral dressing processes such as flotation separation, energy saving is one aspect of the studies being undertaken years in collaboration with several firms aimed at achieving improved performance of the processes. No quantitative figure for the energy savings resulting from such work is available.

Before that date servicemen paid the Assessed Economic Rent (AER) or 15 per cent of salary, whichever was the lower amount, in rent. The GRS has grouped dwellings in accordance with scales and standards, and ranks in accordance with housing entitlements.

(2) How many of these persons are receiving pensions or part pensions as a result of contact with Agent Orange. (3) What is the long term effect of Agent Orange on an individual at various levels of contact. (4) Are there any documented cases in Australia or the United States of America of persons who have been in contact with Agent Orange (a) being made sterile or (b) having Agent Orange induced skin cancers. (5) What are the range of illnesses caused by Agent Orange. (6) Will a special inquiry be established to investigate the effects of Agent Orange on Australian Service personnel. (7) Will lump sum compensation or special pensions be paid to Australian Service personnel who have been affected. (8) Is he able to say what were the effects of Agent Orange where it was sprayed continually on civilian Vietnamese populations. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Defence Health Services have no documented cases of personnel who have been in contact with Agent Orange. (2) The Australian Defence Health Services have no record of any claim for a pension based on contact with Agent Orange. The receipt of pensions is a matter for the Minister of Veterans' Affairs. (3) The long term effects of Agent Orange are not fully known to the Australian Defence answer to Question (5). (4) See the answer to Question (1). (5) Ingestion of large undiluted ange could cause gastrointestinal depression and difficulty in swallowing. Occasionally skin contact can produce harmful effects on the peripheral nervous system causing pain, tingling, or paralysis of long duration. (6) and (7) See the answer to Question (1). (8) The Australian Defence Force did not use Agent Orange in Vietnam, and in these circumstances no comment is offered on the Question. Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 November 1978: (1) Is it a fact that since the 1940s the Australian Navy has been aware that asbestos is a dangerous health hazard. (2) If not, when did the Navy become aware of this fact. (3) What action (a) was to protect Naval personnel and dockyard workers from asbestos fibres. (4) Has any publicity been given at any time to the nature of asbestos and the associated dangers of asbestos caused diseases. (Question No. 2990) Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The hazards involved in the ntining or manufacture of asbestos and its products have been known for many years. There is no evidence to suggest that the Navy Health Services have not been aware of these hazards since the 1940s. (3) and (4) Australian Navy Orders specifically related to asbestos hazards have been issued since 1968, and apply to all personnel, uniformed as well as civilian and to contractors' employees, in Naval Dockyards and Establishments. They have prescribed detailed procedures to minimise the production of asbestos dust during handling, fitting and stripping of asbestos-containing materials. They have also provided for personnel employed on such work to wear approvedrespiratorsand to be medically examined, including chest x-rays, before starting such work and annually thereafter. These orders supplement but do notreplacethe relevant instructions under Clause 41 of the New South Wales Factories Act of the Harmful Gases, Vapours, Fumes, Mists, Smokes and Dust Regulations 1945 (as amended) made under the Victorian Health Acts. Naval dockyards have always complied with the provisions of these Acts. Defence Department: Apprentices (Question No. 3009) Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 November 1978: (1) Does his Department or any bodies or statutory authorities under his control normally employ apprentices.

367,Mr VINER,DAILY FEES FOR ORDINARY CARE PATIENTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Data on officers on long term sick leave is not available before 1975. However there has been an increase in the number of officers on long term sick leave in the last three years, from 769 in December 1975 to 1,264 in November 1978. A large proportion of officers on long term sick leave are awaiting invalidity retirement The Public Service Board has indicated that the increase in officers taking long term sick leave is related to the increase in invalidity retirements from the Service. (2) There does not appear to have been a sudden and widespread breakdown in the health of public servants. In its 1978 Annual Report the Public Service Board said that the increase in invalidity retirements (and hence the use of long term sick leave prior to retirement) wasrelatedto a number of factors. These include the changing age structure of the Service, the number of ex-servicemen approaching reaptirement, changing community attitudes towards health and arrangements for age and invalidity retirement. There is also today greater community awareness of the importance of early diagnosis of disease. I am informed that this, together with increased sophistication of diagnostic techniques, has resulted in earlier recognition of potentially serious conditions such as psychiatric disorders, heart disease and hypertension. Such conditions can have fatal consequences if Consumption Tax allowed to progress untreated. It is generally considered by medical experts that these types of illness may be aggravated (Question No. 3027) by stress, particularly stress in the work situation. Modern treatment of these conditions requires not only therapeutic measures such as appropriate drugs but alsoreductionor elimination of stress. In some cases the latter can only be achieved by granting long term sick leave. (3) (a) I am informed that the Department of Health has no evidence of any collusion between medical practitioners and public servants. tax, which the Treasurer has (b) Medical officers employed by the Australian Public Service do not encourage public servants to abuse sick leave entitlements.
