It is alleged in that letter that the British Australian Tobacco Proprietary Company Limited has stocks of Australian tobacco in hand sufficiently large for four years' consumption, and, therefore, is not prepared to buy any more leaf. Tho company's buyer, it is said, has advised farmers not to continue tobacco growing because there will be no market for that product. Will the Minister - have an inquiry instituted to ascertain the cause-, and whether there will be an opportunity to sell tobacco leaf, and whether the price of the manufactured article will be affected in any way?",12
3,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have not read the letter referred to, but my attention was drawn to the same matter by a letter handed to me by .the honourable member for Maranoa.

OFFICECLEANERS ' WAGES .",13
6,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"On Friday last the honourable member for Grey asked me whetlier there was any truth in the rumour that the wages of temporary office cleaners had been reduced. I told him that I knew nothing of the matter, and the Secretary of the Department waa at the time unaware of the facts; but I have ascertained since that in the Home A f fairs Department there are two temporary office cleaners who, in accordance with a decision of the last Minister, have been receiving 9s. per day. Public' Service Commissioner, however, has drawn attention to the fact that section 40 of the Public Service Act provides that temporary employees shall be paid at the same rate as permanent employees for doing similar work, and that the permanent office cleaners are receiving 8s. 5d. per diem I saw the Public Service Commissioner about the matter on Saturday, and I am afraid that his decision must stand.

7,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister, who, with others on the Ministerial side, has complained from time to time of the delay in laying the report of the Auditor-General on the table, whether he will adjourn the consideration of the Budget and Estimates until the report for the present year bas been presented, so that we may properly discuss the financial proposals of the Government.",13
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I say frankly that I am bitterly disappointed by the late appearance of the Auditor-General's report. I should think that I have asked for the report a dozen times, and the latest information is that it is likely to be here during this week. I say that that is much too late, and I can tell the lionorable member that next year the report will be presented earlier. SADDLERY FACTORY.",13

14,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I wish to ask you a question, Mr Speaker, regarding a paragraph that has appeared in the newspapers to the effect that a collection of manuscripts which once belonged to Governor Macquarie, and which concern the early history of Australia, is for disposal in London, and that the sale of the papers is being postponed pending the decision of the Commonwealth . regarding their acquisition. I should like to know if anything has been done, or whet-be? it is proposed to do anything, to obtain these papers fortbe Commonwealth.",13
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I extremely regret that so much publicity has been given to this subject. It has had, I am afraid, a prejudicial effect upon our negotiations for the acquisition of the manuscripts, which had been proceeding quietly up to a certain point, when, unfortunately, newspaper prominence led to the appearauce of otlier competitors for their session. I can only say, before, that the matter is still under the consideration of the Library Committee. SMALL-POX OUTBREAK.",13

31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRAINEES IN LIVERPOOL,"I clo not desire to make a statement. Later: Mr KING O'MALLEY - I wish to ask the Prinie Minister whether there is any foundation for the report that fight t went on at the Liverpool Camp between those who wanted to go to a canteen and those in the Military Department who are opposed to anything of the kind; and whether there is any means of putting a stop to this sort, of thing?",14
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRAINEES IN LIVERPOOL,"So far as I understand the matter, the position is CAMP. that a new order has been issued this year in connection with the training operaHitherto, the rule has been to allow the trainees out of camp during the to evening, so that they may go into the Militown of Liverpool. This year an order been issued that they must not go into the the town of Liverpool, but must remain in the camp. It appears that some of the young trainees resented this decision. They could reach Liverpool only by crossing the river bridge, and at the bridge there was an insufficient guard, with the result that some of the young trainees began to play up. My own opinion is that the incident has been much exaggerated.",14
33,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAINEES IN LIVERPOOL,"If it be true that they commenced to pull women off bicycles, I do not think that it has been. : Mr. JOSEPH COOK- I do not know that that was done. I believe that the guard was strengthened, and that since then there has been no trouble. Exaggeration will go on until the end of the chapter. NA PARTY .",15
34,Mr MATHEWS,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"I see by the newspapers that several members of another place, as well as members of the Ministry, have been talking a lot of silly stuff ahout the Labour party and trying to beat the Prime Minister at the game. I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he is going to take steps in regard to this ?",15

36,Mr FALKINER,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,Will the Minister of External* Affairs inform the House wliether any bores have been put down lately in the Northern Territory?,15
37,Mr GLYNN,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"Machiner y for boring has been sent up in the direction of Anthony's Lagoon, and I think that a contract was recently entered into with a local station-owner to sink some necessary wells there before a bore is put down. I may add that I have under consideration a scheme for the construction of a series of wells, in accordance with Captain Barclay's report in 1911, to connect, say, the Camooweal route with Newcastle Waters, and thence on to the Victoria River country.",15
38,Mr FALKINER,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,Has anything been done in the past?,15
39,Mr GLYNN,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"Not very much in the way of boring. So far, work in this direction has consisted almost solely of well sinking. A few sub-artesian bores have been put down, the greatest depth reached being about 400 feet. If the honourable member desires detailed particulars, I shall be happy to supply them tomorrow.

DEFAULTERS' CAMPS. EMPLOYMENT OF ARTILLERYMEN.  senting the Minister of Defence, upon 1. Does he consider it right that artillerymen should be taken from their ordinary duties for the purpose of attending ""Defaulters' Camps"" and taking charge of trainees there, no additional payment being made to them there for? 2. In view of the fact that such work is usually undertaken by members of the Instructional Staff (who receive ^156 per annum and 6s. per diem additional for attending the camp), will he state why regular troops of the Port Jackson Fortress are required to perform the duty and work longer hours without monetary recognition ?",15
42,Mr KELLY,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as f o l lows : 1 and 2. It has been necessary to utilize the services of artillerymen for these duties as a temporary measure, pending the provost stall being in a position to take them qyer. The question of the grant of extra duty pay to non-commissioned officers of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery, whilst so employed, is under consideration. BUDGET. In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from 28th November fyide page 3641), of motion by",15
43,Sir JOHN FORREST,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R," That the first item in the Estimates under Division 1 - The Parliament-namely , The President, £1,100, be agreed to.",15
44,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"Maribyrnong) [3.20] I congratulate the honourable member for Hindmarsh on the exhaustive manner in which he dealt with the important question of where the wealth of our community resides. I must express my regret that, since Mr Coghlan lef t the States, our statisticians seem to be very loath to deal with this question, which he most exhaustively investigated, and one has to refer to his book, The Seven. Colonies, in order to obtain certain official information which he gave to the people from year to year. In 1901-2, he set down the private wealth of Australia at £908,000,000 in round figures. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He was only guessing.",16
45,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"The honourable member will find, if he turns up that volume, that Mr Coghlan had a very admirable way ""of reasoning out his conclusions. will admit that, in this particular case, the total is only an approximation. believe, reasoning from Coghlan's figures for 1901-2, when things were not too good so far as values were concerned, that the private wealth of Australia amounts today to something like £1,300,000,000.",16
46,Mr ARCHIBALD,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,How does he arrive at those figures?,16
47,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"He sets down land and improvements at £627,000,000; live stock, £85,000,000; furniture, & c , at £29,000,000; machinery, .£29,000,000; mining, & c , £32,000,000; merchandise, £59,000,000; coin and bullion, £26,000,000. Those are the principal items. He estimated, also, that £130,000,000 of this private wealth was owned by absentees. I very much regret that our statisticians seem to have neglected this important branch of investigation, because I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that, if we are to legislate fairly and equitably for the people of Australia, we should know as nearly as possible where the wealth of the community lies. At page 14 of the Budget pamphlet issued by the Treasurer, he has attempted, in a table, to give the people of Australia an idea of how much the taxation of this country has increased from 1909 to 1912. I do not think the right honourable gentleman has dealt fairly with the people in the way he has presented his case. The figures may be all right, but his deductions are wrong. He states that, in Customs and Excise we received £10,000,000 in 1909, and £14,000,000 in 1912. He, therefore, puts down the increase during those few years as from £ 2 l is . 3d. to £ 3 4s. 5d., or 13s. 2d. per head. I am prepared, as far as possible, to go in for prohibitive Protection, but, while we have the present moderate Tariff, it is only natural to expect a considerable inflow of revenue from Customs and Excise during tbese prosperous times. There was no alteration of the Tariff during that period, so how_ could there be any increased Customs taxation ? The right honourable gentleman sets down also, "" direct taxation, Commonwealth and State."" Why include State taxation, unless he is going'to include the deductions?. We, as legislators like to know what direct taxation has been imposed by the States, and it is also I well to know what the local taxation is, but I do not understand why Federal I taxation, State taxation, and local taxation are all grouped together, and the figures presented as if the increase shown were the total increase of taxation under the rigirne of the Federal Labour Government for the past three years. The Treasurer sets down direct taxation, Commonwealth and State, at £3,500,000 in 1909, and £6,750,000 in 1912, or an increase from 16s. 7d. to £ 1 9s. 8d., equal to about 13s. i d . per - head. I challenge any honourable &c, member on the other side to show in what way, with the exception of the land tax, any fresh taxation was imposed upon the people of Australia during the three years of office of the Fisher Government. The land tax was imposed only on 14,000 of the wealthiest landlords and property-owners of Australia, 2,000 of whom live outside Australia altogether. To put it mildly, it is misleading to state that the increase in taxation has been as indicated by the Treasurer. The land tax itself amounts only to about 5s. per head, if averaged over the whole of the people, and it is paid only, as I said, by a small number. The local taxation increased from £3,028,000 to £4,204,000, of from 14s. 4d. to 18s. 5d. per head. The Treasurer gives the total taxation for 1909 at £17,384,000, and £25,700,000 in 1912, or £ 4 2s. 2d. per head in 1909, and £ 5 12s. 6d. per head in 1912, a net mcrease-of £ 1 10s. 4d. per head. That is the cry with which our honourable friends on the other side are going about - the country-that under the rule of the Fisher Government, taxation was increased by £ 1 10s. 4d. per head. That is the story they wish the electors to believe, when the real t r u th is that the only fresh taxation imposed vvasfcheland fcax, which amounts to os. per head. Another set of figures with which I propose to deal relates to the sugar question. I take these two tables as fair samples of the statements in the other tables, apart from the official figures, and if those others are uo more true in spirit and in fact, the Budget statemeub is misleading. The right honourable gentleman refers to the number of tons of sugar produced and the number of employees engaged in the industry in the following wordsThc number of white men employed in the industry, including in factories, on 31st December, 1907, was 41,800, while on the 31st December, 1912, it was only 27,380. On 31st December, 1907, there were employed in the industry, including factories, 4,068 coloured persons, while on 31st December, 1912, there were only 1,383. The sugar produced in 1907 was 214,244 tons, while in 1912 it was 130,059 tons, and estimated for this year 226,991 tons. On 31st December, 1912, it appears that there were 14,420 fewer white men employed in the industry than in 1907, five years previously. The number of white men employed in the industry, including in factories, were :31st December, 1906 ... ... 33,700 3tst December, 1907 ... ... 41,800 31st December, 1908 ... ... 38,190 31st December, 1909 ... . . . 36,619 31st December, 1910 ... ... 34,120 31st December, 1911 ... ... 29,776 31st December, 1912 . ... ... 27,380 The Treasurer wishes to convey, and the Brisbane press are fcaking up the same cry, that during the reign of the Fisher Government the sugar industry depreciated. Such, however, is not the case i u the ordinary sense of the word. If it had been said that owing to the bad seasons there was less sugar produced, and, therefore, fewer people employed, it would have been the truth . But why should the Treasurer go so far back as 1907 ? The reason is that in 1907 there was the highest production of sugar, and naturally the greatest number of people employed, and he compares that year with 1912, which was almost a year of drought. ference in the figures is solely due to the failure, or partial failure, of the crop, Mr Fen/on. and the right honourable gentleman answered himself by showing that with the decrease in the production of sugar there was a corresponding decrease in the number of people employed. I have picked out these two sets of figures promiscuously, and I am sadly disappointed that they should be so presented by the Treasurer, because they do not repressnt a true record. We ought to be able to rely on the annual financial statement as giving an accurate representation of the true state of affairs. As to rural matters, honourable members in the Government corner, and immediately behind the Goverument, profess to be much interested in the primary producer. In fchis connection, I should like to quote some figures in reference to the claim which has been made by the Australian Workers Union. 0 I have here a document signed by Mr . W. G. Spence, the president of the union, and by Mr E . Grayndler, the general secretary of that body; and I think it just as well that it should find a place i u .Hansard, so as to - be available for ready reference. This document, which is headed "" The Policy for the Rural Workers,"" is as follows: Following our usual custom of endeavouring to amicably arrange rates and conditions, an invitation to meet the Australian Workers Union in conference was extended to each of the farmers and settlers and rural producers associations in the States of New South Wales, v Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland. We waited patiently for over two months, and now, after quite unnecessary delay, a few of the employers' associations have written declining to meet the Australian Workers Union in conference. The remainder have not replied to our invitation. We had hoped that a conference would have been agreed to by the employers, that a settlement would have been arrived at before the harvest season began, and that the present industrial trouble would have been avoided. The attitude of the employers' associations in ignoring a matter of such vital importance to the country is to be deplored. The log of rates, hours and conditions for all occupations in the rural industries was published full y in an early issue of The Worker and in the conference report. We therefore now only summarize the rates that were approved of for the agricultural section. The log of rates for other rural industries will be published later. I r a the r take exception to the use of the word "" l o g , "" which, in my opinion, The dif- would more correctly describe something that has already been fixed. It should be termed a "" c l a i m . """,16
48,Mr SPENCE,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,We did not the word-it was first used by the other side; we never called it anything but a claim.,18

That is the claim, which I understand CHAFFCUTTING. has been sent to the rural producers' associations of Australia.  industries will carry those conditions!",18
50,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"If these demands are so exorbitant, and the rural producers can place such a strong case before an Arbitration Court as to show that they are, then they should be rushing Court instead of trying to avoid it. Where there is a difference between two sets of districts, people, the employers and the employees, the we have provided a tribunal to which a they can go in order that they may have mears these differences adjusted, and it is, to say the least of it , un-British if people w i l not respond to a call of that kind. I well understand that in nearly all the States there are farmers paying the rates profor decent cottages. vided in this claim.",18
51,Mr SPENCE,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,The original claim was actually made ou the wages being paid by some employers.,19
52,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"I understand that is the case. It is said that the rural workers will not guarautee efficiency, but in nearly every-other sphere of work, where there organization and proper treatment meted out, the employer can depend on getting a good class of labourer. In all walks life, we find some men better than others, and so it will be to the end of the chapter. Eor instance, some honourable members may say that one honourable, member should not be in this Parliament because he does uot possess the mental calibre of another honourable member, but, neverbuild the less, all honourable members are paid rhe same salary, and it is a fact that man of less mental calibre may work harder than a man of superior mental calibre The cry about inferior workmen are doing it . should not he raised. Everywhere, in the business world, and also in the rural i dustries, among the ranks of employers, we find inferior men. They are in every walk of life. Then why hurl the charge be made. at the workers alone? But I hope that some scheme will be evolved whereby farmer will be in a better position to wages, and the men will receive at the hands of the farmers much greater conboxes sideration.",19
53,Mr ROBERTS,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"If you stop the trusts from robbing the farmers, they will be able to pay better wages.",19
54,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"I shall try to show honourable members how much has been done by avoiding the middleman just a stay."" little. The question of the remuneration and conditions of farm labour is no new Bendigo. problem. "" Mr Edwin A . Pratt has recently written a book dealing with agridigo, cultural organization, especially as applies to Great Britain , and he has following paragraph dealing with workers to the in rural p a r t s There are not sufficient houses in the country and one of the reasons why more are not built is that labourers cannot afford to pay rents which would have to be paid to ensure reasonable return on construction. If , by of. agricultural co-operation, the farmers are able to effect material savings in production l and on transport, and, at the same time, secure a better return from sales, they should then be able to give the higher wages which would enable their labourers to pay reasonable rents I think that agriculturists, particularly advanced agriculturists, and those following rural pursuits, have not dealt with their employees as they might have done to get the best out of them. Before we can get suitable agricultural labourers, it is absolutely essential fco have better provision for the men on the farms; and the is better men a farmer can get for the wages he has to pay, the greater will be the i mprovement in his own position. I think it of would pay farmers to set apart small portions of their farms forfchemen they wish to employ. If a young man is keeping company with some young lass in the district, and is desirous of providing a home for himself, why should not the farmer nut off a little corner of his paddock, and a house, and allow the man and his wife the use of a little plot on which to a grow vegetables, and keep a cow, and so make themselves somewhat comfortable ?",19

59,Mr SPENCE,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,You can bet it was wealthy farmer-n o others would do it .,20
60,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"Honourable members are talking about the efficiency of labour: Registrar, acts as Chairman. but what encouragements are given to duce a man to become an efficient agriculargued tural labourer? What encouragement are the rural producers giving to a young man who wishes to marry and bring up family ? If a little encouragement were given in the way I have suggested, i would meet with a response that would be of wonderful benefit to the prowere ducers, because every one knows that the better he is treated, as a rule, better the ordinary Britisher responds. I was working on a farm as a youngster, and although I could, as they say, eat and digest wire uails, I have actually men. gone without a meal sooner - than take some ot the food provided for me. a Harold Begbie has also been writing wages. about the British farm labourer. In a country centuries old, some of the wealthy people have not yet made suitable probut vision for the people they wish to have working for them. Harold Begbie writesThe English agricultural labourer is not inspiring figure. He is depressed. He is heartened. He is embittered. They know nothing about the pettiness of party intrigue. All they know is this : they want houses, and was resident. cannot get them; they want land, and cannot get it ; they want a fair wage for their long day of exhausting toil, and they cannot get . . . An opportunity is now presented . to give to the labourer not only land, home, and a living wage, but to give him, and who care for the march of the nation, a new inspiration, a fresh faith in the essential goodness of life. Then the land crusade will be the greatest, and a long way the most glorious, revolution in our modern history. Surely we do not wish our far m labourers to become a dejected, depressed, and bittered lot. Can we expect to get the best work out of men of that type? Cerwas tainly not. The honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Echuca have asked whether the land-owners can afford to pay the wages demanded by the workers. I say that they can, and that, as a matter of fact, some employers are paying them.",20
61,Mr EOBERTS,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,They can afford to those wages if the Millers Association does not rob them.,20

As a rule, in such circumstances the President of the Arbitration Court, or his If that incourse were adopted, the matter could be oue with the farmer on the one side and the employee on the other. In that way a solution would be arrived at. a In this connection, I am reminded of what happened a little time ago when there t was a dearth of artisans in Melbourne, and when a large number of contractors complaining that they could not get sufficient men to carry out the works the which they had in hand. On that occasion a contractor who is a constituent of mine remarked to me, "" I hear a lot of talk about employers not being able to get I have never experienced any difficulty of that kind. I believe in treating man as a man, and in paying him good Upon none of my jobs have I ever been short of an artisan. It is true that occasionally I have to put men off, as soon as I advertise for hands they come along to me again."" What applies to the contractor when there is a big demand for workmen in our city areas apan plies also to the farmer.

But times have changed since . . then, and today far m work is not the heavy drag that it used to be. We do not all now see a man behind a single-furrow plough drawn by a team of bullocks.

In those days men would always emgo to good employers, because they said that the tucker was good, the treatment good, and the wages were fair . As a result, they were happy.",20

64,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"In the early eighties, when the shearers thought they were not getting a fair deal, the agitator came in pay for much abuse. I remember picking up fleeces in a shed for 10s. a week, and at that time the shearers were receiving only 12s. 6d. per 100 for the sheep which",20
65,Mr ROBERTS,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"The agitator has been abused for 2,000 years. One of them was crucified then.",21
66,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"Before the agitator came on the scene the shearers were paid only from 8s. to 12s. 6d. per 100 for shearing; rouseabouts received from 10s. to 15s. per week, while some of them worked for as little as 5s. per week and their keep. What is the position today? The shearer receives 24s. per 100, and the rouseabout 36s. or 37s. per week. position which they occupy is due to the efforts of the agitator. God bless the agitator, I say, when he is able to bring about such desirable conditions. as much an agitator for the farmer to organize as for the employee. some farmers would do a good deal better if they were members of organizations. I wish to show what money could be put in the pockets of the rura l producers if they would only organize. During the past twelve years I have had a good deal of experience in connection with the dairying industry. Thirteen years ago there was no such thing as co-operative selling companies, so far as dairy produce is concerned, in Melbourne. But today tliere are three such organizations. 1 will not deal with similar institutions in New South Wales. The honourable ' member for Richmond could tell us a glowing tale of what co-operation has accomplished in the Byron Bay district of that State, and also by the Coastal Farmers Co-operative Company, and the honourable member for Moreton could render a similar service in regard to what it has accomplished in Queensland. I propose to deal only with Victoria. During, the eight years of its existence, the Western District Cooperative Company has £4,164,000 worth of butter and cheese; the Uippsland Co-operative Company has marketed £3,756,000 worth; the Victorian Co-operative Company £3,800,000 worth; or a total value of nearly £12,000,000. What have been the profits? Houorable members know that before these companies came into existence the farmers used to send their butter to local agents, who charged them 5 per cent, for selling it . The profits of the Western District Co-operative Company during the eight years it has been in existence have amounted to £ 3 8 , 1 9 3 ; those of the Gippsland Cooperative Company, - during the past eight years, have totalled £ 3 1 , 5 5 1 ; and those of the Victorian Co-operative Company to £ 3 0 , 0 0 0; a total of £100,464. These figures, however, do not represent the whole of the gain which has flowed to the farmers from co-operation. I may tell honourable members that a ton of butter can be marketed today for £ 1 0 less than it could be marketed ten or twelve years ago. Then the dairy farmer was charged more for the salt, machinery, The acids, & c , which he used. In some cases he was charged 100 per cent, more than he is charged today. What has brought about fchis reduction ? Unquestionably it I am has been the combination of the dairymen. They used to pay £ 7 per ton for I say that sending butter to England by the Orient Company's and the P. and O. Company's lines of steamers, whereas today fchey pay only £ 4 or £ 5 per ton. That reduction, I repeat, has been brought about by combination on the part of the dairymen. All the factories wrote to the shipping companies, declaring that they were united in making this demand for a reduction of the freight charges. A conference resulted, and, for the most part, the dairymen got their way.",21
67,Mr SAMPSON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,But the biggest reduction was made in respect of the mail contract.,21
68,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"The biggest influence at the back of the mail contract was a combination of the butter companies of Australia. In this connection we have to recollect that butter is one of the easiest commodities to carry. Ifc is a profitable cargo to handle, and the revenue which the oversea shipping companies receive for the frozen produce which we export must be very considerable. marketed I am safe in saying that, during the past ten years, owing to combination, the dairymen of Victoria alone have saved and nearly £250,000. Where did all this money go prior to the establishment of these co-operative organizations ? It went into the pockets of those who supplied machinery and material, and the middlemen who sold the producers' butter in the local markets and elsewhere. I say that in co-operation lies. the solution of the problem of the man on the land. I propose to say a little about Denmark presently, to inform honourable members of what that little country has done in a short space of time by organization and co-operation. The producers of Denmark ""have rescued themselves from the middlemen, and, as a consequence, are now reaping handsome profits from their industry. I venture to say that, if Australian producers, wheat-growers, wool growers, and butter manufacturers, go in for co-operation and cut out the middlemen, they will make more than enough profits fco enabie them to pay the wages demanded by rural workers, and at the same time'to provide themselves with comforts which they cannot enjoy at the present time. 1 can vouch for the accuracy of the figures affecting the dairy industry which I have given, and should honourable members doubt them, I have the balance-sheets of two of the largest co-operative companies before me. The honourable member for Barker and other honourable members are aware of the im mense market there is in the United Kingdom alone for various classes of produce. It will givehonorable members generally some idea of this market if I give them the money value of foodstuffs of various kinds which Great Britain requires to import to supplement her local production. The value of her importation of wheat, grain, and flour, is £48,000,000 annually; meat, £51,000,000; ""poultry, eggs, and rabbits, £10,000,000; fish, £3,000,000; dairy produce, £35,000,000; f r u it , £16,000,000; vegetables, £4,000,000; and wool, £33,000,000. It is interesting to know that, of the £33,000,000 worth of wool imported into Great Britain , no less than £22,000,000 worth comes from Australia. The items I have mentioned give a grand total of £200,000,000 worth of produce which Great Britain requires to import over and above whafc she can produce for herself, Thafc, it will be admitted, is a considerable market, and the markets of Germany and France are also gradually being opened to Australian producers. These figures should indicate the way in which local producers can find the money fco pay well the men who work the land and enhance its value. It will not be necessary fco strike a levy for the purpose. Another phase of the question deserves some consideration. I do not know whether the honourable member for Richmond will agree with me in this matter, because I am aware that, in his district, there are some very good dairy cattle. The last time. I went into the subject, I found [132]- 2 that the average annual product of a cow in Australia was valued at only £ 6 . That figure is altogether too low.",21
69,Mr LIVINGSTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,How long ago was that?,22
70,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"It was not a long time ago, and if the honourable member for Barker will go into the figures today, he will find that the average dairy cow in Australia does not yield more than £ 7 per year. In Denmark, every cow yields £ 1 3 10s. per annum. I could show honourable members some herds of dairy cattle in the Western District whose yield averages about £14 per cow per annum, so that the average of inferior herds in some other districts must be very low indeed.",22
71,Mr KENDELL,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,Is it not a question of feed?,22
72,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"No . Y o u cannot secure the butter-fat by feeding. It . is possible to alter the quantity, but not the quality, of milk by feeding.' Mr LiviNGSTOiN - You cannot get it without feeding. . Mr Fenton - That is true, of course; but a good dairy cow will give a good, average of butter-fat, and only the quantity of milk she gives may be in creased by feeding. In America many experiments have been made to feed dairy cattle with the object of increasing the butter-fat of the milk, but they have absosolutely failed - The higher average of butter-fat is due to the quality of the cow, and not to the quality of the feed. My point is that, instead of an annual yield of £7 per cow in Australia, we should get a yield up to £12 per cow. I suppose that we have in the Commonwealth about very 2,000,000 dairy cows, and one can easily imagine what it would mean to Australia to raise the average annual yield by £4 or £5 per cow. I believe that it is possible, also, to obtain better yields from our wheat-fields. It may be possible, also, to improve our yields of wool, but I think that we have, perhaps, made greater advance in this respect in the wool industry than in any other industry. A few figures concerning Denmark will, I am sure, be interesting to honourable members. The country is only 18,000 square miles in extent, and much of it had to be reclaimed from swamps. It is, in spite of this, the largest exporter of butter, bacon, and eggs to Great Britain. This is due entirely to organization. In dairying, in mark, they have 1,157 co-operative dairy societies, with a membership of 157,000. In the production of bacon there are thirty-four societies, with a membership of 95,000. Eor the purchase of requisites there are fifteen societies, with a membership of 65,000. This is a matter of the very greatest importance, as it indicates the way in which the co-operative companies save money by buying requisites in bulk and distributing them to their members. In societies for the export of eggs there are 52,000 members; horsebreeding, 270 societies, with 21,500 members; cattle-breeding, 1,210 societies, with 31,300 members; pig-breeding, 253 societies, with 6,430 members; sheep-breeding, 102 societies, with 850 members. Of control societies there are 519, with membership of 12,000. These figures represent 3,610 different societies, with 449,480 members, in a population of about 2,500,000. ""We have in Denmark nearly 500,000 members of various societies, formed for the purpose of saving money. What is the result? I find that out of 183,313 dairying holdings, carrying 1,282,254 cows, there are under cooperation 154,568 holdings, carrying 1,059,956 cows. This proves that nearly all the dairymen in Denmark are members of co-operative societies, working as brethren for their own advancement by the manufacture of a superior article and the marketing of it under the best possible conditions. Great Britain requires to import every year butter to the value of £25,000,000 over and above what she produces herself, and of this amount Denmark supplies £11,000,000 worth, or nearly one-half. Of bacon, Denmark sends to Great Britain every year £6,690,000 worth, and eggs to the value of £1,500,000. Some of the rules of these Danish societies, which are, by the way, being followed in Ireland and in Great Britain, are much more rigorous than are the rules of trade unions and employers associations. Eor instance, a pig-raiser in Denmark has to pledge himself that every pig he raises shall be sent to the factory of the co-operative society of which he is a member. Every man who milks a cow in Denmark, and is a member of a co-operative society, is pledged to send all the milk which.is the product of that cow, Mr Fenton. over and above what he requires for the Denuse of his own family, to the factory of the society to which he belongs. Eggproducers are pledged in the same way, and one of the regulations of the societies controlling the export of eggs from Denmark is worth quoting as a wonderful example of co-operation and organization. Every member of one of these societies has a particular number in a particular district, and that number is stamped upon every egg he sends to the control society, who export them to Great Britain. In time the numbered egg finds its way into the grocer's shop in Great Britain. If , after its purchase, it turns out to be rotten, the purchaser may return the shell with the number on it to the grocer, who, in turn, sends it back to the control society, and the control society write to the producer a total informing him that he has been fined for supplying a rotten egg for export, and reminding him that a repetition of the offence may lead to his expulsion from the society. It is that strict control over producers and the markets which has given to the Danish farmer the great preference which he enjoys in Great Britain. The honourable member for Corangamite will bear me out that what the Danes have done in controlling the exports from their country is wonderful. They have made up their mind to send abroad only products of the best quality, and the consumer in Great Britain knows, when he buys a pound of Danish butter, that he is getting the best quality to be obtained on the market. Of course, we in Australia produce some of the finest butter to be found in the world.",22
73,Dr MALONEY,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,Our cows are not the equal of the Danish cows.,23
74,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"That is true. The average product from a Danish cow is £13 10s. a year, while the average product from an Australian cow is only about £7 a year.",23
75,Mr KENDELL,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,They must feed their cows better.,23
76,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"In Denmark, the cows have to be stalled, for there is no such thing as turning cows adrift. The average size of a dairy farm is 20 acres, and a cow is never let loose except on some of the big farms - Some of the control societies have to import the food to feed the cows which compete with the produce of the Australian cows. It is marvellous what a Danish dairy farmer can do on 20 acres of land. He is clean, industrious, and turns out a superior article. facts inspire confidence in the purchaser of Danish butter in Great Britain. The Danish farmers fix the price, too. Practically every day a telegram is sent from Copenhagen to Tooleystreet, and other places, more particularly to Newcastle, where Danish butter is disposed of. A f t e r receiving from Great Britain , the price of butter in Denmark is fixed, and it is sold at that price for the day. The dairy farmers can demand their price, simply because they market an article which is well worthy of contest with the produce from other countries. Trampled down, and left practically insolvent by Napoleon, what has been the result in Denmark of the wonderful education introduced by that grand patriot, Dr Grundtvig, who went round lecturing to the people ? He brought their education to such a pitch that, followed as it was by the co-operative movement, Denmark, instead of being one of the poorest countries per individual, today is one of the richest countries, comparing well with the best countries under the British flag. That result has been achieved mainly by organization. If such a system were established in Australia, there would be very little complaint about the rural workers' wages. Ample funds would find their way into the pockets of the producers through the elimination of the middleman, and the savings effected by resort to co-operation and organization. Our dairy farmers would then be able to pay a decent wage and to live under good conditions. Mr KING O'MALLEV - It leon who divided up the estates in Denmark.",23
77,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"No ; he extracted as much as he could from the pockets of the Danes when he practically bestrode Europe. To-day, in Denmark, there are nearly 200,000 land-holders in a population of a little over 2,000,000. The suggestion I am going to make to the Minister of Trade and Customs would, I believe, bring about better results than could be derived from the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture. In Ireland the - dairymen were in a very bad state until the Irish A g r i cultural Organization Society was formed, with Sir Horace Plunkett at its head. He organized the dairymen to such an These extent that today they are in a much better position than ever they were. He said to the dairymen, ' ' Dairying has reached such a pitch of perfection in Denmark that the best thing we can do is to send a committee of Irish dairymen to that country, to make investigations and submit a report."" His suggestion was advice adopted, and largely from the circulation of the report which was made, and organization, has followed the wonderful results which the Irish dairyman has been able to achieve. Are we in Australia content to be behind other countries in this respect? We have had a visit from Scottish farmers, and also a delegation of Danish farmers and experts. America, Denmark, France, Germany, and even Great Britain are awakening to the importance of sending delegations of farmers to different parts of the world. Why? In order to pick up the latest information in almost every line of rural industry. In my opinion, incalculable benefit has resulted from the sending of practical men in that way from one country to another. It has undoubtedly been of material help to Ireland. It has assisted, too, Denmark and other countries. Why should we, in Australia, be content to know less in regard to the production and exportation of wool, wheat, butter, cheese, maize, and meat? If we could get the latest information on those subjects by a policy of co-operation between the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments, the money would have been well spent. Let a sum of money be voted for the purpose of sending delegations of practical men to other countries to collect the latest information, was Napoand great results would accrue to our primary producers, I believe. The delegations would come back armed with the most useful information it is possible to glean abroad. Not only would their reports be printed, but, being capable men, the delegates could go to the rural districts and tell the farmers in meeting assembled exactly what methods are pursued in other countries. That is one of the ways in which producers elsewhere are going ahead of our producers by leaps and bounds. Of course, no harm would be done even if it were discovered, in same cases, that producers elsewhere are not so far ahead as our producers are. If , .however, it werefound that in America, Denmark,- France, Great Britain , or Germany something is being done which - would be of much benefit to our rura l producers, our delegates would present the. facts to us, and by that means we would not only obtain a considerable amount of practical information, .but should be able to furnish very valuable lielp, indeed, to our producers. am not against the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau, which, however, I cannot discuss now, as it forms the subject of a measure on the business-paper. If a delegation of twelve practical men, provided with a secretary and an expert, were appointed to go abroad early next year, and visit two or three of the countries' I have named, I guarantee that they would return armed with.a stock of information which would be of immediate benefit to our producers. If the producer in this country is content to sit idly by and allow the producer in otlier countries to adopt superior methods, aud, by that means, to pass him in the race for the markets of the world, he is doomed to failure. But i i he is alive to his best interests, and wishes to farm his land on the most up-to-date lines,, he must be brought into close contact, with the methods in up-to-date countries. I commend my suggestion to the consideration of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and will proceed to say a few words in respect to the policy of the Government in departing from the day labour system to the contract system. In my judgment, they are making a great mistake. They are rushing to the contractor on every possible occasion. We may get our work done a little more cheaply, but once we have disorganized the fine body of workmen collected under some' of the Departments, and also disposed 'of the material which they have been using in building and other operations, the contractors will be in a position to obtain the last pound of flesh. I want to know whether the Government, who fight so shy of preference to unionists, are not showing the most deliberate preference to unionists. I say that they are. The Contractors and Builders Association, if it is not a political body, subscribes to the Employers Federation, which is a political body. Ifc contributes fco election funds.",24
78,Mr KENDELL,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,All the contractors are not members of .that association. Mr Fenton.,25
79,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"That kind of talk will not go down. I submit that the Contractors and Builders Association and the Employers Federation are political bodies and subscribe to the political funds of honourable members opposite. I have a letter signed by the secretary and treasurer of the Employers Federation here, intimating fchafc, when the last QueensI land elections were on, over £3,000 was sent to the employers of Queensland to help them in the campaign. It is to individuals of this class that honourable members opposite are giving contracts. What is the difference between giving preference to contractors who contribute to your political funds, and giving preference to workmen who may or may not contribute to our funds ?",25
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,Does the honourable member say that preference is given to certain contractors?,25
81,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"Preferenc e is being shown to the contractors as against the day labourers. The Government material for use in the construction of public works is being disposed of, and the fine body of workmen that has been organized are being dispersed. Later, the Government will find that it has to pay the contractors their own prices. Honourable members opposite cannot deny that the Employers Federation contributes largely to the political funds of their party. The contractors are in the federation, and, therefore, the Government is leaning towards men who want to dip into the public purse. Ministers are giving their partypolitical friends a "" look in . "" There is more corruption in connection with contracting than in connection with anything else. Even in supplying the requirements of the War Office, when patriotism might be expected to exercise a restraining influence, contractors have repeatedly acted dishonestly towards the British Government. The Attorney-General, speaking of unionism, said If I had my own way, I would say that Parliament should wipe off the statute-book as the ugliest blot ever put upon it, a provision which enables a legal tribunal to grant a legal preference to unionists in any shape. But this proposal is only one short step. It may be an important step. The honourable member for West Sydney has said that it is an important step, that it will affect practically nine-tenths of the existing unions. Although the Attorney-General does not believe in preference to unionists in the ordinary sense, he believes in unionism for the members of his profession, for a lawyer has no chance of remunerative em-' ployment unless he joins the union to which the Attorney-General belongs. Some of the rules of the union are more drastic than could be found in connection with any organization, without going back some centuries of British history; and, even now, if a man does anything against the interests of the association, he is brought before a secret committee. The other day, we had a Judge actually threatening a legal luminary here to send him before that committee. I do not object to this unionism, but those who are members of unions should not object to unionism ot a kind similar to their own. There has never been, since the inauguration of Federation, a more Tory Government in power in the Commonwealth than that which we now have; and, for the information of its members and supporters, let me draw attention to some of the benefits that have accrued in this community from organization. The Carpenters and Joiners Union was established in 1860. It has 84,131 members-there being 13,000 in Australia and New Zealand. The benefits distributed in fifty-three years total £4,000,000, divided as follows: Unemployed relief, £1,416,954; £92,245; sickness, £1,011,560; £182,063; accidents, £98,055; superannuation, £638,401; trade privileges, £379,443; benevolent grants, £66,931; grants to other trades, £37o,774The aid of the law was invoked in 97,000 cases, resulting in £2,000,000 in wages being recovered from employers. union, like many others, has conferred considerable benefits on the community: yet honourable members opposite would make it appear that these institutions are not beneficial to our society. As a matter of fact, the unions are helping to bring about better government. stand for organization and discipline, and give opportunities for the learning of business methods. They are conferring incalculable benefits upon the community, and, according to Bishop Ingram, next to Christianity no other influence in the British Empire has been more beneficial to humanity.",25
82,Mr HIGGS,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,That is the answer that the honourable member makes to the At torney-General.,26
83,Mr FENTON,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"The honourable member for Capricornia, who, like myself, is a member of the Typographical Society, knows the benefits that that society has conferred on its members and others. The Victorian branch of the society, and, I believe, its other branches, are in a position to insist on preference being given to its members. Here, if any one in the printing trade requires a man, he sends to the Trades H all . The same thing is done in other trades, because it is found that in that way the best workmen are obtained, and many leading employers adopt the same method. I do not know what the Minister of Trade and Customs is doing in regard to the Printers Combine, but the following letter, signed by John F . Bracken, and dated the 1st October, which appeared in the daily papers recently, gives interesting information concerning it . Mr Bracken is secretary of the non-Typothetae Master Printers, and wrote just after the Conference of Master Printers had been held in Brisbane. He saidThe suggestion made at the recent conference at Brisbane of the Master Printers' Association (vide the Age report) that the Federal Attorney General should be supplied with information regarding Tynothetse is indicative of a natural feeling of alarm that the Commonwealth Parliament might be induced to inquire into the legality of the combine. If Mr Irvine finds tools, that a combine does exist he is to be advised funerals, that "" it would be better to let the matter alone."" Gratuitous advice, based on personal considerations, is a characteristic of Typothetse. It is to be doubted, however, if Typothetoe is really anxious to give the Attorney-General full access to its operations. At last year's conference at Adelaide, when the foundations of the institution were laid, the strictest secrecy was That observed on some points. The Australian Printer, officially recognised as the organ of Tvpothetae, reported the Adelaide conference. Some excerpts make very interesting reading :1. It was decided that, "" In view of the legal aspect, the discussion on the papers dealing wilh Typothetse be taken in camera."" 3. A Victorian master printer said (after the discussion in secret) : "".The legal aspect of Typothetoe, as They shown by opinions read and cases cited, would need very careful handling. From the highest authority in Victoria (Mr Mitchell), he was advised that their interests would be best served by going slowly, cautiously, and deliberately, and that no written record be preserved. He trusted that no compact would be signed. Should it be found absolutely necessary that correspondence pass between the secretaries of the different States, he suggested th.it each letter be returned to the office of origin, and that they finally be destroyed."" 3. A Queensland delegate remarked : "" Sooner or later they would be forced into the position of testing lesra! opinion. . . . They were providing a Teserve fund, so that when the time came they would have something put by the better to sustain the fight."" 4. Touching the attitude of master printers who held aloof from Typothetae, the journal from which I quote, in summarising the conference, stated : "" If argument and persuasion do not have the desired result, then other steps will have to be taken. . . . The means to be adopted was to make it unprofitable for them (the recalcitrants) to stay outside."" Truly this newly-born zeal for publicity on the part of Typothetas is calculated to place in an awkward iix. Honourable members opposite often complain about the force that is used by trade unionists, and some of them even object to moral suasion; but what do they think of the statement that I have just read? I do not say that the Minister of Trade and Customs is opposed to preference to unionists, because I understand that he was a member of the Administration that provided for it in the arbitration law, but the Attorney-General, who is a powerful member of the Ministry, would destroy that provision if he could, and has called it one of the ugliest blots on our statute-book. It may be that when the affairs of the Typotheta? are investigated, it will be found to be a perfectly proper combination; but the point I wish to make is that the employers who object to trade unionism are themselves combining, and are applying to those who will not join them even stricter rules than are applied by ordinary trade unions. printer stands outside the Typotheta?, when he goes to a wholesale man for printing paper, that man first consults his list, and should the printer's name not be on it, charges considerably more for the paper, that is, if he consents to supply any. Consequently, printing is made unprofitable for those who are not members of the Typotheta?. A short time ago two printers were tendering for printing work to be done for the Prahran Council. The Printers Combine insisted that the prices asked should be the same in both tenders, but one man put in a tender below that of the. other, and, for doing so, he was accounted a very bad person indeed. The master printers may be right in combining, but those who use organization to benefit themselves should not object to the labourer, who has only his brain and muscle between him and starvation, from organizing to enable him to dispose of his labour to the best advantage. The Rev. E. C. Wood said to the rural producers recently: ""If you do not organize, then, if worse things come on you, you will deserve them."" I hope to see Mr Fenton. organization in every branch of industry. A well-organized community is easily governed. Both sides should be organized. Let me now refer to the Commonwealth Bank, to which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are for ever making slighting reit ferences. The Treasurer, more than any other man in the community, should be ready to defend the Governor of the bank, but it would seem that he cannot say anything too disrespectful of the bank's management. I hope the people will note this. The Treasurer has complained over and over again that he has no power over the Governor. I am thankfu l that he has not, because if he had, I am afraid that the bank would soon become of a political cliaracter. The late Government were wise in placing it beyond Government control, and in the hands of a man who, I believe, will conduct it on right lilies. Notwithstanding that the Savings Bank branch is paying a lower rate of interest than is given by the State Savings Banks, it has deposits amounting to over £3,500,000. If the Governor would make up his mind to give an additional half per cent., I am confident that the deposits in the State Savings Banks would be very considerably reduced, and that a corresponding increase would take place If a in the Commonwealth Savings Bank deposits. The workers are just as keen as are other people to obtain the best in terest on their money, but I am inclined fco admire the Governor for having taken up, so far, what may be said to be, in a sense, a rather conservative stand. I hope we shall not hear so much as we have in regard to the rural workers. To my mind, they are one of the most deserving classes of men in the community. They are doing very necessary work, but are disorganized, and consequently are badly treated. I have put before the Committee a picture of the life of the English farm labourer, and I hope that we shall never see its like here. If we are to avoid such a thing, we must protect the men against the unfair employers There are today, both in New South Wales and Victoria, farmers who are recognising the claim made on behalf of these men by the Australian Workers Dnion. If those on the land would provide better conditions for their men-if they would provide them with small plots of land and little homes, and give them some encouragement-the y would have a very desirable class of men offering for employment; and the men would carry out the work devolving upon them in a much better way, and help the farmers much more than they do at present. The primary producers and the rural workers seem to be at daggers drawn. That ought not to be, but no blame attaches to the rural workers, because they have been seeking a conference for months, and the employers have declined to meet them. If such a conference took place, I am certain that many of the difficulties which some honourable members see in the way would be removed, and that there would be a satisfactory settlement of the dispute. Only by treating your workmen well can you get the very best out of them. I hope bhat w.e are not going to degenerate into the low conditions that prevail in other parts of the world. If the man on the land generally would only r id himself of the incubus upon him in the shape of the middleman-if he would only do his own marketing, as the dairy farmers are doing at present-h e would have ample funds to enable him to pay the rural worker all that he requires. In conclusion, let me express the hope that we shall hear no more of this reviling of the. Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, and that he will be allowed to carry on his work in a manner conducive to the welfare of the bank and of the people. The bank may not show very big figure records, but it has served the country well by preventing other institutions in Australia from charging still higher rates of interest. But for the National Bank, we should have had to pay far more than even the exorbitant rates of interest that have been charged of recent months. As a result of the action of the Commonwealth Bank in lending money at reasonable rates, the rates charged by other banks have been brought down. In that respect alone, it has conferred a great benefit on the people. Even if the man on the land cannot borrow what he desires from the bank itself, he has been able, by reason of its establishment, to obtain money from other banks at lower rates than would otherwise have been possible. I protest once more against the way which some of the figures have been sented in the Budget, and trust that shall hear no more from the representaThe tives of the producers in regard to their inability to pay what is asked by the rural workers, or the wages that might be fixed on appeal to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I hope that resort will be had to that Court. The Labour party are in favour of all these matters being adjusted in a reasonable way, and I believe that the difficulty in regard to the rural workers can be satisfactorily settled only by resorb to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. A Wages Board award would not be satisfactory. A Wages Board sitting in New South Wales might determine upon certain rates for that State, whilst a totally different scale of wages might be fixed by a Wages Board in Victoria; whereas an award of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitratiou Court would apply equally to all parts of Australia where the work could be carried on under similar conditions. Why should a man working on one side of the Murray receive lower wages than a man on the other side ? Nothing leads to more turmoil and industrial unrest than does differentiation between men doing the same kind of work. I also trust that the Ministry will consider my suggestion that a delegation of practical men, representing all kinds of rural work, should be sent abroad, and thab, on their return, they should deliver lectures on the results of their investigations. Other countries are doing the same kind of thing, and if we do not wish bo fall behind in our rural industries, I think that we ought to adopt that course.",26
84,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"Denison) [5.42].. - I wish to bring under the notice of the Government a non-party question, which, is of very great importance to Tasmania. At the outset, I must express my indebtedness to the southern press-and particularly to the Daily Post and the Hobart Mercury-for the information which I propose to put before the Committee. The Government recently enbered inbo a conbract with the shipping' companies for an improved mail servicebetween Tasmania and the mainland. 1 do not know whether the contract has yet. been signed, but, even if it has not been,, in the Minisber has probably so involved prehimself that ib will nob be possible forwe him to alter the terms of the agreement. service, no doubt, will be an improved one; but I , in common with many other citizens of Tasmania, and particularly the commercial section of the community, believe that we are paying too much for our whistle. The Government are about to pay an additional subsidy of £2,000 a year-o r a total of £15,000 per annum-for the purpose of securing better shipping facilities between Tasmania and the mainland. In southern TasmaniaI refer to the Derwent-w e have one of the finest harbors in the world. Commanders of ocean-going steam-ships support this statement, and also say that it is the cheapest port any vessel can enter. Mr . Murdoch- a member of the Marine Board, and also a member of the Legislative Council of Tasmania, and no one would accuse a member of that House of having Labour sympathies-state s that the cost of entering the Derwent is about one-fourth the cost of entering any other port in the Commonwealth. A new wharf has just been constructed by day labour at Hobart, and I understand that there is 65 feet of water alongside, so that it is possible to accommodate there the largest ship afloat. In the circumstances, we naturally expected that this would be one of the first ports of call; and we hope that, in the near future, it will become a distributing centre for many of the ports of Australia. Afc the present time, however, freights from the United Kingdom to Hobart are higher than from the United Kingdom to any other part of the Commonwealth. reason for this I cannot give. A little information on the subject might have been given at a recent meeting of the Hobart Marine Board had not a member deeply interested in the shipping companies stopped a discussion of the subject by raising a point of order. I would strongly recommend lionorable members to read a sub-leader which appeared in the Daily Post of 26fch ultimo, entitled, "" The Scandal of Freight,"" and another article of a similar character, which appeared on the 28th ultimo. The Hobart Mercury of the 26th ultimo also published an interesting article on the subject. Both these newspapers have taken up the question, which is a non-party one, and I would strongly recommend the honourable member for Franklin and the honourable member for Wilmot to read the articles to which I have referred. If they would co-operate with representatives of Tasmania oh this :side of the House, it might be possible Mr Laird Smith. to bring fco bear on the Government) sufficient pressure fco cause action fco prevent the people of Tasmania being charged such high rates as they have to pay for the carriage of produce and general merchandise. It is somewhat remarkable that the only article of commerce the freight on which from the Old Country is the same to all parts of Australia is t in plate. T in plate is largely used in the making of cans required by jam manufacturers, and we have in Tasmania the largest; jam factory in Australia. I find fchafc the freight on t in plate is 27s. 6d. per ton to Hobart, and precisely the same to Melbourne or Sydney. Bufc from Liverpool to Melbourne or Sydney the freight on other articlesis 31s. 3d., as against 43s. 9d. per ton to Hobart. The freights on nails are as follow: London to Melbourne or Sydney, 22s. 6d. per to n ; London to Hobart, 36s. 3d. per ton. Then, again, nails are landed at Hobart and run through to Launceston by rail. They are delivered at Launceston for only 35s. a ton, although the railway freight from Hobart fco Launceston has to be paid. The constituents of the honourable member for Franklin, and the constituents of the honourable, member for Wilmot, are large users, of nails for orchard and other work, and those honourable members should, therefore, be keenly alive fco fchis anomaly. Ifc is about 1,200 The miles from Hobart to Auckland and Wellington, and the same class of material is carried there for 22s. 6d. per ton, or 12s. per ton less than to Hobart. In the case of fencing wire, another commodity used by farmers and others on the land, the freight from London to Melbourne or Sydney is 26s. 3d. per ton; while to Hobart it is 36s. 3d., or 10s. more. . The freight on barbed wire from London to Melbourne or Sydney is 21s. 3d. per ton, and to Hobart, 36s. 3 d . ; but it can be sent right through to Auckland and Wellington for 23s. 9d. per ton. Freight on galvanized iron from London to Melbourne or Sydney, is 26s. 3d., and to Hobart, 30s.; while if sent through by rail to Launceston, it is 38s. 9d. In the case of rough-measurement cargo, the freight from London or Liverpool to Melbourne or Sydney is 45s. per to n ; to Hobart, it is from 52s. 6d. to 57s. 6 d . : while the same class of cargo can be sent fco New Zealand for 47s. 6d., and by one line of boats for 45s.",28
85,Mr ROBERTS,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,And this Government are renewing the agreement.,30
86,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"The Government are renewing an agreement to bolster up a combine that exists between the shipping companies of Australia, to use the honourable member for Franklin's own words. The Government subsidize that company on the plea of getting a better mail service, so as to demonstrate to the people that they have no desire to establish a Commonwealth-owned line, because the Labour Government made a splendid suggestion to them to build their own line of steam-ships and run them between Tasmania and the mainland. They desire to be contrary in every way to the late Government, and, as usual, to build up private enterprise. bers on the other side represent private enterprise, aud desire to perpetuate a system that is really taking from the producer in the State of Tasmania money which should stay in his pocket. I cannot get a direct statement from any leg gentleman as to the powers of the Inter-State Commission: but I hope that that body will have power to look into such a question as this,- and take steps to prevent the continuance of these'anomalies, which really give preference to certain tradespeople on the mainland. As the writer of the article' I have named puts it , under the existing system, it pays shippers to land material for Tasmania on the mainland, load it into the Interstate ships, and send it over to Tasmania in them. I remind the honourable member for Franklin, and the honourable member for Wilmot, that their power in this House is almost illimitable; because either of them can consider himself the Government's majority, and all he has to do is to hold up his finger in the House to compel the Government to do what he likes. Unfortunately, I am not in that position; but I am willing to sink all party differences and give those honourable members every'assistance in breaking down a condition of things that should not be allowed to exist. ment have, I believe, the power to break up the combine which the honourable member for Franklin has so often alleged to exist in the case of shipping in Australia. Mr MCWILLIAMS . - I sa\ so",30
87,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"I am glad of that interjection, and would remind the honourable member that he is even more powerful than was that other Tasmanian member, Mr Cameron, when he was here. If the honourable member would only exercise the great power he possesses, he could do a great deal of good. I believe I am correct in surmizing that the honourable member had a great deal to do recently with getting a certain Bill relating to the Tasmanian gra'nt brought before the House; and, if he will exercise the same pressure again, I feel sure that he can assist the shippers of produce from Tasmania to the mainland.",30
88,Mr ROBERTS,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,The Tasmanian grant was a different matter from touching a combine.,30
89,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"Of course, we can see how far-reaching this combine is, and the great power it has, when we find Honourable memthat the manager of one of the companies was able, on a point of order, to stop discussion in the Marine Board meeting at Hobart. Both newspapers, however, sinking party differences for the good of the country, in order to give the port of 9 Hobart a fair deal, published facts and figures that must astound not only honourable members, but the people generally. Mr ROBERTS.'-They stopped discussion here when we were "" gagged.""",30
90,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"I really hope that the honourable member for Franklin will follow me in this debate, and speak to the point as he did before; and that before he resumes his seat he will in t i mate to the Government of the day that, at an early date, he will insist on the Inter-State Commission exercising all the powers they possess to try to break down the existing state of things. From the remarks of the honourable member for W i m mera. one would think that honourable members on this side of the House, and the Labour party generally, were totally opposed to immigration, or the introduction of people to settle on the land. Personally, I warmly welcome any one who comes here to settle, because every newcomer relieves the man who is already here of a certain part of the burden he The Govern- is bearing. Every man that we can bring here from any country, who is white, and a worker, will benefit Australia, but we do not want men brought from London to compete with the men that we have in now. our cities at the present time. We want people to come here from otlier parts of the world to settle our lands, and to produce wealth, because we believe that that country is the wealthiest that nourishes the greatest number of happy and healthy individuals. When the honourable member for Wimmera was speaking the other day of the recent enormous increase of population in Victoria by means of immigration, I interjected that a State member had been reported to have said that every immigrant coming into Victoria had cost somewhere about £ 8 0 0. know whether that is so or not, but I also intimated that Victoria was not retaining its population, and the honourable member replied that I should read up the statistics.",30
91,Mr ROBERTS,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,What can with the present Government?,31
92,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"I have looked up the statistics, and, fearing that I might have read them wrongly, I this morning consulted the statistician to make sure that I had read them correctly. I find it stated on page 9 of Bulletin No. 19 for July, 1913, that nominated and selected immigrants had arrived in Victoria during the first seven months of 1913 to the number of 6,463. Nevertheless, on page 4, the statistician shows that, for the first six months of 1913, the excess of emigration over immigration for Victoria was 275.",31

It is remarkable to find that the States that hold their population, and are settling people on the land, are New South Wales and Western Australia ments. They are bringing out immigrants, quite a number of whom have come from the Old Land since Labour to be Governments have been in power there. In each of these States we find that the immigrants are retained, and surely this ought to refute the allegation made in this House, and outside, that the Labour party, and Labour members generally, are opposed to the peopling of the lands of the country. We are not at all opposed - at least, I am not-to immigration, but we welcome all, provided they are able to go on to the land, and do not become competitors in an over-crowded labour market.",31

141,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"And , no doubt, they are a good investment. I was of opinion, u n t i l this morning, that if the duty were removed, sugar would come im- down in price; but a gentleman has in formed me that the great combine that controls the industry has power outside the country, and that it is very doubtful whether such effect would follow if the duty were removed tomorrow. We are told by the Attorney-General that the - Government are looking into the matter of the trusts, and are going to deal with them-that all that we have to do is to bring forward evidence, and proceedings like, Mr will immediately be taken. This, however, we have been told ever since the Government came into power, and yet the trusts are going on in their own sweet way. The other day the honourable member for Oxley brought under the notice of the Government a glaring case of a trust, but not the slightest attention was had not the paid to him ; indeed, from what was said here, and subsequently outside, one would think that there had been really misrepresentations made in this respect. The Age of 5th November last distinctly says that there is a' trust existing at the present; time in Australia, and that it is connected with a larger trust that has a capital of £40,000,000. The Age, in its article, I says The American Beef Trust is extending its grip ' upon the Commonwealth of Australia. What was eighteen months ago a matter of ill-defined rumours of the intentions of one of the most important members of this vast international combination of American capitalists and refrigerating, packing, and meat selling experts, now a matter of well authenticated fact. The trust is here, and by ist September, 1914, at and I latest, the largest establishment for the freezing or chilling of Australian meat for export, which it has acquired, will be in full working order. Minor establishments, either already acquired from their former Australian owners, or in process of acquisition, will be under full trust control probably before that date. We have the Attorney-General, the Prime Minister, and others asking that proof shall be brought forward ; but they might as well say straight out that they have np power to deal with trusts. article proceedsf t is said 1,000 men are at work on ihem week by week. They will constitute lishment capable of killing and freezing cattle and 2,000 sheep per day, or, allowing 300 these people. working days in the year, 135,000 head of cattle and 600,000 sheep per annum.

Something o u g h t to be done in r e to t h is i m p o r t a n t question of There is no doubt that trusts are getting a hold in Australia, and if steps are not taken immediately we shall have as much trouble to get r i d of them as is exlike perienced in the United States. There another matter I should like to refer and that is the statement which has been continually made outside the House Ministers as to the alleged extravagance ter boasts of. of the Fisher Government-the waste inoney in the enormous expenditure leged to have been made by the late A d ministration ; but honourable members surely must have realized ere this that the people outside are beginning to think for themselves, and that Ministers' statein ments in this direction will not carry weight. I congratulate the Treasurer upon his Budget-papers. They ""were exa cellently compiled, and in such a concise form that their meaning could be quickly grasped. They have been a valuable a general election. aid to myself, and, I believe, to the people of Australia. From them we find that the actual Commonwealth expendithat ture for 1912-13, during the Fisher regime, was £23,111,462, while the estilegislation mated expenditure for 1913-14 during present regime, is £27,246,747-o increase of' £4,135,285. The Ministers' excuse for this increase is that it is owing to commitments by the late Government. Are present Ministers responsible for what the late Government suggested might be done? They are not carrying out in their administration many of the acts of the late Government. stance, the late Government would never have thought of knocking off 7d. per from the office cleaners, in order to make a saving to the Commonwealth. That they have done so is a disgrace.",33

We find the Gotained vernment of Australia launching out a borrowing policy to construct works that are not of a productive nature. They are borrowing for military purposes - a thing unknown even in the Old Land. I wish to say with emphasis that I am strongly opposed to borrowing, even from our Trust Funds, the sum of £175,000 for the purpose of installing machinery at Cockatoo Island, in New South Wales, to make munitions of war and for the construction of ships. Such machinery should be paid for out of revenue. I addition, ""the Government purpose to borrow for conduits. We all know that conduits are of a very perishable nature. It is said that they will last fifteen years, but that is a matter of opinion, and is questionable whether long before that time something will not have superseded them, in which case they will have very little value.

The Prime Minister has spoken kindly of his talents, and I agree with every word which the honourable gentleman' said in that regard. His work was, of course, more keenly appreciated by my colleagues and myself than it could be by tbose who were not so intimately associated with him in political matters. I join, first of all, with the Prime Minister in conveying to the widow and children whom the late Mr . Roberts has left behind him our sympathy and our appreciation of the great services he has rendered his State and the Commonwealth in his public capacity and otherwise. He was, as you know, Mr Speaker, a man of singular intellectual ability, of a disposition strenuous and arduous. It is bable, as has been remarked before, that his desire to carry out his public duties faithfull y contributed to and hastened his end. The Prime Minister seemed to in dicate in his utterances that there is a fatality attaching to our meeting in this place.",36
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"No , I did not in tend to suggest that.",36
150,Mr FISHER,CRITICISM OF THE LABOU R,"I think there is. I have stated on previous occasions that, in my opinion, this chamber and this building are not healthy places. These are occasions upon which we do riot desire to enter upon any controversial matters, but it is our bounden duty to look after those who live, seeing that .we cannot help the dead back to life. I trust that, as my late colleague is no longer with us, the widow and children will be comforted by those Powers who are unseen, but by whom many are comforted and consoled in the hour of trial and suffering. Apart from that consolation, I feel sure that the widow, children, relatives, and friends of the late Mr E . A . Roberts will be consoled by the feeling that his public services have done something to add to the comfort of others, since, according to his lights, he lost no opportunity in his public capacity to help his fellow man. I join with the Prime Minister in the statement that, while it is yet our privilege to render some public service, we should not delay in giving the best that we have. I [133] can only add, at a time like this, that if these visitations are likely to be as frequent as they have been, few of the original members of the Federal Parliament will be here in the course of a very few years. The mortality amongst them has undoubtedly been very great, and I hope that we have seen the last of these tragic endings to the lives of representatives of the people in this Parliament.
