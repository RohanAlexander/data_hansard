2,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister if he will have steps taken for the investigation of a statement which has been published in the American press to the effect that 1,800 bales of wool are stored in Australia oh account of Germany ? It is necessary for me to give to the Minister some explanation of the question.",20
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member wish to make a long statement?,20
4,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"No . It appears that, in 1915, Germany sought to have arrangements made for the clothing of 5,000,000 of her. soldiers, and that this was being done. through an American company, of whose 36,000 shares 29,095 were said to he held by citizens of the United States of America. The firm obtained admission to the American Textile Alliance upon an affidavit to that effect, hut subsequently the Alliance charged it with conspiracy, and a case has heen brought for trial in the Courts of the country. It has transpired in the course of the trial that the agents of the company in various countries were these",20
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,As the honorablo member is making rather a lengthy statement it will be necessary for him to obtain the leave of the House.,20
6,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I do not object to leave being given, but I suggest' a more proper course. If the honourable member will furnish me with the necessary particulars, I shall undertake to have the matter examined at once.. Later:",20
7,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I understand that the Acting Prime Minister has no objection to my continuing the statement, and that his suggestion was made under the impression that I would have an opportunity of dealing with the matter later.",20
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member may continue only with the leave of the House. - Mr SINCLAIR -'This is grievance day. The motion to go into Committee of Supply will give the honourable member the opportunity to say what he wishes Mr JH CATTS,- I am unable to wait for that opportunity; I have to go away. . ' Leave granted.",20
9,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The agents of the company are these:'.1. 'Deutsche 'Bank, in Berlin, and its representative in America, Mr. MoClement. 2. Herr Trade Councillor Stoehr, Leipzig3. Botany Worsted Mills, Passaie, N.J. 4. Gustave E. Claussen, associated with Alfred Everett, .South African wool buyer, East London, South Africa. 5. Mr Helmarth, wool dealer, as agent of Ernsthauscn Inc.; of Calcutta, for Jute. Firm 'later re-named the East India Export Oompany. 6. George Stoehr, a German army officer, who obtained leave and visited the United States .and probably Australia. According to the New York Times, on the 17th March, 1918, in explanation of the letter, which I shall later readMr Forstmann, whose firm it waa shown at Friday's hearing, shipped hundreds of. thousands of dollars' worth of wool into Germany, said that "" All of our mail in those days was being intercepted,"" and that he was for that reason "" anxious to tfu&rd against any business interrupted."" Mr Forstmann' admitted that the Forstmann-Huffman Company has more than 1,800 bales of wool stored in Australia, but said none of it was intended for German consumption. The letter to which he referred was as follows:(Deutsche Rank, per illegible signature to Without referring to our ordinary correspondence, I should like to tell you t»-<lny that I had several visits from Herr Trade Councillor Stcehr, who has been here for more than two «i:cks. As appears .'roin the several conversations with hun, lie seems to have learned of the wool transactions which you have effected both for Forstmann and Huffman, and for the friends of these gentlemen in Cape and Australian wools, and he did everything he could to induce me to take part for the bank in wool for his own account, to the extent of about ten to twenty million marks, or to participate in a syndicate to be formed for this purpose. Naturally I listened to his proposals witli the greatest attention, but I told him at once that we would not like to give up the impartial position which we had hitherto taken with reference to the rest of our customers, this position being evidenced by the fact that we limit ourselves to the financing of such transactions. Meanwhile, he Beems to have succeeded as a result of influence exerted by him in the proper quarters in getting orders, or, at least, prospective orders, of considerable size for governmental authorities, and with this in view he has arranged that his son Hans, who is at the time at the Front, shall be granted leave to be able to go to America for the proper execution of these transactions intrusted to ,, him. This young Mr Stoehr was here a few days ago in oompany with his father. . . . Young Mr Stoehr is now to try to purchase suitable quantities of Cape and also, Australian wool over there in order to ship' them here later at' a suitable time, as American domestic wool, with the manufacture and preparation necessary for the purpose. Apparently there has been a conspiracy to ship wool to Germany. The statement was made in the United States Law Courts that a German army officer, obtaining leave from the German army, visited the United States, and it is suggested .that lie also visited Australia, and bought wool here, and that now 1,800 bales is stored in Australia on account of a German firm which was endeavouring to' arrange for the clothing of 5,000,000 German soldiers.",20
10,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,He cannot get the wool to Germany now. Ho was hoping . to send it there via America.,21
11,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"But if there are 1,800 bales of wool stored-in the Commonwealth on account of a German firm it ought to be released at once to enable Australian women to get wool for the purpose of knitting socks for soldiers.",21
12,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,But wool.,21
13,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Then we should endeavour to have it treated in such a - 30th January. 1915. way that it can be used. I have no doubt that the matter having been brought Schmidt.) under his notice, the Acting Prime M in ister will take steps to have it thoroughly sifted in order to discover if there is any wool stored in Australia on behalf of a German firm.",21
14,Mr WATT,Unknown,I shall do so without de lay. OORNSACKS AND WOOLPACKS.,21
15,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Has the Honorary Minister (Mr Greene) seen the report of Major Purcell's remarks concerning the purchase of cornsacks and woolpacks by the Commonwealth ?,21
16,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I have seen his statement. I ' have noticed, too, that Major Purcell has said that the British Government has purchased the whole of our wheat crop for three years. If his in formation on the jute question is as inaccurate as his statement on ,the wheat question, we cannot pay much attention to what he says on the subject. SHIPPING BOARD. Mr MCWILLIAMS ' - Some weeks ago, I asked if it is the intention of the Government to take steps to give representation on the Shipping Board to traders and the - public. The Minister for the Navy promised to bring the matter under the notice of the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, I have had to absent myself from the sittings of the House for some time, and I therefore now ask the Minister controlling the Shipping Board if steps have been taken to deal with the matter.  the consideration of the Acting Prime Minister. So decision has yet been arrived at. CORNSACKS.",21
17,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Will the Government take .the widest steps possible to demonstrate to the farmers in the country the great disparity in values between the Argentine sack and the Australian cornsack, the. Argentine sack being in reality this is raw a bran bag, and altogether unsuitable for wheat?",21
18,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I shall be pleased bring the matter under the notice of Minister in charge of the Wheat Pool (-Senator Russell), and ask him to advise the - wheat-growers that the Argentine sack is altogether unsuitable for Austrahands lian purposes. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). LITHGOW SMALL ABMS FACTORY: UNEM PLOYED MUNITION WORKERS.",22
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received from the honourable member for Macgamated quarie (Mr Nicholls) a letter intimating that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the condicently tion of affairs existing in the Small Factory at Lithgow, and the general con-, Factory for over six years. dition of the members of the Small Arms Factory and munition workers of Ausof tralia."" Five honourable, members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",22
20,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"Macquarie) [2\46]. - I have made previous endeavours to have the men who were dismissed from the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow resaid at the Conferenceinstated, and other honourable members on this side also have worked energeticwere ally to that end, but the position today is as it was four or five weeks ago. would be no exaggeration to say that beconscription tween 600 and 700 men are unemployed statement through no fault of their own. Had those Show men struck, or done something else to incur the displeasure of the management, regard the present situation might be more easily where understood ; but when a large number of men have been compelled to leave work should through no fault of their own, it is or strange that the Defence Department pared to accept that. - should take no action to have them instated. The reason given for not rewere engaging these men was that three of the six barrel-setters had ceased work mediately those three men left the Facreport, tory on a Priday their unions were sulted, and they ordered them to work. On Monday the barrel-setters presented themselves for re-employment, but were told by the management that ployment. they were not required. A little time later the union decided not to take tion isup the case of those men, and, as to a result, two other men were asked the by the management to return to the Factory and take up the work of the dismissed barrel-setters, on the promise that immediately that was done all who were out of employment would he re-engaged. That was a fortnight ago, but between 600 and 700 men are still idle. I do not know whether the Defence Department intends to permit those men to roam the streets and starve or to reemploy them. I have letters from the secretaries of the Lithgow Small Arms Factory Employees Union and the AmalAustralian Society of Engineers, asking that the fullest inquiry be made into their case. The management of the Factory has engaged men who only rewent to Lithgow' in the place of Arms former employees who had worked at the At the recent Recruiting Conference the matter economic conscription was discussed. I propose to make one or two references to the report of the Conference proceedings, with the object of showing to what extent the incidents happening at the Small Arms Factory at the present moment are in conformity with the decisions arrived at by the Conference. I find that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) I come now to Mr Tudor's proposals as they presented to the Conference. His first proposition reads, "" That there should be a deI t finite pronouncement by the Government that has been finally abandoned."" Upon that point we are of the opinion that the which I made at the Agricultural luncheon, Sydney, is sufficiently clear, explicit, and unambiguous. If members do not it in that light I ask them to say exactly it falls short, and I shall endeavour to meet their objections. The second proposal put forward by Mr Tudor was ""That there be no economic conscription in public private employ."" The Government arc prereThe Government and the Conference prepared to agree that there should be no economic conscription in public or Imprivate employment. Purther on in the proposals made by the Leader of conthe Opposition are set out, and among return to them is' the following:Proposal No. 2. That there should be no economic conscription in public or private emThe Government's reply to that proposiAccept. "" Public employment"" includes employment at the Small Arms Factory or any otber munition works in Australia. But in the 'Small Arms Factory today a system of economic conscription is in operation. If that were not so, why should married men, with five or six children dependent upon them, be thrown out of employment for ten weeks, and have to walk the streets in fruitless search of work. If that is not economic conscription, I do not know what is. I have here a letter from the Secretary of the Amalgamated 'Society of Engineers at Lithgow, dealing with various phases of this question. In this letter he states ment for three years. that the management promised the men that immediately the two barrel-settersthe Messrs. Overton-wen t back to work the whole of the men would be ployed. The two barrel-setters have been back for practically two weeks, but there is no move on the part of the Defence Department to take back one of these men.",22
21,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,What reason does the Department give for its attitude?,23
22,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"The .chief reason that they do not intend to employ any one eligible for active service. It would that they intend to economically conscript even married men, with families of five families to maintain. and six children to support. The secreniember tary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers also states thatThere is one more glaring you to have and that is S. Sanders, late secretary to P.L.L. here. Sanders was sent for be. three days after the trouble commenced, and worked about three weeks. The manager then told him that he would have to go was going to put a returned man on the job.. H a d he been a single man, I do not pose the action of the Department would have been questioned, but it is set out this letter that Sanders explained that was a married man, and a reject, and that he had only two brothers, both of whom were at the Front. Those facts, parently, carried no weight with the partment. The management decided dispense with the services of this man because he was an active member of the local branch of the Political Labour League, and took an active part in anti-conscription campaign, as well as politics generally. That is why he was not permitted to return to work.",23
23,Mr HECTO BLAMOND,Unknown,It cannot be both economic conscription and victim ization.,23
24,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"It can be. In this letter the names of two other workmen are mentioned. One is a married man, who had been in the employ of the Defence Department for' six years. He has six children, and is in poor circumstances. When he applied for re-employment, he was told there was no work for him ; yet a new arrival in the town was permitted to take up his job. The thir d case is that of a man with three children, who had been, in the employ - of the DepartWhen he asked for re-employment at the Factory he was told there was none for him. H is position has been filled by a man who but rere-emcently arrived in the town. Mr HECTO B LAMOND - Were these two recent arrivals returned soldiers?",23
25,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"I do not know. The position I take up is that, war or no war, a civilian with a wife and family to support must have his interests safeguarded just as the interests of a returned soldier is must be looked after. The Department itself should make provision for our reseem turned soldiers without dumping them into the jobs of other men who have large If the honourable for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) thinks otherwise,' then the Small Arms Factory will not be in existence at L it h case I would like gow much longer.",23
26,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,I hope it will,23
27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,We shall have off as he it at Canberra before long.,23
28,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"That is not likely. supI f the Government desire that the Small Arms Factory shall be conducted as a in factory ought to be, then they should give he the employees reasonable conditions, and see that they are not unduly harassed., The Treasurer recently made an earnest apappeal to every Australian to contribute Deas much as possible to the war loan. As to the result of that appeal many of these men who have been walking the streets of Lithgow for ten weeks put practically the whole of their savings into the war loan the before they lost their employment. Toi n day they are at the mercy of those who see fit to look after their wants. Is it fair that the Government should take the contributions of these men to the war and then prevent their re-employment in could not go to Lithgow. the Factory, particularly when, as i many cases, they have large families to support? All sorts of misleading misrecertain presentations were made by the Defence Department and by the Manager of the Factory in regard to the re-employment of these men, with the result that they were led to believe that they would be put on once more. .About five weeks ago the men. approached the management, .and also the Department, for a list of those who were not to be re-employed. list was not forthcoming u n t i l two three days ago, when it was handed to the secretary to the local union. U p to time every man who had been victimized was .living in hope of his re-employment, but they now find, after walking the it . streets for ten weeks, that they are not required by the Defence Department.",23
29,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,And yet the Govern the ment say there shall be no victimization^,24
30,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"Q u it e so. On 27th A p r i l last there were 950 Small Arms Factory men out of work. A tively small section was employed in industry, despite the fact that rifles then were just as essential to the winning of the war as they were twelve months ago. As a matter of fact, a supply of rifles is more essential today than ever. B u the Government do not, seem' to have given any consideration to that point. is a very debatable question whether output of rifles today is as large as was twelve months ago. I tried yesterday to get into touch with the Minister for Defence Pearce), but was unable to do so. I was referred to his Chief Clerk, and from Chief Clerk to another officer, but neither could give me the information I desired. This morning I again endeavoured to get into communication with the Miuister Defence, so that it might not be necessary for me to submit this motion, but I was unable to do so. I was referred again the Chief Clerk - Whether he is an authority as to the conditions existing the Small Arms Factory or not I do not know. I telegraphed to the Minister when the trouble commenced and asked him visit Lithgow and interview the men, he replied that he could not spare the time. When I found that the trouble was spreading I again sent him an urgent loan telegram, but again he replied that he I received no n reply to a third telegram which I sent. Apparently the Minister treated it with a amount of contempt. The people for whom I am speaking are not of that class of disloyalists or members of the Industrial Workers of the World who are so much spoken about; they are reputable citizens, and they are entitled to the most serious consideration from the Government. It is a very fine thing for those who are in receipt of Ministerial salaries to sit down and enjoy the luxuries of life The while poor workmen are compelled or to«» tramp the streets of the country in search of work, because they happen to be that unemployed through having, fallen in with the suggestion made by one or two individuals. That is the position as I see A considerable time ago I approached Treasurer (Mr W at t ) , thinking possibly that he might be able to assist in the matter, but no result was forthcoming. Everything that it has been possible to do has been done in order to get the men comparaback to work, but the Government have the simply sat down and allowed the management of the Factory and the Minister for Defence to treat the men in a most in humane manner. The Minister received a deputation from Lithgow in connection t with the dispute, but, as he decided that it should be conducted under the proviI t sions of the War Precautions Act, no one the knows what happened; no one has been it given the opportunity to probe into the pros and cons of the conference between the Minister and the deputation, and no one knows exactly what offer or what sug(Senator gestions the Minister made. Recently the men have had to consider their finanthe cial position. They find that they cannot possibly hold out any longer unless - the Government gives them the assurance that they will be permitted to return to of work. A great number of the men have invested all their spare capital in the war loans. It does not seem to be the correct to attitude for the Government to take up to sit idly by and to permit decent, reat spectable citizens to go. about practically in a state of starvation. It is riot the way to get recruits. These men are in comto munication with others throughout the but State of New South Wales, and put their grievances before them in no unmistakable manner. I want an assurance from the Minister representing the Minister for Defence that he will, within the next day or two, give serious consideration to the position of the men, and give them employment as soon as it is available for them. If he cannot employ the single meu, let him give some work to the married man who have families, or, if there - is no work available, let him compensate the men in some form. stand that those employees whose services are to be dispensed with have received notice from the management of the Factory that there are to be given a week's pay in lieu of a week's notice. After these men have been starving for ten weeks, a week's pay does not seem to be a very adequate manner of compensating them. . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The ment should find work for the men.",24
31,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"The Government will have to do something for them. The men are not going to lie down in the streets and die from * starvation. The Minister fo©Defence knows perfectly well how dimcult it is for any man to get employment at the present time, aud how difficult it is for men who have been out of work for ten weeks, and have families dependent on them, to travel through the country in search of employment.",25
32,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,What reason was given for putting these men off ?,25
33,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"Thre e barrel-setters ceased work because thejr, wanted better conditions and higher pay, and it necessarily followed that a certain section of the men employed in the Factory automatically went off, because there was no work for them. It was said at first that six barrel-setters were required to keep the work of the Factory going. W it h three of those men not working, it meant that half of the hands could not be employed. Later on, however, it >was discovered that three barrel-setterscould do all the work required. These three men are earning approximately £25 each per week. The manager told the men that when the complement of barrel-setters returned to work the whole of the men would be re-employed, but when the men went back to the Factory seeking re-employment they were told that they were no longer required. That is why a large number of these men are not working. The other day the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) askedHas the Minister issued any order requesting his officials in the various Departments under his control to draw up lists of men who are of eligible military age? The reply wasYes. This was done at the request of the State Recruiting Committee. . If the State Recruiting Committee is to be permitted to go into the various industrial establishments of the Commonwealth and I under- compel the management of any particular establishment to draw up a list of eligibles and give notice to every man whose name is on that list, we shall have economic conscription in force. That is what is* happening in the iSrnall Arms Factory. The Minister for Defence states quite openly that he will not employ a single man of military age. Furthermore, he is preventing men who are not of military age, who Governhave reject certificates, and have familiesdependent upon them, from securing employment.",25
34,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,.What has become of the pledges given by the Government at the Governor General's Recruiting Conference ?,25
35,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"^ T he pledge given at that Conference was something similar to the pledge given to the people after the first conscription, referendum, and is being treated in exactly the same way. It is easy for the Government to say that they will not introduce conscription, when the very next day they ask employers to do it for them.' That is exactly what is happening at the Small Arms Factory.  Mr NTCHOLLS . ^ I haye already stated how the men left their work, and how, after the unions had held meetings on the Saturday morning and on the Sunday, they were instructed to return to work. On the Monday morning they presented themselves at the 'office, but the management would not employ them, despite the fact that rifles were required. This resulted in the whole of the other men being thrown idle.  Government, were the original cause of the trouble.",25
36,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"Thos e men, who are said to be the original cause of the trouble, were put outside the gates by their respective unions, and allowed to find employment elsewhere, but the other thousand men are now paying the penalty of starvation. '  elsewhere ?",25
37,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,If the honourable member were thrown out of employment tomorrow morning-and there is a great possibility of that occurring in the near future-o n what occupation would he concentrate his attention?  twenty-four hours.,26
38,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"I know the sort of fix in which a great number of honourable members would find themselves under the circumstances, especially if they were absolutely without money, and obliged to travel a number of miles to find work.  Government could take these men to where there is work for them.",26
39,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,Would the honourable member assure me that the New South Wales Government will find employment for 650 men?  Government could put them in the way of getting work. *,26
40,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"Thes e men are accustomed to a particular class of indoor work, and it cannot be supposed that they could take up outside work of quite another kind.  than starve. Mr NICHOLLS;- A man accustomed to the lathe cannot readily take up the pick and shovel, though, of course, some might be able to do so. The Government's desire, in the case of this factory, is to make every eligible man, whether married or single, fight against his will. A system of economic starvation is being introduced, under which the men, whether they have families or not, will have to enlist.  this country.",26
41,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,I could cite scores and scores of cases of direct starvation owing to men being thrown out of employment by unscrupulous employers.,26
42,Mr CHAHLTON,Unknown,How many men are there employed at the factory now ?,26
43,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,I should say there are 600 or 700.',26
44,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,How many of those were previously employed at the factory?,26
45,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"Quite a number, though I cannot give the exact figure. Mr SPEAKER,-The honourable member's time has expired.",26
46,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Gippsland-Honorar y Minister) [3.15] - This trouble has been going ori before I entered the Department, and I was not personally acquainted with all the details. After the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls) gave me notice, about 12 o'clock today, that be intended to move the adjournment of the House, I obtained the following statement from the Department-jThere has been a considerable amount of trouble at Lithgow in connection wit h the barrel-setters, whose business is to straighten barrels after they have been, machined. This is an operation which requires some expertness of eye, and so far no machine has been devised which, can effectively do the work. It takes some little time to learn, and has always been regarded as more or less of a trade secret. Previous difficulties wit h these men have been in regard to wages. Exorbitant rates have been demanded, and were resisted for a time, but ultimately the Department had to give way, so that the output of rifles would not be disturbed. To overcome the difficulty, arrangements wore made with the High Commissioner whereby eight (8) unfit members 'of the Australian Imperial Force were sent to Enfield for training in barrel-setting. Four of these men have since arrived in Australia. .Contrary to expectations, these returned soldiers, instead of supporting the Department in its difficulties, immediately took sides with the malcontents at Lithgow, and even demanded higher wages than the .original men thought of. At one time their demand was for wages of £12 12s. per week. Of the four- (4) returned soldiers, one has since been discharged for insubordination and neglect of duty. He was tolerated as long as possible, .but, as stated, was at last dismissed. One, after his return to Australia, asked permission to return to his private business. This was granted, as, at that time, the factory was f u l ly staffed with barrel-setters,, and, in fact, there were one or two surplus to requirements. This man gave an undertaking that he would be available if his services were required in case of emergency. He has since been sent for, but has not yet reported whether he will fulfil his undertaking. Of the two men remaining, one has remained loyal, and is at present working at the factory, and the other is on strike. The other four men of those originally trained were allowed to remain in England at the express wish of the Ministry of Munitions, the idea being that, as the men's demands had been conceded here, these men would not be required for the moment; and they would probably become all the more efficient when the time came for them to return to Australia. As a precautionary measure, steps have been taken for twenty more to be trained in this barrelsetting, but their services will not be available for some time yet. The immediate trouble at Lithgow is that four of the six men now employed there object to the Department inspecting their work. It is the principle in all military manufactures that work should be inspected and passed by independent inspectors. In most cases these are not responsible to the manager, but directly to the military authorities in Melbourne. This is the case at Lithgow; the military authorities have their inspectors there, and a ll work at certain stages is submitted to them for examination and acceptance. These men, for ' some reason or another-probabl y because their work was being paid for according to the numbers of barrels passed by the inspectors-objecte d to this inspection. Apparently they claimed the right themselves to determine whether their work was accurate or otherwise. Obviously this could not be tolerated. Four of the men left work without notice, leaving two to carry on, one being returned soldier Frith, and the other A. Overton, father of two of those who have struck work. Overton is a most skilful barrel-setter, and if he remains loyal there is little doubt that he Will be able to teach others to do the work. some months, however, before they become any way expert. Overton and Frith , the loyal returned soldier, should be able to cope with a fair amount of work, and if the other returned soldier who is now being taught, together with a fourth man who was employed on this work at Lithgow, but has since left, can be traced, the Department should soon be able to overcome the difficulty. A further satisfactory feature is that Mr Bors, who specially studied this matter of barrel-setting during ""his visit to England, is en route to Australia. When he arrives, there is no doubt his services wilF be available. When the manager, Mr MCKay, reported that these men had left work, he stated that he proposed to discharge them and make an effort to overcome the difficulty. He stated that it would be necessary to lay off a considerable number of men for the time being, the reason being that, as the factory is balanced in every part, any disruption' of one process, especially such a one as this, the only one in the factory which depends on skill of individuals, involves the remainder. Some of the men could be continued in work, but sooner or later they would have to be laid off to await the time when the barrels would catch up. It is better, tlierefore, to stop the whole of the manufacturing section until the difficulty can be overcome. This is what is being done. There is no dispute with the great majority of the employees, and as soon as barrels are forthcoming, they will be taken on again. It is probablethat opportunity will be taken now to abolish the night shift and give effect tb the Prime Minister's announcement that preference of employment would be given to returned soldiers in the Government establishments. There is a considerable number of eligibles employed at the Small Arms Factory, and while it has been difficult to obtain returned soldiers to take their places, it is considered that by the abolition of the double - shift a considerable number of them can be disposed of. The reason for the abolition of the double shift is that only 260 men are employed at night now, and Mr Wise. whether or not they ,are engaged does not have much effect on the output of rifles. Over 1,000 men are employed on the day shift, and these, together with the new machinery which has now been installed, will , it is anticipated by Mr MCKay, keep up the output which has been attained within recent months, namely, 900 rifles per week. This second shift at present is more or less an expense to the factory, and as' the supplies of rifles in Australia are ample, there does not seem to be any good purpose served by its maintenance. The supply 'of rifles at present is nearly as great as it was when war broke out. The manager has been asked for a report as to the position at the moment. It is proposed, however, to leave the matter in his hands. It is greatly to be regretted that the honourable member bas attempted to read into what bas occurred the introduction of economic conscription.",26
47,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,It is most improper. It will take,27
48,Mr WISE,Unknown,It is. No attempt has been made to introduce economic conscription.,27

50,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [3.23] - Some may say that they are surprised that this debate should arise so soon after the Conference that was called by the Governor General, but I am not a bit surprised. At the time, the Labour movement thought that the Conference would be useless. My respected Leader said that he would attend it, and he was told that he would be a fool for his pains. The political section of the Labour movement in Victoria sent a representative, an ex-member of this House, but the industrial sections of all the States refused to be represented, saying that it would he useless, because economic conscription would continue, as in the past, and it looks now as though they were right. An attempt is being made, to apply economic conscription, not only at the Small Arms Pactory at Lithgow, but to all the munition workers in Australia. Yesterday, I asked the Minister this questionHas the Minister issued an order requesting the head officials in the various Departments under his control to draw up a list'of men who are of the eligible military age? The reply was "" Yes, this was done at the request of the State Recruiting Committee."" I also askedI f so- (a) Is it the intention of the Min ister to dismiss from the Defence Department the men whose names appear on such listst (ft) _ Will he obtain particulars as to the family responsibilities in each caset To that, the reply was givenNo special action is contemplated other the recently announced policy in regard ployment of eligibles in Government Departthe ments, and also to give the State Eecruiting Committee an opportunity of canvassing eligibles for recruits for the Australian perial Force. The Minister does not say whether he will ascertain in each case what the family responsibilities are. The Conference called by the Governor General was in tended to clear the air, so that more cruits might be obtained under the volunattend tary system. I-have said, both here and outside, that, had it not been for foolish interference with /. voluntarism which took place, there would have been no need to try conscription. Now an tempt is being made at economic conscripnomic tion. Let me read the reply of the partment to a letter sent to the Minister for Defence by my Leader. It is' thisDear Sir, I am in receipt of your letter of SOth making representations in regard to the terto mination of employment of Messrs. Goldie, O'Connor, and Flynn, and have to inform you scription. that, in pursuance of the policy of. the ment, the work formerly carried out by these men is being performed by returned soldiers. It is regretted that they cannot be found employment elsewhere. Yours faithfully, The three men whose names are given men. were employed by the Defence DepartWe ment as viewers of the ammunition supwould plied by the Colonial Ammunition Coming, pany, two of them being married, with family of four each. On the 30th A p r i they were notified that their services would be dispensed with, and representawill tions on' their behalf were made to the officer in charge. They have been thrown out of employment to enable returned soldiers to be put in their places. are limitations to this sort of thing. Every one is agreed that returned soldiers should be placed, and given the means earning a livelihood, but surely the vernment is not so poverty-stricken in i vention that it cannot find ways of embut ploying returned men to the advantage the country without displacing others. Mr Lockyer's scheme of repatriation seems to me comprehensive. When immitold grants were being brought'from the Old Country, Australians' were dismissed find them employment, so that they might than not write complaining letters to their 1 to emfriends, but after six or twelve months earlier immigrants were dismissed, to find work for later arrivals. This system discredited the immigration movement. ImThe Government is acting in a similar way in regard to returned soldiers. M in isters are riding for a f all ; but some other policy will have to be carried out. The names and ages of the employees at the - Cordite Paotory are to be taken, and the remembers of a recruiting committee are to and inquire why the eligibles there have hot enlisted.. We are not told what the will happenafter the inquiry, but we know that three men have already been dismissed Eo find places for returned solatdiers. There is no other name but ecoconscription for that. The Prime DeMinister before he left-h e should not have been allowed to go, because he cannot represent Australia-sai d that conscription had been abandoned for ever, 1st May, 1018. and that there would be no victimization ultimo and no economic conscription. The case which I have referred, if it is not one of victimization, is one of economic conThe Government can go too Governfar in this line of action. The soldiers themselves will resent the charge that men . with family responsibilities are being thrown out of employment to find work for them - There should be no need forT. TRUMBLE, that. The Repatriation Department should Secretary. discover occupations for our returned That is the reason for its existence. said that the Win-the-war party act in the way that it is now actthough its members denied that they a would. If others in the Cordite Factory l , are treated as the three men whose names havej been mentioned have been treated, any one say that they are not being put off to force them to enlist? At the Lithgow Small Arms Factory the M i nister, after refusing to do anything, There agreed to the holding of an inquiry, which was conducted .under the War Precautions Act, the witnesses being bound of to secrecy. The ""finding which has been Goread by the Honorary Minister (Mr . n - Wise) today is not based oh the evidence, - that evidence cannot be produced, beof cause it was given secretly. The report that has been read lies, like all the reports from the Defence Department. We were that the Department was the best run Department in the world, u n t i l an to examination of its accounts showed a shortage of millions of pounds. No reports from that Department can, believed.",27
51,Mr WISE,Unknown,Then why is time wasted man for a definite purpose. in asking us questions concerning the ministration of the Department?,29
52,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I do not blame the Minister personally, though I say that is the duty of Ministers to get down the facts, and not to be content witli reports of the Department. Why should men who are out of work be penalized what is hot their fault? The union all they could to keep the factory but"" certain men went - out in spite them, and were expelled in consequence. Now it looks as if the Government was collusion with the barrel-setters, timize others. These barrel-setters make a large amount of money.

TEe Department should see that there is no victimization. At one 300 persons were employed at Lithgow, most of whom were under eighteen years of age.  have there been there within a given time ?",29
53,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"That horrible member for Echuca again-the man with small mind and the small body! The turned soldiers, when asked to join union there, say, "" No; we have been structed not to join ' unions, because going to the war, we joined the one grand union."" That is proof that the Governpartment ment, or some one connected with the partments', is trying to break up the unions. I do not expect members to adthat mit it, but when lying awake in the early hours of the morning their consciences every honourable member. may lead them into agreement with me on the subject. Does the Government tend to keep its promise that there be no economic conscription; no conscripquence tion in any form, and no victimization ? I have waited some weeks to see the come of the promise that was made. I should like to ask the Governor General a question, but apparently'he and I are not on speaking terms.",29
54,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! It"" is not in order to introduce the name of the Governor General in debate in that way.",29
55,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Ver y well. I shall betalk about the Conference which was brought into existence by a certain gentleThe Goadvernment are showing no desire to carry out the resolutions of that Conference. If they intend to continue their present it course of action, we shall have to adverto tise wider than we have in the past what the the Government are trying to do with the people of Australia. I know the Gofor vernment are looking about in a spiteful did way to arrest somebody under the War going, Precautions Act. Somebody will have of to take that risk. If the Government are looking for some victim it is their in duty to tell us so. If they intend to to vicforce men out of employment",29
56,Mr WISE,Unknown,It is very easy to make statements without backing them up with,29
57,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I ask the Minister me to back up his statement, with proof. If get we ask the Defence Department to lay 011 the table papers dealing with a partime ticular matter, we are told that for military reasons that cannot be done.",29
58,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Charlton"" (Hunter) [3.37] .1 consider this a very important matter, and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls) was perfectly justified in the bringing it under the notice of the reHouse. I was surprised to hear that so the many men are out of employment at inLithgow through no fault of their own. in The Minister in his statement admitted that no dispute existed between the Deand the men, and that their Deunemployment was in consequence of a few barrel-setters refusing to work. If is the case the 900 men who are unemployed are entitled to the sympathy of The men are not on strike; it is well that honourable inmembers should understand that these shall men have been denied work in conseof the action of the barrel-setters.",29
59,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Are the barrel-setters in out the same union as the other men?,29
60,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Yes , and they were, expelled for striking.",29
61,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The barrel-setters received no sympathy from their fellow employees, but in consequence of their action these other men are compelled by the Government to remain in idleness. I ask the House what view will be taken of the action of the Government by the industrial workers throughout the Commonwealth, once they understand that recognised employees, of the Commonwealth who are not on strike, but are idle through the actions of certain individuals, are denied employment. Minister for Defence has said that this has been found an opportune time to dispense with the second shift, which is not required, because the factory can produce sufficient rifles in one shift with the additional machinery which is being installed. The Minister has said, also, that the time is suitable to give effect to Hie policy of the Department to employ returned soldiers in this work. I , too, desire to see returned soldiers employed, but I do not think that the policy of dispensing with the services of married men with families, in order to give preference to returned men, will find favour with them or with the public at large. number ,pf men who were not at Lithgow prior to this trouble have recently been engaged at the factory, whilst hundreds of former employees have been out of work for ten weeks. Everybody can Understand what must be the indigent circumstances of working men who have been unemployed for ten weeks, especially when they have to pay rent. Butalthough the other factory employees condemned the barrel-setters who were responsible for the stoppage of work, they are told that, because certain returned soldiers are available they cannot < be reinstated in their old positions. This policy can have only one effect. When the unionists throughout Australia realise that returned soldiers are replacof ing married men who have families support, they will say that there is no centive to them to encourage enlistment. We do not wish that view to be held. desire to get as many recruits as possible; yet, while we are endeavouring' in every way to clear the political and industrial atmosphere, we find the Government into troducing in their own factories methods which will' prove detrimental to recruitpoint ing. I am sure that when the Governwill ment took this course of action they did not view the matter in the light in which I have put it. But that is the true terpretation of their attitude. Is it the interests of the country that, at this time of crisis, we should create bad feeling which will do more to prevent recruiting than anything else that has happened ? In the interests of recruiting, Conferences are being held between State Ministers and industrial organizations for the purpose of removing all obstacles; but, The while these negotiations are in progress, the Commonwealth Government are introducing a system which must appear to the outsider to be economic conscription. That is the only construction that can be placed on the action of the Government in depriving' men of the right to work, although .those men have committed no fault. Nobody will resent, this policy more than the soldiers themselves. Men who have had sufficientspirit to go to the Front will not come back to resort to the cowardly action of displacing their fellow men. We ought to endeavour to find avenues of employment for the returned soldiers, and we must maintain - them A until work for them is found; but let us not put them in the position of taking the bread and butter from married men with families. Though the Minister argued that there was nothing in the nature of economic conscription in the Government's policy, I ask honourable members to put them1 selves in the position of the workmen, and consider what would be their opinion if they found that returned soldiers were being utilized to displace them from their employment and leave their families without means of support. It must be remembered that the factory employees are skilled workers. They can do only certain classes of work in connection with % machinery, and when they are thrown out employment, they cannot go anywhere to and get a job. The consequence is that in they feel the present position very keenly, j and the Government's action must create We a good deal of ill-feeling. I hope the Government will give the matter further consideration, and I am sure that the Assistant Minister will use his influence change the policy of the Government if he finds that step necessary. From my of view, the policy is dangerous, and not be helpful in the prosecution of the war. In those circumstances, let the Government retrace their steps and give inemployment to the men who are required in for producing small-arms, and when any vacancies occur, give the work to returned soldiers. Do not let us, for the purpose of getting rid of the burden of maintaining returned men until they find employment, displace other men who for years have given loyal service to the Government.",29
62,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [3.46]. J. have never sat silent when any question of unemployment has been brought forward. I have been connected with every unemployment grievance for the last quarter of a century, and today I .appeal to the Government, through the Minister, to be just to the men who are out of work. At the present time, we are. simply existing on credit, and if that credit be disturbed, we shall have more trouble in Australia than we'have ever had before. The disturbance of credit^following the - land boom and the big maritime strike caused a financial debacle and misery and wretchedness throughout Victoria. What happens when there is unemployment? The first person to suffer is the small lord, who cannot get his rent. Then the small tradesmen feel the pinch. Later comes the disturbance of credit, and the tradesmen have to appeal to the banks. I warn the Government that in creating unemployment they are taking the first step towards causing a disturbance of credit, and once that happens there will be an end to the present form of government, and we shall have a lot of trouble. In connection with the land boom, I had a list of 200 names of schoolmates and boy-mates who lost their homes, for which they had partially paid. The building societies collapsed, and later came the bank smash. In a time of war the Commonwealth Government are actually putting men out of work, and stopping the making of rifles because three expert men, who were drawing £25 a week, declined to do their work. Rifles can still be made, and put aside to be remedied later on by the barrel-setters. I understand that barrel-setting is a work that cannot easily be learnt, and that some men have a special faculty for it. I ask the Minister not to be too thinskinned about his Department, for if ever there was a Department which lived in a miasma of mystery, it is the Defence Department. Will anybody deny that there was, a phantom regiment, and that thousands of pounds were drawn to pay men who never existed? Will anybody deny that the Minister for Defence swore that the fence surrounding the Base Hospital, in St. Kilda-road, was over 6 feet high, when i u reality, as was shown by a photograph, the fence only' reaches my shoulders. Do I not know that medical men lied in the witness-box when they said, after the unfortunate Gunner Perry was sent to the observation ward of the lunatic asylum, that he was able to earn his living?",31
63,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I would remind the honourable member that the question before the Chair has nothing to do with that case.,31
64,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Then I shall not pursue the subject further. The Defence Department has been branded by a leading advocate in Sydney as "" the Department of Muddledom."" I cannot blame my honourable friend (Mr. Wise), for the muddle that exists landin the Department, since he has been in office for only a few weeks, but I hope that under his fostering care a great improvement will be made. The Government are playing with fire in dismissing men in this way. At a recent recruiting meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall Lieutenant MCKenzie, a returned soldier, made'the most eloquent speech, in which he declared: "" I have been a trade unionist all my life,"" and I am sure that he would cut his throat rather than find\ work for himself by displacing another man. These men at Lithgow are, perhaps, to be treated just as returned soldiers employed at the woollen works in Queen-street .are .being dealt with. If they have a pension of 15s. per week, they are not allowed to earn more than 27s. per week, as their total weekly income must not exceed £2 2s. The returned soldiers engaged in the same industry in Sydney are working under the Red Cross, and axe treated differently from their brothers in Melbourne, who object to this system as a dragging down of trade unionism. No one knows better than I do the misery suffered by the masses as the result of unemployment, and I unhesitatingly say that if this system is continued by the Government a most dangerous situation will be created. The Government should extend the work of the Small Arms Factory. At present we are not properly armed, and we have not yet made a big gun capable of sinking a second class cruiser. I warned the Government as far back as 1905 of the neces"" sity for the establishment of an arsenal in Australia, and it seems to me' that we shall come to a bad end if we stop at the mere making of rifles. We should manufacture in Australia everything required for the prosecution of accursed war. As it is, we find the Government reducing employment in the only factory we have for the making of munitions. I wish the^ people had an opportunity of controlling the created thing called Parliament. If they had, there would soon be a change. Let the Government extend its munition works. Let us have, if you like, two arsenals-on e at Lithgow, and the other at Canberra-and let the men returning from the Front be employed at the Canberra works. Returned soldiers have not been treated well in Melbourne, and I think that both the Commonwealth and the State Government should be ashamed of their shortcomings in that respect. I am confident that not one out of every fifty returned soldiers would accept a job if , by doing so, he would deprive another man of his bread and butter.",31
65,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [3.55] - Las t week the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls) was busily engaged in his own electorate in connection, no doubt, with this very matter, and in his absence I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence a question concerning the men out of work at the Lithgow! Small Arms Factory. The honourable gentleman was at first unable to answer my question, but on Friday last he in formed me in the House that he had received a report stating that it had been found possible to re-engage a number of these men, although a considerable number were still out of work. I understand that prior to this trouble 1,500 men were employed in the Small Arms Factory, and that today there are only 800 in the works.'",32
66,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Ove r 1,000 are employed in the day shift.",32
67,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Acceptin g that stateM ment, it means that 500 men are still of work. A point which I wish to emto phasize is that two or three months the Government sent the present' ActGovernments, ing Prime Minister (Mr Watt) on a special vsit to Lithgow to inquire into the housing of the men employed at the Factory. The honourable gentleman reported to Cabinet, with the result that the Government decided to build 200 houses for the use of the men. The Government realized, apparently, at that time that the housing accommodation for the employees was insufficient, and they did hot contemplate any reduction in the number of hands. H a d they thought at that time of making a 33 per cent, reduction in the number of employees at the Factory the probability is that the proposal to build 200 houses for the workmen would not have been made. I do not know whether the Government in tend to proceed with it , but if , at the time of the Acting Prime Minister's visit to Lithgow, additional housing accommodation was .thought to be necessary, there must have heen evidence before the Government that there was not likely to be any reduction in the number of hands employed. But what is the position today? We are told that at least 500 men have been thrown out of work, and the majority of these, according to the honourable member for Macquarie, are married. In view of the circular which has been distributed - throughout the Commonwealth Departments it is felt that pressure is being brought to bear upon the officers to compel them, although married, to enlist. An y such pressure is quite at variance with the decision arrived at by the Recruiting Conference, which recently took place at the instance of the Governor General. One of the propositions which I , on behalf of representatives of Labour, submitted to the Recruiting Conference, was that there should be no economic conscription in either private or public employment. A country that has deliberately turned doVn the policy of conscription on two different occasions might reasonably be expected to oppose anything in the shape of economic conscription-the forcing of men out of employment.'so as to compel them to enlist. y proposal that there should be no out economic conscription was the only one which the Prime Minister, speaking on ago behalf of the Commonwealth and State and also on behalf of the employers' organizations, replied to in the one word, ""Accept."" He stated that there was no intention to bring in economic conscription. Shortly afterwards, according to the newspapers, the Harris Company in Sydney dismissed number ""of single men from their employ, and the Hon. W. Brooks, M.L.C., who presented the New South Wales Emthe ployers' Federation at the Conference, stated in an interview that the disthe missal of these men was in direct opposition to the agreement arrived at by the Conference. He said straight out that the Employers' Federation was opposed to any sort of economic conscripat tion. The Prime Minister, in accepting our proposal, spoke for the Commonshould wealth, as well as for the State Premiers Capital. and the employers' organizations, and I hope that the Government will the compact. The honourable member for Pigott) interjected while another honourable member was speaking, that these men could find employment in other of Australia. I would remind him that it is not an easy matter for a married man to part with his few sticks of furniture and to break up his home, or to that we cannot. leave his wife and family behind him. while he seeks work elsewhere.",32
68,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,And most of these men are skilled workers. The work for which they have been specially trained cannot be obtained outside the Small Arms Factory.,33
69,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Quite so; they would have to accept casual employment as labourers. Those who know what i means for a married man to leave histell wife and - family and seek work in town or country will recognise that this action on the part of the Department must give rise to a very bad feeling. It shows that the Government are not prepared to honour the agreement made at the Rebe cruiting Conference.,33
70,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"It is pretty rough a man to have to travel on the ""please, ma'am, do give me a feed "" system.",33
71,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have never travelled on that system, but I know what it look for work on more than one contiallowed nent. If the work of the Small Arms Factory has been reorganized, and it is tended to employ as large a staff of workmotion men as before, then such a decision must be of recent date. It could not have been contemplated two or three months Masseyago, when the Government announced a that they intended to erect 200 workmen's homes at Lithgow, and that the munirecipality - would be asked to co-operate in work. If it is said by the Department that the output of the Factory, with reduced staff, meets the maximum requirements of the Commonwealth, then the work of arming Australia is far simpler than many of us imagined it to be when we spoke .of establishing an arsenal Tuggeranong, in the Federal Capital area. I have always held that an arsenal be established at the Federal",33

73,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Because the machinery Calare (Mr has not yet been set up. , Mr Charlton - And if we can provide for our requirements with a staff of parts only 1,000 men at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory there can be no necessity for the duplication of the works.",33
74,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,But we know,33
75,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Of course we do. I know that a staff of 1,000 men cannot turn out the number of rifles required for our own defence. I urge the Honorary Minister (Mr Wise), as representing the Minister for Defence, to see that the Work of manufacturing rifles at Lithgow is pushed on with all possible speed. If it be true that a larger output is not t necessary, then the Government should us at once, so that we may know how to deal with the larger question of the establishment of an arsenal at Canberra. It is most urgent that these 700 men should be at once afforded an opportunity to earn their living. They ought not to turned adrift after they have spent years in making themselves skilled in the manufacture of small arms, and I urge for the Government to give our request serious and immediate consideration.",33

Question-That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair, and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply-pro posed.",38
114,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Dalley) [ 4 . 1 7 ] - I desire to draw attention to one or two cases in which injustice has been done to some individuals in the community. The first matter touches upon ' the famous Sinn Fein regulation which empowers the military to enter the premises of any citizen whenever they take it into their heads to do so. I have received the f o l lowing letter from Mr B . O'Connor, of Leichhardt:- ^ On 25th March, at 3.15 pan., three police officers entered my house at above address and searched, by warrant, the whole of my private rooms. Their warrant was signed by General Lee, on what the police said was owing to private information. They found nothing that they could seize but a few private letters from Home to my daughters, of no importance to any one, and some picture cards of Dr Mannix. I interviewed General Lee, and explained the whole circumstance, when he reEMPLOYEES-=- marked I would obtain those private letters back, but, up to the present,. I have not received a reply. Now, sir, I want to know if this is justice when my house is raided in a SEPARATION most brazen' manner on the mere statement of EN- some personal enemy without making previous inquiry from local police or otherwise? I may add I am not a member of any society, or any of my family, not even an Hibernian, Sinn Feiner, or anything else; simply an Oddfellow. LABOUR This I regard as a most glaring case. This gentleman has lived in the locality for a great number of years, and has OF ALLOW- there raised a family. He is well known, and nothing can be said against his private character; and yet, merely because it is presumed, possibly on the information of somebody who has a personal spite FIJI- against him, that he has disloyal tendenCONDUCT OF cies, and without any inquiry being made WAR : from the local police, or any Other local authority who might know the circumstances, his private residence is raided. Amongst some of the documents taken from 'the house were some nrivate letters that had been received by his daughters, and also' some picture post-cards of Dr Mannix. It may be regarded as a most heinous crime in this country to have picture post-cards of the kind in one's possession; but, if so, the. fact ought to be made known to the public, so that breaches of the particular regulation may be avoided. It is desired that the letters should be returned, for they possess, if not an intrinsic, at any rate a sentimental, value to the daughters of the household. Honourable members understand that young ladies do receive letters from members of the opposite sex concerning matters which should not be made public, and such documents axe not likely to be of any military value to the enemy. Of course, it is quite possible, in these latter days, that the militarv authorities may think the seizure of these letters will , in some w a y , / h e l p l o beat the Germans back, and win the war. The whole affair seems to be utterly ridiculous and 1 childish; and I bring it under the notice of the House, and of the Government, with the suggestion ""that when such information is laid against any person, in quiries should be set afoot by the authorities in order toinsure that personal spite plays no part in the proceedings. The inquiries made in such cases ought, of course, to be conducted privately, and would doubtless assist the authorities in deciding as to the merits of the charges made. I sincerely trust that the letters I have spoken of will be returned, and. not detained with any idea that they may help the Government to win the war. There is another serious matter connected with the military authorities which I desire to bring under the notice of the House. Some time ago a man, eager to do his duty to his K in g and country, enlisted, and was sent Home. When he arrived in England it was discovered that he was not quit© medically fit for Hie firing-line; and, as he was actuated by the highest of patriotic motives, the refusal of the authorities to allow him to go to Erance was a great disappointment. Indeed, he felt that an in justice was being done to bim, and he did what many other men might do under the circumstances. He discovered that a d r a f t Mr Mahony. from his own battalion was being sent to Erance, so he smuggled himself amongst them, got into the firing line, and started to do his b it to beat back the Huns. When this was discovered, he was charged, first, with being absent without, leave; and then, above all things, with the great offence of "" unlawfully firing at the King's enemies."" Could anything be more absurd ? However, the worse part of the business is that, because of this man's determination to fight, his wife and children are made to suffer in Australia today, inasmuch as their separation allowance has been stopped now for months.",38
115,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Has the honourable member submitted his case to the Minister for Defence ? Mr MAHONY \ - I have; and I bring it before the House, because I find the military authorities are going along in the old humdrum way, accepting something that somebody tells them, and leaving this woman and her .children to starve. I ' have some correspondence which I should like to read; and the first letter is as follows^Head-Quarters, Sydney, 4th February, 1918. Be CANCELLED ALLOTMENTS. .You are advised that payment of allotment made to you on certificate No. 403 at Drummoyne Post-office, on behalf of No. 6776, G. S. Mathers, 22/13 Battalion, Private, has been cancelled on and from 11.1.18 on account of soldier absent without leave. Please return the allotment certificate to the postmaster. Mrs Jane E. Mathers, 56 Reynolds-street, Balmain. The next letter received by this woman was- ' District Pay Office, Victoria Barracks, Sydney, 22nd February, 1918. Re No. 6776, G. S. MATHERS, 13TH BATTALION. I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant relative to the allotment of pay of the above - named soldier, and in reply I have to inform you that it is regretted that this allotment cannot be reinstated until further advice is received from the Chief Paymaster, London, in view of the fact that the soldier is illegally absent from duty, and all pay for such period is forfeited. She then got into communication with me; and I think it w e i r that the whole of the correspondence should go on record, so that honourable members may know exactly how the Defence Departsaent is treating the dependants of the men who are fighting for us to-3ay. The l e t t e r to myself is as f o l l o w sC/o Mrs A. Prestage, 35-57 Wellington-street, Rozolle, Dear Sir, I am writing to ask yon if you could help me in my trouble with regard to my dear husband, No. 6776 Private George S. Mathers, 13th Infantr y Battalion. I am enclosing you a military form ; it is not the first one I received, this one was given to mc by one of the military officials to use if I went to the Lord Mayor's Fund for assistance, the other one I gave to a doctor who was going to try and do what he could for me; then I was advised to write to you, and I would bo sure to have the matter cleared up. I have received no military pay at all since the pay before the date on enclosed form, and. I can gain no satisfaction with regard to my husband. I gave a good husband and father when I let him go, and now it is not only a broken home, but a broken heart as well. I have had to take my son away from his school and let him go to work, and I have had to take a positon myself. I am in service, and have seven children to look after. I wish honourable members to note that particular pointI. am ill myself, and am afraid I can't keep up much longer. It is cruel to be treated in this way. Is it just to take our men, and then treat them and their wives and children as though we were nothing? Can you find out for mc why my money has been stopped ? All they say is that my dear husband is marked ""' A.W.L."" I asked them at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, why my boy and I should suffer for my husband not being able to .attend dril l (I'know he is, or was, very ill by his letters), and they politely told mc' that if a man was sick and unable to go to work, his boss would not pay himTs this the callous way in w h i c h the dependants of our soldiers are to be treated ? I sincerely hope that it is not , and that , if, t h is sort of t h in g has been going o n , the House will ' t a k e steps it in the f u t u r e and if a 'man in the Army did not do his d r ill he could not expect to get his money; so that, if this is the way our men are to be treated, God help us. By my husband's letters he has not heen drawing any money at all for a very long time before my pay was stopped. Poor fellow, he feels it very keenly. My only hope is that my boy's and my own prayer is answered, and that God will protect him, and they will send him home to me. I was paying off for a block of land, and had to sell it to get a little ready cash, and I have two small accounts I am unable to pay. They worry and upset ine. If they were settled; I could manage on my boy's money and what I am earning myself, but paying a little off them each week leaves my small amount of - cash very short. I only write and explain all this, dear sir, to let you know how I am placed, and I do not want my affairs to be made public. M x . WEBSTER - S h e did not wish it to be made p u b l i c? 12th March, 1918.",39
116,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"B e for e I sit down, I shall t e l l the Minister w h y I make the matter public. Those concerned are for c ed to make it p u b l i c They tell me, also, that there is a debt standing to my husband for, I believe it was said, some hospital expenses, which I cannot understand. They showed me the papers with the amount on them, £12 10s. 10d., I think it was. In God's name, I ask you to try and find out something for me, and let me hear from you at your early convenience. Believe me, Yours faithfully , (Mrs.) E. J . MATHKBS. P.S - I am also enclosing an answer to a letter I wrote to the Victoria Barracks, Sydney. When I say I don't want my affairs made public, I mean by telling people; as a rule, people are so .cruel, and make the most of one in trouble. I was told by one returned man that the military people dare not stop my pay unless my husband stopped it himself for some reason, and as I know my dear husband has no cause to do that, I don't want anybody's ideas, only those who help for kindness, and as one Christian to another. It r u st you can help. P.P.S - I am afraid this letter is rather broken. Please excuse it, as I am very tired and worried. On receipt of that letter, I g ot in to communication with the Department, to which I sent the o r i g in a l letters, r e t a in in g copies for ' m y own use. A f t e r a day or t w o .

I had to give up the work I was doing; now my son, who was earning 15s. a week, iB ordered into hospital. It is terrible; why are they so cruel. God forgive them for all the misery they cause; I can find it in my heart to forgive, but later some one will pay the penalty. I am, Yours very respectfully, (Signed) E. J. MATHEBS . N e x t is a l e t t e r addressed to myself from the Secretary to the' Defence D e p a r t ment29th A p r i l, 1918. In continuation of this office memorandum 24,497, of the 26th ultimo, relative to your representations on behalf of Mrs E. J. Mathers, c/o Mrs A. Prestage, 35-37 Wellington-street, Rozelle, regarding the stoppage of payment of allotment of her hubsand, No. 6776 Private G. S. Mathers, I have iiow to inform you that a cable has been received from the Chief Paymaster, London, to the effect that this ment cannot be reinstated as the soldier in question is still an absentee. I sent on the letter to the lady in question, so that she might know exactly what the Defence Department had to say on the subject, and I received from her another letter, complaining of her harsh treatment, and pointing out that she had received letters from her husband addressed from a camp in England. Although the paymaster in London cabled out to the effect that the soldier in question is presumably an absentee, letters have come from him addressed from the 13th Training Battalion, Codfoi'd, the date of the last of these being 28th February last. The Defence Department, in a letter of the 29th A p r i l, say that a cable has been received from the Chief Paymaster, London, to the effect that the allotment cannot be reinstated, as the man is still an absentee. , Mr JOWETT - Was the date cable given?",40
117,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"No ; but presumably it was sent about the same time as the letters. This woman has suffered financial loss arid a terrible mental strain, so that her health is completely shattered. Having no means to pay for medical assistance, she is forced, as she says in one of her letters, to go into a public hospital. Her words are, "" Nobody cares; I am only a soldier's w if e . "" I do not wish to weary the House by reading at length all the letters in""my possession.",41
118,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Is there not Sydney, as in Melbourne, a State War Council to deal with cases such as this ?"" don.",41
119,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"There are a number suspicion, of bodies by whom assistance is supposed to be given. But this woman and her the office examined. children can get nothing. Why should they be penalized, even though the band may have been guilty of a breach woman ? of discipline or of some infraction of the military regulations? Why should they pay the penalty of his offence? The thin? is grossly unfair. The people of could Australia will not stand for such treati ment.  application to the State War Council?",41
120,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,Sh e has made applishe cation after application. . Sir ROBERT BEST - It is extraordinary that a case of this kind should be overlooked by that body.,41
121,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,My information is allot- that she can get no assistance.,41
122,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Does she say to what body she applied ?,41
123,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Sh e says in one of the letters that I have read that she applied for assistance from the Lord Mayor's Fund. The fact that stands out is that the Defence Department has done nothing for her, and the Minister will gain nothing by trying to shift the responsibility onto the State War Council.",41
124,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,The State Wa r Councils are working with the Department.,41
125,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"This man enlisted, although he had a wife and children. As I have pointed out, the authorities at Home said that he was physically unfit to go to the Front, but his spirit was so strong that he determined to do so. I have a letter here from him to his wife, bearing the address, "" 13th Training Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, of the Officers' Mess, Codford,"" and dated 14th February last. Mr TUDOR. - Since then there have been only two mails.",41
126,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"There could hardly be later news. This letter shows that the man was then in camp, despite the cablegram of the Chief Paymaster in London to the effect that he was an absentee - There is something wrong in the Paymaster's Office in London, and we should have a close examination into its affairs. I am afraid that some of the tricks that were being played in the Pay in Office in Sydney, and caused such a scandal there, are being played in LonA t any rate, cases like this arouse and in the public interest the Government should have the accounts of  husber tried to get assistance for this",41
127,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"I have brought the case under the notice of the Defence Department, and taken all the steps that I to have matters put r i g h t ; I bring t before the House as a final resort, as in no other way can I force the Department to do justice to this woman and her children. My only desire is that shall receive a fair deal. I have no desire to make political capital out of the case, and I would be the first to compliment the Minister if to-night, or even tomorrow morning, he would take the proper action. The letters from the husband to the wife would make one's heart bleed. They are tender communications, imbued with the kindest regard for wife and children. That these should be treated as they have been treated while he is lamenting that he cannot be with them, is scandalous. I trust that the matter will not be treated lightly, as many matters that are raised in this chamber are treated, nothing being done. The husband is overseas attempting to do his bit. He went away to fight the Ger' mans, ancl even if he has been charged with the ridiculous crime of unlawfully firing on the King's enemies, at least, do not let us fire on his wife and children.",41
128,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Has the member personally put the matter before the Minister for Defence?,42
129,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"No , but without a moment's delay I sent to him from Sydney the letters that I had received. Does the Postmaster-General suggest that the Minister does not take notice of written communications, and will act only when button-holed ?",42
130,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,If the honourable member's heart were in the case he would have spoken to the Minister personally.,42
131,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"-My heart is in the case. I have brought it before the House because the Department will do nothing. The Postmaster-General is trying to sidetrack me. But, notwithstanding his long parliamentary experience, I will not let him put it over me. He cannot get away from the fact that the Department has refused to give this woman and her children a fair deal. He says that I should whisper into the pearly ear of Senator Pearce, but I am not going to do that.",42
132,Mr BAYLEY,Unknown,Does the' Department admit that the charge against the man is what you have stated it to be ? Have you an official admission to that effect ?,42
133,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"No ; the word of this soldier is good enough for me, and I accept it . His letters contain a statement of the charge and of the whole of the circumstances connected with it .",42
134,Mr BAYLEY,Unknown,"In justice to the Department, you should get an official denial or admission regarding the correctness of the statement concerning the charge.",42
135,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,The Department says that a cablegram has been received from the. Chief Paymaster in London saying that the allotment cannot be reinstated because the soldier in question is still an absentee. Yet letters have come from him giving as his address a camp in England. The outstanding fact is that the woman and her children have not received assistance. ^ .,42
136,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Anothe r outstanding fact is that the honourable member has not himself appealed to the Minister for Defence.,42
137,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Not very long ago I approached Senator Pearce on behalf of a woman, in order to ascertain the whereabouts of one of her two sons, who were at the Pront. The Department had in formed her that it had no record of his whereabouts. The mother knew that he had gone to the Front, for she had said honourable farewell to him at the boat. But when I approached Senator Pearce he said that he had much more important matters to attend to. I resolved then that Senator Pearce should wait a long time before I again approached him privately on any inatter. In the case I have mentioned today I took the proper step of w r it in g to the Department officially, and the Chief Paymaster has replied that the man is still an absentee. Yet the man's letters arriving by the latest mai l are headed with the name of the camp in which he was stationed in England. I will be generous enough to say that a mistake may have been made. If so, the man's address is contained in his own letters, and it is the duty of the Department to take the steps necessary to rectify the injustice which has been done to his wife and children. Sir EOBERTBEST (Kooyong) [4.52] - The statement by the honourable member for Dalley of the grievance to which we have just listened elicited the sympathy of every member of the. House, and inspired us with an anxiety that something should be done to relieve the distress of the woman and her children. But when, in the latter portion of his remarks, the honourable member saw fit to make a heated reflection on the Defence Department, he did both himself and his case au injustice. As soon as the case was brought under their notice, the Defence authorities Were not content with a mere inquiry by m a i l ; they regarded the matter as of sufficient importance to justify a cable. The only official information they have received in reply is that the man is a deserter, and as such he must have been guilty of a very serious breach of discipline. There may be associated with the case qualifying circumstances, such as those suggested by the honourable member. That is a matter for subsequent inquiry. In the meantime there is a cle.ar means whereby substantial relief can be obtained for the unfortunate woman. I speak from some little ence in this matter, and I infer that relief, which is available in Victoria, may be relied upon to be available in every other State. There is in Victoria a State War Council, which is now associated, to some extent, with the Department of Repatriation. That Council has raised considerable sums of money, including a recent amount of £120,000, which is specially applied to the relief of cases such as the honourable member has mentioned. So far as my experience goes, amelioration has not been refused in one deserving case. On the contrary, the labour and trouble incurred by members of the Council in ascertaining the facts of every application is most commendable. A gentleman who is associated with me spends day after day in investigating the circumstances of various cases which are brought under his notice. If the honourable member for Dalley will take the trouble to bring the case he has ventilated today under the notice of the State War Council in New. South Wales, I am certain that relief will be immediately afforded.",42
138,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The State Government is another source of relief.,43
139,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"In addition to the State Wlar Council there is the Lord Mayor's Fund, and the two combine to offer a guarantee of a weekly allowance to every deserving applicant. to which we have just listened is most deserving, and demands immediate attention and relief, but the channels to which I have referred should be at once resorted to. In the meantime I am hopeful that the Defence Department will undertake an investigation. Of course . it is most difficult to believe that the charge against this man is such as has been suggested by the honourable member for Dalley.",43
140,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"That is ,what the soldier himself stated in one of his letters.",43
141,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I should have been' inclined to regard that statement as a bit of humour on his part. I hope the honourable member will not allow the case to drop, but will seek relief from the sources I have suggested, and will urge a complete investigation by the Defence Department. I realise, with him, that these complaints are unduly and unfairly stressed in opposition to recruiting, and that makes it all the more necessary that experian investigation should take place, especially as the"" Government have made extra appointments for that purpose. I believe that if this case were brought under the notice of the Assistant M in ister for Defence (Mr Wise), whom the honourable member may interview in the House, he will see that a proper inquiry is made, and that temporary relief is given at once. The case should be dealt with on its merits, and if the merits are such as he suggested, the unfortunate woman is entitled to the most generous consideration.",43
142,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [4.581- A few days ago I thought it necessary to complain about the actions of the military authorities in raiding the offices and private residences of certain reputable citizens. I made particular reference to the raid of the private residence and offices of the secretary of the - Irish National Association in Brisbane., Sinoe then, correspondence' has reached me which shows that that raid was by no means isolated. I am informed that in a number of instances in New South Wales, presbyteries, and even convents, have been raided by the military within the last few months. I shall read to the House a copy of a letter which was sent to the M i nister for DefenceThe Presbytery, - Canowindra, N.S.W., 2nd March, 1918. The case I beg to make application to you, personally, for information regarding the charge made against mc by the military authorities in Sydney. The Hon. Mr Millen promised me some five weeks back to make someinquiries for me, but iip to the present I have not received any information, although I sent him, at his request, the particulars of my transactions. It appears that, towards the end of December, the military authorities in Sydney caused inquiries to be made of me as to what certain cases received by me contained. I gave all the information I could to assist the police in making the inquiry; in fact, I invited them to go into the church, the convent, and the school, and sec for themselvca the articles referred to. When in Sydney, I called upon Colonel Lloyd with reference to his action, and asked for some particulars as to the charges and the informant. Tho only, information I was. able to elicit from him was that' some person, who did not know me and did not know the circumstances, reported that he had been told that I had received some large cases. From another source, I learnt that some one had said that he had heard that a case addressed to me was br.oken in transit, and that, though it was supposed to contain "" images,"" it actually contained "" rifles."" As the military authorities, as represented , by Colonel Lloyd, are satisfied that I am innocent of this serious charge, I asked for the information to be passed along to the police, so that they might, in the interests of justice and fair play, deal with the ruffian who concocted the story. I was told by Colonel Lloyd that, under no circumstances,' could a name be revealed, no matter how grave the groundless charge .might be. Seeing that similar inquiries have been made about some of our teaching sisters who bought pianos, and who, at least in ono case, were credited with getting four piano-cases of rifles instead, I have very grave doubts as to the' bona fides of the charges. Wo should be protected from these either bogirs complaints or wicked.charges by some evil persons; and, as a means to protect myself, I ask that the name of the informant be given, with a view to action by the police. Another officer informed a friend that was a written complaint. With these contradictory statements, it is not easy to arrive at the truth. _ I _ have refrained from having tliese humiliating annoyances vetitilated in the House until I communicated with the responsible head of the Defence Department. I am a native of the country, fifty-eight years of age, and have been in my present district for a period of, twenty-seven years. I have made public addresses advocating all patriotic movements, and given money and land towards these objects, so that I am not unknown as a reputable citizen. I claim even to have given more, proportionately, than any contributor in my own district. Even in the church, I have strongly urged the claims of War Loans. I mention these matters to show that I have reason to claim exemption from this cruel and uncalled-for action of the military authorities. My parishioners deeply resent this action, and would, if permitted, take some palpable means of expressing their opinions. As a free citizen, I hope I am not asking too much when I request your assistance to help me in this matter. To which the reverend gentleman received the following reply from the Defence Department: With reference to your letter of 2nd March, addressed to the Minister for Defence, 1I have to inform you that Senator Millen was written to on 6th February, 1918, in reply to the representations made by him on your behalf, and as the representations were made through him, the roply was also sent to him. In regard to the matter complained of by you, I desire to say that it is the duty of the Commandant of each district to inquire into all matters submitted to him. . In the present case, the action taken disclosed nothing of a suspicious nature, and the Intelligence Officer at Sydney informed you to that effect. It is not considered by this Department advisable, for obvious reasons, to disclose the ground on which any specific action is taken. "" It is regretted that you should have been put to inconvenience in regard to this matter. I ask honourable members if they think it fair that reputable citizens, no matter what may be their political or religious faith , should be subjected to such treatment on mere hearsay evidence or casual observation. Somebody heard that somebody else had said something, and on such statements men occupying responsible and honourable positions in the community have been subject to harsh treatment. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Wallace) recently brought before the House the case of the Rev. Father Jerger, .who has been in terned. I do not desire to discuss the there - merits of his case other than to say that so far as I have been able to gather from what was said in the House, and from correspondence which,has been submitted to me, in his. case also, there is an utter absence of any tangible charge or evidence. This was another case of hearsay. Certain remarks are made that in somebody's opinion a gentleman has been saying or doing something that seems suspicious, amd on flimsy evidence of that character, the Defence Department, in its peculiar anxiety to interfere as much as possible in the affairs of Australia, rushes in and causes all this trouble and inconvenience. I do not mention these matters because of any"" sympathy with people who are likely to be ill-disposed towards Australia or the Empire, or who might be reasonably suspected of sympathy with the enemy. The lives of gentlemen like Father Jerger and Father Doran, of Canowindra, are Yours faithfully, very much like those of public men. P. J . DOEAN. Their actions are not-private, but public. Their whole reputation is eminently popular, in the sense that their lives - are lived in the sight of the whole of the people. Because some one said that a case addressed to one of these gentlemen was broken open, and that rifles were seen in it , he was subjected to this disgraceful and humiliating experience. Then, again, the sisters in the convent obtained a piano from Paling and Com-' pany, of Sydney, and it was immediately reported that they had received four piano cases full of rifles. A man of ordinary intelligence would wonder where these rifles could come from. So far as we know, there is only one source of supply in Australia, and it is - entirely under the control of the Government. could not, therefore, be derived from any local, source. It is much more unlikely that they could be derived from any foreign source. The control of importations by the Commonwealth Government renders such a thing almost impossible. In any event, it is absolutely absurd to associate such a reputable firm as Paling and Company with a consignment of rifle* under the guise of a case containing a piano. One wonders what is the motive behind these allegations. There is nothing to justify the. raiding of either private residences, convents, presbyteries, or the offices of associations. The other day the honourable member for Barrier (Mr . Considine) referred to the raiding of the homes of Italians by the military police, and spoke of the ruthless methods adopted in connection with those raids. The Postmaster-General, who is representing the Government in the House this afternoon, must recognise that these incidents have a very disturbing and irritatin g effect. We are inevitably driftin g towards a condition of things which, instead of helping us to weld the people of Australia into one homogeneous whole-instea d of helping to develop a satisfactory Australian spirit-wil l drive the people of Australia into sections. It would seem that, as the result of these secret service and espionage tactics, we are bringing about a system of secret societies, to which we have hitherto fortunately been strangers in Australia. one wishes to see their introduction the Commonwealth. The only justification for secret societies is the existence of a Government so unreasonable autocratic that people with grievances to remedy, and rights to protect, are driven by force of circumstances into them. always breeds like. We reap what we sow, and, undoubtedly, Australia, in ing the tares of hatred and disturbance Mr Finlayson. and ill-feeling, is bound to reap a very unsatisfactory harvest. These actions surely have proved their inutility . Surely after three or four years of effort in connection with these matters the Government must have arrived at the conclusion that, so far from having a helpful, they are having a hindering effect. Instead of being beneficial to the win-the-war policy of the Government, these incidents are creating They the most serious obstacles in the way of that policy. Repression and obstruction of this character were, no doubt, the regular methods of Governments in such autocratic countries as Russia years ago, and also in Great Britain centuries ago. We hope that the world had moved since then, but . it would seem that the relapse into barbarism, from which the world is suffering today, has thrown the Government of Australia off its balance, and that it has resorted to the bad methods adopted under the vile system of government obtaining in the days gone by. Is there any hope of improvement, or are we simply to go on protesting here as best we can and finding no redress? Are we to see our country torn, by factions and divided in every unnecessary way in order to carry out a policy that can help no one,, but which must really be detrimental to the best interests of the community? I am not questioning the loyalty of the Government. I do not suggest that - they are less well disposed to the future of Australia now than„the y were before, but I do think that in some particular way their vision has been clouded and . their minds so disturbed by events in Europe that they are unable to exercise that judgment and sanity of conduct which is essential to good government. I propose now to pass to another matter very closely associated with that which I have just been discussing. I No refer to the prohibition of the introducinto tion into Australia of certain publicationswell accepted, well known, and well read, and popularly quoted throughout and other countries. In the Commonwealth Gazette of a recent issue there appeared a list of something over 100 different Like papers, books, pamphlets,. & c , which, are in free circulation in other countries but sow- the admission of which into Australia is denied. A recent prohibition applies to all pamphlets that are being issued by the Union of Democratic Control in Great Britain. Those pamphlets are in free circulation in England, and are the product of some of the keenest minds in the Old Country. They are based on historical facts. No person who has read them can fail to be impressed by their grasp of the facts associated with the present war and their possible effect on the countries of the world. They are written with the pure desire that, as a result of this war, the best shall be done. The honourable member for Barrier has just given me a copy of the Government Gazette containing the list of prohibited publications. There are dozens of pamphlets and books in that list, and, although they are incirculation all the world over, their introduction into Australia is prohibited by the Government because, of some peculiar tender consideration for the feelings of Australians. It makes us wonder whether we are responsible-thinking creatures or merely spoon-fed children, who cari only be allowed to read the works which our mentors-the Win-the-War Government - will allow us to see.",43
143,Mr WEST,Unknown,"We are the best-educated Democracy in the world. Mr FINLAYSON"" - All the statistical publications show that we are the most intelligent, the most highly educated^ community in the world. They show that the proportion of illiterates is lower> the system of education higher, in Australia than in almost auy other country. Why, then, should there be this limitation of books and pamphlets? Why, for instance, should such pamphlets as The Fiddlers, Defeat, and Pursuit-publica tions with a world-wide reputation-be prohibited? Quite lately, another peculiar addition has been made to the list of prohibited publications. In that list, for instance, we find The Ploughshare, a Quaker organ of social reconstruction, published at Graham House, London* E.C, and conducted by an advisory council of eighteen Friends, in addition to the two editors. These are all prominent members of the Society of Friends, two of them having been at different periods Clerk of the London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends-on e of its most important offices in Great Britain. There is also The Last Weapon, by Theodora Wilson. This is a novel by a Friend, representing "" Fearless Love"" as the most powerful weapon in the divine armoury for the conversion of enemies into friends. I have not seen the book, but Theodora Wilson's works are well known. ' If her .argument in this particular book as to fearless love being a powerful weapon for the conversion of enemies into friends is considered undesirable, why do not the Government prohibit Professor Henry Drummond's book, in which he shows that love is the greatest thing in the world. Why do they not prohibit the New Testament, which declares, above all else, that love is the most powerful influence, and that our only hope of overcoming force is not by force, but by love? Yet the one is prohibited and the others are not.",46
144,Mr WBBSTJSB,Unknown,The honourable member speaks with much authority on these' questions.,46
145,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I claim no authority to speak on them, I am speaking only from the standpoint of a common-&ense man. I hope that the sanity of my statements will convince the honourable gentleman, and lead to his removing the cause of t^e complaint that I am, unfortunately, compelled to make. Yet another book which has been prohibited is Whence Gome Wars, published by Headley Bros., Kingsway House, Kingsway, and London, W.C. . This is an official publication, being the first report of the Committee on War and the Social Order, appointed by the London yearly meeting of the Society of Friends. Goodwill: a Journal of International Friendship, and Official Documents Looking Towards Peace, both published in the United States, have also been prohibited. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) said, in another place, that the man who talks peace just now is a traitor to his country. From that view I entirely and absolutely dissent. It is right, in my judgment, to talk of peace at any time and in all circumstances. A resolution in regard to peace should always be in order in any Parliament, and more particularly in order when a war is raging. No matter what may be the conditions responsible for the war, or the reasons for carrying it on, we all look forward with a longing hope to the end of the conflict, and to the day when .peace shall be proclaimed. If the discussion of peace-if the letting in of light the discussion of the subject from aspect, and from the point of view of every nation-is freely allowed, then shall be far more likely to arrive at satisfactory and early termination of all wars, and particularly of the present This is a matter of which I hope the vernment are willin g to take some cognisance. The prohibition of these puballotted lications is not going to help the Governallotted ment one iota in its own win-the-war policy. ' It is> not going ' to make disF loyal citizens loyal, nor is it going cause those who are opposed to the war to enthusiastically support i On the contrary, it is going to compel number of people who today are disColonial turbed < in their minds, and anxious i their thoughts regarding the war, to come much less strong in their support the' Government, and much less inclined to assist them 'just at a time when the vernment need all the assistance that every section of the community can give to them. Nothing"" would be more useful to them at the present time than the dial and hearty co-operation of all classes of the community, but how can they hope to secure that co-operation and that generous assistance while these matters which I have referred are allowed to has exist? 1 Quite recently, I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Watt) whether representations had been made by the Indian Government, or their representathat tives, to the Commonwealth. Government in regard to the conditions of emplovment of Hindoo labourers by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in Fiji. The Acting Prime Minister replied that no represenso tations have been made, that he was not aware of the condition of affairs in Fiji that he had no information in regard the position of the Colonial Sugar Refintrol ing Company; and that the Government's attitude in regard to the matter had not of been considered. The more I look into be this question of the employment doo labourers in Fiji the more serious the proportions thai it assumes. years ago, Professor Andrews was selected by the Indian Government to inquire into the truth of certain reports in circulation followingregarding the treatment of labourers by the Colonial Sugar Company in Fiji, and his report was so Mr Finlayson. condemnatory of the company, and such upon an exposure of the misleading methods every that had been adopted in order to get ' Hindoo labourers to volunteer for work in we F i j i , that the Indian Government were a greatly alarmed over the matter. Certain well defined ]>romises and clear, distinct, war. and unambiguous statements were made Goin order to induce Hindoos to volunteer for work in the sugar plantations in F i j i . They were offered a free passage to their destination, free housing at their plantation, Is. per diem for six days a week, the opportunity to settle in i j i after five years, and a free return tb passage to India after ten years, that is, after re-indenture. The report furnished t . by Professor Andrews caused a consider a able tightening of ""the conditions, and the Sugar Refining Company were n compelled to promise certain reforms. At bea later date the Indian Government ap son to visit F i j i , and report whether the Goreforms had been loyally observed. Professor Andrews was recently in Melbourne, and I bad the honour and good fortune to have a fairly long 'interview corwith him. I am concerned in the matter, because if our fellow British subjects are being ill-treated a reflection is cast upon Australia. The Indian Government claims that, as the Colonial Sugar Refining Comto pany is an Australian company, which extended its operations to F i j i , the Commonwealth Government is, to an exActing tent, responsible for th'» manner in which any the company conducts its business. Naturally, educated Indians understand the Commonwealth Government has no control in F i j i , anil that this company is ""practically beyond our jurisdiction, so far as its operations in the island are concerned, but the average Indian, not being well acquainted with the conditions of international relationship, and thinking ; that, as this company is an Australian to one, we must necessarily have some conover it , holds this unfortunate and humiliating business of the treatment Hindoo labourers in Fij i to a charge against the Comof Hinmonwealth Government. The Acting are Prime Minister says that he is not aware Some of the conditions that obtain in F i j i . The Federal Independent, a Sydney religious journal, recently published the Hindoo Refining I - THE COOLIE LINE'S. Coolie "" lines"" are the buildings erected for housing the indentured Indians. To speak of these shanties as homes would be to insult the English language. They are more like cattlestalls in which privacy and decency are impossible. These lines have become sinks of vice and immorality. Four women to ten men is about the proportion allowed by recruiting regulations. This immense sexual disparity becomes the occasion of outbursts, and murders arising fro m sexual jealousy are frequent. A Hindoo husband, arriving in F i j i with his wife and family, is quickly given to understand that his wife must become common property, and she does. The man is helpless, the conditions being such as to make resistance futile. The C.S.R. has been asked to help minimize this shocking state of affairs and provide some little safeguards in providing decent accommodation for at least the married couples and tlieir families. But the appeal has been in vain. II - TH E PLANTATIONS. In the sugar plantations, gangs of twenty to t h i r t y women are employed. These are overseered often by lads of twenty years of age, engaged and sent out from Sydney. youths have charge of the operations in the cane-fields, where the cane often grows to 9 feet high. A few steps into the cane, and there is perfect seclusion. Many of these Indian women are prostitutes, made such by the very conditions under which they have been recruited. Let the mothers in the pure homes of New South Wales, whence these boy-managers have been sent, realise the awful temptation into which their lads are thus thrown; let them conceive the worse possible, because the worse is done. Here, again, the C.S.E. has been approached and asked to stop this practice of placing mere immature youths in such positions of moral peril, and replacing them by older and more experienced men. Again the appeal has been refused, and for the following reasons:(1) The women coolies are more manageable than the men; hence younger men suffice. (2) The younger managers can pick up the coolie language quicker at the lips of the women than at the lips of the men. Thus, for purely economic considerations, Australian lads are placed in moral jeopardy. But this is not all. It would be well for the blood guiltiness of the Christian holders of C.S.R. scrip if it were. But worse remains to he said. III - WOMEN' S HOSPITALS. The C.S.B. is compelled by law to erect hospitals for the coolies. These contain erections for the women, into which they flock in their maternity troubles, whilst female diseases are of necessity rampant. Now, common decency, to say nothing of common humanity, would suggest that these women's wards be under the supervision of matrons. These women's wards are in the charge of. men (not doctors) who have the merest smattering of medical knowledge-me n picked up anywhere and anyhow. What it means to a Hindoo woman to be mauled about by a man - and he a foreigner-onl y tliose who know the [167] Hindoo character can full y realise. We have staying with us, as we write this, the Rev. C. F. Andrews, M.A., who, commissioned by the Women's Council of India, has spent some months in F i j i , and at great pains, and even peril, has been investigating this woman side of the coolie situation; and he says it is impossible for any European to gauge the outraged sense of degradation that is felt by Indian women at these abominable sexual conditions. The C.S.R. was explicitly asked by Mr . Andrews, in the name of the women of India, to at least place matrons in charge of these women's wards, and give them trained nurses. But, notwithstanding the fact that there are ladies in Australia who, through Mr Andrews, willingly volunteered to take up this work, the C.S.R. curtly turned down his request, and declined any further communication with him. In a M e l b o u r n e paper, q u it e recently,- the following appearedI t is interesting to read a statement by the Rev. J. Burton to the effect that male Indian These coolies who worked on the F i j i a n sugar plantations, were paid ls . per day "" if they did work enough to satisfy the overseers,"" while the women received Gd. per day. The rabbit warrens into which the coolies' families were crowded, Mr Burton also said, measure 8 feet by 10 feet, the partitions between them leaving "" much to be desired."" At the same meeting, Mrs James Booth is reported to have stated that the C.S.R. Co. was making such profits that it was at some pains to hide them. It acknowledged 40 per cent., and was credited with 50 per cent., while it had made £100,000 extra in war profits. Further, the same speaker pointed out, only for t y coolie women were allowed to land in F i j i to every 100 men, because women were not such good economic assets, and the moral degradation resulting fro m such a state of affairs she described aa appalling. The dreadful conditions maintaining among these workers showed in the suicide statistics, the rateamong these unfortunates being stated to be 1,000 times greater in' F i j i than in their own homeland'; the increase in murders, on the same basis 'of comparison, was eightyfold. In j u x t a p o s it i o n to that record w e have the f a c t that the Colonial Sugar R e f in in g C o m p a n y last h a l f - y e ar made it s u s u a l £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 p r of it . The danger to Australia in regard to t h is matter is that , before very long-Professo r And r e w s has estimated it as lik e ly, to be with in the n e x t five years - Indi a will absolutely refuse to 1 do any business, in Australia unless w e take some steps to remedy t h is state of affairs. It is easy enough to say, "" What can Australia, do ? We have no responsiBut no. b i l it y in regard to F i j i . It is an independent C r o w n colony, and o u r j u r is d i c t i o n does not extend over it . "" Indi a does not view the matter in the same l i g h t . The. people of Indi a c l a i m . that we have a m o r a l r i g h t to c o n t r o l the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, in regard to its Fiji The company finds its principal market New Zealand, but it has repeatedly made up the deficiency in Australia's producnexion tion of sugar from its F i j i plantations. One wonders, after all , if we have vanced very much during recent years. The conditions brought about by the same company's operations in Queensland, when working with Kanaka labour, caused such a revulsion of feeling a few years among educated people, and among Chrissaid tian communities, that the Commonwealth Government were compelled to cause an abandonment of the employment of Kanaka labour in that State. worse state, of affairs is found in F i j used to shudder at reading of the Congo atrocities by the Belgians; yet here, our own doors, are atrocities inflicted fellow British subjects, while we seem helpless to interfere.",46

147,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"And by an AusHotels tralian company. I happen to know that Professor Andrews did have an interview with a responsible Minister of the Comqualified success."" monwealth Government. The Acting haps Prime Minister, in reply to my questions, said that the matter had not been conthan sidered by the Government; and evidently Australia. the Minister concerned was not strongly impressed with the statements made by the Professor Andrews. But the report  a Commission, were sent o u t by the Indian Government, should be available 'very pressed soon. I am satisfied that the India Government desires to live in the closest harmony and the most kindly relationovercoming ship with the Australian Government; the but, unless something is done in-regard to this matter, and some remedy found for the treatment of the Hindoo labourers F i j i , we shall be involved in an unfortu nate dispute with the Indian Government, which will not make for our comfort.'in tending his particular Department; Australia, and may cause some intercan national difficulty. I hope the Governagree ment will take the matter into considerasatisfaction. tion, and relieve us from any dangers this respect. There is one other matter to which I departial. sire to briefly refer, based, again, on some questions which I put to the Acting Prime by the files of the newspapers Minister, and the .unsatisfactory answers in the Northern Territory. thereto. On the 12th A p r i l , I put pages taken from the Northern certain questions to the Minister for products. Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) in as to the position of affairs in the Northern Territory, particularly in conw it h the conduct of the State hotels. The Minister was good enough to adfavour me with a statement of the revenue and - expenditure, which, for the six months ending the 31st December, 1917, shows receipts amounting to £30,450, and an expenditure of £25,850, leaving a ago credit balance of £4,600. The Minister that he was not aware of any serious dissatisfaction with the conduct of the State hotels, and, in reply to a question as to whether he would allow the resiEven a dents of the Northern Territory to dei .

It is rather significant that a few days later, the following reference to an oflicial report appeared in the Melbourne newspapers:In a report to the Home and Territories Department, Mr J. W..

In the issue of the Northern Territory Times Gazette, dated Saturday, 16th February, 1918, there is a leading article headed ""-State Hotels,"" in which, inter alia, we findThe State hotels ar.e manifestly on wrong lines. They are proving a bane, and not blessing. They are existing almost solely liquor dispensaries, and the quality of wares is seriously questioned. When the State assumed ownership', a great opportunity offered for reform by way of ing the hotels social centres of an approved type. Man is essentially a social animal, Darwin offers little by way of social attracprints. tions. The State as hotel proprietor might reasonably have been expected to make strenuous efforts to strengthen the social side of the institution, and to reduce to a minimum the degrading influences following on the abuse of intoxicants. . . . drunkenness is prevalent, and the hotels are in ing disrepute. And with the moat damning evidence daily before us we have reluctantly found ourselves in duty bound to assert that the State is engaged in a .trade which is grading its citizens. In the same newspaper of 16th February, there is a long letter signed by "" Disany gusted,"" who says, inter aliaThe whole circumstances connected with acquisition of the various hotels in the ern Territory have been deplorable, and the results which have arisen therefrom have proved even a hundred times more deplorable. . . Judging from the fact that there is drunkenness and disgusting language rampant at the State hotels and so seldom any police interference, it would certainly appear State hotels are a law unto themselves in all niatters, and the licensing laws of South tralia, and even the jocular ordinances specting sanitation, overcrowding, health, of rooms, &c, which at one time were so tively used. to hinder and annoy hotel keepers and property-owners who did not belong the caterpillar club, are now more honoured in the breach than the observance. . . . The State hotels at Darwin, according to had . recently left the generally accepted ideas, were established the purpose of putting down the sly shops, supplying the public with comfortable accommodation and decent grog at reasonable prices, and to decrease the amount of ness. Not a single one of these objectives have yet been realized, nor, under .existing ditions, are they ever likely to be. The State [167]- 2 hotels at Darwin are a standing disgrace to the Commonwealth Government. One other extract from the same newspaper of the 23rd February will sufficeThe Supervisor of State Hotels, Mr J. W. Callan, interviewed on the conduct of State hotels and recent criticism, put up a spirited May I defence. He holds that the hotels are proving a blessing, not a bane, that the quality of the liquor is good, that sly grog-establishments are a negligible quantity, that programmes for improvement have long since been launched, nnd and only await time and money for accomplishment. Recent issues of that newspaper disclose that the publio indignation is even more marked because of that statement of the supervisor than it was before. As I have a said, the supervisor cannot be taken as on an authority on the matter; he is not; their and eannot be expected to be, an impartial judge, and it would be much more makreliable for the Commonwealth to estimate the public view of the matter from and the letters that appear in the publio",49
148,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,You would not appjy moral and that doctrine generally?,50
149,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Certainl y not; but the liquor business enters into the shocksocial life of the commumity in a way that very few other institutions do. Everybody is more or less interested, and we may generally arrive at the feeling of dethe public on a social question of that sort more clearly by the attitude of the newspapers and the letters therein than on other subject. Some time last year, I quoted from an article in the Brisbane the Courier, written by Mr MACMahon, who Northhad visited the Territory. That gentleman's writings regarding Northern Australia, Papua, and German New Guinea so much are now very freely quoted; indeed, several magazines today are publishing his articles as those of a recognised that authority. Although I do not agree with Aushim in his general deductions in some redirections, I must say that he draws a size very vivid, lurid picture of the condieffection of things in Darwin re the State hotels. I remember that when I quoted to extracts from his report, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford), who Department for of Home and Territories, followed me in grogthe debate, and expressed the opinion that Mr MACMahon's statements were, drunkenunfortunately, corroborated by independent testimony, and, in hiB opinion, conthe only remedy for the evil of the liquor business in the Nortbern Territory was prohibition. I am not suggesting that the Government is disposed to favourably consider such a policy.",50
150,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I think it is.,51
151,Mr EINLAYSON,Unknown,"I should be delighted to know that the Government is even inclined in that direction. As I stated, I asked, on the 12th A p r i l , whether the Government would allow the people in the Territory an opportunity to decide the question, and I have had a motion on the notice-paper ever since this Parliament opened, to the effect that such opportunity should be given, and that prohibition should there be the law in regard to liquor. One wonders, really, in view of the world-wide events at the present time, and the tremendous Agitation that is convulsing all nations in regard to the liquor traffic, why the Government hesitate to allow the people of the Northern Territory, if not, indeed, the people of the whole of Australia, to determine this matter for themselves. If the Government are afraid-if - they lack the necessary courage to do the big thing, or to risk even a mistake in attempting to do the big thing-ar e they prepared to allow the people of the Northern Territory to determine the matter? Surely they might be expected to know best, if - not what is best for them, at any rate what they would prefer. A f t e r all, de* mocratic government is based on the fact that the people, who bear the burden of the cost, ought to have a direct say and control in the conduct of public affairs. Unfortunately, the people of the Territory are not represented in this Chamber, and have no voice, not only in legislation, but in' the control of their own affairs. The Government appoints the Administrator and all the officials; in short, it manages everything. If other branches of administration in Northern Territory are as open to strong censure as is this particular Department, it is no wonder that the condition of affairs as disclosed in governmental reports, and particularly in the financial statements, calls for th criticism so severe. I ask the Postmaster-General to bring ibis matter under the notice of the Minister for Home and Territories. When the Estimates are before us, I intend to return to my criticism of the administration pf the Northern'Territory. Some months ago, I referred to events which have recently taken place there, and made certain statements regarding the administration which were not, and cannot be, successf u l l y contradicted. In this case, au immediate remedy can be found, public dissatisfaction can be set at rest, and the Government can show that it desires to do its best for a section of the people who, by reason of their situation, have to suffer many disabilities. I hope that relief may be afforded at an early date.",51
152,Mr OOKSIDINE,Unknown,"Barrier } [5.52]. - Recently the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) , in his peculiar speech, referred to the attitude of the Labour party of Australia towards the war as ""bandy-legged'' and ""cockeyed,"" and he said that no other Labour party elsewhere had taken up a similar attitude. H is . confusion concerning the ideals of Labour in British-speaking countries, recall the anecdote of the scholar who, at an examination, wrote of Oliver Cromwell-confusin g him with Cardinal Wolsey-that on his death-bed his complaint was, "" Would I had served my God as I have served m y K in g . "" The attitude of the British Labour party towards the present world-wide cataclysm is set out pretty clearly in the following letter, written by the president of the Birmingham Trades Council, which has a membership of 100,000 workers. It was addressed to the. Lord Mayor of Birmingham, and was published in the Labour Leader on the 20th December last. It reads as follows:3rd December, 1917. My Lord Mayor, I desire to thank you very sincerely for the kind invitation to be present at the Asquith dinner on the 11th inst., as president of the Birmingham Trades Council, but regret that it is quite impossible for me to accept the same. In common with the workers generally, I the find we have been entirely misled as to the objects of the war, and that, while the invasion of Belgium provided a ""good cry"" for the Government, quite apart from that, this country was committed to fight with France as far back as-1911 (if not earlier) if she. were unhappily involved in war, through Russia or otherwise. The Morocco business of 1911 proves that. Further, the publication of certain secret treaties reveal that the Allies were after more territory, notwithstanding the oft-repeated fable that ""we went into this war with clean hands."" Hence the necessity for us to come out of it with empty hands. So far, no responsible statesman has stated definitely what are the war aims of the Allies save Lord Lansdowne in Ms fine letter, recently, wherein he shows what they should be. But he is repudiated by the War Cabinet and the Government {Northcliff) press. One would have thought the Government would have been intelligent enough to have appreciated Kerensky's position in Eussia, and the necessity of clearly defining her war aims if Eussia was to be retained as her Ally. When asked to co-operate with the Local War Aims Committee, the Labour parly instructed its secretary to write the Central War Aims Committee to enlighten the party as to the objects of the war, and, failing to obtain an intelligent reply, decided it could not cooperate. Since then, we have hoped aiid waited in vain for a clear and unmistakable statement. For that we still wait, and, more important still, for perfect liberty to discuss same when published. We have' heard that one of the aims of the war was "" to make the world safe for Democracy,"" but here at Home Democracy is. muzzled; and, what with conscription (industrial and military), D'Ora the extension of the censorship to pamphlets, &c, the unequal distribution of food, and the food profiteer, we begin to wonder if one of the unavowed war aims of this country's ruling class is to break the power and organization of the workers here at home. Millions of lives have been sacrificed, and the sacrifice is to continue, apparently-and for what? My Lord Mayor, I extremely regret having to write you thus. To do otherwise would be insincere on my part. I have the greatest respect for you as a gentleman and a citizen who has worthily discharged the duties of a high office in a time of great difficulty with conspicuous ability and success. I am, my Lord Mayor, yours sincerely, Then, in the February issue of Current History, a magazine that strongly suprest ports the Allies, the following statements are made in an article on "" The ""War tunate Aims of Labour Parties ""-> Since the Bolsheviki at Brest-Litovsk forced the German leaders to come out into the open as avowed annexationists the temper of the common people throughout the Central Emcide pires has undergone a change. The working tion. of this new and potent influence called Litvinoff, Bolshevist Ambassador to Great Britain, in his speech before the Labour gress at Nottingham, to declare, already hear the rumbling of a storm in Austria from the results of Brest-Litovsk."" The message of the French Socialists to the Bolsheviki, printed in the pages that follow, is another phase of the same movement. The war aims of the British Labour unions and those of the Socialists of the continental coun. tries, while differing widely on the point of readsa German peace, are so nearly alike in other essentials as to give an impression of general solidarity. Upon this solidarity their leaders have based the recent assertion that if the statesmen do not soon make a peace the workers will get together at Stockholm or elsewhere and do it themselves. Under the heading, "" British . Labour's War Aims,"" it is stated thatOne of the steps leading up to the Nottingham resolution was a memorandum on ""Labour's War Aims,"" issued 17th December, 1917, by the Labour party through its secretary, Mr Henderson. The memorandum was passed by the parliamentary committee of the Trade Union Congress and the executive of the Labour party. It declares "" that whatever may have heen the cause of the outbreak of the war, it is clear that the peoples of Europe, who are necessarily the chief sufferers from its horrors, had themselves no hand in it . "" And that ""whatever may have been the objects for which the war was begun, the fundamental purpose of the British Labour movement, in supporting the continuance of the struggle, is that the world may henceforth be made safe for Democracy. . . . The British Labour movement emphatically insists that a foremost condition of peace must be the reparation by the German Government, under the direction of an International Commission, of the wrong admittedly done to Belgium; payment by that Government for all the damage that has resulted from this wrong; and the restoration of Belgium to complete and untrammelled independent sovereignty, leaving to the decision'of the Belgian people the determination of their own future policy in all respects. That sounds like the manifestoes of the State Conferences of the Labour party in Australia The British Labour movement re-affirms its reprobation of the crime against the people of the world by which Alsace and Lorraine were F. W. RUDLAND. forcedly torn from France in 1871; a political blunder, the effects of which have contributed in no small degree to the continuance of unand the growth of militarism in Europe; and profoundly sympathizing with the unforinhabitants of Alsace and Lorraine who have been subjected to so much repression, asks, in accordance with the declaration of the French Socialists, that they shall be allowed, nhder the protection of the supernational authority, or league of nations, freely to dewhat shall be their future political posiM. In the same magazine is an article enContitled, "" British Labour's Message to the "" We can Bolsheviki,"" which saysAgain the British Labour party placed itself on record regarding war issues on 15th January, 1918, in a message to the Eussian people and an appeal to the peoples of Central Europe. The message was prepared by the Labour party t in conjunction with the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress. The text We have reached a crisis in the war. The negotiations at Brest Litovsk have been interrupted because the Germans have refused to admit the principle of self-determination of peoples and the doctrine of no annexations. In thus acting, the Central Powers are speaking clearly in the name of a militarist State. In this crisis the British people must speak, because the Russians can only succeed in their great and perilous task if supported by the people everywhere. The British people must proclaim to Russia and the Central Powers that its aim is identical with Russia's; that we, too, see no solution for the evils of militarism except self-determination and no indemnities. In applying the Russian principle to onr own case, we are conscious of the problems raised, but we do not shrink therefrom. The British people accept the principle of no annexation for the British Empire. This applies in our case to the Middle East, Africa, and India - Mr. We wish to remind the Russian people that Great Britain, taught by the loss of the American colonies in the 18th century, was the first modern State to grant complete self-determination to any group of its inhabitants, for example, the Dominions of Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. We accept the principle also for India and other Dependencies of the British Empire, though we .believe that the record of the British Government here gives little occasion for reproach. We intend to meet this by more rapid development of self-government. We respect the sovereign independence of the Turkish people in their national home, but we believe that the domination of their Government over other people is a hindrance to their own national development. OUT Government is pledged to some of these people-Arabs , Palestinians, Armeniansthat the Ottoman rule shall not again be imposed on them. This responsibility shall be undertaken by the Peace Conference, and a permanent international organization, that we hope will be there constituted. In tropical Africa we repeat our renunciation of annexation. Nobody contends that the black races can govern themselves. They can only make it known that the particular Government under which they have been living is bad in some or all respects, and indicate the specific evils from - which they desire liberation. We believe that the Peace Conference, would be well advised to place all tropical Africa under uniform international control. We adjure the peoples of Central Europe to declare themselves to make their Governments speak for them in answer to Russia and ourselves. We call on them to renounce annexations in Europe with the same good faith in which we are renouncing them in Asia. We call ori them to give the same self-determination to the French, Alsacian, Italian, Polish, and Danish members of their States as Russia has given to Finland, Courland, Lithuania, and Russian Poland. . . . The family interests of dynasties, or the desire of the German, Austrian, or Magyar governing classes to dominate other classes and nationalities must no more be suffered Mr Considine. to prevent self-determination in Central Europe, and thereby imperil it in Europe as a whole, than the interests of British Imperialism or British capitalism must be suffered to do elsewhere.",51

If the world is to be saved, it must be saved by good faith and reciprocity on' the part of all. Do not fail us now. Do not let your Governments drive the British people, as they are driving the Russian people, into the terrible choice between continuing the war and abandoning the only principles that can save the world. If this choice is forced upon us, we shall choose as Russia chose. We shall continue, but the responsibility will be yours. I have read to the House the complete message of the British Labour party to the Bolsheviki. I have not sought to suppress, as the press of Melbourne does, to distort Labour's attitude in Britain for the purpose of hoodwinking the people of Australia into the belief that the British working classes, through their in dustrial and political organizations, take up a different stand from that of the Australian Labour party.  knows that the British Labour party take a very different stand.

Unless the Goverof California officially stays the hanging Tom Mooney, convicted on a charge of murder, he will swing at the end of the hangman's rope the first Friday in May. Last week, in answer to an urgent appeal, the matter was considered by the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, and following a resolution a cable message was despatched to Governor Stephens, of California, urging a review of the whole case. We have received from Tom Mooney direct an appeal dated March 4 last to the workers > Australia, in which a brief history of the "" frame-up"" is outlined. Tom Mooney's Labour letter is as follows:judicial fight is over, so far as my is concerned, but we have the Executive appeal to. The Governor of California is now the only man who can officially stay my hanging or give me my liberty. By the time this letter will have reached you I will be in a death cell at San Quentin Penitentiary, ready to be served up the hangman's snare. I have sent literature to your country all of the facts about our now worldknown case, which I hope has reached, Goyour hands by this time. I am now making my final appeal to you and your fellow-workers in your home land. Solidarity of Lahour throughout the world is the only weapon that can stay the powerful hand of this criminal gang of .' Law and Order' bandits that are thirsting for our innocent blood.

Tom Mooney was published in the Sydney Worker, but when the editor of the Socialist, published in Melbourne, proposed to reprint it in his newspaper, the censor in Victoria refused to allow him to do so.

President Wilson himself has intervened on behalf of this man in response to the representations of the workers of other countries.

It would, seem that a man can be dealt with, not for a breach of the censorship regulations, but for a breach of the interpretation placed upon the regulations by a particular censor. If the censorship is designed to prevent the publication of anything detrimental to the cause of the Allies, I contend that it should operate equitably all over Australia. Tbis is not the only incident of the kind. I had occasion to visit the censor in Victoria, quite recently. One of our people at Broken Hill wrote a book on the industrial history of the Barrier, and had it printed in this State. In that book he referred to the formation of the Labour Volunteer Army, and printed the pledge that the members of that army take. That pledge had already been published in all the daily newspapers in Australia. The'military authorities allowed it to be published while the conscription referendum was in progress, but the censor here refused to allow it to appear in this book. The writer made a reference, also, to a disturbance that occurred at Broken Hill , and remarked that some of those who took part in it had never smelt powder in the trenches. That reference also was cut out of the book by the censor, despite the fact that statements of I the kind had appeared in the Age, the Argils, the Sydney Daily Telegraph, the Sydney Morning Herald, and other newspapers which are opposed to the Labour party. Our papers and publications are not allowed to publish what may appeac in the newspapers that support our political opponents. s",56
184,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,What did the censor say in reply to your representations?,57
185,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"He said that these particular references in the book in question could not be permitted ' since they were detrimental to recruiting. He admitted that he had control of the metropolitan area, and when I asked him why Melbourne newspapers had been allowed to publish the same kind of matter, his reply was, "" That has nothing to do with the question. These statements are detrimental to recruiting, and cannot be allowed to appear in the book."" That kind of administration is absolutely futile, and is calculated only to stir up trouble and dissension in the country. The people may fairly ask why the censor refuses to allow the Labour and Socialist me. newspapers to publish matter that is permitted to appear in the daily newspapers that support our political opponents.",57

187,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I have referred to the differential treatment by the censors of Labour and Socialist journals as compared with their treatment of Liberal and Nationalist da(ily and weekly publications in Australia. If the editor of a Labour or Socialist journal wishes to republish a statement which has already appeared in. a Liberal or Nationalist organ, he is not permitted to do so, and if he does so in defiance of the censor he must put up with the pains and penalties of the law. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Einlayson) has referred to the publications the introduction of which into Australia is prohibited. Even the elected representatives of the people of Australia responsible for the carrying on of the government of the country are not permitted to know what is being published in Labour journals in England, unless they can secure their introduction surreptitiously. Even members of this Parliament are not permitted to know what is taking place, at the heart of the Empire by the perusal of literature the publication of which. is permitted land. That is a scandalous state of things.",57
188,Mr ABCHIBALD,Unknown,"The reason for that is that there is conscription in England, and there is not conscription here.",57
189,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"That is to say that if the people of Australia knew the facts, there would be a great falling off in recruiting.",57
190,Mr GBEGOBT,Unknown,"No , there would be a keener desire for conscription.",57
191,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Then I shall expect the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) to join with me in urging the removal of the prohibition against the introduction of this literature. I am willing to run the risk of a change in the opinion of the people of Australia on the subject of conscription if the honourable member is prepared to join with me in nrging the removal of this prohibition.,57
192,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I should like to join with the honourable member in going to the Front if the authorities would take,57
193,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"On another occasion I shall deal with that aspect of the matter fully, to the satisfaction of the honourable member. The people of Australia are in the matter of the censorship and the prohibition of literature being treated like children. In the home circle a moral censorship is often established, and the children are not permitted to read certain newspapers or periodicals. The present Government are treating the people of Australia in precisely the same manner. They arrogate to themselves the right to say what the people shall be permitted to read, and what views may be placed before them. They further say that members of this Parliament shall not be allowed to form any opinion as to what is taking place elsewhere, except through literature that passes the censorship of the Win-the-war Government, That is the kind of Government that went on under the Czar.",57
194,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I think it was a Lahour Government that appointed the censor.,57

197,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman dissembles his happiness very successfully. Honourable members would do well to peruse the list of publications the introduction of which has been prohibited. They have a very wide range. There are the publications of the Society - of Priends in England, such as Whence Comes War? This is a scientific investigation of the causes that lead to war, and various aspects which are factors mining wars. Then there are two publications by the temperance societies.  ber belong to those bodies?",58
198,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I do not have to belong to a particular organization to urge that it should be given a fair deal. There are on the list Arthur Mee's pamphlets Defeat and The Fiddlers. They have been prohibited, though I suppose honourable members have read them, as they all received copies of them. They were issued by the temperance societies, not with any view to interfere with recruiting, or to prevent the Allies from winning the war, but to point out to soldiers the dangers of the alleged evils of the drink traffic. These publica- day or two. tions are put on the Index Expurgatorius. Then there is Labour's Volunteer Army Song Book, published at Broken Hill . I suppose it is assumed that if honourable members were permitted to read one of the songs composed by one of the chaps at Broken Hill ing the anti-conscription campaign they would become disloyal, and it might have a detrimental effect upon the prosecution' of the war. There is also on the list the publication Shall ail People talk Peace, printed for the Australian Peace Alli ance, and there is Labour Union Socialism and Socialist Labour Unionism, works published long before the war, and that have nothing to do with the war,or the conduct of it.",58
199,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Then why bother about them now?,58
200,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Why do the Government put them on the index? They have nothing to do with either winning or losing the war, and the only reason for (Formal). 4575 putting them on the index is apparently because certain economic interests would be menaced by the spread of these doctrines of Labour Socialism.",58

I turn now to the consideration of another matter' which arose in connection with the Recruiting Conference convened by His Excellency the Governor General. At page 26 of the report of the proceedings of - the Conference, I find that Mr Tudor, referring to certain men who were imprisoned in connection with the general strike, said I understand from the morning papers that they are to be released today.",58

The men placed on their t r i a l at Deniliquin were acquitted, with the exception of two against whom precisely the same evidence was submitted, but in addition it was said that they had belonged to the Industrial Workers of the World organization. That was the only circumstance which, in my opinion, secured their conviction. All the other men charged with the same alleged crime were acquitted. The t r i a l of the balance of the men committed for t r i a l at Deniliquin was cancelled by the State authorities of New South Wales because of the result of the Deniliquin trial. These men were sent back to be tried before the same magistrate, who had committed them for trial, and whose bias is well known in Broken Hill ; and he sentenced them to six months' i m prisonment each.",59

213,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Eden Monaro) [ 8 . 1 ] - I understand that there are between 4,000 and 5,000 enemy subjects interned at Holdsworthy, near Sydney. 'We all know, although we cannot prove it , that these men have many sympathisers outside, and we through the newspapers that occasionally some of them escape, probably with the connivance of persons outside. ever occurred to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to imagine what might happen if , instead of two or three escaping, 2,000 got out with the aid of sympathisers outside, secured arms, commandeered a train, and went to Sydney ? Half of the city could be burnt down, and many people could be killed before the troops could arrive. As there are few soldiers stationed in Sydney itself, the only persons who could intercept them would be the police. A gentleman who looks upon the proximity of this internment camp to Sydney as a menace to the city has drawn my attention to this possible danger. We all know that there are startling rumours abroad concerning the presence of enemy raiders on the coast, and that infantr y have been posted in certain places, and aeroplanes have been stationed along the coast. All these things tend to promote a feeling of alarm among the .people. For that reason, I ask the Minister if he does not think this 1 danger that I have pointed out is 'one that needs careful investigation in order to see whether it would not be in the in terests of the people of Sydney to remove these internees to a place further in land, where they would be less likely to be a menace. How would the people of Melbourne like to have a large camp of enemy subjects, all of them able-bodied men, and nearly all of them trained, within 25 miles of the city ? What could be done if they broke out at midnight? They could do a great deal of damage. I have recently visited Cockatoo Island, where tliere is a large number of men engaged in shipbuilding. There is a feeling of discontent among the old, experienced servants of the Crown employed in that dockyard, because they are being superseded by what are called ""pommies,"" or new chums. I do not wish to labour t i e question, because it is not a ""matter that concerns my . own electorate, but I have spoken to the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) about the matter, and I know that he has already voiced those men's grievances in the House on two or 'three occasions. Manual workers in the employment of the Government are just as much entitled to consideration as are men doing lighter work in offices. It is quite natural for men to , look for hear promotion after having been in the employment of the Government for a number of years, and they should not be Has it passed over by others who have not had the same amount of service. I called attention the other day to a case in connection with the Stores Department, where a draftsman had been appointed over the heads of the experienced storemen. That sort of thing creates a strong feeling of discontent. It also leads to a tremendous expense in teaching these novices the work, which might be avoided by appointing the proper experienced men by promotion. I have already called attention to the extravagance which takes place in that Department. Although the Minister told me, at the time, that he did not thipk there was anything in my complaint, I understand that a saving of at least £ 2 0 to £ 3 0 per week has been effected in regard to the excrescences to which I called attention, and there are many more requiring notice. It is hard to give details without giving names. The men have been very candid to me, and they would be very candid to the Minister if he would give them his word that they would not be victimized. A man who has been in a certain employment, for twenty years, and has built up a little home for his wife and family is not likely to run the risk of baving everything swept away in one act. Of course, he is not victimized in a straight-out fashion, but he becomes a marked mau. If the Honorary Minister in charge of the Navy Department will look into this question at Cockatoo Island, he will find that there is great room for reform, and that he can save a great deal of money. At any rate, he could have the work carried out much more expeditiously. There are men there who have been in our employment for fifteen to twenty years, who have almost sufficient practical knowledge to take charge of the dockyard. Many of them are foremen who could practically turn out a ship. Y e t these men are being superseded, by new chums, who do not know much about their work, and, in fact, have to go for guidance to the men they are bossing. This is not the method the Government should follow if it desires to get good service from its employees.  too Island on Monday, and if the honourable member will supply me with the in formation I promise to go into the matter.",59
214,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I will be very glad to give the Honorary M in ister the information, and I will leave the matter there, for I know that he will do what he says he will do. These men are only working men, but the y are entitled to the same consideration as is shown to highly-paid men. When the Honorary Minister is in Sydney he might also ask some of the practical men there whether something can-' not be done in the way of building, wooden ships. Although we are all assured that steel vessels are the best, if the best is not obtainable we must accept . the second best.

215,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"It is easy for the Honorary Minister to say that he is open to consider any offer, but it is his business .to foster this industry and look into suitable places for shipbuilding.

216,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I can put the Honorary Minister in touchwith the men. I am much obliged to him for his promise. The honourable member, for Dalley can substantiate the statements I have made in regard to Cockatoo Island. I hope that the results of the Minister's visit will be to put the old experienced servants of the Commonwealth on a better wicket. If the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls) had been in the chamber I would have tendered him my best thanks for the service he has rendered - to the Eden-Monaro district by pointing out the unsatisfactory and unfortunate, conditions which prevail at Lithgow; but because the Government employ a large body of men for a certain time it does not necessarily follow that those men should always claim that the Government must keep them in employment. unfortunate employees at Lithgow are brought out from their work by troubles among themselves, but they cannot expect that the Government should be regarded as bound to keep on finding employment for them at Lithgow. That is the worse of the day-labour system. It does away with competition. We should have more contract work and more private enterprise under proper supervision.",60
217,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Of course!,61
218,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I know that the honourable member does not agree with me. He believes in the go-slow policy, but the time has come when we cannot afford to continue the day-labour "" go-slow "" system. Last night the whole cry from honourable members opposite was on behalf of unfortunate men who would not know when they had income tax to pay. I tell honourable, members that the very men on whose Behalf they were speaking are more intelligent than are some of those who were making speeches on their behalf. It is a notorious fact that the main trouble the Commissioner of'Taxation has is chasing after men who will not furnish returns. The honourable member for Macquarie has told us that some of 'these unfortunate men are earning £ 2 5 each per week. I hope that the Honorary Minister will look into the trouble which is occurring at Cockatoo Island, and I trust that the Minister for Defence will consult with his omcers and see whether the internment camp should uot be moved fro m Holdsworthy to a olace a littl e further away from the city,' where it would'not be such a menace.",61
219,Mr WALLACE,Unknown,"West Sydney) [8.151. - I desire to say a few words in reference to the Defence Department. I presume that honourable members upon both sides of the chamber have experienced the same difficulty in dealing with that Department as I have. Some months ago I brought the complaint which I am about to voice under the notice of the Minister for Defence, who promised that if I wrote him, giving full particulars of the case, he would attend to it . . He has attended to it , but apparently the regulations governing the settlement of such matters are entirely unsatisfactory. Take, for instance, the case of an allotment left by a soldier to his mother. If he is a good son, and leaves her a decent The sum, she is penalized to the extent that she does not receive an additional allowance from the Government. On the other hand, if he is not a good son, and leaves her less than he would have paid her if he had remained in Australia, the Government make her an extra allowance of 6d. per day for each dependant under sixteen years of age. I say that that principle is altogether wrong. I do not see why we should discriminate in that way. If a soldier, who is a good son, chooses to leave his mother an allotment of 30s. per week, I fail to see why she should be penalized in any way whatever. If he chose to leave her only 15s. per week, the Government would supplement that sum with an allowance of 6d. per day for each dependant under sixteen years of age. I think that the Department might very well alter the existing practice in this respect. I have written to the Department in connection with it , and have pointed out glaring anomalies in connection with our Defence administration. So far, however, I have received no satisfaction. In my opinion, the M i nister should shake up the departmental officers, especially the staff in the Pay Office, New South Wales. I have now had before me for nine months the case of a man who enlisted under an. assumed name, and embarked for service overseas, leaving his wife and two children in Aus-' tralia without any support whatever. A f t e r getting, numerous affidavits sworn, procuring correspondence from this soldier, and comparing it with the signature on his attestation papers, I ultimately succeeded in convincing the Department that' he was in fact the husband of this woman. A cable was then sent to the Old Country, and the man was finally compelled to admit that he was her husband. The Department thereupon compelled him to allot the woman the sum of 3's-. per day. She is in receipt of that sum now, and she has also received the separation allowance from the time the allotment was made payable. But it can easily be understood that a woman who had been left for nine months, with two children, without any support, was in pretty straitened circumstances, and had incurred a considerable debt. The arrears due to her on account of separation allowance would materially assist her to liquidate her liabilities. The Pay Officer of No. 2 Militar y District promised me nearly three months ago that he would get this matter adjusted. I have written to him several times in reference to this case, but have received only the stereotyped reply that the case is being inquired into. It is the duty of the Minister to shake up these officials.",61
220,Mr WISE,Unknown,If the honourable member will give me the name of the case I will have it looked into.,62
221,Mr WALLACE,Unknown,"I shall be very glad to do so.  ber quite sure that there is not a deed of separation between this man and his wife 1 - Mr WALLACE - I am. The only separation between them is made up of the vast expanse of water between here and Great Britain . Still another matter which I desire to mention has reference to the repatriation scheme. I have in my possession a letter dated 1st May l as t that is, since the Repatriation Department was reconstructed-relatin g to the case of a man who applied to it for an advance of £ 1 0 0 to enaVble him to pur-, chase a steam laundry. The owner of the laundry had promised to allow him fourteen days in which to complete the purchase. Accordingly, the soldier waited upon the officer administering the re-' 'patriation scheme in Sydney, and applied for an. advance of £ 1 0 0 . A f t e r having waited ten or eleven days without receiving any reply, he again interviewed the officer, who informed him that the Board would be meeting in a couple of days, and that his application would then', be placed before it . On the day on which the Board was supposed to meet, the returned soldier once more visited the office, where he was told that the matter had been overlooked, but as the Board was then sitting it would be gone into right away. By this time the owner of the steam laundry had grown impatient, and consequently, he informed the soldier that he could uot Wait any longer. On the very day that the transaction should have been finalized the soldier told him that he had received no intimation: - from the Board regarding the purchase, and, therefore, was obliged to abandon all hope of transacting the business. Three days later he received a letter from the Repatriation Committee intimating that his application had been refused, as they did not consider the proposition a good one. But the anomaly to which I desire to direct attention is that that letter was written two days before it was posted. Even if the communication had been a favourable one, the returned soldier would not have received it in time to have enabled him to purchase the business. This is how he describes the position himselfI am forwarding to you the letter I received from them. You will notice the letter was written on the 24th April, and the Post Office stamp shows that it was not posted t i ll the 27th April, which clearly shows that the letter was lying in the office three days before they thought to p'ost it. They talk about their repatriation for returned soldiers, but if the general public only knew the state of things, I do not think it would help recruiting. If a discharged soldier attending hospital and unable to work goes down there to draw hia 2s. a day sustenance money, he is kept waiting about there all day before he gets it, and there are a lot of us chaps that are unable to stand down there all day. If we could stand down there all day waiting for 2s., we would be able to do our own work. 1 for one, do not go near them, and I know lots more the same way. In voicing the opinion of hundreds of' returned soldiers, I think it time something was done. That is the complaint bf a returned 'soldier. I do not think it is fair that he should be called upon to wait around all day for 2s. sustenance money.",62
222,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,The officials require shaking up. There is no doubt about it .,62
223,Mr WALLACE,Unknown,"Unquestionably they do. Only the other day I was ringing, up No. 2 Militar y District for three-quarters of an hour in an attempt to get connected with Major Evans. I wish inow to say a word or two in regard' to the taking over of our public parks.",62
224,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I would remind the honourable member that that is a matter which. is at present before the House in another form , and, consequently, he will not be in order in discussing the same subject.",62
225,Mr WALLACE,Unknown,"My remarks have no reference to the park which it is pro-, posed to take over under the Landfe Acquisition (Defence) Bill .",62
226,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member will be im order in making a general reference to the matter.,62
227,Mr WALLACE,Unknown,"I wish to refer to Wentworth Park, which is situated in my owu electorate. That park has been taken over by the Commonwealth under the War Precautions Act Regulations. It was vested in trustees, to whom the M in ister for Lands in New South Wales - wrote, informing them that the Commonwealth desired to take it over for the purpose of erecting wool stores thereon. The trustees held a meeting, and agreed, to the Government taking over the park at a rental of £250 per annum. I think that is a scandal upon the administration of the Commonwealth. The Government have no right to take over that park and to mutilate it in the way they are doing. It comprises about 60 acres of land, and is situated between the two most congested areas in Sydney, namely, Pyrinont and the Glebe. Half of the park had already been acquired by a cricket club and a football club, which hold meetings there on Saturday afternoon. The Wool Committee has fenced in another 10 acres of the park, and fig and acorn trees, which are ten and twenty years old-fine trees such as cannot be seen in any other part of Sydney-are being remorselessly cut down. Immediately adjoining the park is Wattle-street, the John Bridges' wool store, and the Co-operative wool stores, whilst on the other side there isi a vacant allotment containing about 5 acres, upon which wool could be conveniently stored,, thereby obviating any necessity for encroaching on Wentworth Park at all. I utterly fail to see what advantage can accrue from the acquisition of this particular recreation reserve. Any wool taken either to or from the park must necessarily be carted, because there is not sumcient depth of water available to admit of its transport by sea. If the Government desire to erect temporary wool stores, why do they not erect them in suburbs where any quantity of vacant land is available for the purpose ? The other day I saw some 200 school children playing at football, cricket, and other games on about three acres of ground. When I went to have a look at the portion fenced of f , the watchman asked me my business, and when I told him, he informed me that he had to be v very careful, because only the day before a number of children, whom he had had to put off the ground, had stoned him. Good luck to them! They showed themselves to have the spirit to resent the taking of their playground. The watchman also told me that the day before, his mate had given a couple of the trespassing children a hiding, and that the fathers of the children had subsequently come down and given the watchman a hiding in return. Mr Wallace. There is no doubt that the people deeply resent 'the taking of this park. When the fencing was commenced, there was an impression that it was the intention of the Government to improve the reserve, - and now that the work of erecting the wool stores has commenced, they fear that it is too late to protest. Personally, I do not think that it is too late, for at present there is only a weatherboard building; and, as the work of preparing the foundations was started only on Thursday last, the Government could very well step in. This site, from the point of view of the Government, has no special economic advantages, seeing that all the wool must he conveyed there by rail, and thence carted to Darling Harbor. It might as well be situated at Wagga, or anywhere else.",62
228,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,The honourable member must admit that Wagga is a little farther away. ,63
229,Mr WALLACE,Unknown,"In any case, there must be the carriage and cartage. It is true that wool stores in this locality would „ be of convenience to wool buyers, but I do not see why the children of Pyrmout and Glebe should lose their playground on that account. A meeting of protest is being held in Sydney to-night, and a deputation will wait on the Commonwealth' Government in due course. It appears that the Cabinet have held a meeting regarding the internment of Father Jerger. If the public are to be prevented from knowing the full facts of this and similar cases, honourable members, at any rate, should be given au opportunity to peruse the papers connected therewith. As things are, a man is interned, or otherwise punished, and we, as members of Parliament, receive letters of protest from our friends. Perhaps some of us may be. intimately connected with the man concerned, and ready to take up the case from another point of view. In the matteT of Father Jerger, I have received several letters, and had numerous interviews, but, owing to the attitude' assumed by the Government, I am able to present only one side of the case. Therefore, I urge that honourable members should be able to ascertain for themselves exactly what are the charges made against Father JergeT, and what evidence theTe is in support of them. That should be the policy pursued in all such cases under the War Precautions Act, and I hope the Government will give serious consideration to the matter.",63
230,Mr GEEGOEY,Unknown,"Dampier) [8.35] I concur in the remarks of the honourable memher for West Sydney (Mr Wallace) as to the repatriation administration. I have very great confidence . in Senator Milieu, who, I believe, is putting brain and energy into the movement; hut a great deal more has yet to be done, and I hope the Government will endeavour to make the conditions for the returned men better than in the past. I regret that the modesty-the retiring and unassuming nature-of the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) has caused him to retire. He was aware that I intended to refer to him, and it is rather unfortunate that he should have left the chamber. Prom this evening's newspaper honourable members may learn that the honourable member today introduced a deputation to the Acting'Prime Minister, on behalf of returned soldiers. We ought to feel proud indeed of the honourable member for the Barrier when we find him with sufficient courage to get into the company of returned soldiers after the'speeches he has made here time after time. At that deputation, Mr. Amos, one of the speakers, said they desired to impress on the Government the absolute necessity of finding work for unemployed returned men. He also said that the deputation was not prepared to say anything against the State War Council, but they protested against thousands of eligible single men being permitted to retain their jobs while men who had fought for their country were workless. That is what was said by a member of a deputation introduced to the. Acting Prime Minister by the honourable member for the Barrier. When the Acting Prime Minister remarked that Mr Amos was raising an argument in favour of conscription, Mr Amos said he was not a conscriptionist. He added that the returned men did not want philanthropy, but they were becoming desperate when they saw fit men enjoying jobs that returned men should have. I am sorry that the honourable member for the Barrier is not now present, because in his speech to-night he said that what he desired was a fair deal, and I would be glad if the Defence Department now gave him a chance to fall in with the view of the deputation he introduced. Two announcements have recently been made by the Defence Department, one is in the form of a regulation permitting boys of eighteen years of age to enlist without the permission of their parents, and the other to the effect that oflicers who are invalided home and desire to go to the Pront again must be discharged and enlist, as privates. I am sure that none of us approve of a regulation which imposes on oflicers, who have won their spurs on the battlefield, the necessity of entering the ranks as privates if they wish to once more' take a hand at the. Pront. It is said that the Government are in receipt of a letter from General s Birdwood, whose desires they are virtually carrying out; but 1 cannot believe that General Birdwood made a request of the kind. 1 do not wish to-night to stress the objection to the enlistment of boys of eighteen without the consent of their parents, but merely to express a hope that the regulation will be re-considered, seeing that it is one which will undoubtedly destroy parental control. There are many families throughout Australia which have lost sons at the Pront, and in which there are younger brothers now just attaining their eighteenth year who have an intense desire to avenge their loss. There are hundreds and hundreds of eligibles in Australia, and yet boys of tender age are to be induced, or seduced, to enlist against their parents' wishes. I am not going to make any threats, but I know there are members on this side, and, I believe, on the other side also, who do not agree with this regulation; and I suggest that it should be re-considered with a view to its amendment.",64
231,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,We ought to have an opportunity to discuss it in the House.,64
232,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"In reply to a question by me, honourable members were told such an opportunity would be given; and, in any case, we could make one on a motion for the adjournment of the House. The regulation has, no doubt, been made in good faith, but it is a mistake; and when there are so many eligibles in the Department it comes with bad grace from the Defence Department. As to the regulation requiring returned officers, if they wish to re-enlist, to de so as privates, I may point to Captain Carmichael, and ask what is the secret of his success in the recruiting field? It is the fact that he won his spurs on the battlefield, and that when on the platform he does not ask others to ""go"" but to ""come"" with him to the Front. These regulations all point to disorganization, and, I am not afraid to say, too much favouritism. There are a number of generals and colonels who never heard a gun. fired except at a review-toy and chocolate soldiers-and, while they are in charge and advising the Minister, this sort of thing goes on. As an instance, I may say that when Engineer officers were required for tunnelling and so forth, the Chamber of Mines in Western Australia, on behalf of the Defence Department, sent out » circular letter inviting men of experience to enlist. The invitation was responded to, in a case that came under my notice, by an inspector of mines, and also by a mining engineer, the latter of whom told me that he was giving up a salary of £55 or £60 a month in order to serve the country. Their papers were approved, and they were told that, if they entered the school and passed the examination they would get commissions. .They made great sacrifices. I am not speaking of two cases alone, because there were about twenty-six others. Perhaps if I had tried to work for one or two, they would have got their commissions, but I wanted no one to receive favours that the others could not get. throwing up their positions those two came over on the pay of privates, and entered the engineering school at Sydney. There they-were ten weeks on infantry training, as well as other work. were six months in the school altogether, and received the pay of privates while there. That school cost the Department over £24,000. Wow see the way the home service man is treated. major, one captain, and nine lieutenants, all home service men; went into the same school. Not one of them had to join the A.I.F., nor did they have to sacrifice anything. The major received the pay of a major, the captain the pay of a captain, and the lieutenants the pay of lieutenants, and in addition 3s. per day field allowance. If they failed to pass they simply went back to their duties. Twenty-six or more of the other men passed through the school with credit. Mr Gregory. Two of them-Colbra n and Pearce- I saw, and they were sent away as privates. They and the others had not only passed through the school, but had been recommended for commissions. Then, after all the sacrifices they had made, they were told they could have their discharges, or go away as privates. Is there not something wrong in the Department when the home service man can get all these concessions granted to him, while others are treated in that way after the country has spent over £24,000 to make offioers of them? They were told that there was no room for them, and that the Department did not want officers. I asked here how many unattached infantry oflicers went away on the Nestor and the Ormond. I was told over fifty, and that was in the last few months. These were unattached men who had beeu hanging about here. They were sent to the Front as officers, yet the men L speak of were told they could go away as privates or go outside. The Department would not even make them sergeants. When the University boys recently formed a corps, one young fellow, who had had some previous training in the Citizen.' Forces, went into the Non-Commissioned Officers' School that, was just starting - Being a wonderfully clever lad, he got through, and has since been gazetted a sergeant. There was no favouritism in this case, but why is a Non-Commissioned Officers' After School wanted now, and how is it that sergeants can be gazetted today, when all these specially-trained men who passed through the engineers' school six months ago, after six months' training, and They recommended for commissions, are treated as they have been ? How is it that they could not be offered positions as sergeants? There is something very' wrong. I want the Minister to have these One things well looked into, particularly with regard to returned oflicers. If a man wins his spurs at the Front, surely he should have his commission ten thousand times sooner than a man who goes through a school now, and goes to the Front for the first time. A statement was published in the Argus yesterday from the Defence Department to the effect that, at the request of General Birdwood, oflicers who returned from the Front are to be discharged, and if they want to go back must go back as privates. No finer recruiting agent can be found than the soldier who has been wounded at the Front, and come back here to recuperate, if he is fit to go to the Front again, and can go outside and say to the eligibles, not "" Will you go to the F r o n t ? "" but "" Will you come with me to the F r o n t ?"" I hope the Department will also take into serious consideration the regulation just framed permitting boys of eighteen to enlist without the consent of their parents. W it h regard to the men who went through the Engineers' Training School, it was unfair, to say the least of it , that after they had made big sacrifices, thrown up good positions, spent twelve months in the Department on a private's pay, fulfilled every condition, and passed their examination, they should be told they could go away as privates or get their discharge.. It shows very poor administration and a species of morality that marks a very poor military code. Mr HIGGS '(Capricornia) [8.52] Some little time ago I spoke on a niotion proposed by the Prime Minister, that we should go to thebitter end to secure a victorious peace and the freedom of the world - I said then that it was a foolish motion, as it meant that we were going to carry out the oft-repeated statement of the Prime Minister that we would crush Germany, stop German trade, and boycott Germans for all time.",64
233,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,That was not in the motion.,66
234,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"No . I said we ought to express ourselves as favourable to peace by negotiation, and that, though the Germans were pushing' back the Allied Armies, and had even succeeded in pushing us back within a fortnight or a month over territory that it had taken us two or three years to win, they could not possibly beat the Allies. I have been taken to task by the Minister for Defence for that speech. I am supported in my view that the Germans cannot defeat the Allies by a recent statement by Lloyd George, appearing under large headlines in the daily pressLLOYD GEORGE: VISIT TO THE WEST ERONT: RETURNS IN HIGH SPIRITS: GENERAL FOCH CONFIDENT. In (in interview, Mr Lloyd George expressed himself as having been amazed at the confidence shown by every one at the Front. He met no pacifists or pessimists. They were all confident they were winning the war, and were making the enemy pay a heavy price for the ground won.",66
235,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Does not Lloyd George want a victorious peace?,66
236,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"He says so, but he is a boastful man, and he and the Prime M i nister of the Commonwealth have done more to prolong the war tlian any other two men on the Allied side. Senator Pearce was good enough to say that ""to talk of peace by negotiation was either midsummer madness or treachery of the deepest dye,"" and that any man who advocated it was either a madman or a traitor.",66
237,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,He is not far wrong.,66
238,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I advocate peace by negotiation, and I am neither a madman nor a traitor of the deepest dye. I protest against the refusal of the British Allies to discuss peace with the Germanic Allies. I would urge the British Allies to agree to an armistice on all Fronts, and agree to hold an open conference, not a secret one, of representatives of the belligerents, together with representatives of such neutral countries as will be acceptable to both sides. If the Germanic Allies will not agree to an honourable peace, of course this dreadful war must go on.",66
239,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,DO you regard the Russian peace or the Roumanian peace as honourable ?,66
240,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"As an honourable member said this evening, the general body of Russians are in - a far better position today, with all their civil war and all their quarrelling, than they were under the tyrannous regime of the Czar and the people about him.",66
241,Mr WISE,Unknown,That was not the alternative.,66
242,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,What was the alternative 1,66
243,Mr WISE,Unknown,"They had had the revolution, and they were winning the war.",66
244,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"What assistance did we givethem with the revolution ? Did we show our sympathy with them ? Did we allow any representatives of Great Britain to go to Russia to assure the Russian people thali we were not out for Imperialistic aims? No; we refused to allow anybody to go near them, and the talk of all our statesmen was that there was no sympathy with ,the revolution. It is my deliberate opinion that, just as there were in Paris, during the war of 1870, when the Germans were surrounding that city, people - who would rather see the Germans overrun Paris than their own Communards succeed in their aims, so there are in Great Britai n today people who would prefer to see the Germans win rather than that the aims of the Bolsheviks of Russia should succeed throughout Europe. I am still of opinion ihat, instead of refusing to discuss peace, instead of making speeches thousands of miles from each other, we ought to say we are willing to discuss peace in open conference. Lloyd George, speaking in the House of Commons on 12th February, 1918, said, "" U p to the present, the Allies have had an overwhelming majority of troops on the Western F r o n t . "" That included the time when Russia was at war with Germany. I admit that Major-General Maurice has denied that we had an overwhelming majority of troops on the Western Front, but we have been at war for nearly four years., and have not! succeeded .in breaking through the Hindenburg line. In view of that fact, when are we going to succeed in breaking through it ?",66
245,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,We through it .,67
246,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"And we were pushed back again. We may push the Germans ""back again, and lose hundreds of thousands of meu in doing so. Shall we then have crushed Germany andbrought her to her knees? Shall we then have destroyed German militarism, as the Prime Minister said?",67
247,Mr ABCHIBALD,Unknown,Do you want a German peace?,67
248,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,What does the honourable member mean by a German peace?,67
249,Mr ABCHIBALD,Unknown,A peace made in Germany to suit the Germans.,67
250,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,-We want definitions from these gentlemen who talk of a German peace.,67
251,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Would it not better for Germany to retire fro m the conquered territory before we talk of peace ?,67
252,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Would we retire fro m conquered territory in similar circumstances ?,67
253,Mr WISE,Unknown,E very country is right cept your own.,67
254,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"-That is a foolish remark. It is absurd to say that, because I am speaking in this way, every country is right but our own. The Honorary M in ister had a long period of independence, when he sat on a rail, and could jump down on whichever side paid the better.",67
255,Mr WISE,Unknown,The honourable member knows well that I never did that. Was I paid to go to either side ? The statement should be withdrawn.,67
256,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I withdraw it . The Honorary Minister, being so touchy, should refrain from suggesting that I favour every country but my own. He provoked my remark.",67
257,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Then say a good word for England by way of a change.,67
258,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has beeu a member of the House for about two weeks, and yet interjects more than any other. Older members do not interrupt in this offensive way.",67
259,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"T f my remark was offensive, I withdraw it , and apologize for it .",67
260,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We on this side can read and think as well as those who are opposed to us, and our record shows that we do not favour Prussian militarism. did break Honourable members opposite should, therefore, credit us with good motives. No man can accuse me of having favoured Prussian militarism and tyranny. My political life has been an agitation on behalf of the masses, of the poorer classes, of the under-dog, so to speak. Honourable members opposite are striving to attain the unattainable. A soldier who returned to Australia wounded informed me that in the House of ' Commons generals have stated that the sooner it is recognised that the knock-out blow-the crushing of the Germans, the beating of them to their knees-is impossible, the better it will be for humanity. A statement in yesterday's Argus prompts a reference to the censorship under which we suffer, which be far amounts to a grievous tyranny. The other day an issue of the Labour Gall, a journal with a limited circulation, was seized by the Defence authorities, because the editor inserted full points where passages has been struck out by the censor. .The publisher waited on the Honorary M in ex- ister (Mr Wise) in connection with the matter, and the Minister saw Senator Pearce, but the latter refused to allow the paper to be issued with indications that the censor had cut something out. Yet in yesterday's Argus we have as a big heading, "" English boys at the Front. Who will relieve them ? Appeal to Australians;"" and following it this paragraphImmense reinforcements lately rushed to the Front by Germany have had to be met by great reinforcements from England, which consist very largely of English boys. These youngsters pass hour after hour on the long road towards the Front, with pink cheeks, flushed, big hearts, and slender bodies. The feeling has overcome more than one Australian onlooker of late that many a grown, hardened man is really sheltering behind these youths of England. It is these drafts of English youths thrown into the gaps in the ranks which more than anything cry aloud to grown men of our country to take the burden off them. Is it not advantageous to the enemy to be told that, instead of grown men, English boys with pink cheeks and slender bodies are being put into the firing line. Is not that valuable military information ? Moreover, it is proposed that Australia shall bring herself into line with Great Britain i u this matter by sending her lads to the Front despite the objections of their parents. That is how the big German military machine is to be crushed. Under these circumstances the refusal to talk peace almost prompts me to say something that is in my mind, but I will not say it . One would think that members oppositeshould be the intelligent party. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) who recently told the honourable member' for Batman (Mr Brennan) that he was using language which those on the other side could not understand, this classical scholar, is supported by the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn), who would not be guilty of such snobbish remarks. We might expect gence from the party following them, but Ministers and their followers not intelligent. They are the Stupid party. They first alarm the German people by saying that they are to be crushed and afterwards boycotted, so that the Prussian Junkers can say to their people, "" Lloyd George and Mr Hughes have told you what they are going to do to you if you fail , so you have to fight."" Having created this position, the party opposite blazons to the world the fact that English boys with pink cheeks and slender bodies are being put into the firing line. What is to be said of the censorship that permits the publication of such statements ? I am glad that some bf the members opposite do not think that lads of eighteen-who , because of the taunts that are made by various persons, are under considerable pressure to enlist, and also under great inducement because of the various appeals that are being addressed to them-shoul d be allowed to enlist without their parents' consent. We have no right to send boys tb do what all who have been to the Front realise to be a man's job. I . have spoken of the remarks of Senator Pearce concerning tSiose of us who have talked of peace by negotiation. He has declared that we are midsummer madmen or traitors of the deepest dye. I want to draw attention to a speech made by this same gentleman, Senator 'Pearce. A motion was moved in another place by the late Mr Justice, then Senator, O'Connor, in the following terms:That this House affirms the readiness of Australia to .give all requisite aid to the Mother. Country, in order to bring the present war to an end. That was when England was involved in another war. Speaking to the motion, Senator Pearce saidSurely the time has not arrived when we are afraid",67

On that occasion he saidSurely the time has not arrived when we afraid to hear the criticisms of those not believe that the actions of the British ing our young men there. statesmen are altogether right or justifiable. And then he went on to say- , I cannot support a motion which pledges the support of Australia in men and money to carry the war to any extremity British Government may decide is advisable or right. you Was Senator Pearce called a pro-German at that time 4 Or was he thought to be suffering from midsummer madness? Was he considered a traitor of the deepest dye? Senator Pearce went on to sayWhile we must be loyal to the Empire, we remember that our first duty lies to Australia. The Ministry who rule the destinies of the Empire in Westminster may not always have the interests of this part of the Empire at heart. . . . 1 believe that time is ripe for overtures for peace to be"" made, and it would be generous if the British Government to concede terms that a brave foe, such , "" elseas the Boers are, could accept. Was Senator Pearce called a madman, a traitor, or a disloyalist, because at that time he said the time was ripe to discuss He went on to sayWe have to consider at the present time whether Australia iis justified in offering furaid in the prosecution of this war or of any other war which Great Britain likes to enter upon. say, too, that we have a duty to perform This ultra-loyal gentleman who made this speech, also saidSeeing that we are the junior partner, and a very junior partner, in this concern, are we , not taking upon ourselves more of the responof the Empire than we should be called upon to bear? Are we not neglecting duty to ourselves in taking upon ourselves so much of the responsibilities of Empire? Have we so many of the young and best of onr population that we can spare them for the the honorpurposes of this war?",69
276,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does the honourable gentleman say that there is any parallel between the Boer war and this war?,69
277,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I say that at that time we had only sent, comparatively, a few t thousand men away, and yet Senator Pearce asked the questionHave we so many of the young and best-of population that we can spare them for the purposes of this war? At that time Senator Pearce was about He is now just ^ about within the military age, so at the time to which I refer he would be about thirty years old, and I did not hear that are he volunteered to go. to the war when Engwho do land wanted men. He objected to sendSenator Pearce furthe r saidWe have also to remember that any aid we can send for the prosecution of the war is but very slight for the accomplishment of the end which the Great Britain has in view. That is the argument people are using today. Senator Pearce also saidThe few thousand men we can send will have very little effect in bringing the war to an end more quickly. That is just what is being said today.",69
278,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,But Great B r it did not appeal for men then.,70
279,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"No ; but O'Connor, who was, I believe, then a colleague of the honourable senator, moved the following motionThat this House affirms the readiness Australia to give all the requisite aid Mother Country, in order to bring the present war to an end. Evidently the Government, of which honourable member for Kooyong was a Minister, deemed it necessary to pass that resolution, and I am pointing out that the gentleman who opposed it land in the terms I have been reading was the present Minister for Defence, who scribes me and others who are advocating peace by negotiation as victims of summer madness or traitors of the deepest dye. Senator Pearce continuedI , for one, if asked for a vote upon tion, will say that there shall be no contingents sent to the war. We have done our duty, and have done all that could have expected of us as a part of the Empire and Britishers. Those words are as true today as they were in 1902.

280,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, It is disorderly to make any personal reflection on any honourable member or Minister of the Crown.,70
281,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I withdraw the remark. Senator Pearce has made a veiled attack on me, and I , with a numthe ber of others, who advocate peace by negotiation, have been assailed with most opprobrious epithets, which should not have been used by a gentleman who was a colleague of mine until another person said in a room upstairs, "" Those who ibelieve in me will follow* me."" Senator Pearce and twenty-three others fola in - lowed him , and divided amongst themselves a number of portfolios and posiSenator tions of various kinds. One wonders sometimes why some public men alter their views and attitudes, and I was often mystified until of I visited the Old Country in 1911. I to the found that when gentlemen go to London in a representative capacity, they seem to be hypnotized by the graciousness of Her the Majesty the Queen, the charming manners and modulated voices of the aristocracy, and the boundless hospitality of the rich people. I should say that Engis one of the most attractive places on the globe in late spring and early desummer, and those gentlemen who visit England resemble the Prime Minister mid- (Mr Hughes), who, when he went to Bendigo some little time ago, and was received by all his well-to-do this quesnew supporters, said, "" I am like a further man who has been wandering in the been wilderness for forty years, and I have as now entered the Promised Land, the land of milk and honey."" Representative men who go to London, and are received, in this way, often begin to cherish the idea that they may end their days in England, and, possibly, as Shelley says, see that ""Bask in the sunshine of a Court."" the That is the reason why most public men must who go to England in a representative be capacity never return to Australia the employsame men. They shed their opinions as easily as they shed their Australian no qualiclothes for a Court suit. I desire now to deal with a few matters concern the Treasurer. We have ena duty to our soldiers at the Pront. their Everybody admits that obligation. , 1 to have previously said that nobody has seriously taken into consideration what, this couutry, in justice to itself, can do in the way of sending men to the Front, or in the way of financial aid, keeping in mind our promises to the soldiers and their wives, their widows, and dependants. I mentioned to the Prime Minister some time ago a paragraph which appeared in Argus, of 20th February of this year, to the effect that a councillor of Footscray applied, on behalf of a returned soldier, for a monopoly of the right to gather bottles, and bones at the Footscray rubbish heap. There was an objection to granting a monopoly, because councillors that said other returned soldiers were getting a living in the same way. There must be something radically he on that basis. wrong when returned soldiers are obliged to earn a living in that fashion. recently a deputation representing a couple of hundred returned soldiers pears waited on the Minister for Repatriation Senator Millen) and asked for work. So ar, only about 50,000' or 60,000 of our soldiers have returned. What will happen when the other 200,000 or men come back, as I hope they will ? We have said that we will last mau aud spend out last shilling in the prosecution of this war. not spending the last shilling, because I observe from figures prepared in connection with the last war loan that the assets in the banks of the Commonwealth are £61,000,000 gross more than they were prior to the war. I ask the Treasurer's attention to a few figures, with which possibly he is already acquainted. The revenue for financial years is as follows: Year. 1913-14 (pre-war year) ... 21,741,775 1914-15 1915-16 1916-17 ... ... ... 1917-18 (estimate) ... ... The expenditure for the same years is as follows: Year. 1913-14 (pre-war year) ... 1914-15 ... 1915-16 . ... ... ... 1916-17 1917-18 (estimate) I have not included in those items the interest paid by the Commonwealth on loans to the States, because I imagine that that money will be recoverable. In the pre-war year 1913-14 there was a deficit of £3,574,219, which was paid out of the accumulted funds for old-age pensions, and by means of Australian notes (vide page 15, Financial Statement, 1914-15). In the first war year and following years the deficits were as follow: 191415 - .. £17,849,904 191516 .. 40,266.224 191617 - 53,626,546 191718 (estimate) .. 85,750,907 The total deficit for the five - years works out at £201,077,800. ifr. Higgs. rags, for 1917-18 is estimated to be over £30,000,000 sterling more than was that of 1916-17. We may expect, therefore, the deficit for the year 1918-19 will be, not £85,000,000, but £115,000,000.",70
282,Mr WATT,Unknown,No ; the increase will not,71
283,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I hope the Treasurer is Only right, and that it will not be so much as £30,000,000 more next year, but it apto me that if the war iasts another year we shall have a war debt of £300,000,000.",71
284,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Y o u mean shortage of re300,000 venue supplied by loans?",71
285,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Yes ; it is really a deficit if we raise the money by loan and send our not by ordinary means.,71
286,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The deficit even then We are would be only half of what poor little Roumania is called upon to pay by way of war indemnity.,71
287,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I have not heard what Roumania has been asked to pay. I did hear that Russia was to pay £900,000,000; but, in reading some of the treaties arranged, for example, be the five tween Germany and Austria and the Ukraine Republic, I noted nothing about £ any fine or penalty. In m y opinion, the interest bill per annum will amount to 22,419,798 at least £14,000,000, not including a sink30,762,216 ing f u n d . 34,035,173 Mr Watt - On . the £300,000,000? 35,181,655 Mr HIGGS - Yes, and the item interest on loan for war purposes and sinking fund on loans for war purposes, £ 1917-18, is estimated at £8,461,200 (vide 25,315,994 40,269,702 page 259, Estimates). 71,028,702 The war pensions are estimated to 87,661,719 total £2,600,000, and repatriation is set 120,932,562 down at £1,000,000 (vide page 263, Estimates). These items, together with administrative expenses, come to £3,637,168. When I mentioned the total of £2,600,000, I referred to the figures in the printed Estimates. The item of war pensions at present comes to at least £3,200,000, but we are suffering such f r i g h t f u l - losses that I believe, with the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson) that it will not be long before our war pensions will run to nearer £8,000,000 than to £2,600,000. If we take the items of war interest and the pensions as well, it will be not less than £22,000,000; and those The deficit two items alone will amount to more than the whole of the ordinary revenue of the last pre-war year, namely, £21,741,775. The Treasurer has estimated that he will receive £35,181,655 by way of ordinary revenue for 1917-1.8. But, a year hence, he will want probably £45,000,000 of revenue for ordinary services to pay his way. Whence is he to get that money? Our Estimates of revenue at the present time compare thus with the figures of the last pre-war year:Customs and Excise 13,630,000 14,978,070 Post Office, Telegraph, and Telephone 5,670,000 Land Tax 2,110,000 Income Tax 5,915,000 Special Income Tax, Non-participants 500,000 Succession Duties 900,000 War-time Profits Tax (1916-17 and 1917 -18) 1,000,000 Entertainments Tax 225,000 Coinage 300,000 Defence (1917-18) 2,547,000 Balance of Defenoe Trust' Eund Accounts 33,000 Patents 15,000 Trade Marks, Copyrights and Designs 5,300 Quarantine 15,000 Lighthouses and Light Dues 105,000 Capital Territory 33,700 Northern Territory (excluding Customs and Post Office) 28,400 Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta Railway 22,400 Port Augusta-Oodnadatta Railway 1,500 Darwin-Katherine River Railway 56,000 ' Nil Repayment of States' proportion of Pensions 48,000 Contributions of Offioers to Pensions under State Acts .. . . . 3,000 Sugar.. 85,000 Miscellaneous 910,000 Repayment and Unexpended London balances 825,355 Totals 35,181,655 There is an item relating to sugar£85,000. I do not think we shall taking any of that revenue, since it will all be paid back to the producers. Where is the Treasurer to get the £45,000,000? Hot from Customs, because' if we are have a scientific Protectionist Tariff there will . be no increase in revenue. There may be the aboUtion of penny postage on business circular-letters, but I suggest that the Treasurer should not increase the postage on private correspondence. The newspapers might be asked to pay their way. I wonder whether the newspapers would be so anxious to remain "" bitterenders ""-whethe r they would still urge that we should refuse to discuss peace terms-if they, thought they were likely to be called upon, as they ought to be, to pay a fair share of taxation. We carry Estimates Receipts 1817-18. 1013-14. 20 ozs. of newspapers through the post for a penny, but for 20 ozs. of letters we charge 3s. 4d.

In the balance54,777 sheet for this year there is an item of 4,647 £825,350, re-payment of unexpended London balances. This, it must be pre946 sumed, will not be a permanent source of revenue, so that"" it must be taken into the Treasurer's future reckonings. 36,824 This brings me to another point in regard to the "" bitter-enders,"" whom 2,962 Bernard. Shaw bas dubbed the jusquau Nil boutists. The Prime Minister (Mr. NU Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy Nil (Mr Cook), before leaving for England, made speeches in regard to the war. The 21,741,775 Prime Minister saidThere is only one way to peace, and that is the destruction of the Hohenzollerns and be of the military power of Germany. I shall not weary honourable members by repeating the statement made by Mr Balfour that we could not impose a constituto tion on Germany; that such an attempt had never succeeded, and that it - would not be a good thing if we could impose a thing. constitution on the German people.",71
288,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Lloy d George also makes the same statement.,73
289,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I believe that B statesmen generally are now adopting view. The Minister for the Navy, in his parting speech, referred to the islands the Pacific, and said I am going to London to help the Minister, and I am going to stand behind while he urges that we should retain these islands to the last gasp. There can be no doubt that all end this talk on our part as to the including retention of the islands df the Pacific is embarrassing to British statesmen. They will be led to think that if they turned the islands of the Pacific taken fro m Germany since, the outbreak of the war, the result might be the dismemberin ment of the Empire. that we in Australia desire to retain them for developmental purposes. In this connection I invite honourable members realise the enormous extent of territory already possessed by us. Australia an area of 2,974,581 square miles, and although we have held this country for 130 years, we have today a population less than 5,000,000.",73
290,Mr WISE,Unknown,We want to retain the islands of the Pacific for ourown protection.,73
291,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"When honourable membut bers speak of the retention of these islands in order that we may be better protected, I invite them to think of what is happening today in the Northern ritory. Have they looked at the balanceto sheet for the Territory ?- Here are some figures in regard to it . In 1910rll deficit in respect of the Northern Teris ritory was £166,856. In 1911-12, it was'. £364,368; 1912-13, £388,658; 1913-14, £458,878; 1914-15, £391,S62; 1915-16, £649,518; and 1916-17, £702,385. verification of the first of these items I utterances of every representative, so that refer honourable members to page 20 Australian Financial Statistics, by Mr G. H . Knibbs, and for the last item to page 128 of the Auditor-General's Report let the war go on. for 1916-17. I have no doubt that the deficit in respect of the Northern Terriknows tory for 1918 will be over £700,000.",73
292,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The honourable member is really not putting the figures in the proper way. In one year the redemptions amounted to £490,000, an exceptional",73
293,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The Minister is talking of a Micawber-like way of getting r i d of a debt. Micawber, as we all know, used ritish to write out a fresh IOU , and say, that "" T h a n k God, that's settled."" The Northern Territory has an of area of 523,620 square miles, its largest population, exclusive of Prime aborigines, at any time was in 1890, him when there were 5,366 inhabitants, including Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, and people of other nationalities. At the of 1916, it had a population of 4,767, Europeans; Chinese, Japanese, and people of other nationalities. In .1881 it had a population of 670 Eurorepeans, and in 1913-thirty-tw o years later-ther e were 2,143 Europeans in the Territory. These figures are to be found the Gommonwealth Tear-Book, 1916They will believe, 1917, page 1041. We are losing £700,000 per annum to on the Northern Territory, and yet , the Prime Minister and the Minister has for the Navy say that we must retain 'possession of German New Guinea, which will add to our financial burden by of something like £30,000 per annum. I have no wish .to detain honourable members further. My honourable friends opposite may have the idea that I am suffering from midsummer madness, or that I am ""a traitor of the deepest dye; I repeat that if Australia is to do her duty to our soldiers when they return, and to their dependants, we must have regard to the financial side of this quesTertion. While we must do our level best carry on the war, and. to meet our obligations, we ought to urge Great Britain the and her Allies to say that, if Germany agreeable, they are willing to have an armistice on all Fronts with a view to an open conference to discuss the terms of an honourable peace. Reporters should be For present at that conference to record the of the world may judge who is right and . who is wrong. If Germany will not agree to the terms of an Bonorable peace, then  what Roumania has had to pay by way of indemnity.",73
294,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We do not know the facts; the press .are not allowed to pub- . lish the documentary evidence. We are for some reason in the dark. If honourable members will look at publications received from America, they will see reported in .full the speeches of Count Czernin and Von Hertling. If they compare with those reports the brief extracts which have appeared in the press here, they will recognise that the items we were permitted to see are a travesty upon the utterances of these men.. The censor in this country, instructed by Senator Pearce, who has a distorted view of what is right and proper, is acting in a way which does not find a parallel in any of the allied countries.  the Germans have secured domination over 56,000,000 of Russian subjects.",73
295,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We cannot tell that, because we are not allowed to know the facts.  man will not believe any statement of that kind.",74
296,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We know the lies that have appeared in' the newspapers. In the early part of the war we were informed by the press that because Liebknecht spoke against the war in the German Reichstag he - was executed, or, as a matter of fact, was murdered. Afterwards, of course, that was contradicted.  gentleman believe that Liebknecht is gaol now?",74
297,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I believe he is.  but your own.,74
298,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Thes e cheap taunts of the honourable member for Grey  ing - with the discussion of a subject this. I say they are cheap taunts, because we do not know exactly what has taken place. We know there has been a revolumost tion in Russia, and that there are half-afood dozen different republics there now. know the Germans are there with their armies, and their excuse is that they must have their armies there to maintain some kind of order. ",74
299,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Honourable members know what takes place when there is a volution. At the time of the French volution, all the. privileged classes, lost their privileges by the revolution, combined to make the revolution a to failure. No doubt, the privileged classes in Russia at the present time are combining, so far as they can, to make the Russian revolution a failure, and to restore the Czar to the throne.  gentleman like, to see such a revolution here?",74
300,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The condition of the two countries is not comparable. In Australia we have one adult one vote, and we have free and compulsory education. In Russia, the people were so ground down that, according to the. Statesmen's TearBook, only about 20 per cent, of them could read and write. If honourable members opposite will blindly continue' this war, and refuse to have anything to do with peace by negotiation, they will build up such a mighty mountain of debt that the resolution of the Victorian Railways Union will not be the only resolution that 'will be passed advocating, the repudiation of the war debt. We shall have repudiation advocated everywhere. If honourable members will read the Trustees' Quarterly ""Review, a Queensland publication, they will find in it an article by. Mr Gellatley, recently financial editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, in which it is stated, that there are wealthy men at the present time in England contemplating the in mountain of debt being piled up there, and, in order to meet the bill, some are suggesting the direct method, or a roughand ready method of wiping out a por: tion of the debt. That, of course, is merely another form of repudiation. If honourable members are going to conto blindly refuse to talk peace, and like to make the working classes of all the belligerent countries suffer as they are suffering today-and we have heard the dreadful reports about the lack of in the Old Country-the y must take We very great care that they do not create a number of Industrial Workers of the World men and revolutionary Bolsheviki throughout Europe, and including the United Kingdom. We do not want that. I take it that we desire to bring about as much of the millennium as we recan get in our day and generation by parreliamentary methods. For these reasons I who do hope that honourable members opposite will give up attributing wicked motives those of us who talk as I have talked, and suggesting that we are traitors to the country, and that they will give some ous attention to the financial question, and see how we are to carry out the promises made to our soldiers who have gone to the Pront. .",74
301,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I wish to make a personal explanation. Unfortunately, when the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) was paying some attention to me this evening, I was not in the chamber. The honourable gentleman, in the course of his remarks, said that I was aware that he intended to refer to me .in connection with the deputation of returned soldiers that waited on the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) and the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) this morning. I wish to give that statement an emphatic denial. I had absolutely no knowledge that the honourable gentleman had the slightest intention to mention me in any connection whatever. Further, he referred, in not very nice terms, to my connection with the deputation of returned soldiers, and attempted to connect me with the alleged advocacy of the dismissal of men from their employment because they did not volunteer for the Front. I wish to say that in the report that was published in the Herald, and from which the honourable member for Dampier quoted, the newspaper very carefully omitted certain statements made at the conclusion of the interview.  censor again.",75
302,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I expect so, and the Honorary Minister evidently knows all about it. The press carefully omitted any reference to the fact that at the conclusion of the deputation, with the permission of the Acting Prime Minister, who will bear out my statement, I asked every member of the deputation to say whether he desired that any man who is at present employed should be dismissed from his employment in order to find work for returned soldiers, simply on the ground that he had not gone to the war, for any reason whatever. Every member of the deputation answered "" No "" to that question. The shorthand notes of the deputation will bear out my statement that not one member of it wished to have a single man dismissed from employment by reason of the fact that he had not gone to the war, but they all insisted' that something should be done to business people who promised employees going to the war that their jobs would be kept open for them, seriand did not keep that promise when the men returned from the war.",75
303,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [9.59] - I listened with the greatest interest to every word spoken by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). Perhaps, because the honourable gentleman is not sympathetically inclined, he is unable to understand the views of honourable members on this side which, I believe, are shared by most prudent persons, not only in this section of the British Empire, but throughout the Empire as a whole. I believe that he fails to appreciate the fact that we are not now, as we were at the time of the South African war, engaged in a conflict in which we can afford to do the weak, if the generous, thing. He has failed to appreciate the fact that we are now in a war for our existence, and that how we are to get out of it depends on our awn exertions, and on our loyalty, more than it depends upon any consideration we may expect from our foes. Right through his speech the honourable member seemed to be more prone to believe the intelligence that the other side was putting forth than that which reaches us from our own people overseas. Contrast his reluctance to believe a single word of the harsh terms exacted by Germany from Roumania with the readiness with which he believes every tale of the sufferings of the British working classes; contrast his indignation when we asked what had happened as the result of this same programme of peace ih ""open conference'' at Brest-Litovsk with his concluding admission that Russia was today merely a series of dismembered republics, running red with Russian blood, with Russian arms, aided and abetted by German arms, turned against Russians, and with German annies still marching through a country with which Germany ""has officially declared peace. After the lesson of Russia, how can the honourable member expect us to go blindly into this trap of "" an open conference "" ? Does he realise that the interests of our Allies, upon the coherence of which in this common cause our safety depends, are being separately appealed to by the Germans in every direction? The honourable member, who is a student of international relations, must be aware that there has been a very strong effort directed from Germany for over a year past towards trying, to create trouble between this section of the British Empire, and so between the British Empire, and an Ally of ours in these seas, to whom we are indebted for three years of help. Is not the honourable member aware that in France, for the last year, a gospel has been preached, underground in the cellars, and everywhere, furtively, in the subsidized and bribed press, that France should make peace with Germany at the expense of England? MT. HIOGS - Hav e we not been trying to do the same in regard to Austria?",75
304,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Exactly . The answer to a mere statement of fact is a charge against our own people! If the honourable member holds this attitude of mind, how could he expect people to do other than suspect his motives? I do not suspect his motives, but I put the matter fairly and - squarely to him. A few weeks ago he raised in this House an issue which was quite capable of solution without bringing in international relations; but the honourable member dragged into' that debate the grave injustice that he said we are doing an eastern Ally by following a certain course, and he asked, "" What will they think of us in Japan?"" When he was.speaking was he ignorant of the fact that his very speech would be quoted in Japan by agents of influences hostile to our cause ? If a man behaves indiscreetly, how can he expect other persons, when these indiscretions occur, and are repeated, to have the same confidence in his motives that men who know him well may have in them? I ask the honourable member to be fair, and to realise that we cannot leave this war now of our own choosing, and that Australia, least of all, can leave it of its own choosing. Is he not aware that we have arrived at a period in this struggle when the moral endurance of the peoples at waT is at least as important a factor as is the continued courage and energies of the armies in the field? The honourable member quoted figures and past speeches, and asked whether Australia could materially contribute towards winning the war. If it were not for the fact that we are part of the British Empire, there might be more in what the honourable member says than there is; but Australia is part of the British Empire, and its armies are fighting as near to Paris as Mount Macedon is to Melbourne. Does the honourable member realise what use could be made in the metropolis of France of any weakening on the part of this section of the British Empire? Does he realise how German agents throughout the great republic would say, "" See these flaws beginning in the solidarity of the British Dominions. Ask yourself, Frenchmen, if it is not time to lay down your arms and make your peace, letting Britain stand the cost."" At this time, when Germany realizes that could she break down the Allied endurance she must succeed; it is utter madness for Australia to do anything that can undermine the loyalty and endurance of our friends in Europe. How long could the British Empire stand without the continued friendship of France? One of our greatest troubles in this war has been the strain* on Allied shipping. The honourable member knows that the devastation that has occurred to that shipping has come about in spite of the fact that the whole of the Allied navies have had to watch only 100 miles or so of German and Belgian coast line and a small outlet to the Adriatic. What chance would we have of getting a ton of produce into or out of England if, added to that 100 odd miles of coast line in the North Sea, watched by practically all the navies of the world, we had also to watch the coast of France, with every port and every haven on that coast a new nesting place for underwater piracy? If we lose the friendship and alliance of France we lose our birth right. I appeal to honourable members to realise that every word we say here that spells weakness, whatever may be in the minds of honourable members, may vitally undermine the loyalty of France, upon which the safety of Australia depends. ""Can Australia win the war?"" the honourable member asks. As an old battler in industrial warfare, what would he answer if a unionist said, "" Can any single unionist win a strike""? He would say "" No ; but any man can start a rot."" Any single unionist may lose a strike by starting a rot. It is only by every one standing together that a strike can' be won. That is our position today. We i u Australia must start no rot. We have already done enough harm, and I do not think that this is either the place or the time to add further to our faults in this direction. Let honourable members recognise what has happened to Russia. Russia went into an open conference. Who were the men who brought her into that conference? Who knows who Lenin is; who knows where he was born? Of Trotsky we do know something. We know that before the war broke out he was in Buda Pesth. We know that, although not of Austro-Hungarian birth, he was given a free passage through Austria, and went to Paris.",76
305,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Of what birth is Lord Milner?,77
306,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Of English birth.,77
307,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,He is not.,77
308,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Her e is an honourable member defending Trotsky by libelling Lord Milner, What comradeship is there, between the honourable member and this Trotsky that I should not be permitted to say what I have to say? We have the clear history of this man Trotsky, upon whom lies most of the guilt of this great treachery to Russia. This man went to Paris. There he started to undermine the moral resistance of the Prench people, and, as a result, was ejected from Prance. He then went to America, and when Kerensky began the bond fide and beneficial revolution of the Russian people, in a moment of weakness he asked the British Government to let Trotsky, whose activities in Europe had been known and marked, return to Russia. Although Trotsky was held up at Halifax as a German agent,'he was given a free passport back to Russia. Why did the Austrians give him a passport? Why did the French Republic eject him from France?",77
309,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Because his presence was inimical to the interests of the capiRoumania, talists of France.",77
310,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I think that democratic history will (remember the name of . Clemenceau iwhen the inhabitants of Broken Hill have forgotten that ever their present representative lived. I do not hesitate to say that any man who attempts to make the public believe that France is in the war for capitalistic purposes must be either the very soul of audacity, or must be bereft of sense. I only want to ask those who in this chamber give utterance to these dangerous and dividing sentiments, ""Where did Trotsky lead his dupes?"" At the time of which I speak, there were to be "" no indemnities and no annexations."" The Russian people believed that. Russia was as eagerly desirous of peace as is every man in this chamber. All through Russia peace was desired, and "" No annexations and no indemnities "" was the cry raised. That cry had some foundation at the time, because the German Reichstadt had given its voice in - that direction. Russia's representatives went to the open conference at BrestLitovsk. To-day where is their peace?",77
311,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,They are in pieces!,77
312,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"They are in pieces, and today armies are marching here and there through Russia, not to maintain order, but to seize what wheat they can find and send it back to Germany. To rob the Russian people of their stores of food, these German armies are traversing the country with which they have just concluded peace. ""No annexations,"" they said. How many persons of Russian birth are now under German control, and are-if the existing peace stands-for all time doomed to the lot of the Polish people, who have been under the heel of Germany ! There were to be no indemnities, we were told, and yet today the very food of Russia is being stolen by the armed forces of Germany after the declaration of peace! Down south is that poor little country, Roumania, which certainly put up a fight worthy of the admiration of the world. She is now defenceless, abandoned by her ' great neighbour, at whose call she entered the war. I do not ask honourable members to believe all that they read in the newspapers, but I do ask them to remember what has happened to and to inquire what is likely to happen to us, in the light of her experience, if Germany should prove triumphant in this struggle. I believe that every word we utter here, which tends in any way to spoil our cohesion, is a blow aimed at the heart of Australian liberty and at our continued existence. I believe that our best chance of winning through is to show ourselves worthy of the Allies whom we still have.",77
313,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,That same argument was used to back up every autocratic repressive measure in Eussia prior to the revolution.,77
314,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am grateful indeed for that interjection, and I am glad that only the honourable member has made it . He talks of repressive measures. Why, the only repressive measures which the Allies are urging are directed against the blood-madness and the blood-lust of Germany! Do not let us try to score off each other here, as if this were merely a debating society. We may be unimportant units of a people who may one day be trul y great, but this is our chance to show to the world that we t r u l y realise our opportunities here. Do not let us seek to make points off each other.. Let us recognise that the safety of this country depends upon our doing nothing to weaken Allied cohesion. I am sure that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) will not regret the tone in which I have addressed myself to his speech. I do hope that he will realise that honourable members upon this side of the House are just as earnestly anxious for peace as he is. But we recognise that the only chance of securing a peace which will not mean that every drop of Australian blood shed in this war shall have been wasted is to get a peace which will be made lasting by the fact that Germany's outrages against civilization have been proved to be of no value to her. Before concluding, I wish to Tefer to a method adopted by the last Parliament in dealing with German trade in this country. Honourable members will doubtless recollect that shortly after the declaration of war, branch houses of great German manufacturing concerns in the United States were given by their parent houses the right to exploit B r it is h dominions. A f t e r considerable time, this Parliament. decided that goods covered by enemy trade marks and trade descriptions should not be allowed into Australia. I hold in my hand a letter from the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Jensen), and in connection therewith I take this the earliest opportunity to voice my humble protest. Honourable members know that if a name is owned in Germany, ultimately the trade in connection with the name will revert to its German owners. The good-will is only kept alive if we allow goods covered by those namesthe to come in from neutral or Allied countries until Germany is again in a position 1 to resume her trade. The other day I asked the Minister if he would do his best to see that Bosch magnetos-the well known trade name of a German-made magneto which was very popular before the war",78
315,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It was probably the best on the market.,78
316,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I do not know that it is the best today.,78
317,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Probably it was then the best on the market.,78
318,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I would not even say that, but it was a very popular magneto. In any case, the Government did, at an early stage, declare these magnetos to be of enemy origin, and they were for a long time prohibited from entering the country. Quite recently a company, named the Bosch Magneto Company, has been f ormed in America, and is importing magnetos as "" Bosch magnetos "" into Australia today. I ask that that practice shall be discontinued. .This is the letter, dated 8th May, I received from the Customs Department Department of Trade and Customs, Melbourne, 8th May, 1918. Dear Mr Kelly, In reply to your question in regard to the importation of Bosch magnetos made in America, I desire to inform you that this type of magneto was not, at the outbreak of war, registered under the Trades Marks Act in Australia, but on the 30th December, 1915, the Bosch Magneto Company Limited was proclaimed an enemy company, which had the effect of excluding from Australia any goods produced ,by this company in any part of the world. It was represented by numerous importers early this year that the Bosch Magneto Company in the United States of America was not in any way controlled by enemy persons, and this fact was substantiated by the United States of America Government. On the advice of the Attorney-General, the proclamation of 30th December, 1915 was revoked, and a new one was issued, making the Bosch Magneto Company Limited, of Stuttgart, Germany, an enemy company, thus prohibiting the importation of Bosch magnetos made in England, Prance, and the United States of America, or any non-enemy country. The word "" Bosch "" has become associated with a particular type of magneto, and does not necessarily infer that a magneto hearing this name is of enemy origin, although no doubt the type was originally conceived in Germany.",78
319,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,This is as bad as 4711.,78
320,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is almost the same thing exactly. What - will happen after war? We shall have clever German traders coming back amongst us and telling the people that while, for perhaps two years or six months, they have been buying magnetos manufactured in England, America, and France, they are now offered the real thing, which manufacturers in those countries have tried to copy, and have not succeeded in copying well. The very fact the name is put in front of the people is a guarantee that the German trader will again recover his trade after the war. This is the time to abolish the value of German trade here, and the way to abolish it is by abolishing all German trade names and descriptions. I make this final appeal to the Minister to stop this happening wherever it raises its head. I do not believe that any Government will make such investigation into the enemy origin of any firm as will guarantee that firm's nature remaining as it was at the time it was investigated. A firm may exist today and manipulate the trade good-will in fhis Bosch magneto, and what guarantee have we that the shareholders in the firm are all persons of non-enemy origin, or are not dummies 1 What guarantee have we that the shareholders, will be the same next month. The shares are on the market, and German influence can buy them at any moment. The only safety we have in this connection is to abolish those trade names wherever we find them, and I appeal to the Minister in charge of the House > at the moment to make a note of my protest.",78
321,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,^ I have done so.,79
322,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The r e is not only a test voiced by my humble self, but I understand that the matter has been brought officially to the notice of the Government by the Mother Country's representatives in this country, and I ask that the practice of admitting these articles under an original German name be discontinued from this hour.",79
323,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [10.27] - I wish to refer particularly to the administration of the censorship. At the recent Recruiting Conference the Prime M in ister promised that the censorship' should be administered said that a Press Conference, which was then sitting, would deal with the matter. I pointed out that it was quite possible the Press Conference would not look at the matter from the same point of view as other persons might; and I understand that the findings' of that Conference have never been made public. From what I have heard, however, I understand the decision was that no in formation likely to prove of use or of importance to the enemy, or likely to disturb our friendly relations with our Allies, should be published. Honourable members who have not come very much in contact with the censor may think that everything is going on well in that Department, and that every paper is observing the decision of the press' conference. I have here, however, a duplicate copy of an article which was sent fro m the Labour Gall in Melbourne to the censor, and should have appeared today. It deals with part of the proceedings of the Conference which had to do with the case of Captain Allen, who was an area officer, and afterwards a Brigade-Major in Victoria. This article could give no military information whatever to the enemy, and having read it through, I can say that it certainly would not in any way tend to injure our relations with our Allies. Those responsible for the administration of the censorship have taken on themselves to use it for political purposes; and I take it that, whatever may have been the practice before the Conference at Government House, and the Press Conference, it is not intended ""that the censorship shall in futur e be used in any such way. I accepted the invitation to the Conference at Government House in the spirit in which it was offered, and went there prepared to do my best to further the objects of that pro- Conference. As I say, there is not one word of military importance in the whole of the article that was intended for the Labour Gall, but because the oflicers who administer the censorship consider that it reflects on them, its publication is prohibited. I take it that the Government will not tolerate that kind of thing for five minutes. If it is intended to run the censorship for political purposes, especially in view of the Conference to which I have referred, the sooner we know the fact the better. It was never in tended that area officers should devote the whole of their time to area work. Capfairly , and tain Allen was a supporter of the Labour party, and that apparently was his chief fault. He was selected on his merits as Brigade-Major, the Defence Department apparently knowing nothing of his political opinions at the time. When they found out, I suppose they thought the;; had made a mistake, and wanted to get him out of the position. An inquiry was ordered, to be conducted by Colonel Hawker. General Wiilliams went to Bendigo on the matter, but instead of meeting his military officer at any of the four dril l halls he met him at the Shamrock Hotel, the principal hotel in the city. The inquiry was held, the object being to shift Captain Allen fro m the position of Brigade-Major because he was a political opponent of the party in power. The matter was dealt with at the Conference, and sent as part of the report of the .Conference to the Labour Call. It was submitted to the censor, and the censor cut out the lot, presumably to safeguard his fellow military officers who were responsible for shifting Captain Allen. There is another matter in connection with the censorship that I should like to mention. A paragraph was allowed to appear in Liberty and Progress, which, as honourable members know, is the journal of the Employers Federation, but that same little paragraph, has not been allowed to appear in the Labour Gall. Is there anything in the following which would give military information to the enemy, or be detrimental to our relations with our Allies?There was neither sense nor need for raid-. ing Parliament House in order to seize the Catts' excerpts from Hansard. All that was needed was to declare them non-mailable matter, and let them lie there, or at the Post Office,-or in the gutter. But if there are ninety and nine right ways of doing things, and only one wrong way, the wily bookmaker may take short odds every time that some one in authority will find the wrong way, and do it Liberty and Progress. Do honourable members think it is giving a fair deal for the censor to cut that paragraph out of the Labour Gall ? Here is another paragraph which appeared in the Australian Worker under the heading "" Are We Being Sold?"" It relates to the trip of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy (Mr Cook) to England. It is about 4 inches long; the censor allows four lines to appear, cutting out everything else, although it contains not one item of military importance. I hand these proofs to the Acting Prime M in ister (Mr W at t ) to show what has been censored in the Labour Call this week, so that he may judge if there is anything of military importance in the matter, or [168] ' Avhether the censorship is not being used by certain persons for their own political purposes. I ask only for a fair deal. I hope the Acting Prime Minister will see that the censorship is carried out in accordance with the following statement made by the Prime Minister at the conference at Government House I am not going to. stand here as the protagonist of the censor. I shall not say that if I had been in Mr Tudor's place, I would not have said a great deal more than he has of the censor. As a matter of fact, I have said things of the censorship which would surprise even a hardened Conference like this. It is difficult to get them to carry out the instructions. The trouble is not caused so much by instructions from head-quarters- I mean, of course, Ministerial head-quarters-as by the manner In which perfectly well-meaning men interpret them. I am hopeful, however, that, despite what may be said of criticism as to the wisdom of accepting the decisions of the Press) Censorship Conference as final, a great deal of good will come out of the deliberations of that body. I am not in favour of political censorship. It may be, of course, that a suspicion of party politics attaches to anything done by one party in a time of war, but I want the Conference to understand that I am not in favour of political censorship; and the Government will endeavour, by instructions and administration, to prevent the naval and military censorship being used for political purposes. Many members said at the conference that it was not right to use the censorship for political purposes.. I do not want anything to be published in any part of Australia or elsewhere that is opposed to the Allies' cause, but we have a right to know the truth , and when we find these things are being cut out for political purposes, it makes us doubtful.",79
324,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Y o u can hardly say the purpose is political.,80
325,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It can be called political if a man is barred simply because he happens to be of one political faith. If a paragraph is allowed to appear in Liberty and Progress, why should it not be allowed to appear in the Labour OaUl What is the opinion of the honourable member for Grampians on that point?",80
326,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,It sounds all right.,80
327,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,What I ask is absolutely fair. The honourable member would not like it if Liberty and Progress was. .not allowed to publish something that appeared in the Labour Gall.,80
328,Mr CORSER,Unknown,Why accuse the party of wishing to use the censorship for political purposes ?,80
329,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Prime Minister stated that if he had been in my place he would have, said harder things of the censor than I have. Perhaps it would be better if 1 said that the cutting out of the article relating to Captain Allen was due, not so much to political reasons as to military friendship. If the persons acting as censors repeatedly fail to give a fair deal, as they' are told to do, the remedy is to shift them, a i d put in their places some one else who will do the right thing. No one can defend the knocking out of the extracts I have quoted. The Press Conference, I understand, unanimously carried a motion to the effect that; nothing which would give military information of advantage to the enemy, or be detrimental to the Allies, should be published, and a committee was apr pointed to give effect to the resolution. Still, while things such as I have quoted go on, many persons feel that they are not getting a fair deal. I have had fair treatment from the Acting Prime M in ister, and am glad of the opportunity to bring these matters up while he is present; so that I may get an assurance from him on the subject. Ahout a week ago, the adjournment of the House was moved to protest against the deportation of Italians. I have received a complaint, which I have.' forwarded to the Acting Prime Minister, to the effect that Priday night, at a f r u it and' vegetable shop in my electorate, when the f a m i l y was busily engagedi n attending to customers, three plain clothes policemen came to the front to search; for a man, and at the same time two< military, men jumped the back fence, and went through the living rooms, frightening a child of four and. another of eight who were sleeping there. These men could quite well have stopped at the back gate, because tliere is no side exit,, and no. way of. escape, except at the back, and front. I hope that my complaint has reached the proper quarter. 1 do> not say that all the military or civil police act in this fashion, but. 1 know of another case in. which a house was. searched at 3 o'clock in the morning, one man breaking in at the fron t and another at the back. That was a house in which two sisters were living. Their two brothers had enlisted, and one subsequently ^deserted. Such conduct on the part of the military police is i m proper. When persons are suspected of harboring persons, places can be watched, and a search made under proper conditions, but incidents such as I have just mentioned should not occur under any circumstances.",81
330,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Grampians) [10.44] - I do not think that any speech has ever been delivered in Australia equal to that which we had to-night from the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr K e l l y ) , and it is with regret that I detain the House for a few minutes after such a discussion as we have had of matters of wide-world and historical importance,- to call attention to a merely domestic concern. But the distillation of eucalyptus oil is an in dustry which employs a considerable number of persons, and, because of the war, it is on the verge of temporary extinction. There is an almost unlimited demand for the.oil, but for the last six months it has been impossible to obtain shipping space for its exportation.",81
331,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Shippin g 'space can be obtained for wine, but not for eucalyptus o i l !",81
332,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I was not aware of that. I draw the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the urgency of the situation. There are a number of eucaSince then lyptus oil distillation establishments in .Victoria- I do not know if others exist elsewhere in the Commonwealthlast which within two or three weeks must close unless they can export their products - I have done what I could, but 1 the highest authority controlling shipping states that it is thepositive instruction of the Admiralt y that only goods on the priority list can be shipped-,, and eucalyptus oil is not on that list. It is. news to learn that wine is on the list.",81
333,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,I did not say that it was.,81
334,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I have noticed with interest that, although for a long period leather could' not be shipped away, at all events not in large quantities, it is now put on the priority list, or, owing to the representations of the Government, the exportation of a considerable quantity of leather-has been permitted. I am glad-to know that that has. been done. The tanning industry isan important one< in the great cities, but. the distillation of eucar lyptus oil is of great importance in the country districts-; and, seeing that, the in dustry must discontinue unless the exportation of oil is allowed, I hope that the Government may Bee its way to cable to the military authorities in England asking them to put eucalyptus oil on the priority list, or to allow the stocks that have accumulated during the last six months to be exported.",81
335,Mr NICHOLL S,Unknown,"Macquarie) [10.49]. - When speaking this afternoon, about the Small Arms Factory I thought that I had the right of reply and forgot to mention one or two facts to which I wish to call attention. The Defence Department promised to pay employees who had been dismissed a week's wages in lieu of a week's notice, but this afternoon I received the following telegram from the secretary to the Small Arms Factory Employees UnionEight hundred men now employed. still out. Minister refuses to pay men week's wages in lieu week's notice. The Department, apparently, is not keeping the promise that was made to the men. If I can get an assurance from the M i nister that a week's wages will he paid to any man in lieu of notice, I shall he satisfied. It seems remarkable that a Department should immediately repudiate a contract entered into with these men, but that is what has occurred during the past week or two so far as the Defence Department is concerned. There is another phase of the matter to which I desire now to refer.",82
336,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," Order ! I must ask the honourable member not to pursue the subject. The honourable member debated the subject on a motion for a special adjournment today, and he may not now occupy the time of the House with the same subject. Mir. NICHOLLS - I thought, sir, that this was a day for grievances, and this is a painful grievance with me.",82
337,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order I the honourable member that he took the course of moving the special adjournment of the House to deal with that particular matter, and he cannot now revive the debate.",82
338,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"But this is aspect of the question, Mr Speaker.",82
