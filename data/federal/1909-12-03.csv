TELEGRAPH POLES : SUTHERLAND-MAI L SERVICE : BRISBANE TO COOKTOWNTELEPHONE RATES COMMITTEECHARGES AGAINST PUBLI C SERVANTS : PROCEDURE-TELEGRAP HLINE , SYDNEY TO BRISBANE.",14
1,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"In the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 29th ultimo, there appeared, under the headings, ""Motor Smash,"" ""Collision with Telegraph Pole: Two persons badly injured,"" an account of an accident which resulted from a motor car running into a telegraph pole at Sutherland. The Shire Clerk of Sutherland has written to me a letter, in which he statesThis question, of the position of these poles has been brought under the notice of the Postal Department as far back as 1907, and some correspondence followed. The Department sheltered itself behind the Commonwealth Act and absolutely refused to <lo anything in the matter, notwithstanding the fact that this Council offered to provide the services of two Maintenance men to assist under the supervision of the Departmental officers. These poles stand 15 feet from the road alignment, when the Council formed up the footpath and cut out the water-table the poles stand 3 feet out from the edge of footpath, constituting a danger to traffic, not merely at the corner in question, but right through the township and a particularly busy portion of the road. Will the Postmaster-General inquire into the matter, and ascertain whether this dangerous obstruction, which has already resulted in a serious accident to two persons, and has caused damage to property, cannot be removed ?",14
2,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Whils t it is the legal right of the Department to erect telegraph poles in any part of a public street, I do not think that that right ought to be exercised in a, reckless way, without regard to local convenience and local considerations. In several cases I have interposed, and have directed the removal of poles from positions in which they constituted an obstruction, without being necessary for public convenience. I have seen a. report in reference to the case referred to by the honourable member, and shall cause inquiries to be made with a view to whether blame was attachable ascertaining to any one, and whether anything can be done to prevent a repetition of the occurrence.",14
3,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General a question in reference 10.30 to the following paragraph, which appeared in. this morning's issue of the ArgusBrisbane, Thursday - The contract between the Postma&ter-General and the A.US.N. Company for the carriage of mails between Brisbane and Cooktown and intermediate ports came to an end on Sunday last. The matter of a new contract has been under consideration for some time. The new contract was practically agreed upon today. The matter apparently came to a head when the company intimated that it did not intend to despatch the Bingera north this week, the contract having run out. Subsequently it was stated that the present service would be allowed to continue till the end of the year, but immediately thereafter some radical arrangements will be made. The Bingera will consequently sail for the north tomorrow. The new contract is for five years. The most important feature of the new contract is that the large steamers which leave Brisbane on Saturday will not be bound by the mail contract, and will not go past Cairns. Hitherto they have gone on to Cooktown. I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether the radical alterations referred to in that paragraph are being made by the contractors or by the Department, and what, if any, arrangements have been made to carry mails from Cairns to Cooktown, and thence northwards between the expiration of the present contract and the beginning of the year.",14
4,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Negotiation s in connection with this contract have been going on for three months. The Australian United Steam Navigation Company first demanded £ 2 4 , 7 0 0 for a new service, but, as the result of negotiations, I have entered into a new contract, under which we shall pay ,£18,450. The only difference between the old and the new contract is that the company will not be compelled to send large steamers to Cooktown. That town is to be served by an extension of the existing service from Cairns vid Port Douglas.",14
5,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I do not think the Postmaster-General has quite followed my question. He told us that other arrangements have been made for the carriage of the mails from Cairns to Cooktown, but he did not say what those arrangements are. I suppose there is something in the contract in relation to the class, tonnage, and speed of the vessels.",14
6,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"There are a. number of papers here, which it would take too long to read, referring to the matter. In stead of the big steamer going from Brisbane to Cooktown, there will be a smaller steamer service established between Cairns and Cooktown.",14
7,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The same vessel wil l run to Cairns as at present?,15
8,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Yes .,15
9,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"the General, upon notice I. What was the date of the appointment of the Telephone Inquiry Committee? 2. How much has it cost up to 30th November - last? 3. How much of the estimated amount of cost is for the private member of the Committee?",15

Whetlier, under section 46 of the Public Service Act, an officer may be dismissed by the chief officer or the permanent head for an offence of a serious nature, or should the charge be referred to a - Board ? 2. Whether an officer should not be further suspended under Regulation 263A? 3. Whether the admission of a charge should be made to the chief officer oj, to a Board ? 4. Whether an officer' having admitted an offence to the chief officer (believing the maximum penalty that could be imposed by the chief officer to be a fine or further suspension, but who has been dismissed), has any further claim to have his case further dealt with by a Board ?",15
11,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions areThe Public Service Commissioner has furnished the following information :1. Where the charge is admitted an officer may be dismissed on the recommendation of the ihief officer or permanent head. In such case reference to a Board of Inquiry is not necessary. 2. No, further suspension is only necessary where the charge is referred to a Board of Inquiry. 3. The charge is laid by the Chief Officer, and the admission is required to be made to him. 4. No.",15
12,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,Unknown,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is he aware that, owing to delay in the erection of an additional telegraph line between Sydney and Brisbane, considerable congestion has been occasioned in the transmission of business on the same line to Northern River districts of New South Wales? 2. Will he inform the House what section of such line remains uncompleted? 3. Can he say when the completion of the remaining section will be undertaken, or what steps have been taken in that direction ? 4. Does he intend to further relieve the congestion of the important centres referred to by the installation of Wheatstone instruments (now being imported) at Brisbane and other centres?",15

14,Mr HEDGES,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"In view, of the fact that State debentures and stocks are issued in Australia free of income tax, I desire to ask the Attorney-General whether the inscribed stock or bonds in connection with the proposed Commonwealth loan can also be issued free of income tax?",15
15,Mr GLYNN,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"The State laws deal simply with their own income tax. We have none, and the States cannot impose an intax so as to affect our securities. I think that that was decided in the case of Osborne v. the United. States of America. FEDERAL CAPITAL.",15
16,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"Will the Minister of Home .Affairs state whether it is true, as reported in the press, that he does not intend to do anything with regard to the establishment of the Federal Capital until he has advertised in Europe for competitive designs for laying out the Federal city. Further, is there any. truth in therumour that he proposes to bank his fires ,and go slowly. If not, will he state what steps he intends to take at an early date toestablish the Fedeial capital in the territorv that has been set apart for the purpose?",15
17,Mr FULLER,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"I certainly do not intend to bank my fires and go slowly. The Surrendei Bill has been passed by the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, but I am not aware whether it has yet passed the Legislative Council. As soon as the matter has been completed I shall' be prepared to deal with the whole question, and deal with it , I hope, effectivelv.",15
18,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether it is his intention to advertise outside Australia for plans for the Federal city beforeproceeding with the survey, and, if so, whether he intends to do that at an earlydate?",15
19,Mr FULLER,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"The position put by the honourable member has received consideration, but has not been finally dealt with. I shall do all I can to secure suitable plans for the Federal city.",15
20,Mr MAUGER,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"Will the Minister of Home Affairs, from the' very inception, take definite steps to insure that everything pertaining to the Federal Capital shall, as far as possible, be essentially Australian? I refer to the timber, the stone, and everything necessary.",16
21,Mr FULLER,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"I am just as anxious as the honourable member, and, I presume, as other honorable_ members, to give Australian workmen and manufacturers the f u l lest opportunity in connection with all our work. That is already the policy of the Department of Home Affairs, and I presume it will be followed in connection with the Federal Capital.",16
22,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,Will the Minister of Home Affairs say whether the report is true that he intends advertising be yond Australia for plans for the proposed Federal Capital ?,16
23,Mr FULLER,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"I have already stated that that matter has been under consideration, but no determination has been arrived at. KITCHENER CAMPS. ATTENDANCE OF CADETS.",16
24,Dr LIDDELL,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"Can the Minister of Defence explain why so small an attendance is expected from Victoria in connection with the Kitchener camps, which are to be held to enable Lord Kitchener to review our troops, and obtain some knowledge of their numbers and skill ? Further, I desire to know whether the cadets are to be excluded from those camps? If this is the present intention of the Minister, will he consider the advisableness of allowing the cadets to attend, so that the Victorian camps mav make a fairlv good show ?",16
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"I am unable to explain the reason for the great disparity between the figures for Victoria and those for the other States. My own impression is that some of the figures, in regard to the anticipated attendance at camps in the other States, are a little optimistic. sincerely hope that they are not, and that the figures for this State are, on the other hand, a little pessimistic.",16
26,Dr LIDDELL,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"The Minister of Defence has not replied to the second part of my question, as to whether or not cadets are to be excluded from these camps, and, if . so, why?",16
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"My honourable friend is aware that cadets do not go into training camps with seniors. That is to say,- we do not mix up the cadets with the seniors.",16
28,Mr WILKS,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,Amen d the Defence Bill .,16
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"I do not see that the Defence Bill has anything to do with the point I am putting. I am speaking now of the Kitchener camps. I am afraid that the cadets cannot be sent to the camps together with the seniors, for the reason that we have not a double equipment. I have been considering for some time the best way to get them to camp, and the honourable member may rest assured that, whether they go or do not go into camp, they will turn out, and that Lord Kitchener will have a good look at them.",16
30,Mr FAIRBAIRN,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"In view of the importance of the camps which are to be established when Lord Kitchener arrives, I desire to know from the Minister of Defence whether there is any information in the Department which leads him to think there is any chance of employers being so unpatriotic as to try to interfere with their success ?",16
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TAXATIO N OF DEBENTURES AN D,"Non e whatever, that I have heard of, and I sincerely hope there is no justification for any such idea. NA RAILWAY .",16
32,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I wish to ask the Prime.

40,Mr DEAKIN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I make the suggestion for the convenience of honourable members from distant States, who have been asked to remain in Melbourne over this week-end in the hope that the business will be cluded before the end of next week. The last five or six items on the notice-paper, including Supply, Ways and Means, and (he country. so forth, are what may be described as formal, and will not, I think, occupy much time.",17
41,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Canno t we deal with the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill ?,17
42,Mr DEAKIN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I am perfectly willing to do so, only it is rather a contentious measure. When the Naval Loan Bill - been dealt with, the measures down to the Conciliation and Arbitration B i l in the ordinary sense of the term, contentious, and, having passed the Senate, they have only to be reviewed here.

43,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Wide Bay) [10.53] had expected the Prime Minister to give an outline of the actual measures sires to deal with before the .prorogation, and also a statement in regard posal of the Government some time ago connection with what is called tection. That is rather an old question, of some interest to the Parliament and people. It was a settled part of the policy of the last Government of which the present Prime Minister was the in my opinion, he pledged himself to the country when the Parliament was elected that, if Protection were given to the facturers and the capitalists, the employ6s also should have a share of the benefits. That part of the bargain has not been carshall ried o u t ; and I am sorry that the Prime Minister has not seen fit to planation. Obviously, the Government have changed their ground on this matter. secrets to hide. They are very ready to issue memoranda and reports on the question, and when the capitalists, powerful corporations, or moneyed classes are concerned, they show greatest alacrity in removing any difficula ties of which complaint is made. We have seen that in regard to the telephone rates, to and other matters, action was taken at once to afford relief, though nothing been done to protect the workers. I understand that the Government will proceed with the Seamen's Compensation Bill , the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , the Bill , and'so for t h ; and I am of opinion that the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill might also find a place in the measures to be completed this session.",17
44,Mr DEAKIN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I have no objection.,17
45,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It would appear that some honourable members, if they had their conown way, would sit on Sundays. I am quite ready to be here at any and all times to assist the Government in the business of I do not agree with the Prime Minister, however, in regard TO the Estimates being merely formal business. At any rate, before the House rises I shall expect from the Treasurer-; brief statev ment showing clearly the financial position.",17

47,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I am glad that the Las Prime Minister agrees to that idea.,17
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"There is no change l are not, in the finances this year.",17
49,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,There is an actual change in the expenditure. The Treasurer himself has told us that the expenditure is - I greater than the income.,17

54,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The proposal to borrow was made only the other day, and I must manusay that I was astounded when I heard it. If the Treasurer is prepared to make such a statement as I have suggested, we be glad to hear it , but, if not, we shall have to seek some other means of obmake an extaining the information.",17
55,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,There are no,17
56,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I am not saying that there are, and the' Treasurer is evidently the in a suspicious mood. I am only asking the on behalf of the House and the public for financial statement which will enable the electors to know the exact position of affairs. I regret that it is necessary to sit on Saturdays and Mondays; but, at the same time, I am willing to assist the Government in every possible way to bring the business at an end, consistently with a reasonable discussion of the measures before us.",17
57,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Corio) [10.58] - Are we to take the Prime Minister's announcement as authoritative that we shall sit tomorrow night? 1I have an appointment then which X shall have to cancel, and I do not desire to find, after cancelling it, that we do not. sit. Can I take the Prime Minister's announcement as definite?",18
58,Mr DEAKIN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Yes .,18
59,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"If we should be so unfortunate as to have to sit next Friday, I. hope the hour of meeting will be made 1 1 o'clock; indeed, I think that next session that should be made the hour for morning sittings.",18
60,Mr TUDOR,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Yarra) [10.59] - I have no objection to the House sitting tomorrow, but I think we certainly ought not to continue until tomorrow afternoon. If we sit tomorrow morning, and Monday, it will be all that is necessary, especially in view of the fact that since Tuesday we have been sitting about twelve hours a day. There is one matter on which I think we ought to have a definite statement from the Prime Minister. When the Leader of the Opposition spoke about new Protection, one Ministerial member interjected that it was practically dead through the fault of the Opposition. After the High Court had given its decision on the subject, the Prime Minister, speaking on the 20th October, 1908. said I do not intend to debate the question of the new Protection. I merely wished to show that it was, and is still, an essential part of the Government policy. The right honourable member, for East Sydney then interjectedAnd one of the parts of which I thoroughly approve. Apparently, the Prime Minister holds that view today, and the right honourable member for East Sydney, who, at that time, represented a very important section of the House, is in. accord with it, while it is well known that honourable members on this 'side agree with it, yet absolutely nothing has been done to push the question forward. One of the organizers for the Prime Minister's party, speaking last night at Carlton, said that while Tasmania had no legislation on the subject no action was being taken upon it. The Inter-State Commission Bill-and it - is a good job that it has not been passed, because it would be worse than useless-wa s debated in another place until the 14th October. It is significant that on the 19th October, I received-and I presume that all other honourable members did- a circular letter from the secretary of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce indicating that the Council of that body had carried the following resolutionThis Council is of opinion that up to the present no necessity has arisen to warrant the introduction of legislation to create an Inter-State Commission, and also that if further industrial legislation is deemed necessary the powers of the existing Federal industrial tribunal should be sufficiently enlarged to obviate the necessity of creating another, and at the same time very costly, Federal Department. The writer addedIn forwarding you this resolution I am to . express the hope that it will receive your most 0 favourable consideration - Your s faithfully, C. HALLETI', Secty. Since that time the Inter-State Commission Bill has not even been called on in another place. It has been moved down the list, and for the last three or four weeks has been just above the Navigation Bill, with which every one knows that the Government have no intention of dealing this session.",18
61,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The numbers are against the Inter-State Commission Bill in the Senate.,18
62,Mr TUDOR,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Then why have not the Government the courage to bring it on, and let it be defeated, instead of leaving it on the notice-paper, and pleading at the elections that no opportunity was given them to bring it on ? Since it was abandoned, the Senate in one week devoted only ten hours to Government business, adjourning on one evening about half-past five, and on another about half-past nine. Yet this Bill, which was previously, according to the Government, regarded as of some use to industrial workers, was not considered. When the Fisher Government were in office, honourable members then on this side said that they objected to a dissolution at that time because it was their intention to do something in regard to industrial legislation, but six or seven months have since elapsed, and' nothing has been done. A very different course was taken in regard to the .telephone rates, as the Leader of the Oppo- ' sition pointed out, when the mercantile: community were called upon by the Fisher Government to pay a fair return for the services which they were receiving. The matter was promptly shelved by this Government. The Postmaster-General stated distinctly that the Commitee of Investigaorable tion appointed by him was not going to shelve it, but this morning I received a reply from him that the Committee had cost over £ 1 , 5 0 0 in about five months, whereas the report was to have been presented in three months. Does any honourable member think that that report will be handed before the election? There are only two members on the Committee. It is all very well to say that one is a Government officer and that he is not costing the Commonwealth which, of course, is our duty. anything extra. If we have an officer can be spared from his Department without extra cost, it shows that the service is manned, but I do not believe it is. Some one else' must have been put in his place in the Treasury to do his work, and the Government must be paying for it.",18
63,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"If the matter is properly arranged, his salary should be debited against the Committee.",19
64,Mr TUDOR,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I do not know whether it is included in the amount specified in ness. the answer given to me this morning, but I know that the cost of the Committee has 'been ,£1,519 up to the end of NovemTreasurer ber. The other - member of the Comends, mittee is a private citizen, and there sure to be a deadlock, with one man should, wanting to' keep the work going. is against human nature that a - man should throw up a job worth £ 3 0 a week to himself. Directly he brings in his rethe port his job will be gone, and does any honourable member believe that he will exat pedite the business?",19
65,Mr MAUGER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"1 certainly do not think he will loaf on it. He is a very honourable, - straightforward man.",19
66,Mr TUDOR,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"1 do not think he will, but any honourable member who was in a similar position would consider it absoshoulders lutely necessary to probe the question very bottom in order to ascertain what was done. We have heard complaints about the Postal Commission, but this Committee has cost more in five months than the lessly, Postal Commission cost in any twelve. We should be able to transact the business Parliament without sitting for six days week until n o'clock at night, or later. Several honourable members interjecting,",19
67,Mr SPEAKER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I would point out State that' each and every honourable member can us some years ago. speak upon this question if he wishes, he cannot do, so when another honourable member is addressing the Chamber.",19
68,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I did not know that!,19
69,Mr SPEAKER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Order I The honmember for Dalley is out of order.,19
70,Mr TUDOR,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I trust the Prime Minis- ' ter will so arrange matters that we shall not have to sit tomorrow night.,19
71,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Robertson) [11.8] - The remarks of the honourable in member for Yarra are very pertinent. The fact that we have been sitting for twelve . hours per day shows that we have been paying close attention to public affairs, But the who strain imposed upon those who are here constantly is very great, and we could not overstand it for long. However, the arrangement of business can be well left in the hands of the'Prime Minister, who, I think, will see that we are not killed by too long sittings. The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition with regard to the finances were very much to the point. If the Treasurer would make a financial statement it would materially assist in the transaction of busiSooner or later we shall be face to face with serious responsibilities Tor 1 which no provision has been made. If the keeps these matters at his fingers' I think he will be able to give us is the information in round figures. He from time to time, advise the House It as to our financial position when grave matters of expenditure are under consideration. We have recently been dealing with expenditure of millions that must, ultimately, be financed out of revenue, and. this period of the life of the Parliament, before we go to our constituents to give an account of our stewardship, the Treasurer should be able to give us an inkling as to the condition of the Treasury, especially in view of the_great responsibilities which we haA'e been instrumental in placing on the pf ""the Government. The right to the honourable gentleman should make that statement at an early period, so that we may show the country that we are really sound financiers, and have not been acting reckbut are prepared to meet - the responsibilities that will year by year accrue. There of are, doubtless, many measures which the a Prime Minister will have to drop, but, in another place there are a number of Bills to which Parliament has given a great deal of attention. One in particular is the InterCommission Bill , which we had before At that time it was but loaded with so much that was impossible that it had to be dropped, but the present Government have brought in"" a Bill which reflects a great deal of credit upon them, and they should make an effort to pass it into law. Many questions must come under the attention of an Inter-State Commission. Every State is materially interested in questions that today are calling for attention and settlement, and many of which have been hung up for years waiting for such a body to deal with them. Government can put through this session ' one of the most important Bills that we are called upon under the Constitution to pass, it will be an excellent record for them, and I hope the Prime Minister will not lose the opportunity. The question of new Protection is also involved. No one has more confidence in the Prime Minister than I have. He has written two minutes, and said a great deal upon the question. He made it a live question in Australia, although I am still to be convinced upon some phases of it. I think, however, that it is rather too late to expect it to be dealt with this session, although I should like to hear fro m the Prime Minister on the subject at an early period. He said previously that it was the complement of the Tariff.",19
72,Dr LIDDELL,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,-What about the fact that the Labour party wasted all the time earlier in the session ?,20
73,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"This is not - the time to carp and cavil. We are on the eve of returning our commission to our - constituents, and if any of us have advice - or counsel of any value to offer I am sure -.the Prime Minister will make use of it. A hint is sometimes of great value to those who have responsibilities. The Prime Minister will shortly go before the country, and if he is still convinced that this complement to the Tariff should be passed, and if it is still the policy of the Government, he should insist upon the fact being understood by those sections of the,community who have called Fusionists. I think something should be said on that question.",20
74,Mr DEAKIN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Hear , hear.",20
75,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I am glad to hear the Prime Minister say that. He is a public man with a great reputation, and he made the question a live one.",20
76,Mr JH CATTS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,He buried it again.,20
77,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"He created it, and he has not buried it. The memoranda - which he wrote are on record, and I have yet to be convinced that he has gone back on his statements. On the contrary, I have seen indications that he is still of his first opinion, and his encouragement of my remarks makes me think that we shall yet hear something from him on this question. Mr J. H. CATTS - He does not intend to do anything in regard to it . If the Mr HENRY ' WILLIS - I have always had confidence in the honourable gentleman. I challenge honourable members to ""read any statement in my speeches in this House, where I have sat for nine years, which reflect on his fidelity. Mr J. H.

80,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Onl y a big man could get in front of the present Prime Minister, in whom I have always had confidence as a - conscientious politician. There are many things which he cannot do at the moment; but I believe that he will be f a it h f u l to the trust imposed on him by the terms of the agreement between the members of the combination which supports him. We know that he intends to say something more on this question. ' How far I shall be able to go with him in regard to any proposals that are made remains to be seen. I hope that the way will be made easy for us. Before the session closes/the Treasurer should say something on the subject of finance. Those who know the great themselves work done by the Postmaster-General, when Chairman of the Tariff Commission, feel that he is a man who thinks before he speaks, and that what he says is the result of conviction. He has stated that an expenditure of £2,000,00 0 is needed to put the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services of the Commonwealth in order. That really means that the expenditure is required to bring the service in the larger States up to the standard of that in the smaller States. I do not blame previous Postmasters-General for the present position. But the Department has been starved. The great reputation of Sir George Turner rests upon his proposal to borrow to put the Department of the Postmaster-General in order. H ad it not been for that proposal, his reputation would disappear.",20
81,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Why should we have borrowed, when we had plenty of money which we could have used ?",21
82,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"N e w South Wales is such a large State, and its affairs have been so grossly mismanaged in ' the past, that its services are very inefficient. So, too, are those of Victoria, compared with the excellent services in the smaller States. But the Melbourne arrangements are more up-to-date than those of Sydney. The Treasurer should tell us how he intends to find the money for the necessary reforms in this and other Departments. _ I should like to amend the motion, by moving the omission, of all the words after "" t l with a view to the insertion of the words "" it is expedient, in the best interests of the Commonwealth, that a system of efficient penny post within and beyond Australia be established."" That would give me an opportunity to bring forward a proposal with which I shall not otherwise be able to deal.",21
83,Mr SPENCE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Darling) [11.22] - As I wish to encourage the Government in its belated attempt to do work, I shall not oppose the motion, though I question whether it be possible to effect good legislation in the short time remaining in connection with the sixteen items on the business-paper, of which nine are Orders of the Day for the second reading of Bills. Is it to be thought that there is no chance of discovering weaknesses in these proposals? Nearly every Bill which has been introduced has had to be amended on the motion of the Minister in charge of it, although it has been under consideration for weeks. The Government has hitherto done very little. It commenced by asking for three weeks in which to prepare a programme, which has been so departed from and ignored that it has been forgotten. Then it took a fortnight's holiday to consult with the Premiers. During the greater part of the session the Senate has not had enough business to occupy it during two days a week. Now, when honourable members are tired of . everything, and desirous of asking the people to elect a new and better Parliament, the Government proposes to rush on with businesswhich has been kept on the noticerpaper largely for show purposes. Some of themeasures on the notice-paper are unimportant and without party significance. Indeed, the programme of the Government is noticeable for the big things which are left out. Of course, the Land Tax.. Assessment Bil l is an important measure, and should be passed'; but the Government has admitted its helplessness in regard to the imposition o i taxation. Can that measure be passed in a day or two?' Or is it proposed to gef everything through, by the application of the closure, shutting, all mouths, including those of the Government supporters? It is ridiculous and unfair to propose to do so much in the littletime that remains, because, when legislation is passed under such circumstances, amendments are sure to be required very soon afterwards. Even the cleverest menare apt to overlook matters which are seeni i at , "" by others who are not ranked so highly. They say that fools can sometimes teach wise men wisdom. The object of the Opposition this session has been to keep the Government at work. Whenever a sitting, has lasted to a late hour in the evening, the Government has been ready to adjournto next day. The Opposition has had to depart from its ordinary role, by tryingto force the Government to do work, and objecting to long adjournments and thesuspension of sittings at half-past 10 at night. At the very commencement of thesession, the press declared that the Opposition was 'delaying business , but the 1 reverse was so patent that the statement is not now being circulated. The Government must take responsibility for the delays which have occurred. Having done so little that the other House has not been kept supplied with business, Ministers now propose to deal with sixteen Orders of theDay here, get the measures to which they relate disposed of by the Senate, and"" finish .the session next week. I have only one other matter to refer to.",21

85,Mr SPENCE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I am not preventing the House from doing so. I have not the same faith in the Prime Minister regarding his adherence to new Protection as the honourable member for Robertson has. The subject seems to have been entirely forgotten by the honourable gentleman. It isone which should be dealt with by Parliament. The Prime Minister, however, has failed to carry out the definite promise which he made as head of a previous Administration. Apoarently, it is not proposed to keep it, although it should be kept in the interests of workers, manufacturers, and consumers alike. Minor matters should have been put aside for this big question. Of course, the subject would be dealt with in any Government proposal according to the views of the present Ministers, and therefore, perhaps, it is a good thing that they have not dealt with it. It is the duty of an Opposition to criticise, and when the present Minister of Defence was on this side, no Government proposal had any merit at all. We do not go so far as that. It is not creditable to the Government that this great measure has been dropped out of sight, and the electors will properly call us to account for our omission to deal with it.

It was decided in the case of Pollock v. the Farmers' Loan Company in the United States, that income derived from municipal bonds are not taxable by the States, and, of course, the inference is that income derived from the bonds of Congress are not taxable. The same principle, I believe, applies here. At all events, the High Court so decided in the case of D'Emden v. Pedder, and subsequent cases. The Privy Council took a different view, but subsequently agreed with the H i gh Court that we had power to permit this taxation if we liked. So long as we do not permit it, the States cannot, on the decision of the High Court, tax. The question cannot now go to the Privy Council, because the amending Judiciary Act of 1908 took away the original jurisdiction of the State courts in these matters. As the original jurisdiction is now in the High deal with Court, the appeal must go to that Court, and not to the Privy Council. It would be a mistake to insert any provision in the Bill that is not necessary; besides being utterly useless, it would look like a discounting of our own powers. Clause agreed to.

139,Mr MATHEWSI,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Does the ,1 Treasurer think that he will be able to get the money at par. or anvwhere near par?",25
140,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The rate of interest paid is altogether a question of price; and the point raised is really not important as the honourable member Gippsland would seem to infer. amount we receive per £ 1 0 0 is governed by the rate of interest, and if we make rate 3 per cent., the amount we receive will all depend on the state of the money market. In such case, we would receive much less for every £ 1 0 0 of stock, and at 3^ per cent - a correspondingly greater amount. The question is, which is more convenient rate for us to place in the Bill . The price a loan realizes, assuming the securitv is good, is governed by the of the market. If the market is good, there is plenty of money available, we get a good^price. If , on the other hand, there are wars and rumours of wars, and money is tight, we have to pay more for it. It does not follow that the best security will always obtain the better price, except' at the same time, that is to say, the weakest State in the Commonwealth might get a better price today than the Commonwealth itself a year 0 / t w o hence - al l depends on the state of the money market.' However, honourable members may be sure that the Government are not acting blindly in this matter; and we are advised that this is the-best rate to set forth in the Bill at the present time. If , as I have said, we make the rate 3 per cent., the loan will be raised at a discount, whereas at 3J per cent., we shall get a good deal more per cent.",25
141,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Would this not be a good way to test the security of the Commonwealth ?,25
142,Sir JOHNFORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I do not think it would test its security in the slightest degree. My idea is that the Commonwealth cannot expect at the beginning to raise' money on very much better terms than,25
143,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Is not the first loan the to hear the most favourable one?,25
144,Sir JOHNFORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I should say,25

146,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"There could exnot be better credit, for instance, than that at offered at the present time by New South Wales, which pays every penny of interest on the whole of its loans out of the proceeds of the works constructed with those loan moneys.",25
147,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The interest is fixed at 3?r per cent., because the Treasurer knows so that the Government have spoilt the securfor ity of the Comonwealth. The Sir JOHN FORREST - Doubtles s the honourable member has had more experience the in finance than others on this side ! At the same time, after considering the matter, we regard the rate of interest mentioned in the clause as the most advisable.",25
148,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Robertson) [ IT . 56] - The Treasurer's statement is the most misleading. He says that it matters not what rate of interest we insert in the Bill. We know, as a matter of fact, that state the Commonwealth has greater taxing and power than any one of the States. The utmost that any State can gain from the Customs and Excise revenue is 25s. per head, whereas, in the case of the Commonwealth, the amount is unlimited, and every source of income now open to the States is also open to the Commonwealth. It will be seen, therefore, that the Commonwealth security is better than that of any one of the States, and must be so. A country like Australia never puts her securities in pawn. Our liabilities, sources of income, taxing powers, and private wealth are the gauge of the securitv offered, and the honourable member for Gwvdir has rightly suggested that we shall never have a better security to offer than we have today. If we place the rate at $ per cent., I venture to say that we shall instantly depreciate every State security. For all practical purposes every State is solvent, and has ample security to offer, with, of course, the Commonwealth always behind it. If the rate at 3! per cent, be mentioned in the Bill , and underwriters are allowed to advise, and to say that they will take so much above par at that rate, the nomination of the stock is at once fixed at 3J per cent. It would be better to keep the nomination at the minimum of 3 per cent., even if we have to take less than par, and I hope the Treasurer will have the pluck to do so. Should the Treasurer act on this suggestion, I shall feel inclined to support him.",25
149,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Gwydir) [11.59] Here we have the 'first fruits of the financial policy of the Government-the first symptoms of the disease which is about to seize the Commonwealth. The Government have practically undermined the Commonwealth security, a security which in all countries is regarded as one of the greatest that any nation can offer for borrowed money-the security over its Customs and Excise revenue. The Government have undermined that by giving to the States a first mortgage over it to the extent of 25s. per head. Every lender of money will in future have to consider the value of the security which the Commonwealth has to offer in the shape of Customs and Excise revenue. It will be regarded as an unreliable value, which cannot be depended on with certainty for so long a period as thirty or forty years. Looking at the matter not from a partu or political standpoint, but from a purely financial point of view, they will say that it is not a stable security, because no business man regards a second mortgage with favour.",26
150,Mr STORRER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,We are not limited to the security of the Customs and Excise revenue.,26
151,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"We are to some degree, because not only have the Prime Minister and his party undermined that security, but the Prime Minister, in his speech when moving the adoption of the financial agreement with the States, said that although the Constitution allowed us to raise taxation from other sources, yet we did not intend to do so, because it had been arranged with the Premiers that they should introduce land taxation to make good the deficit which would probably be caused by the agreement. In saying that, he indicated that the Government were going to allow the State Premiers to control direct taxation, which is the other security that the Commonwealth ought to be able to offer to those from whom it may want to borrow money. ' Consequently, through the action of the Government there is also an embargo on the Commonwealth in that direction. We have first given a first mortgage on the Customs and Excise revenue, and next the Prime Minister has given a promise that he will not interfere with the rights of the States to imposedirect taxation. By those two means we have so reduced our security that it will be impossible for the Treasurer to obtaina loan at anything like the rate of interest which the Commonwealth would otherwisehave been able to command. Yet the Treasurer tells us that it does not make any difference whether we put the rate of interest down at 3, 3J, or 4 per cent. Sir J OHN FORREST - The clause says"" not exceeding.""",26
152,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"We know what ""not exceeding"" means. Had not the Government undermined our securities we could"" safely have specified in this Bill that the rate of interest was not to exceed 3 percent. We could have obtained a loan on those terms at par, and by that meanshave shown the States what we have contended all along-that the Commonwealthcan borrow more advantageously than they can. We could thus have proved to themthe wisdom of allowing the Commonwealthto manage all future loans, instead of the Commonwealth having to enter into competition with the States in the money market. The present position is the first result of what the Government have done in the last few.months. The Treasurer is now going to ask for a loan, with the Commonwealth simply on an equality with any State, and he is afraid that he will not get it at par. I should not 'be at all surprised if he obtained no more than ninety-six - or ninety-seven, even at per cent. Why should we blame the money lenders if it is so? Owing to the action of the Government and of a majority of this House the security of the Commonwealth has been weakened to such an extent that the Commonwealth is practically handed over to the mercy of the jews, who will be able, by arguing that our assets have been undermined, to justify offering money to the Commonwealth on less advantageous terms than they would offer it to the States. I never thought that at such an early period we should be afforded .such a striking illustration of the fear of the Government of the results of their own action. The first sign of weakness is shown by the ""Treasurer when he attempts to argue that the Commonwealth security is not as good as that of some of the - States.",26
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I did not say so.,27
154,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The right honourable .member said that the security of one State might be at par today, and tomorrow that of another, while next year they might both be below par. He also said that a State security might be more valuable than that of the Commonwealth, and vice - versa.",27
155,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Not at the same time. Mir. WEBSTER - But , according to the Treasurer, a State security might be more valuable than the Commonwealth security on the day that he goes on to the loan market. The Government have not only undermined the security of the Commonwealth, but have inflated the security of the States - When a State goes on the market to borrow in the future it will be able to point lo the first mortgage given to it by the Federal Parliament for all time on the Customs and Excise revenue. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, will be able to offer in regard to Customs and Excise only an unreliable security, which must vanish if this Parliament does its duty - to the country by bringing about effective Protection, f h e money lender, comparing the two securities, will say at once that that of the States is solid, while that of the Commonwealth is utterly shadowy. The Government have further increased the securitv of the States in regard to direct - taxation. Under the Constitution we have the right to impose direct taxation for the needs of the Commonwealth. To-day our rights in that direction are not unimpaired as they were a few months ago.",27
156,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,They are unimpaired now just the same. Mr WEBiSTER - The Treasurer knows that they are not. He knows that at the Premiers' Conference it was understood,27
157,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,It was not understood.,27
158,Mr WEBSTE R,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I shall quote the Prime Minister's speech to show that it was understood that the State Parliaments should not be interfered with in their right to impose land taxation. The Prime Minister went further, and said the State Parliaments were already proceeding to carry that into effect. Victoria is already in troducing a land tax in conformity with the undertaking then given.",27
159,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The Victorian Land Tax Bill was introduced before the Conference.,27
160,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It was not, and I challenge the right honourable member to prove it .",27
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The honourable member is quite wrong.,27
162,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I have the Prime Minister's speech as my authority.,27
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The Prime Minister never said anywhere what the honourable member is. saying, now. It is monstrous to say that we agreed with the State Premiers that they should introduce land tax proposals.",27
164,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I will not allow the Minister of Defence to distort my words. The Prime Minister said that the right of taxation lay with the Commonwealth, but that on account of the depletion of the revenue that was taking place by reason of the agreement, it had been understood by the Federal party that they should not. interfere with the right of the States to raise from land taxation the necessary revenue to make good that depletion. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Does the honourable member mean by the Federal party or by the Conference ?",27
165,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I am speaking of the men who went to the Conference professing to represent this Parliament. They went away without any instructions, and came back with a compact binding this Parliament for all time.",27
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I do not follow the honourable member.,27
167,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It is impossible for the honourable member to follow anything logical. The Prime Minister said that the States are showing their bona fides in this matter by introducing land taxation. He referred to what has been done in the Parliament of Victoria; and, no doubt that of New South Wales will be asked to consider similar legislation, once the elections are over, and the party in power there is secure from the wrath of the people. But this action on the part of the States will undermine the security of the Commonwealth. The States will invade this avenue of taxation before we have an opportunity to exercise our constitutional right to do so. Government does not intend to propose land taxation, and the States must do so if the - large country properties are to be burst up. Some one must introduce taxation on - land, and the States will do it as soon as possible. In this way our security will be diminished. The security which we have to offer from Customs and Excise revenue ready been diminished by the action of this Government to a degree that is humiliating to those who seek the welfare of this great country. When we are on the eve of great developments, progress is strangled by the action of those whose only consideration is the safety of their own political lives. Were I to talk for a week, I could not more emphatically indicate the feebleness of the Government position. The Treasurer is showing to the world that nothing would be gained by the transfer of the State debts to the Commonwealth, because the Commonwealth cannot borrow on more advantageous terms than the States. asks to be permitted to borrow at the rate of 3$ per cent. He has not the courage to propose that the interest payable shall not exceed 3 per cent., and thus applv the touchstone to ascertain the feeling of the financiers of the world in regard to Commonwealth security.",28
168,Mr HALL,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The States have borrowed at 3 per cent.,28
169,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I find from the official figures with which the honourable member has supplied me that, at that rate, New South Wales has borrowed .£18,024,698, Victoria, Queensland over £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , South Australia .nearly £6,000,000, Western Australia £7,356,000, and Tasmania about £750,000 j or, in all, nearly £48,000,000. Mr KING O'MALLEY - At what price was the New South Wales stock?",28
170,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,At £ 8 6 .,28
171,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I am not able to say on the spur of the moment what prices were obtained for these loans, but I question very much the statement of the honourable member for Corio, who, probably, has in mind some loan offered at a time of depression. The Treasurer, the Prime Minister, and other members of the Government, have from time to time declared that the Commonwealth, if the States debts were transferred to it, could provide for their extinction without cost to the community, by The reason of the favourable terms at which it could borrow money. But those who lend money to nations are not fools. It is their business to investigate the security offered, to ascertain its stability, and whether it is mortgaged. The value of security is, of course, reduced by the encumbrances which are placed on it. No country in the world would have done what the Commonwealth has al- has done in regard to its security. Practically we have to offer only about 25s. per capita of the Customs and Excise revenue, and we are not sure that we shall continue to obtain so much from that source. A second mortgage is always an unreliable asset. It is the States which have given the first mortgage on the Customs and Excise revenue, and they therefore are in a better position to borrow than is the Commonwealth. They can offer solid security, while what we have to offer is such as financiers must consider will not justify them in lending their - money at as low a rate as they would lend it to the States. In raising its first loan, the Commonwealth He should be in a position to offer its most valuable security, but those from whom we wish to borrow will remember that the monev is to be spent, not on reproductive works, as-the loans of the States are spent, but to provide war ships which, after a very short period, will have no value at all. If the Treasurer can prove that this will be the most favoured loan, he will do what will amount to a miracle. No one can prove that a nation which borrows for non-productive works on security alreadv pledged can get as good terms as would be given if it proposed to spend what it bor£10,449,423 , rowed on reproductive works, and had a solid securitv to offer. The introduction of this measure has been the most striking incident of the session. I did not expect that the Government, after all thatMinisters have said about the advantageous terms at which the Commonwealth can borrow, would have asked permission to raise a. loan at per cent. This action proves the fallacy of the arguments which they have put forward. They have parted with privileges which were ours under the Constitution, and which we had no right to sacrifice. We could have retained the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, and applied so much as was necessary to purposes of defence. Instead of doing so, - the Government has undermined security, and improved the position of the States in competing with us on the London money market. The Commonwealth has been humiliated. Its importance has been made subordinate to that of the States. Those of us who have resisted these proposals have been gagged. We have endeavoured to prevent the thrusting on the people of obnoxious and pernicious legislation; but when we try to point out the evil of what is proposed, we are gagged, as criminals gag their victims to prevent their crimes from becoming known to society. I regret what has happened. do not talk merely for the sake of talking, or to show how subtle I am in argument. I do not take pride in putting before honourable members what appears to be a convincing line of reasoning when I am not convinced myself. I do not bend mv intellect to the consideration of problems like this to convince honourable members, showing that I am not convinced mvself by voting for the course against which T. have reasoned. I support mv arguments with mv votes, and mv reasoning is true. The arguments which I have used on this rwasion cnnnnt be controverted, and. later, will be absolutely beyond cavil, because t'-e f cts will then be evident to all. n That is the kind of man we want in Parliament. We need to have in Parliament men who are prepared to sav whnt they mean, to determine what in their iudgment is the right course to mid, having arrived at a determination, to stand by it. Men who pre constant! v K-ic -- 1 ms out have no fixitv of purpose, no desire to do their duty. They are prepared, so to speak, to hand over to the hangman, at the behest of a partu whip, the people whom they professedly desire to serve. I nm not going to do that. We have here the first fruits of the action of the Government and their supporters. Sooner than they expected, a just retribution is over' Mr Webster. taking them. They have undermined the security of the Commonwealth and unduly inflated that of the States, leaving the Commonwealth, as a borrowing power, crippled and humiliated in the money markets of the world.. That is the result of the famous financial agreement, and the infamous compact which have made it necessary for the Government to ask this House to agree to a Bill to provide for the floating of a loan. The Treasurer is afraid to place this loan on the market at 3 per cent., our because the security of the Commonwealth has been seriously injured for all time by the recent action of the Ministry.",28
172,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Corio) [12.32] - In the desert of words through which the last speaker has just traversed, an interjection was made by the honourable member for Darwin to the effect that in his opinion the security of the Commonwealth was not equal to that of the States. As I know that the honourable member has studied financial questions to a certain extent-and he was able to show just now that the honourable member for GwyI dir does not know the difference between "" p a r "" and the price at which inscribed stock is sometimes purchased- I desire to reply to him. Although I am sure we all hope that the Treasurer will be able to raise this money at 3 per cent., it is necessary that we should vest in him a discretion to pay, if necessary, a higher rate. I have here the latest quotations of the London money market in respect to English, colonial, and foreign stocks and shares, and I think that it will be found of interest. I do not suppose any one expects the credit of Australia to be very much better at present than that of Canada. The Canadian provinces have borrowed a good deal, but the Dominion itself has borrowed but little. I find, however, that on 29th October last the price of Canadian 3 per cent, stock was £ 9 2 $? On the same date the price of Indian 3 per cent, stock was follow, £ 8 3 ! , NeAV South Wales 3 per cent. £ 8 6 , New Zealand 3 per cent. £ 8 6 J , anri Queensland 3 per cent. £ 8 6 J .",29
173,Mr JH CATTS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Fro m what is the honourable member quoting?,29
174,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I am giving the official quotations as published in the financial column of The Times Weekly Edition, whose authority cannot be disputed. New South Wales is undoubtedly the strongest, financially, of the States, and her inscribed stock is selling. at £ 8 6 . When I interjected "" £ 8 6 , "" as the price, qf New South Wales stock, a few minutes ago, I was speaking, not to the honourable member for Gwydir, because I did not think he would understand the interjection, but to the honourable member for Darwin, who asked what was the present price of New South Wales 3 per cent, stock. I have here a list of the prices ruling for the stock of varibus strong nations, but I need make only one quotation. I find that Germany pays 3 per cent., and gets only .£82^.' Although Germany has a great Imperial Bank, to which the honourable member for Darwin, in dealing with the financial question, has referred on several occasions as an institution giving great financial strength to the country. I saw recently in a newspaper, and I regret that for the moment I cannot place my hands on the quotation, a statement to the effect that a fraction less than 4 per cent, had been paid on a joint German and Prussian loan of £25,000,000 .",29
175,Mr JH CATTS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Was the loan required for reproductive works?,30
176,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The object for which a loan is floated is of little importance to monev lenders as long as they are sure that the interest will be paid regularly, and that the debt will be redeemed at the proper time. . Mr WH IRVINE - The rate of interest does not depend upon whether or not a loan is required for reproductive works.",30
177,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Quite so. I do not think honourable members would suggest that, whether a Commonwealth loan was for reproductive purposes or to provide for the construction of a navy, there would be the slightest repudiation or default in the . payment of interest.",30
178,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Some of them would repudiate anything. Mr CROUCH,-The honourable member, of course, speaks for himself. question of whether a loan is for reproductive or other purposes does not affect the money lender in England. Statements have been made regarding the varying credits of the States. I do not wish to call attention to the weakness of the present financial position of any State, but we have to recognise that, when money is wanted, it must be obtained on the best terms current among money lendeu.. I need only point out to the honourable member for Darwin and others who have been appreciating the credit of the States, that both New South Wales and South Australia have been paying 3J per cent, for money on the London market, and that any one may obtain across the counter at the Adelaide Treasury 4 per cent, bonds at par.",30
179,Mr JH CATTS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Why these varying rates in respect of the stocks of the different States?,30
180,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I should not be in order in referring now to the question of the transfer of the State debts, but I trust that the Commonwealth will be able to take action, so that those varying rates will be superseded by a fixed rate. I am rather surprised that the honourable member. for Gippsland, who is a lawyer, should have raised this question, since every solicitor has some knowledge of finance. He has referred to our having to pay 3J per cent, for this loan. I should like him to recognise that if we pay only 3 per cent, interest, instead of 3J per cent, interest, we shall probably be able to get, perhaps, only £ 8 6 , or, at the most, £ 9 2 , the price of Candaian stock at present. Is he prepared to see the Commonwealth pay only 3 per cent., and get £ 9 2 for its inscribed stock, or does he think it would be better to pay 3J per cent., and float our loan at par? It would be far better, in the case of a! naval loan, to face our current obligations within the period that has been fixed. As has been pointed out, ships have a limited life, and, since the vessels of the fleet unit may have to be renewed at the end of fifteen or sixteen years, it would be better for us to pay 3J per cent"". and float our loan at par, than to pay only 3 per cent, and get, at the most, £ 9 2 in respect of every £ 1 0 0 that we shall have to pay back fifteen or sixteen years hence.",30
181,Mr AGAR WYNNE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,It works out in exactly the same proportion.,30
182,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The money lender The fixes his own rate of interest by the amount at which he tenders. M i . CROUCH - Does the honourable member for Robertson think that our credit will bje better than that of Canada? If we fix the rate of interest at 3 per cent., it will mean that we shall borrow, perhaps, at £ 9 2 , and that, fifteen years hence, we shall have to pay back £ 1 0 0 .",30
183,Mr AGAR WYNNE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"But we should save J per cent, now, so that the result in the end would be the same.",30
184,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"If we fix the mini-, mum rate of subscription at £ 9 5 , it is highly probable",30
185,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,That it wil l refused.,31
186,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I appreciate the point which the honourable member is endeavouring to make, and it seems to me that, with a. sinking fund, it does not matter whether the price is 3 per cent, or 3^ per cent. The fund can be so regulated as to enable us to pay off the whole amount within the time fixed. If f o i every £ 1 0 0 we got only £ 9 2 on the occasion of our first visit to the money market, the result to the credit of the Commonwealth would be very serious. It would be far better to raise the rate of interest, so as to be able to float our loan at par, than to fix it at 3 per cent, and obtain only ,£92 for it. Once stock is depreciated, it is difficult to secure a forward movement in connection with it . I do not like the idea of borrowing, but if , because of urgent reasons, we required to float another loan, we should find that, having started at £ 9 2 , it would be difficult to obtain a Japan has recently been to the London money market in order to try to convert some 6 per cent, loans, issued at £ 9 0 in the war time, and was unable to do so.",31
187,Mr KING OMALLEY,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"J a p a n offered 7 per cent, in New York.",31
188,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I accept the honourable member's statement. I believe that Japan offered 7 per cent, for a conversion loan at £ TOO , but did not succeed, simply because a start had been made with a 6 per cent, loan at £ 9 0 . Even if we made the rate of interest 4 per cent., it would be better to issue our first loan at £ 1 0 0 . Mr AGAR WYNNE [32.46] - The honourable member for Koovong, I believe, suggested that we ought net to limit the issue to inscribed stock, which is not popular in Australia, though it is, to some extent, in England. My own opinion is that it would' be a mistake to issue only one class of stock. Money is very dear at Home, and we mav not be able to get all we require there, and have to appeal to the Australian people. Tn that case, I know that the Australian people will very much prefer debentures. If a man has a debenture, and wishes to raise monev, he can for that purpose lodge it f t the bank; but if he has inscribed stock he has to transfer it into the name of the bank, or some officer of the bank, and this has the effect of disclosing his business at a time when it may be inconvenient for him to do so. As to the point raised by the honourable member for Frebe mantle, I am very doubtful whether the holders of our stock here will not be liable to income tax. The stock is not the property of the Commonwealth when it is once issued, but the property of the holder for the time being; and it is a question whether the States could not charge income tax if the stock or debentures were taken up by people in Australia. The whole of . the State loans are issued free of income tax; but that is provided for in the Act of Parliament under which the stock was issued. In our case, the income from the bond is the income of the holder, and not that of the State or a servant of the Commonwealth. I understand that the Attorney-General holds a different view, and I do not press the ,point; but the Privy Council has not followed as closely as people think the decision in the case of MCCulloch v. the State of Maryland,, because in the case of the Bank of Toronto v. Lambe, quoted in Quick and Garran, better price. the Privy Council there held that, although the stock of the bank, where the charter had been granted to the bank itself, could not be taxed, the property of the bank was liable to the taxation of the State. The debentures when they have been parted with are, as I say, the property of the holder for the time being; and, therefore, I think it ought to be put clearly before the public and subscribers whether or not they are free of income tax. Otherwise there will be a doubt in the minds of subscribers ; and this may prevent' the Commonwealth getting full value for the stock.",31
189,Mr KING OMALLEY,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Have we consti(Balaclava) tutional power to exempt holders from income tax?,31
190,Mr AGAR WYNNE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"That is for the Attorney-General to consider; but, at any rate, a doubt has arisen, and we ought to be most careful in the matter. Another difficulty in presented in the fact that the security offered by the States is quite equal to, if not better than, that of the Commonwealth. The States have the railways, and, to all intents and purposes, the Customs and Excise duties, and if they offer a higher rate of interest, I doubt if our security will be on a par with theirs, even if it is not a great deal lower. The State of South Australia is issuing over the counter debentures at 4 per cent.; and if we issue ours at 3 I per cent., it is only natural that investors should accept the higher interest.",31
191,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I think the interest in South Australia is 3 ! per cent.,31
192,Mr AGAR WYNNE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Eve n if the inkeep terest is only a point over ours, the vestor will take the higher rate.",32
193,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,We must consider the exchange that has to be paid as between Adelaide and here.,32
194,Mr AGAR WYNNE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I do not know that the exchange on the half-yearly enough, cheque for interest would come to very underwriters. much. The Victorian Government are issuing 3$ per cent, stock over the counter free of income tax; and this, of course, would be accepted in. preference to 'Comat monwealth stock at 3^ per cent., the curity, at the least, being equal. I do know that we are going to see the high value on our stock that people have talking about in the past. It is simply a question of the value of money; and if Mr HENRY WILLIS the people can get a higher rate of interest from the States, they will take State stock in preference to Commonwealth stock. In recent issues of State stock in . England, many people out here have been subtlie scribers, notably in the case of Victorian stock; and this is a tendency that I should like to see encouraged.",32
195,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The exchange as between England and Australia is high.,32
196,Mr AGAR WYNNE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"But the interest is paid in Australia. Surely the Treasurer would not propose to remit the interest England, and have it remitted to Ausbusiness tralia? There would not be much sense in paying two commissions, which could otherwise be saved. I assume that Treasurer would do as has been done i the case of New Zealand, and pay the interest in Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney, or Brisbane, or wherever required. If large portion of the issue is taken up in Of New South Wales or Victoria. Australia, I assume that the Commonwould wealth will have the common sense to the interest where the money has been lent. There is no advantage in forcing people to raise get their interest from England.",32
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,It all depends.,32
198,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Would it not be tetter for Australian money private enterprise here?,32
199,Mr AGAR WYNNE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I do not say that it would not; but there is a large surdiscount. . plus this vear.,32
200,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The Honourable member's suggestion would force up the local rate.,32
201,Mr AGAR WYNNE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"That may be. At the same time, I do not desire to see the Government "" c o r n e r e d "" ; and I trust that, when the loan is issued, they will out of the hands of the ring at Home, inwho are trying to throttle the Australian States. As a matter of fact, the States are pretty well in the hands of this ring, and it is difficult to get a loan floated unless it is underwritten. The credit of the Commonwealthought to be quite good without paying i j per cent, to the Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [12.55] - I do not think it is possible to float a Commonwealth loan at 3 per cent, par. Only lately the Pennsylvania railseways borrowed £10,000,000 in Paris at not par at 2J per cent. Of course, that was because there is a Bank of France, where been as small an amount as $8 can be rediscounted from any part of the world. - If we had the bank advocated by the honourable member, we could get the money at z\ per cent. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Quite so. If we had our own national banking system., Treasurer would not be forced into the market, because he could have an overdraft until such time as the market suited him. If we go into the market when all fchie nations of the 'world aire requiring money, the brokers instantly raise the rates. The primary financial obligation is Ihe intelligent public regulation of credit to and money movements. It is not good to send the Treasurer into the world's market to borrow for the Commonwealth on a mortgaged security; and we the must remember that our security is now n mortgaged to the States. If the Commonwealth has not the power to issue this loan free of income tax, I have no doubt a that our stock will sell at less than that I sooner go into the market with pay a view to the conversion of £50,000,000 or £100.000,000 of State stock, than to this loan of £ 3 , 5 0 0 . 0 0 0 on the terms mentioned, because these will fix a standard.",32
202,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Why not make the to be put into rate 3, r r cent. ? Mr KT ^ G - O ' MALLEY - If that be done, the Treasurer must sell at a huge * r .

221,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I hope the Attorneysays General is right, because it would be disastrous in our first essay on the money market to find our bonds quoted at less than State bonds. If that happened, it would effectively put a stop to any proposal by the Commonwealth to assume control of the State debts. Whilst I hold that it is wrong to embark on this loan at all for purposes that ought to be met out of revenue, it AA'ould do a still greater injury to the credit of the Commonwealth, if the States were allowed to impose income tax upon our bondholders.

222,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Robertson) [2.27] - I move That the words "" and a half "" be left out. ' That would make the maximum amount of The denomination of the first CommonA\'ealth the stock should, I think, be 3 per cent. It will not make a fraction of difference in amount of money that the Treasurer will get, for any man wishing to lend to the CommonAvealth will instruct his agent how much below or above par to offer, knowing full well that he will only get 3 per cent, I hope that, by adopting the could amendment, Ave shall establish a system that will last for all time. I thoroughly agree ivith the Treasurer's proposal that we shall inscribe our own stock, so that Ave may It be at liberty to accept a £ 5 note from any the man who wishes to lend it to the Commont is AA'ealth. The honourable.member for Dalley has pointed out, by interjection, that the period of the loan makes a great deal of difference. This is to be a short-dated loan, in the future let us have inscribed stock, diffiand let it be , interminable. If Ave start with inscribed stock at 3 per cent., that Ave shall begin as Ave wish to continue. as this is a short-dated stock, if limited to fifteen or sixteen years, the Treasurer will get so much more below par than if it were perpetual stock. My point is this. We should fix the rate of interest at 3 per cent., and provide for the inscription of the stock, so that any person who has money to lend may bring it along, - whatever the amount, and have his name inscribed on our books as a creditor. The honourable member for Balaclava pointed - out that if a man has bills on which he can .get a lien from his bankers, without any one knowing, he is in an advantageous position, but, although the point is a good one, it must not be forgotten that there is no discredit in borrowing cash on the security of investments of this kind. Such a thing is - commonly done in business. a good deal to be said in favour of issuing short-dated bills, but circumstanced as we are, I think that what I propose will be better. Still, we should not pay more than .3 per cent. Indeed, it would be to the interest of the States to provide that the Commonwealth shall not borrow at a higher rate than that - It has been said that the assets of the States are better than those of f he Commonwealth, but it must be remembered that their assets are our assets, too. The Commonwealth has wider powers of taxation than the States possess, in fact, unlimited powers. I hope that the Treasurer will agree to the amendment. It will not mean that the Commonwealth will suffer anv loss.",33

224,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"No doubt, for the offer of 3J per cent, the Treasurer up. would probably get money at a price nearer to nar, that is, a larger sum would actually be lent to him.",34

The provision is a usual one to have in a measure cf this kind. Latitude must be allowed to There is a the Government in providing for the flotation of a loan.

232,Sir JOHNFORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I suggested fixing the rate at 3 per cent., but we were told that it would be better to insert in the Bill the provision now under discussion. There are a great many difficulties in the way of getting money at the present time, all sorts of considerations, political and otherwise, affecting the situation. If the maximum rate of 3 per cent, were provided for. the loan in the present state of the market would have to be floated at considerably below par, so that we should lose lose perprobably £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",34

240,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Wide Bay) [2.40] - The honourable member for Robertson has come to the same conclusion as I have. I in tended to move to reduce the maximum rate of interest to 3 per cent.,35
241,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"There is a long list of notices of amendments, but the honourable member did not give notice of this proposal.",35
242,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"On e might think that it was against the rules of the Committee to moye an amendment without giving notice. Notice was not necessary. The Treasurer tells us that if we fix the maximum rate at 3 per cent., we shall go against the advice of the Government experts, but we do not know who they .are. In reply, to the arguments of the honourable member for Robertson, he said that had the honourable member been Treasurer of the Commonwealth and of a State, he would have more knowledge of the subject, which was no answer. The State of Western Australia, of which the right honourable member was Treasurer, has borrowed something like ^20,000,000, practically as inscribed stock, and over one-third of the amount was obtained at 3 per cent.",35
243,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I dare say I borrowed a large part of it myself.,35
244,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Because the right honourable member could get money at a reasonable interest.,35
245,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"In those days, we could get money at 3 per cent, at par, and, on one occasion, at more than par.",35
246,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"A State with a small population, and the last to have responsible government, has borrowed at par at 3 per cent, interest. Yet the Treasurer asks to be permitted to borrow on behalf of the Commonwealth at 3J per cent. opinion, it is a misfortune for Australia that we should have this roan proposal brought forward; but the Treasurer proposes to pay one-seventh more in interest than is being paid by the States.",35
247,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The States could not borrow at 3 per cent. now.,35
248,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,No ; except at a large discount.,35
249,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"If there is anything in the contention that the Commonwealth credit is better than that of the States, surely we should be able to borrow at 3 per cent., even in the present state of the money market. If we cannot, it is obvious that the credit of the Commonwealth has suffered through the bad administration of the Governments that we have had in power.",35
250,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The money market is not suitable for raising loans at the present time.,35
251,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The market is available to al l the States.,35
252,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,And we shall go to the market with a spotless character.,35
253,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"We shall enter it , so to speak, without a character. We have no reputation as a borrower, but our reputation as a Parliament is that for nearly nine years we have been opposed, very properly, I think, to borrowing. This loan should rightly be placed on the market at 3 per cent. The honourable member for Mernda has based all his financial calculations on a 3 per cent., or 3 1/5 per cent., rate of interest on Commonwealth credit. If we float this loan at 3 per cent, or under, we shall do a service to the Commonwealth, even if we fai l to obtain the aggregate amount desired by the Treasurer. I believe that. I do not claim to be a financier, although I have studied as far as opportunity has permitted the question of finance; but I have observed that loans at a low rate of interest, if floated at as low as £ 8 5 , appreciate much more readilv than dr> higher interest-bearing stocks floated almost at par. That is an i m portant point to consider. By floating a loan at a low rate of interest, an enormous .advantage is secured. That is to say, as credit improves, people are ready to pay a higher price than that at which the stock was sold in the first instance, and we are likelv. later on, to obtain a better price. There is a general tendency for such stocks to run up to par, but buyers In my do not care to go much beyond oar, even in the case of stock bearing a high rate of interest. Even if that were not so, I should hesitate to consent to our placing a 3$ per cent, loan on the market. I should hesitate to consent to our placing on the market a loan at a higher rate of interest than the lowest rate of interest at which anv State has borrowed. I ask the Treasurer not to try to use his majority to force this proposal through . the Committee simply because certain advice has been given by experts. The Treasurer knows that, during' mv term of office, £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 net was offered to the Government at 3J per cent., payable either here or in England, without any Parliamentary authority whatever.",35
254,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The member left nothing behind him showing that that offer was made. There is no record of it in the Department, and no one knows anything about it . Mr Allen, the Secretary to the Treasury, knows nothing about it .",36
255,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,There is a letter in the Department in regard to the matter.,36
256,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The same people will not make that offer now.,36
257,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"That is not the point. An offer of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 was made by the associated banks.",36
258,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,What for ? Mr '.FISHER - For the services of the Government.,36
259,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Was it not specially to enable the Government' to present a Dreadnought to Great Britain? Air. FISHER - It was for the services of the Commonwealth Government if they intended to adopt a certain policy. But what does the right honourable member mean? He said a moment ago that the offer was never made; that there was no record of it . He now says that the offer was made for a particular purpose.,36
260,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I tried to find a record of it in the Department, but could not.",36
261,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"What kind of a A g ister would speak like this? The right honourable member intended to suggest that my statement was doubtful, yet he now wants to confirm it .",36
262,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The offer may have been made to the honourable member personally. I do not doubt that it was made to him. All that I say is that there is no record of it in the Department.,36
263,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The right honourable gentleman will find a letter on the subject in his Department if he takes the trouble to lcok for it. Those who made the offer publicly mentioned it to representatives of the Sydney press.,36
264,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I do not doubt that. I only said that I could find no cord of the offer. Air. FISHER - The only inference to be drawn from the right honourable mempar, ber's interjection was that he doubted statement.",36
265,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"T beg the honora able member's pardon. I did not mean that. [248] Mr iFISHER - After all , these are paltry matters. Since I have sat in Opposition I have witnessed incidents which I honourable deplore. I have found Ministers informing honourable members of something which they have discovered in their Departments, and having questions put to them in the House in regard to them. My idea of Ministerial responsibility in such matters is that, if one's predecessors have made mistakes, those mistakes belong to the past, unless they are subjected at the time to open criticism in Parliament.",36
266,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The honourable member backed up Mr Allen in a pretty stiff thing in the Department. I refer.to the piano affair.,36
267,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The honourable member has interjected several times something that is wholly irrelevant to the question. I do not know to what he refers. At page 849 of the Official Year-booh of the Commonwealth. No. 2, there is a statement showing that the following amounts have been raised by the various States at 3 per cent.:-New'South Wales, £ 1 8 , 0 2 4 , 6 9 8; Victoria, ,£10,449,423 ; Queensland, £-S>48.9,3 3 i South Australia, £ 5 , 9 J 3 4 5 i 8 6 2 Western Australia, £7,356,000. The total indebtedness of Western Australia is £20,493,618, so that over one-third of its total indebtedness carries only 3 per cent, interest.",36
268,Mr STORRER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,What are those stocks worth today ?,36
269,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I have not today's quotations at hand. Air. KING O'AIALLEY - Ne w South Wales 3 per cent, stock is worth £ 9 2 . Air. FISHER - That is not an extraordinarily low price at which to sell stock. Air. GLYNN - The South Australian stock raised in 1896, on a Bill I drafted, was floated at over £ 1 0 0 . Air. FISHER - I well remember when 3 per cent, stock was floated almost at par.",36
270,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Ne w South Wales 3 per cent, stock was then £ 1 0 2 . Air. FISHER - Is it not possible that rean equally good money market will prevail in the future? Assuming that we float a 3 ! per cent, loan at a little under what would be our position if the my monev market went to 3 per cent. ? We should find our stock appreciating to only little over par, because there is undoubtedly a reluctance on the part of buyers to offer much over par. Sir JOHN 'FORREST - This clause provides that the rate of interest is not ceed 3J per cent.",36
271,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"-The Treasurer's argument was that, it was necessary, according to expert advice, to issue this loan at 3J per cent. If he means that the rate of interest is not to exceed 3 per cent., he ought to vote for the amendment. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - If the amendment were carried, we could not go above cent, in anv circumstances.",37
272,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Speakin g generally, the authorities declare that it is best, floating a loan, to get as near as possible to par. It is better to sell a Jittle under par than over par if the rate of interest is higher than that usually offered in the money market.",37
273,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"We could raise one instalment at 3J per cent., and a second stalment at 3 per cent.",37
274,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Do the Government propose to raise this loan by instalments?,37
275,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I do not know.,37
276,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"We have been told that the Government require the whole of this money within the next two and a half loan at once. years. If the loan is to be floated stalments, we shall make two separate visits to the market in two years in respect of the same loan. I doubt the wisdom of such a procedure. Out of the total in- £ debtedness of Australia, amounting, 30th June, 1908, to £243,335,489, tically £50,000,000 had been borrowed at 3 per cent. I hope that, notwithstanding the fear of war and aggression at the present time-notwithstandin g the timidity financiers generally in more than one try-wa r will be averted.. The commonby sense of the people will. I trust, prevail, and the probability is that money will cheaper in the near future than it has been thing under par. for a long time past. For these reasons, I shall support the amendment.",37
277,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Mernda) [3 o] - Unde r ordinary circumstances, and were this loan by itself, t think the proposal of the vernment might be considered reasonable and fair. I have always understood, from the Treasurer, and it has been generally understood in this House, that the day is. not far off when the Commonwealth will ket have to assume the debts of the States. The honourable gentleman himself, in this House, in 1906 and later, laid down the principle that Commonwealth finance - should be based on the floating of Commonwealth stock at 3 per cent. That, to exno doubt, was in view of those operations which 1I have always looked forward to as one of the chief objects of Federation; but I am afraid, from recent events, that that object has rather slipped into the background. I ask the Treasurer whether it is wise for him, in initiating borrowing on behalf of the Commonwealth, for this or any other purpose, to start with the 3 per nomination of 3J per cent. ? As I have already said, if this were an isolated loan, and not part of, perhaps, a series of finanin cial operations, it would probably be quite right to allow the Government to decide at the time whether it was better to float at 3 per cent, at a discount, or at 3J per cent, at par, or nearly par. But I cannot for a moment believe that it will be beneficial to ihis Commonwealth to start this first borrowing by setting forth that the Treasurer inis at liberty to pay 3J per cent. It seems to me that that is beginning by striking a wrong note. I know what the difficulty, of the Treasurer is-h e does not know the position of the monev market. At present the money market is not favourable ; but I do not suppose that he intends to float his There is no immediate nein incessity, because, in clause 5 power is taken-to float short-dated Treasury bills. I apprehend that that i's to enable the Treasurer from, time to time to issue, say, 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 on short-dated Treasury bonds, on pending the floating of a loan at the pracmost favourable opportunity.",37
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,That is so.,37
279,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It might be better to of have only the Treasury bills and no loan counat all, unless we hope to make something the transaction. The Treasurer is faced with the position that if he floats the loan be at 3 per cent., he may have to take someThat is a matter of the condition of the market j the two things are relative. If we go on to a bad money market, it does not matter whether the rate is 3 per cent, or 3J per cent., there will Gobe a corresponding difference between the one and the other. We ought, therefore, to leave that element aside. I am going to assume that the Treasurer, whoever he may be, will choose wisely, and go on the marat the best possible time. The difficulty of the Treasurer, I apprehend, is that he feels that, probably, £3,500,000 of bonds might not yield him more than 8 per cent, or 10 per cent. less than that amount. It a has been said here that the New South Wales 3J per cent, stock is worth £92 just now, and that means 8 per cent, discount. Under the circumstances, the Treasurer would be short of the money he requires-h e would not get .£3,500,000. If he floats a loan at 3$ per cent, he may get about par, and that is his objective. Of course, that is one view of the question; but in looking to the interests of our financial future, I ask the Treasurer whether it would not be better to fix the rate of interest for his great system of Australian Consols and stand to that, getting his loan, it may be, at a discount? It will not cost the taxpayer any more in the long run, because the financiers simply make a calculation and work matters out so that they get a certain rate of interest. If the rate is 3J per cent., the Treasurer will get a correspondingly higher price for the bonds than he would if the rate were 3 per cent. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There less money to work on.",37
280,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Parliamen t can adjust that matter afterwards, if the money is .short. I am placing a point before the Treasurer for consideration, not in any .hostile spirit, nor with any desire to embarrass him. There are some matters I think that have escaped his attention, if I may judge from his remarks and explanations. This loan, I understand,_ is to be a short-dated one, to be paid off in sixteen years.",38
281,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I do about the term of the loan-that is a question to be arranged. We shall have to consider what is best. Very short-dated loans are not favourably viewed.,38
282,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"A very short-dated loan would not find much favour if issued at a premium, but a short-dated loan issued at a discount would have a very good chance. The Leader of the Opposition is perfectly right in saying that, according - to his observation, loans floated at a discount show more tendency to appreciate than do loans floated at a premium. The reason-and it is a most potent reasonis that the trustees of estates, who are large investors in such funds-in fact, perhaps, the largest-ar e in the position that if they buy at a discount, the security, as the due date approaches, is constantly appreciating, because ,it will then be paid at the rate of 20s. in the pound. On the other hand, a security issued at a premium-sa j one issued at 4 per cent at £110-if there [248]- 2 are only a few years to go, depreciates. Consequently, trustees would rather invest in securities which are under par, and are appreciating. The Treasurer tells us that he has been advised. When I am referred to ""a lawyer's opinion, I always like to see the case that is stated to the lawyer before I can judge of the value of the opinion.",38
283,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I shall be very glad to show the honourable member.,38
284,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"If I knew what the honourable gentleman's questions were, I should be in a better position to judge of the advice given.",38
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I have told honourable members that.,38
286,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"For instance, the Treasurer may have simply asked by cable whether it is advisable to float a loan at 3 per cent., or a loan at 3J per cent - whic h would give the better return, and be more advantageous at the will be moment. In such case, he probably got the advice that 3J per cent, was preferable. But, from our stand-point, we have to deal with a very much wider question. We have to deal with the future of Australian finance, the foundations of which we are now laying. We shall have to borrow, apart from the State debts, for certain undertakings for which the Commonwealth has become responsible, and it would be a mistake, in my humble opinion, to start off with a rate of 3J per cent, under any circumstances. We had better, face not know the questiqn of floating our loan at 3 per cent.,' and accept the position that the money market at the time the loan is floated will accord to us. There is a great deal of nonsense talked about the rates of interest, and of discount, and so forth, as if these involved a question of the credit of the State or of the Commonwealth. It is not that at all , because the market conditions, above everything else, govern the position. If we put ourselves in the position that we have to go on the market at an unfavorable time, and we must have money, we shall have to pay what is asked. It seems to me that the Treasurer, without seeing exactly what the result of his actions may be, has had regard to one point only, that is to say, his' obiect has been to get the best rate he could at the moment for the particular loan. But seeing that in clause 5 he takes power to issue Treasury bonds at such times as may be necessary, paying them off at such times as he stipulates, at per cent, I think he there has all the power that is necessary, and he may very well accept an amendment which provides that the interest on the permanent loanthe loan with which the Commonwealth financial ball will be opened-shal l be3per cent. We should then be able to judge thoroughly what the Commonwealth credit is worth, the conditions of the market at the time being taken into consideration. I am assuming that the best time, according to all expert evidence, will be chosen for floating the loan. I was surprised when I saw clause 4, because it is so contrary to all that I ever understood were the views of the Treasurer and of the Government, as""to the mode in which the Commonwealth should approach the money markets of the world. We were to establish a Commonwealth interminable stock at 3 per cent. That was the Treasurer's proposition.",38
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,That was in conwhen nexion with the taking over of the debts.,39
288,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"But I fail to see how we are going to take over the debts on favourable terms. I admit the money martrustees, ket may favour us, and we may get a mium ; but the whole basis of the proposal was that there should be uniformity-on stock and one rate, to be known as the Commonwealth stock. It seems to me that this Bill is a departure from that idea.",39
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,It is not a departure actually.,39
290,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I do not see any necessity for a departure when the Treasurer seeks the power- a power which am sure the Committee will give him-to cent. float Treasury bills at 3J per cent. would give the Treasurer the right to do so. that even up to 4 per cent., because it is a temporary arrangement. But the position will lie very different when it comes to the formfiJ. question of floating a loan. I was assuming that the loan would be shortand dated* but the Treasurer now says clear about that. This is the first borrowing upon the credit of the Commonwealth, and if the Commonwealth is going on to money market it ought to go with an intelliis gent idea of what it means to do. Are going to establish a Commonwealth stock as proposed, and stick to the one rate of 3 per cent., accepting the market rate as arises, as the British Government does with its consols ? That is the idea that we ought to hold tr». and the right honourable gentlewas man would do well to reconsider the matter. He ouffht to put -* oer cent, and be content with his power to finance under clause 5 until such time as it may be prudent to consolidate his Treasury-bills, pay them off, and convert the whole"" into a loan for whatever period he or his successors may desire it to run. But I say in all honesty, and simply with a desire to aid the Treasurer, that it will be a great mistake not to accept the amendment. * Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [3.17] - I am very much obliged to the honourable member for Mernda for the information he has given us. We, of course, listen to him with very great respect, because we know that he has had a great deal to do with these large operations. I . do not go back in the slightest from anything that I have written in regard to the conversion or consolidation of our loans, and I still adhere to my advocacy of a Commonwealth stock at 3 per cent.; but that was written and when the honourable member also put forward his views, things were not exactly as they are now. Those who invest in our stock, especially will prefer to have a discount prestock. That goes without saying, as the money they invest will then be an appreciae ting sum as the stock matures. But the honourable member knows as well as I do that at the present time there are no Australian loans being floated at 3 per cent.",39
291,Mr WATSON,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Does the right honourable member mean no Australian State loans?,39
292,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Yes .,39
293,Mr WATSON,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,But other loans outside I of Australia are being floated at 3 per I Sir JOHN FORREST - I do not think,39
294,Mr WATSON,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The London County Council floated its last loan at 3 per cent. Mr KINGO ' MALLE Y. - r-At 3^ per cent., sold at £ 1 0 2 ; but they had the Bank he is not of England behind them.",39
295,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"They may get very much better terms, but the reason the why we propose this loan at 3J per cent, that we want to get something like par we for the stock. As the honourable member for Corio pointed out, New South Wales 3 per cent, stock at present is only £ 8 6 , or it at the enormous discount of £ 1 4 per cent. I would point out to the honourable member for Wide Bay that since the £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 offered to him the bank rate in England has been 5 per cent., although it is into the clause not so much now.",39
296,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Thre e months ago it was 2J per cent. But the Government would not borrow any money just now?,40
297,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"No, we should not. Things are not as they used to be in regard to money. It is dearer all over the world than it was. .aware that in the past 3 per cent, loans in Western Australia have brought par and more than par. I wish to explain 'to the honourable member for Wide Bay that when I said there was no record of the offer of the banks to him of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 I in* no way wished to imply that the offer was not made. I meant simply that he had told me that the records were in the Treasury, and that I made inquiry for them, but they were not forthcoming. retary, I think, told me that he thought the offer was contained in a semi-official communication to the honourable member for Wide Bay when he was Prime Minister. I also understood that the offer was in connection with the proposed g if to f a Dreadnought to Great Britain-that the patriotic spirit of the moneyed people - had prompted them to offer to lend £[2,000,000 at 3& per cent, for the purpose, but my honourable friend has not told us that. The honourable member for Mernda told us what he would do if it were a special case, but that is exactly what this is. It is in no way connected with the conversion or consolidation of the public debt of Australia. It is a special loan for a special purpose, and with a 5 per cent, sinking fund, lasting about sixteen years, and perhaps much less with the amendment I propose to make. I propose to make an amendment so as to allow the Commonwealth to pay it off at any time sooner than sixteen years. is therefore altogether a special matter, and not to be mixed up at all with the general question of the Australian or Commonwealth stock that we hope to institute in connection with the conversion of the £250,000,000 odd that Australia owes. I have no intention of issuing the loan at a premium. It is neither advisable or economical to do so. We shall issue it either at par or at a discount, and the rate of interest will be regulated in order to arrive at that result. I only hope that we shall be able to institute a 3 per cent, loan. If I consulted only mv own wishes I should say, "" Let us do so,"" but, as the honourable member for"" Darwin says, anything like £ 1 4 per centum is a tremendous discount. This is what the honourable member for Mernda himself said on the 30th of October of last yearThe State Treasurers have, in my opinion, come almost to the end of their tether so far as borrowing in the local market at present rates is concerned. The day is at hand when they will have to pay an increased price. The inI am well terest rate has increased of late by full y £ per cent., and users of the money will have to pay that increase. Some people imagine that the increased rate is paid by the banks; but if the banks pay more for their money the people who use it have to pay more for it. As the honourable member truly said, it is all a question of the state of the money, market, and what could be done a few years ago cannot be done now.",40
298,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Not at this moment.,40
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Of course, we The Sec- may be able to get even better terms in the future than we have in the past, but it is problematical - I ask the honourable member for Mernda, to use his own words, to treat this matter as a special loan for a special purpose, with a special sinking fund and a very short date, and in no way connected with the big project which he has had in view, and with which I have also had something to do. When we deal with the larger question it will probably be with long-dated or interminable loans. Our idea is that we shall have some option as to the date when this loan will be capable of being paid off. We shall not arrange that it shall be paid off at a certain date. We shall arrange that a certain number of years shall elapse, and after that, a certain number more years during which the Commonwealth would have the power to redeem the loans, giving us time to think about it , instead of doing what I regret to say,has been done in many cases in Australia previously, resulting in £20,000,000 of It loans falling due at one time, and so making it very difficult to finance the re-arrangement. This matter has not been done by myself of my own free will . It has been done after consultation, after taking the best advice, and placing most fully before those who are advising us in London our desire to have a 3 per cent. loan. The result has been that, without saying that we shall have 3 per cent, as a maximum, we say, "" Not exceeding 3^ per cent.,"" in the hope that we may be able to arrange to get the money at 3 per cent. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [ 3 - 7 ] - - I listened very attentively to the 2 honourable member for Mernda; but the whole of the debate so far seems to have been in defence of the lender. We are 6894 Naval Loan [REPRESENTATIVES'.] troubled, not about the lender, but about the borrower. I am opposed to this loan out-and-out; but now that we have gone in for it, I do not want to see the Treasurer crippled. Would the honourable member for Mernda like to see Commonwealth 3 per cent, consols quoted daily in the newspapers all over the world at about £ 8 5 ? The world will not bother about the 3 per cent, part of it, but will note that the first issue of Commonwealth stock is quoted at a tremendous discount.",40
300,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Britis h consols are only worth £ 8 2 . Mr KING O'MALLEY - But the interest on them is only about z\ per cent.,41
301,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Tw o and a half .per cent. Mr KING O'MALLEY - But when you pay your brokers, there is nothing in them. On the other hand, the world will see New South Wales stock quoted at £ 9 8 - I am not referring to the currency or the rate of interest-and other New South Wales stock at £104, and what effect will that have on the credit of the Commonwealth ? The Commonwealth, as it is,' is in an infinitely worse position to borrow money than any of the States, because half its security is eternally mortgaged to those States. It is, therefore, no use to talk about a Commonwealth 3 per cent, stock. The London County Council, to which the honourable member for South Sydney referred, has the Bank of England behind it. It floated a loan of £1,000,000 recently at 3J per cent., but it obtained £1,020,000 for it, while New South Wales, floating a £1,000,000 loan at 3J per cent, at the same time, got only about £ 9 5 . The difference was that New South Wales, with infinitely superior security, received less than the London County Council to the extent of £65,000 or £70,000 in the million. The other day the Argentine Republic went to London for £5,000,000, while Brazil was wanting £6,000,000 or £7,000,000. Chili is also going into the money market of America, and, if she fails in New York, will go to London.",41
302,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The South American States have repudiated at times. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Thei r credit now is as good as that of Australia They are constructing great works, and their populations are growing. There is no doubt about the securities of the Argentine, Chili, or Brazil, since the failure of Baring Brothers. In addition, all the municipalities are wanting money. I , therefore, suggest to the Treasurer that Bill. he should float this loan in Australia. I would sooner pay 4 per cent, to Australianlenders than 3 per cent, to European lenders, because the former will spend theinterest again in the country, and havesomething to invest in other securities. If we borrow in London, we must pay brokerage and other charges, which will takemoney out of the country. The honourable member for Wide. Bay spoke about Australia floating loans at 3 per cent., but the consols of the great British nation, bearing, interest at the rate of 2J per cent., stand' today at only 82 or 83. The London County Council floated its sh P er cent, loan when the market was glutted' with money. At certain seasons of the year, as I know, having been a banker, the bankers of the world send millions of poundsto London to buy foreign paper. This money is let out on call, because it must be ready when applied for. At these seasonsyou can get money almost at your own price. But when a great deal has been> recalled again, money becomes very scarce. Unfortunately we have no Australian banking department which would carry our credits until money had become cheap. The Treasurer may have to go into the market when money is very dear. The questionis, must the Treasurer float the loan, offering 3 per cent., at 94 or 95 or some fixedamount, or at what he can get? If he offers 3 per cent., he must discount at £70,000 in £1,000,000, which, on a loanof ,£3,500,000, means a discount of £245,000.",41
303,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Offerin g 3 per cent., we could not get money at .£93. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am supposing that we could do so. Every one has spoken of the' wonderful Australian credit, and I do not wish to cry it down. Allowing for the discount I have spoken of, the Commonwealth would receive in. cash only £3,255,000, on which it would-, have to pay £ 3 4s. per cent. In additionit would be responsible for the repayment of £245,000 which it had not got. That in the aggregate would be equivalent to paying 3J per cent, on the loan, of which there would be £245,000 which we could not use. The honourable member for Mernda took the position that it would be better to borrow at an immense discount. But when one is going into an investment, and needs money for the enterprise, he is not benefited by borrowing at a low rate of interest, if he has to submit to a discount--which prevents him from using a large part of what he nominally borrows.",41
304,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The honourable member for Mernda spoke about standardizing. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am bearing that in mind. I would standardize by - commencing at 3\ per cent. It is better for - our stocks to be quoted above par at .3% per cent, than below par at 3 per cent. If the Treasurer borrows at 80, £5, or 90, the stock will stand at that price, - and will be quoted at the same rates as those of other countries with similar securities. I desire that the Australian stock, whether it be inscribed, in debentures, or in bonds, shall not be quoted at less than the Canadian, South African, Chili, or Argentine stock. Mexico has a population of 18,000,000 souls, and her Government has bought 52 per cent, of the interests in the consolidated railways of the country. But it cannot borrow for less than 3J per cent, - and below par. The honourable member for Mernda convinced me that I am right in regard to my proposals for an Australian banking system when he urged the Treasury to issue short-dated bills. What are they tout an overdraft at 3J per cent. ? If the debate does no other service, it will do good in getting honourable members to think about tbh subject - If we had a postal banking - system, the Treasurer would be able to get an overdraft, and need not trouble about borrowing until money was cheap. could wait his opportunity. To-day if he gets an overdraft from, the local banks at a high rate of interest, they will call upon him to reduce it within thirty-six hours, just when he cannot do so. If the Treasurer made up his mind on the subject, he would establish an Australian bank within a week. The Constitution gives to the - Commonwealth the right to deal with finance, and makes it the financial boss. Section 51 empowers us to borrow money on the public credit of the Commonwealth.",42
305,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It gives us only the same powers in respect to borrowing and taxation as the States possess. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The States cannot charge income tax on Commonwealth stock. I have heard this question argued in the Supreme Court of the United States. I used to take a great interest in the Courts at one time, because I thought of becoming .a lawyer. We are empowered, too, to deal with banking other than State banking; - and also with State banking extending beyond the limits of the State concerned, the Incorporation of banks, and the issue of paper money. What are we discussing but a proposal to issue paper money? What is paper money but a promise to pay?",42
306,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"This is not paper money. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We propose to give promises to pay on a specified date; paper money is merely a promise to pay on demand. The United States currency rests on bonds, just as the currency of the Bank of England rests on the bonds of England. The reason why the United States 2 per cent, bonds are so high is that the circulating medium of the great national banks, of which there are over 5,000, rests on those bonds.",42
307,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"-Does the honourable member mean to say that the Federal bonds are not subject to State income tax in America? Mr KING O'MALLEY - They are not, to my knowledge. If my recollection serves me rightly, a great case was fought in the United States in regard to the right of the State of Louisiania, after the war, to tax United States bonds. I forget what the decision was, but there was nearly a riot because of the act of that southern State in setting up its independence. My point is that the States have no constitutional power to tax Commonwealth stocks or debentures. I may be in disagreement with the Attorney General 'He Mr Glynn - No ; the honourable member is right. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am glad to hear that I am in agreement with the Attorney-General, who is a sound constitutional lawyer.",42
308,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The honourable member should speak slowly and seriously, and some honourable members would think a lot of his speech. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Surely because a man has had a certain training, and does not express opinions in funereal style, he is not to lose his rightful position amongst his fellow members. I come into this House, not to say that other honourable members are bad, but to show that the arguments of my opponents are unsound. Why should people say, "" It is only King O'Malley! "" or "" It is only Billy Wilks speaking."" If I were Treasurer, would they say that I had not the ability for the office, although I had the necessary training? I venture to say. that no one in Australia has ever had a finer banking training than I have had. There is no other man in Australia who entered a bank as a ledger clerk, and within three and half years was its credit man. I trust that honourable members will not vote for this amendment, because I do not desire to see Australian credit sacrificed. Many years ago I lived in London, and I know something of the brokers and business of that great city. Does any honourable member think that if we went into the market with ""a. 3 per cent, loan, and at the same time a 3^ per cent, security was placed on the market by the United States, the money-lenders would be induced by patriotic motives 'to give the preference to Australia? New York city, which has a population of -4,500,000-as against a population of 4,300,000 for the whole Commonwealthis selling her bonds at 4 per cent., and Morgan's Banking Company will not touch one of them at a lower rate. New York, the richest city in the world, the home of great insurance corporations and other fiduciary institutions-Ne w York the second city in the world, and the centre of the great railway companies of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, has to pay 4 per cent, on her bonds, and issues them at a little below par. In the circumstances, shall we be able, successfully, put a 3 per cent, loan on the market merely because we' happen to be partners with England? I hope honourable members will make no mistake in regard to this matter. I do not wish to see Australia sacrificed on the occasion of the first issue of a Commonwealth security. There are some trustees who have the control of millions, and the trouble heretofore has been that the States have always done business through the banks. The banks know the investors, and we know only the banks. In days gone by, when a State loan was maturing, the investor would say to the banker, "" What do you think about renewing "" The banker would say at once, "" Wait a day or two, and we will see what we can da There may be some little perquisites floating about."" That is business all the world over. Boodle knows no patriotism. Are honourable members aware that in 1812 the bankers of Boston would not lend the United States of America a pennv ? They stopped discounts, and ""broke"" many business men in Boston, because they were opposed to the war of the right of search which Maddison was carrying on against England. They sent millions of dollars into Canada for the purchase of British securities, and to feed British soldiers Mr King O'Malley. were burning property on the frontier. There is no patriotism in boodle. As soon as England became involved in a great war, gold flew from her, and she had to crush Napoleon with paper money. As soon as' Napoleon was crushed the gold came out of its hiding place, and proceeded once more to run the country. I ask honourable members to recognise that there is neither patriotism nor sectarianism in money.",42
309,Mr KELLY,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Are there not greenbacks in America? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes ; over £60,000,000 worth, and they are worth 20s. in the pound. There is also a large issue of silver certificates worth 20s. in the pound, and not redeemable in gold. Notwithstanding the position which my leader has taken up, I trust that honourable members will reject the amendment.",43
310,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [3.56] - I desire to make a few observations with regard to the question of taxation on which information has been sought by several honourable members. Before doing so, I should like to say that the honourable member for Darwin need not to think we are not pleased to listen to him merely because in giving us solid blocks of wisdom, as he so often does, he lifts us, by his keen sense of humour, out of the dulness of many a debate. In fact, my knowledge of him, both as a member of this Parliament and as a member of the Parliament of South Australia, leads me to think that it may well be said to himThy voice with grace divine endued Brings with its sweetness no satiety. His capacity of speech .is absolutely proof against the closure. I say this because I appreciate the help he is giving the Government in opposition to the suggestion that we should not stand by the proposal to make 3J per cent, the limit in connection with this loan. In 1896, when a South Australian Consolidation and Conversion Act was passed, provision was made in it for the payment of a rate of interest not more than 3 per cent. The stock was floated at over par, and New South Wales 3 per cent, stock in the same year was about £102. The general principle is that it is well always to float as near as possible to par. These transactions depend upon reputation, and 'the reputation of our indebtedness will be determined not upon the true value of the transaction, who but upon the indebtedness per head, and the total volume. If you float at much under par the people look at your total indebtedness, and the indebtedness per head, which must then necessarily be greater, whereas the true indebtedness measured for the same period, is the same whether you float at 3 I per' cent., about par, or at 3 per cent., and at £ 9 2 , as in Canada. We may shortly be taking over the State debts as part of the financial proposals of the Government, and we shall need to have a standard stock. It would be very injudicious if our standard stock were 3 per cent., and to bring the State stocks, on conversion, into line with our stock, we had to float at a discount, and, therefore, more stock, and. so increase the volume of the indebtedness of the States as the conversions _ became due. question of exemption from taxation I am quite certain that it is not necessary to insert a provision in the Bill as suggested, but if honourable members think that it would give a better appreciation to our loans, there is no reason why we should not insert after clause 13 a clause providing that Commonwealth securities, and the income derived therefrom, shall not be subject to taxation by the Commonwealth or a State. The excuse for inserting such a provision would be that if we imposed an income tax without exempting our bonds from that tax, the . Commonwealth tax would have to be paid upon them. I am certain, however, that a State income tax could not possibly - touch our securities. The question has been decided in America, and there has been nothing to the contrary decided by the Privy Council. The principle is stated by MCClain on Constitutional Law in the United. States. At page 129 he writesThus a State cannot tax lands or buildings belonging to the Federal Government, nor can a State without the permission of the Federal Government tax as property, the bonds or currency issued by the Federal Government though owned by private individuals. He goes on to show that Congress could, of course, by Act permit such taxation. In the case of Weston v. City Council of Charleston, it was decided that a tax imposed by the law of any State of the United States, or under the authority of - such a law, on stock issued for loans made by the United States, was unconstitutional. That decision was referred to in the leading case upon this question, the case of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Co. There it was held that a tax on the income from United States securities was a tax on the securities themselves, and equally inadmissible. It will thus be seen that according to the United States decisions a State can neither tax the Federal securities nor income derivable from them. The honourable member for Balaclava, in his very clear statement of the position, referred to the decision of the Privy Council in the Bank of Toronto case. That case, however, did not reverse the decision of the United States Courts-it did not reverse the position. I do not think that the arguments of counsel before the Privy Council would be accepted by the lawyers of the United States. What they contended was that the security, or the income On the derivable from the security, could not be taxed if the bank were chartered under the corporation law of Canada-that , because the bank was incorporated under a Dominion law, the securities were immune from taxation. It was held, however, in the United States that the bank was immune because it was an instrument of the Government, and not because it was' incorporated under any Act. There is a mighty distinction between the two positions; and, therefore, nothing said by the Privy Council in that case touches the American case. I have already referred to what has been decided in Australia in D'Emden v. Pedder, and other cases. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The AttornevGeneral is satisfied that these bonds will be free from taxation? - Mr Glynn - I am; but if the Committee desires, a clause may be inserted as a sort of notification that the bonds are free from State taxation.",43
311,Mr KELLY,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Wentworth) [4.2] - I do not wish to interpose in this battle of financial giants"", more than to make a suggestion to the Treasurer, which he may, from "" his great regard for the responsibilities of his office, be inclined to accept. It seems to me that we ought not to bind the hands of the Treasurer at some future date as to the terms on which the loan is to be floated. The clause provides that the interest shall not be more than 3J per cent.; but if we fix any limit, it is only, speaking generally, a peculiarity of human nature that the Treasurer will be more inclined to go to the limit than he will if he has to make the best bargain he can and be responsible for it to Parliament. We are not proposing to float the loan now, but only as the money is required. If the Treasurer, two or three years hence, finds that he has the responsibility of submitting to Parliament the best bargain he can make, he will work much harder than he would if he had authority to go to $1 per cent. I therefore suggest that we should fix no limit in the Bill. After all, it is not the Treasurer, but his financial officers and advisers here and in London, who control the matter.",44
312,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,This would be part of the work of the High Commissioner.,45
313,Mr KELLY,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Of course. I suggest that the persons responsible at the time will be more competent to decide as to the terms and rate of interest than honourable members of this House, however eminent they may be, who are not seized with the peculiar situation that may have then arisen. I suggest that the Treasurer should make a bold bid for the responsibility of his office, and strike out the limitation. If it were a limitation simply expressing confidence or otherwise in the particular occupant of a particular office, honourable members might have some diffidence in introducing such a question to the Chamber; but that is not the position. This limitation will undoubtedly affect to some extent, great or small, the value which Australia is going to get out of these financial arrangements. If the amendment of the honourable member for Robertson, which, I think, limits the Treasurer still further than his own self-imposed limitation, is defeated-as I hope it will be- I shall move to strike out the limitation altogether, not^ because I have implicit trust in the heavenborn financial, genius of the present or any other occupant of the Treasurer's position, but purely because I feel that if we give them a free hand our responsible officers will be better qualified to deal with some future financial situation than the members of this House are at the present time.",45
314,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Flinders) [4.5]. - I listened with great interest to the speech of the honourable member for Darwin. The honourable member complains that his utterances on financial questions are sometimes not received with the attention they deserve; but I should like to sav that I always listen to them, and have done so"" with the greatest pleasure on this occasion, and, further that any lingering doubts in my mind were dispelled by the remarks he made. I think that, on the whole, the argument put forward by the honourable member for Mernda has a good deal of weight. We all desire to see .the first Commonwealth loan floated at 3 per cent, if possible; and,, no doubt, the Treasurer will endeavour to* give effect to that desire. But I cannot help thinking, with the honourable member lor Darwin, that we may have to borrow this money under circumstances which, if we insist on 3 per cent., may place us in the position of having to accept a discount of, perhaps, 14 to 16. per cent. This, I agree, will do our reputation more harm in themarkets of the world than the fact of our issuing a short loan at 3J per cent. There is a good deal in the suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth. Why should"" we impose any limitation ? Is it usual to do so?",45
315,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,It is usual.,45
316,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,But it is not always done.,45
317,Mr KELLY,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Stat e Treasurers float loanswithout consulting Parliament.,45
318,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I cannot remember a case without a limit.,45
319,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I do not desire to suggest any unusual course; but I cant well conceive certain circumstances arising,, though I sincerely hope they will not,, when we might have to get the money suddenly, and could not keep within 3J per cent. However, I do not desire to press; that point unduly. I merely rose to say that weighing the disadvantages on bothsides, I am rather inclined to think that thepossibilities of danger from a very large discount on our first loan, outweigh those of floating this loan-whic h after all is only a special loan for a special purpose-at asomewhat higher rate than we should liketo see. As to the income tax, I am entirely in accord with the Attorney-General'sexposition of the law. I may suggest, however, that the object could be achieved"" - the minds of our creditors could be disembarrassed of all idea that they were subject to income tax-by some notification to that effect on the stock certificates. As a matter of fact, the brokers and those whoadvance the money seldom ever troublethemselves about the Act of Parliament, which does not disclose the conditions that are really inquired into.",45
320,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The brokers are themasters of the situation.,45
321,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Primaril y so; but they have to depend ultimately on their clients. The actual moneys which we shall' be able to obtain must ultimately depend on public opinion and the reputation of our Commonwealth funds. It may not be usuaP 4o state on the stock certificates that they are not subject to income tax, but I think that would be the most effective way of meeting the situation.",45
322,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Mernda) [4.10] - If the Government were committed to the flotation - of this loan at once I should be quite at - one with the honourable member for Flinders. But, if we provide in the Bill that the interest shall not be more than 3$- per >cent., we give an indication of our idea of what future interest should be. The honourable member for Darwin is perfectly right in saying that we may have to take a dis-ccunt, but I do not consider that that is necessarily so at this stage. As I have said ibefore, I would allow the Government, - under the Treasury Bonds clause, to go up to 4 per cent., if necessary, in order to get money on the best terms for the time being, with a view to ultimately floating the loan under favourable circumstances. I remind the Committee that the Government are not - compelled to float this loan until the market is favourable, and that, if in the future 1 it should be found that 3 per cent, is too low, it would be quite easy to introduce a - short Bill raising the rate to 3$ per cent.",46
323,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Parliamen t might - not be sitting at the time.,46
324,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Thes e things are not - done in an hour, but will be full y considered. It is to be presumed that the High Commissioner and the Treasurer will be in constant communication as to the prospects of the market. I understand that the advice received by the Government is that there will not be as low a rate for - money as in the past, for some considerable time to come and, if that is made quite - clear, then, as I say, a short Bil l could be passed. Parliament would then have the - satisfaction of knowing the exact condition - of the market. It seems to me inconsistent with sound business principles to start off by providing for a rate of interest which we do not desire to pay, especially when we are under no compulsion to obtain the money at once, machinery being provided for obtaining funds for temporary purposes.

Now that the Bill has reached its present stage, we should endeavour to make it as perfect as we can. The brokers of London certainly know as much about this business as do any honourable members; and we have been told by the honourable member for Mernda, who. is a successful business man, that the whole question is one of choosing the opportunity. I am very glad that the Treasurer has intimated his intention to act on the suggestion made by the honourable member. The Treasurer, in accepting the amendment, has come to a very wise decision in the interest of the Commonwealth. Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [4.16] - My desire and the desire of the Government has always been to float this loan and commence our borrowing at 3 per cent. We were influenced to place ""not exceeding 3J per cent."" in the Bill by reason of our advice from London. 1 quite recognise, however, the value of the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Mernda and others, and perhaps it is inadvisable to place a 3J per cent, placard in our first Loan Bill , although its being there would not necessarily tneaj that we should float the loan at 3J per cent. In fact, my utmost efforts would be in the direction of trying to make the rate 3 per cent. Still we have a temporary power in the Bill to raise money, and if we find that difficulties arise in regard to the 3 percent., we shall not have to wait so long before another Parliament assembles. If we find we cannot get it at 3 per cent., we shall have to submit the matter to the House. I am quite willing to accept the amendment for the present.",46

It would have been a disastrous mistake for us to issue first loan at the high level of 3$ per If we had left the 3J per in the Bill the London financiers would have regarded it as expressing the will of Parliament, and any negotiations by. the Treasurer to obtain a lower rate would have been quite futile. I have always thought that our borrowing for all purknowledge poses should be on a 3 T>er cent, basis throughout, and my calculations have been based upon that as a maximum. It is the spot. far better for us to appreciate our loan values. A discount will, of course, be inevitable if we float at 3 per cent., but it will be better to find our stock appreciating up to par than to have it at a higher rate, and oyer par, but not appreciating. I Bank did not speak on the matter before, because I felt that the Prime Minister had the Home authorities, and that I acper cepted that advice as superior to anything that I could give, or any results at which I could arrive, and I want the Treasurer clearly to understand that if he proposes to go outside of that small circle in London, which controls these large inand large investments, he will make at a mistake. He has to get into line with those who can assist him in connection with Everything will depend who on the manner in which the operation is dealt with at the outset in London, and if the right honourable gentleman follows the who proper and regular channels he will find himself most successful, because the first will Commonwealth loan will be popular, and purpose for which that loan is beinp I predict with some little change in 'the conditions that now exist in London, we shall have a very successful issue indeed; but the will be well advised if he waits Let me say here that any suggestion that the meamendment has been proposed or is sm> ported by those who are against the Bill , they and opposed to the loan, or to an Australian Navy, is too utterly ridiculous to be entertained for a moment.

It is proposed to amend the succeeding clause so that it will provide that there shall be paid into a sinking fund an amount at least equal to 5 per cent, of the loan moneys raised, until there is to the .credit of the fund a sum sufficient to redeem the loan, with interest added. When the contributions to that fund cease, a sum equal to the amount of our indebtedness will stand to our credit in it. That being so, I see no reason why we should now fix the term of the loan. It is unusual to do so.",50
368,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,But .this is an unusual loan.,50

370,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The usual course is to provide that after a certain number of years the loan shall be redeemable at any time on notice. That has been done in Western Australia, Victoria, and South Australia, and has been found to work well. The practice of naming a fixed time at which a loan shall mature, which was followed for a long time in some of the States,"" is very unsatisfactory. Under such a system a loan may mature in the face of a very bad market, or several loans may mature during the same year. Honourable members will find that State loans amounting to something like £20,000,000 fall due in one year. We shall fix as short a time as possible, after which the Government may have the option of redeeming the loan. In Western Australia and South Australia twenty years have been fixed. I believe that on one occasion a shorter period was fixed, and that the Government had to revert to a longer period. Investors do not like to give to a borrower the option of paying off a loan at anv time. They desire to know that they have made an investment for a certain number of 3'ears, and my experience leads me to believe that to fix too short a period is to inconvenience investors. The desire of the Government will be to make as short as possible the term after which it will be optional to pay off the debt. I think it unnecessary to fix any term in this clause, seeing that we provide in the next that there shall be an annual pavment into a sinking fund equal to 5 per cent, of the amount of the loan.

448,Mr SPENCE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"In my opinion, this penditure should, if possible, be provided out of revenue; but, as that may not be done, we should do what we can to force the Government of the day to make the sinking fund sufiicient for the repayment of the loan at the earliest date possible, with a view to providing for the replacement of the disappearing unit. That will not be done in any one year. 1I have nothing to say regarding the statements of the honourable member ""for Mernda about the of the loan; but it must be remembered that what we are dealing with is not loan for reproductive expenditure, but for a navy which will quickly become obwhich solete, and for whose replacement we soon have to provide.

That is now the practice followed by nearly all the States It is not merely a convenience to the borrower, but also benefits the lender, because it gives fixity for a certain period for his investment. The Commonwealth will not obtain so high a price for - a short-dated loan as for a long-dated one, because lenders generally desire to invest their capital for a long experiod. If the Treasurer really desires to redeem this loan within sixteen years, - he should provide for its redemption on the ist January, 1926, or at any future date of which the Government may give twelve months' notice. I think that the loan should be redeemed before that date.",55

457,Mr MAHON,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I should provide that the whole loan shall be redeemed within sixteen years, but that it shall be optional to commence to redeem it at the end of twelve years. Evidence is accumulating that the lif e of the vessels of the fleet unit has been overestimated. A prudent man is always on the safe side, but the Treasurer appears to have seized upon the maximum life of these vessels in proposing that the loan shall have a currency of sixteen years. I suggest, therefore, to the Leader of the Opposition that he so amend his amendment as to provide that this loan shall be redeemable on ist January, 1922, or later, up to 1926, on the Government giving twelve months' notice of their intention to redeem.",56

The point that I wish to make, however', is that the currency of the loan should be shortened.

Let that fund be on the basis of the amount proposed to be raised now, namely, £3,500,000. It is quite true that the ships of this unit will still be comparatively efficient as ships of their class eighteen years hence, but it is not true that they will be, as they are now, top vessels in their respective classes. They will require to be superseded, if Australian defence is to be as well looked after then, in proportion to foreign power, as it is to be now. Therefore, I. suggest that, in addition to the sinking fund, it will be necessary to provide a trust account into which at least one-tenth of the capital value of the vessels, namely, £3,500,000, shall be paid every year from revenue.",58

499,Mr KELLY,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Such a provision is essential if we are to have anything like decent financing. I have no desire to divide the Conimittee prematurely on a question of the kind, but we must do something in this direction, unless we are going; to commit ourselves for all time to a pernicious system of borrowing for naval purposes.",58
500,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"There should be such a provision made, but in another scheme altogether.",58
501,Mr KELLY,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I agree that that would be preferable; and all I desire is to get some sort of assurance from the Treasurer that he recognises the necessity for a f u n d of the kind.,58

I am heartily in sympathy with theobject that the honourable member for Wentworth has in view. I go further and say that, if we are going into this undertaking on a business footing, we must be prepared' the to renew this unit out of the ordinary revenues of the country. I am firmly of opinion that we shall not only have to renew this unit by that time, but that we shall alsohave to very materially increase our total' war strength.",58
503,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Mak e another visit to "" mv uncle "" ! Mr. JOSEPH ' COOK - I hope there will be no more visits to "" mv uncle."" I do not agree that we are going to borrow for any future unit we may have to provide. We shall have to increase our naval strength if we are to meet the International exigencies which promise in the near future, and we shall have to meet the cost, as other peoples do; or, in other words, we shall have to tax ourselves. But, with the Leader of the Opposition, I think that that time is not now.",58
504,Mr KELLY,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I do not ask that provision should be made in this Bill ; a Ministerial statement will satisfy me.,59
505,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Is the Minister of fence going to put the black ensign, with the three balls, in the centre of the fleet?",59
506,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Bot h the honourable member and myself desire that Australia shall have a fleet, but I am afraid that the plan he suggests for obtaining the vessels would only result in postponing their building. It is only the urgency of the matter that reconciles me to having a loan for war purposes; and I hope that this is the last time we shall have to appeal to the House and the people for a similar authorization. Of course, we cannot speak dogmatically or prophetically, because everything depends upon the international situation. It may be that in the future we may have to proceed on emergent lines, and I am not sure that I would not be justified in saying that we are proceeding on emergent lines now, because I do not regard the international situation as satistleman factory from any point of view. It is just as well to be prepared, and, therefore, we have to get this fleet into being at earliest possible moment on such terms offer now. That is the reason we ask authority to raise a loan. In my opinion, the proper time to make a financial adyears justment on a business-like footing will be, perhaps, a couple of years hence, our present subsidy to the Mother Country will cease, and we, with full naval sibility, begin to receive the contribution from the Imperial Government. That will which the monev can be obtained. be the right time to begin to put our house in order for the future, and, as suggested by the honourable member for Wentworth. initiate a war chest to enable us to build the Government want. further units. In the meantime, we better get this Bill jput into operation the earliest possible moment.",59
507,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Gwydir) [6.10] - It refreshing to hear the Minister of Defence indicating what the Government will be this unit. prepared to do two years hence, but it would be more interesting to be told where the proposed war fun d is to come from. The Minister of Defence hopes that this will be the last time we shall go to the money market for the purposes of defence, and tells us that it would be wise to inaugurate a war fund by putting aside a sum equal to 10 per cent, on the present loan.",59
508,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Did I say that?,59
509,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The honourable gentleman agrees with the honourable member for Wentworth, and that is the suggestion Dethat honourable member made for meeting the increased expenditure on an improved fleet. The sinking fund at 5 per cent, means £[175,000 a year, and the proposed war fund of 10 per cent, would mean an additional £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 , making in all £ 5 2 0 , 0 0 0 out of the revenue of the Commonwealth. Are we to understand that after the elections, and in two years' time, the Minister will be prepared to consider the advisability of imposing direct taxation in order to meet the additional liability of £[350,000? Is that the reason why this afterthought of the Minister is not embodied in the Bill as it could and should have been, if the Government were honest in their desire to replace the unit?",59
510,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"That is to say, we cannot be honest and bond fide unless we prepare for all futuritv in this Bill .",59
511,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"the honourable gendoes not answer me with such interjections ! If the Minister thinks that the honourable and right thing is to create the the suggested war chest, it ought to be as created today. But something is going for to happen before two years hence. I am thankful, however, to hear that in two time the Government will be prepared to come down with proposals for direct when taxation in the shape of a land tax. We are told that the Government do not desire responto borrow; and, if that be so, direct taxation is the only other source from The Leader of the Opposition said he thought these matters might be brought forward in separate measures, but that is just what Direct taxation had could have been, and should have been, at proposed instead of this measure, if the Government had not been afraid to go is to the source of revenue which ought legitimately to bear the strain of providing I thank the Minister of Defence, and I thank the clever little member for Wentworth for his kindly intervention on this occasion, because it now becomes evident that this Government, after another term of office, 'will be prepared to defray the cost of the scheme out of taxation imposed on the landed monopolists and other wealthy people who expected the Government to save them.",59
512,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Corio) [6.17] - I should, be .sorry if the Treasurer lost sight of the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders. The clause says that the payments into the sinking fund shall begin "" from and a f t e r "" the ist day of July, 1912. That means that they will not really start until the ist July, I 9 31 The phrase used should be "" o n and after."" I understand that the Treasurer is following a Western Australian practice, but that practice has been generally adopted because loan money has usually been used for reproductive works which would give some return in two or three years' time. In this case we start our borrowing, and start our redemption, at a certain time after the date of the first issue. Of course, we could not begin to make payments to the sinking fund during the current financial year, because our finances are already overburdened, but in the next financial year we ought to pay towards it an amount proportionate to the amount borrowed in that year.",60
513,Mr BOWDEN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Nepean) [6.19] - We ought to adopt some suggestion similar to that of the honourable member for Flinders. As soon as we get any of this money, the sinking fund ought to start in proportion to what we have raised. At any rate, by the ist July, 1911, £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 will have been raised, according to the Treasurer's own statement, and yet under this clause the sinking fund will not have started. There is no reason why the sinking fund based on that amount, or even on the whole amount, should not start from the ist July, 1911, because we expect in that year, on account of the new financial agreement, to have a revenue larger than our immediate requirements. It would be a fair compromise to insert that date. We are all anxious that not only 5 per cent., but as much above it as possible, should be paid in, so why not start the fund as soon as possible?",60

When a bond has been cancelled there seems to be no legal justification for paying into the sinking fund interest on the amount which it represented. the I have no doubt that the Leader full of the Opposition had a reason for Bill using the language he proposed, and very likely it was that he thought the interest on the main issue should be continued, even although some of it were redeemed, and that the money so used should into what might be described as a war in the event of the sinking fund being 2. more than sufficient to redeem the balance. It seems reasonable, however, to say that fund, when a bond has been cancelled there should be no charge in respect of interest left upon it, and I think that the Treasurer's to invest proposal will make that clear.",61

552,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"We must invest the sinking fund as quickly as possible, so as to make it reproductive, and if Commonwealth bonds were not available, we might desire to invest it in the bonds of a State.",62

He is going to take the risk of investing money raised for in a specific purpose in stock that may rise or f all , according to market fluctuations.

571,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [8.14] - As this Bill is drafted, there is no inprovision for trustees at all, and I do not think it is necessary to omit these words. In connection with the National debt of England, there has been a special provision since close of the eighteenth century for trustees of money set aside for the redemption, not of a particular loan, but of all loans existing. Similarly, under some of the a State Acts, there is a general provision for that the redemption of the National debt, and for setting aside so much revenue for the purpose. In those cases there are trustees. There are some cases in which there are for a single loan, but they are exceptions. As this Bill is not based on the trustee principle, we have inserted the words "" in any other prescribed manner,"" so as to allow a greater latitude to the Treasurer there would be in the case of official trustees. If we inserted a clause as to the appointment of trustees, it would be better to strike out these words, but if not there nulliis not much harm in passing the clause as",63

Commonwealth securities and the income derived therefrom shall not be subject to taxation by the Commonwealth or a State."" I am pretty confident that Commonwealth securities and incomes are not taxable by a State under the Constitution, and that it does not mattfcr, therefore, whether the clause be inserted or not. At the same time, the desire has been expressed by some honourable members that some such provision should be made. I may say that it will not amount to a mere declaration, because it will exempt not only the securities from State taxation, but also from Commonwealth taxation, the latter not being provided for in the Constitution. The honourable member for Flinders has very properly pointed out that we should not be content with a clause of this kind, but see that a more direct notification is given to the subscribers.",64
578,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Kalgoorlie) [8.22] When this matter was under discussion .this morning the Treasurer, on the strength of an opinion expressed by the Attorney General, stated that Commonwealth securities under the Constitution were not liable to State taxation. If that be so, a clause of this kind is unnecessary and if the Attornev-General be wrong, the provision will not improve our position. _ Mr Glynn - The honourable member is right up to that point, but he overlooks the fact that the clause will also exempt Commonwealth stock from Commonwealth taxation.",64
579,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The question whether we desire to exempt Commonwealth securities from a Commonwealth income tax is one that is not involved in the discussion to-night.

581,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It may at some time be considered necessary, in the interests of good government, to impose a Commonwealth income tax, and the question may arise whether or not those who are receiving a return from Commonwealth Treasury bonds are not fair subjects for taxation.",64

584,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,That is exactly what I contend.,64
585,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,In regard to the States we are only declaring what is the law now.,64

588,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The proposal of the Attorney-General opens up a very serious question, which was not contemplated at the earlier stages of this discussion.",64
589,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Mernda) [8.28] - I think that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is taking rather an unfair view of the situation. So far as the States' income taxes are concerned, any clause we put in the Bill will not affect the question, but exemption from a. Commonwealth income tax is certainly not covered by the Constitution, and we ought to make our intention perfectly clear. If we issue stock with the possibility of a Commonwealth income tax, - we may have a difficulty in floating our loan at a satisfactory price. It will probably mean that, in order to obtain a small tax, we will have to pay an inordinate price for the money we borrow. As the Treasurer says, this clause is to some extent a mere placard so far as the States are concerned; but that is not so in regard to a Commonwealth in : come tax.",64
590,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Dee s the honourable member think that Commonwealth bondholders should be exempt from any possible Commonwealth income tax?,64
591,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I certainly do, because it is in the interests of the Commonwealth to obtain our loans at the cheapest rate.",64
592,Mr MAHON,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Coolgardie) [8.29] - If Commonwealth stock is subject to taxation by the Commonwealth while the States' stock is exempt from taxation by the States we shall certainly place the State stock in a better position than our own. In such case the stocks of the States will obtain higher quotations in the money markets than the Commonwealth stock. reason is obvious-the investor will buy the stock which-the .security, being almost equal-give s him the best return for his money. While. I agree with the Government in this matter, I dissent from the view put forward by the honourable member for Mernda, that .the securities obtained by Commonwealth bond-holders should never in any circumstances be taxed. I decline to subscribe to that doctrine. At the present moment Government stock can be bought in the Australian market at a price which yields very nearly 4 per cent. Now there are some industries and private property in this country which are not yielding any higher rate of interest than that. If a man invests £20,000 in land, he can be taxed as high as we like, but if he invests the same amount in Commonwealth stock, we expressly declare by this proposal that he is to be exempt for all time.",64
593,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Exactly ; because we want to get the money cheaply.,65
594,Mr MAHON,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I admit that if we were a continuous borrower in the markets of the world, it would be foolish not to make the provision; but we do not intend to be a continuous borrower', and therefore a small impost upon Commonwealth stock would not materially depreciate it. It could only operate against Commonwealth stock whenever the Commonwealth wanted to float a new loan. A man putting his money into Commonwealth stock should not be in any better position, so far as taxation goes, than the man who puts his money into any other security.",65
595,Mr HEDGES,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Why do the States empt bond-holders'?,65
596,Mr MAHON,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Because the States are continual borrowers. There is nothing immoral or illegitimate in leaving this provision out of our Act; for if any extraordinary contingency arose, the man who held our bonds, and whose security the people of this country would be protecting by taxing themselves, ought as a matter of equity to bear his share .of the burden.",65
597,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,It only applies to this one loan.,65
598,Mr MAHON,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"But the right honourable gentleman is setting a precedent which may be followed with other loans. In any case his interjection does not vitiate mv contention that we ought not to place people who take up our bonds in a better position as taxpayers than those who inThe vest in other .securities. The fact that we give them the security of the whole Commonwealth for the repayment of the money is a very big inducement to them to invest in Commonwealth stock. Everything, of course, depends on ability to pay the interest and repay the principal whenever it is due, and that is why Government bonds carry less interest than other investments. Mr W. H. IRVINE (Flinders) [8.34I. - So much of the proposed clause as deals with State taxation is absolutely and entirely, inoperative. I have strong objections to this Parliament embodying in an Act something which is beyond its powers, and effectual simply as a placard. That part of the provision means nothing. I agree with the Attorney-General in the view he takes of the Constitution. The Constitution itself, without any Act of ours, prevents the State authorities from imposing taxes upon the interest derived from our bonds, and, therefore, no such provision as this, so far as regards the States, is at all necessary. With regard to the Commonwealth, the argument of the honourable member for Coolgardie, when, analyzed, will be found to be applicable to a somewhat different state of affairs, although I agree with him that, where you are making laws for taxing the community by a form of income tax or other direct taxation, you ought not to exempt any class of the community from it. For that reason, such a provision as this in an Income Tax Act would be really out of place. If in passing an Income Tax Act we exempted all holders of bonds or other Government securities from the tax in regard to the interest derived ex- from those securities, we should be benefiting all those people who had already obtained existing Government securities, and appreciating their securities unnecessarily. We should be placing them in a better position simply for the purpose of enabling us to get somewhat better terms for any securities that we might issue in the future. That would be an illogical and unnecessary mode of applving this provision. It seems to me that this is the Act in which that policy ought to be introduced, if we wish to introduce it at all, because we have not hitherto borrowed, and the provision would not applv to any other securities than those dealt with in this Act. All that we would sav would be that, as a part of the barr/ain with the new creditors, we give thern security against any existing or future taxation by the Commonwealth on the interest on their bonds. If future borrowers lieved in every case that we were going . impose only the limited rates of income usually imposed for ordinary revenue poses, it would not matter very when we borrow many people in other parts of the world, who are ignorant f the most part of our conditions, may distrustful of things that they know nothing about, and distrustful of this Parliament. They may be apprehensive that our process of taxation will be carried much further than we know it will be carried. It tent to which the States taxed them. may, therefore, be of great advantage relieve their minds entirely from apprehenFlinders, sion as to future taxation. where we ought to put in the exemption from taxation is in the Bill which creates out. the security, as one of the elements of new contract which we invite people enter into with us. At the same time, ought not to include the exemption i general taxation measure, because if we do, State."" we thereby exempt a whole lot of people who have no particular reason or cause to be exempted. While, therefore, ing the Treasurer as to the major part of there is a doubt. the proposal, I ask the Attorney-General reconsider the question of including ference to State taxation.",65
599,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,It is not of the slightest use.,66
600,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It is only, to make the point clear.'",66

604,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Is not this the question ?,66
605,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It is the same chasing Commonwealth stock. question in this sense: the question is also another reason. - whether the States have, under the Constiheard tution, power to do it. If they have power, our putting this provision in will merely a childish and fatuous attempt prevent them doing something that they have the power to do. If , on the hand, they have not the power under Constitution to do it, our saying that shall not do it does not make the slightest difference. The provision should, theresecurities, fore, be left out. I regret that we have got too .much into a way of thinking that beit does not matter what we put into an Act to of Parliament, on the ground that even if it tax is bad it can do no harm.

608,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"If so, we cannot prevent it by any provision in this Act.",66
609,Mr HEDGES,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"But we can compensate the bond-holder. I suppose that in any case two taxes-Stat e and Commonwealth-coul d not be collected on the interest on the same bond. I point out to the Attorney-General that many things queswhich we think have been finally settled in this House are afterwards upset in the High and I should like to see this matter 'made perfectly clear, so that when the same loan is put on the market, people may know under what conditions they are purThere is I have frequentlyit stated in this Chamber that the that Commonwealth can manage the whole of be the finances of Australia much better than to can the States; and it would put us in a very bad position if we found that, in our other first loan, we were not offering the people the conditions as good as the States offered. they The States have declared that income tax shall not be levied on their bonds and and if we wish to put our loan on the market under the best conditions, we' should make it clear that income tax will not be levied on the interest paid to our creditors.",66
610,Mr SPENCE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Darling) [8.47] - I think that the clause should be negatived. In my opinion it will not materially affect the loan. Those who advance money on Government security do it to obtain interest on their capital, just as they invest money in anything else, and there seems to be no reason why they should escape the income taxation which other investors have to pay. The public works which are necessary for the development of the country, and make life convenient and pleasant, must be paid for. It is only by levying taxation that these advantages can be provided for the people. Consequently, those who pay taxation cannot be regarded"" as suffering a loss. They are merely charged the cost of undertakings by which they benefit. In the English market the proposed condition would be of no advantage at all. We cannot guarantee that our bondholders living abroad will not be taxed on the interest which we pay to them. As a matter of fact, in England investors have to pay he&vy income tax. So far as the market is concerned, I see no reason why an investor in Government stock should have an advantage in regard to income tax over other investors. Such a differentiation would be unfair, and,, in my opinion, would not materially affect the price at which we could borrow locally. Amendment agreed to. - Proposed new clause, as amended, agreed to. Amendment (by Sir JOHN FORREST) agreed toThat the fol'owing new clause be inserted :"" 8A. The Sinking Fund shall be paid to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Secretary to the Treasury of the Commonwealth, who are hereby constituted Trustees for that purpose to be invested and applied by them as in this Act provided.""",67

I move this amendment on behalf of the honourable member for iCook. A short time ago the members of the Government party were asking us with great fervour to trust the people. It seems to me that they might well be consulted regarding these financial proposals.",67
612,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,We want to provide for the construction of an Indomitable.,67
613,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"If the Government wishes to commence the construction of the new fleet at once, its word will be sufficient for the builders.",67
614,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,We must have legal authority.,67
615,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The Government has embarked on a financial policy for which it has no authority from the electors.,67
616,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,That has been said over and over again.,67
617,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It has beensaid before, but will bear repeating. The Government have not received the sanction of the electors for this proposed. naval loan. As we are going to the country very shortly, this issue might well be submitted to them. The Treasurer has shown a, good deal of consideration towards Opposition proposals this afternoon, and if he wishes to crown himself with glory, he ought to accept this one. , Nothing can be added with advantage to what has already been said on this subject. This is the first time in our history that a Commonwealth Government has admitted its inability to meet its obligations. . In my opinion, the people are readv to pay increased taxation to provide for the construction of the proposed fleet. Believing that to be so, and knowing that the policy of borrowing was not once mentioned at the last elections, I think that the Government should show its sincerity in regard to trusting the people by submitting this proposal for their sanction.",67
618,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Dalley) [8.55] - If the proposed new clause be carried, we shall have a triple referendum-the financial agreement, the State debts question, and the loan question. The Government have paid the electors the compliment of saying that they can deal with so complicated a question as thefinancialagreement, and that they are competent to form an opinion regarding the proposal to transfer the debtsof the States to the Commonwealth. This It is, however, a contradiction of the financial agreement. In asking the public to ratify the financial agreement, we ask it to authorize us to bind the Commonwealth to pay to the States for all time a certain sum out of the Customs and Excise revenue. Having done that, we are now showing that we cannot afford to hand back to the States the sum agreed upon, because we have to borrow to pay for a fleet. I should like this loan proposal to be taken before the people, because it would enable me to show my electors how iniquitous the financial agreement is. The three proposals should be put before the people together.",67
619,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,That is precisely what we intend.,68
620,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"But if Parliament passes this Bill as it stands, the proposed loan will be floated, unless the coming Parliament repeals our legislation.",68
621,Mr COON,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The honourable member would not vote for the reference of the Capital Site question to the people. Mr Wilks' - That is not a financial question. This proposal affects the whole community. If the loan is floated, they will have to provide for the payment of interest and sinking fund through the Customs and Excise. I shall support the amendment.",68
622,Mr SPENCE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Darling) [8.59] - I hope that this proposal will be agreed to, and that the loan will not be floated until the public have sanctioned it. I am not in favour of referring complicated questions to the electors, but this is a very simple one. All parties in the House have declared against borrowing, and now, at the end of the Parliament, it is proposed by the Government to raise £3,500,000 by loan. The adoption of this proposed new clause would give the people an opportunity to say whether they were prepared to pay the taxation necessary to provide for the efficient defence of Australia, or preferred to allow the Government to go into the money market for^ that 'purpose. It would not interfere with the ""Building of the Navv. We have been assured that only £500,000 will be required for the purposes of the"" naval scheme up to the end of June next. The elections will be held early next year, and the Government will know as soon as the vote has been taken, what they are to do. If {Tie Loan Bill is approved by the people, they may take steps at once to raise this money. On the other hand, if it is rejected by the people, that will be a declaration that they are prepared to provide the necessary money for the construction of the Navy Bv means of taxation, and it will be for the new Parliament to determine what form that taxation shall take. At the worse there could be only a slight delav. and I certainly approve of the proposed new clause. Mr THOMAS ^Barrier) [9.1] - I should 'be glad if the Government would accept [249J the proposed new clause, for I think it only fair that a referendum should be taken. The general election will take place shortly, so that the adoption of this proposal will not inconvenience the Government. If there is any question that ought to be referred to the' people, it is this - I regret that the House has committed itself to the policy of borrowing, for I believe that it will be a bad thing for the nation. Many people will vote for the Fusion Government candidates, although they are opposed to this Loan Bill. Unless this proposed new clause be carried, they will feel that they can show their disapproval of this policy only by voting against the Fusion candidates, and supporting candidates of the Labour party, and rather than do that many of them will swallow this policy. If a referendum were taken, every elector in Australia would have a direct opportunity to say direct whether he approved or disapproved of a Commonwealth loan policy^ and would be free at the same time to vote for his own party candidate. Some honourable members opposite have already stated publicly that our refusal to support the proposal' to take a referendum on the question of the financial agreement meant that we had gone back on one of our platform planks. That is not so. We are anxious, however, that this question should be submitted to the people, and if the Government really believe in, trusting the people, they have in this instance an opportunity to do so. I shall support the proposed new clause. Question-That the proposed new clause tje inserted-put . The Committee divided. Ayes ... ... ... 11 Noes ... ... ... 23 Majority 12 AYES. Mahon, H .

623,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Swan-Trea surer) [9.14] - I move- ' That this Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members are aware that the Surplus Revenue Bill which became law on the 13th June, 1908, denned the manner in which the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth should be dealt with. It was agreed by the State Premiers at the recent Conference that if the financial agreement were accepted, the Commonwealth Treasurer should have, as an aid to his large expenditure for old-age pensions, the right to expend during the present financial year, £600,000 out of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which the States were entitled. The basis of the contribution by the States out of their three-fourths of this amount, £600,000, was agreed upon by the Premiers, namely, 3s. per head of the population of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, in which States old-age pensions were being paid, and 2s. per head from the States of South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. The Bill amends the Surplus Revenue Act of 1908, so that the FAIRS. understanding with the Premiers can be carried out, providing that the people approve of the financial agreement. This Bill will only take effect in the event of Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill being accepted by the electors and assented to by the Governor General, and in the further event of the excess expenditure of £600,000, or part thereof, being incurred. The effect of this Bill will be that the excess expenditure, instead of being debited to the States per capita, will be debited in the proportions agreed on by the Premiers. The last clause of the Bill is also conditional on the passing of the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill. It repeals the Surplus Revenue Act of 1908, which belonged to the bookkeeping system, and which will be terminated by the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill. Honourable members will see that this Bill will have no effect unless the people by referendum approve of that Bill ; and if they approve, the present measure is necessary for the reasons I have stated.",69
624,Mr THOMAS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Barrier) [9.18] - Do I understand that New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland will contribute more per head towards the £600,000 than will the other States? .",69
625,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Yes; that was agreed to by the Premiers.,69
626,Mr THOMAS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"We are here as a Federal Parliament, and not simply to ratify what the Premiers have done. The proposal is that New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland are to pay 3s. per head, because there have been ©ld-age pensions in those States, while South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania are to pay only 2s. per head because they have been neglectful of their duty in the past.",69
627,Sir JOHN FORREST,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,That does not affect us.,69
628,Mr THOMAS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It affects the fair play of the thing. I have no objection to the Commonwealth having £600,000 with which to help to pay old-age pensions, in view of the fact that we are taking over the responsibility in this connection; but it seems to me a little unjust to New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland that they should have to pay more, simply because they have done their duty to the aged poor.",69
629,Mr MCDONALD,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Kennedy) [9.20] So far as I can see, there is no necessity for this Bill. It cannot possibly come into operation until after the referendum; and we cannot suppose that the Treasurer pro-' poses to use this £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 before he knows whether the financial agreement is approved by the people.

660,Mr SPEAKER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Order . I am rather surprised at this method of conducting a second-reading debate, and I ask honourable members on the Ministerial side to allow the honourable member for Yarra to proceed.",71
661,Mr TUDOR,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The Treasurer should at least grant an adjournment of the debate until tomorrow morning, as many honourable members are away attending engagements which they entered into before they knew the House would sit to-night. Otherwise, the second reading will be carried, the Bill will be put through Committee, and sent up to another place, before they have an opportunity of dealing with it. "" The Treasurer has the numbers behind him, and I suppose feels sure that he can force the Bill through, in spite of all that we may say. We are told that if we do not pass it we shall be keeping back the Seamen's Compensation Bill , the only measure brought forward by this Government that is of any interest to the workers. Everything else that would benefit the workers has been pushed right down the notice paper. The Government say "" Give us this Bill , and we will give you. something else afterwards."" We have no right to proceed with this measure in the dying hours of this Parliament, seeing that, in all probability, a majority of those returned to the next Parliament will be against the financial agreement entered into at the Premiers' ^ejrencG",71
662,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Flinders) [9.40I I must confess that when I saw the Bill to-night I had some apprehensions, first as to whether it would not, if passed, enable the financial agreement with the Premiers, or some portion of it, to be brought into effect before that agreement is sanctioned by the people, and, secondly, whether it might not be used as an argument at the referendum why that referendum should result in one particular way. If I thought that it would have either of those effects, I should not only vote against it . have to but also use any influence that I possess to prevent such an extremely improper measure being passed; but, on looking into it , I Old-age pen- found that it really cannot have either effect. Clause 4, which is the only express clause, provides simplv that the Surplus Revenue I very Act 1908 shall be deemed to be repealed if thf Finance Bill is approved by the electors at the referendum, but I would point out to the honourable member for Nepean and others that the other clauses have no subject-matter on which they can operate until the Finance Bill is made law by the sanction of the people.",71
663,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,This is speculative legislation.,72
664,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"In one sense it is conditional legislation, and consequently quite unusual, and requires to be carefully scrutinized before we pass it. For that reason I am endeavouring to scrutinize it now. It can operate only upon those moneys specified in clause 2 as "" the excess expenditure,"" which is defined as beingThe sura, if any, over and above one-fourth of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of customs and excise for the financial year ending on the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and ten, which the Commonwealth, in pursuance of Constitution Alteration Finance) igog, applies in that year, out of the said net revenue, towards its expenditure for the service of that year. The Bill referred to there is the Bill which has to receive the sanction of the people, and unless that Bill passes .there is no "" excess expenditure.''' If there is no excess expenditure, there is nothing whatever on which this Bill can operate. The honourable member for Yarra suggested that the Bill might in some way be used as an argument to induce the electors to sanction the financial agreement with the Premiers on the ground that old-age pensioners would otherwise be in some manner deprived of what was coming to them. But that argument could not honestly be used. It would be an absolutely dishonest argument, and could so easily be met and refuted that it would recoil on the heads of those who used it. In fact, it could be used with just as much force in regard to the financial agreement itself as it could be used in regard to this Bill, and to my mind it would have no force in either case. Personally, I should have preferred that this legislation should have waited until we were in a position to deal with it in the ordinary way-until we had the powers that would enable us to pass it. Conditional or prospective legislation, dependent upon powers which we do not possess at the time we pass it, is very unusual, and is justified in this case only on the ground of convenience. I do not think we ought to take any great exception to it in this instance, because no honest argument can be based upon it that could induce any elector to vote in favour of the financial scheme.",72
665,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Then why do the Government want to rush it through? Mr W. H. IRVINE - It may be a matter of considerable convenience.,72
666,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Whether the Bill is passed or not, the argument referred to could be used.",72
667,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"That is so, and for that reason it will have no additional force through this Bill being passed.",72
668,Mr HARPER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,So long as it is understood.,72
669,Mr WH IRVINE,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It will be the duty of all of us to make the position clearly understood when the proper time arrives. For my part, I express a very ferventhope and wish that the Bill may never become operative. ' Mr THOMAS BROWN (Calare) [9.45] - 1 should be much better pleased if the views which have been expressed by the honourable member for Flinders had been presented to the House by the Minister. We could have accepted them as an assurance that the Bill will not be used in the manner suggested by the honourable member for Yarra. Although the honourable member for Flinders can find reasons why it should not be so used, we know that, in the present state of politics, we have reason to fear that it will be so used.",72

671,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"That will probably be said to the electors to induce them to vote for the agreement,.though it will not be a legitimate argument to use. I would be more satisfied had the honourable member's presentment of the case been made by a Minister.",72
672,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I personally adopt everything that the honourable member said.,72
673,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I am glad to hear that. As the case was put by the Minister who moved the second reading of the Bill, it was not indicated that it was not open to any one to use such an argument as that mentioned.",72
674,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"He said that it might be argued that if the agreement were not passed, there would be no money to pay for old-age pensions.",72
675,Mr GROOM,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The Bill has nothing to do with that.,72
676,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,It will be used as a justification for that argument.,73
677,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"No . Mr THOMA S BROWN - Then , why sions. has it been introduced? We are anticipating what the electors may do. Should they refuse to ratify the agreement, our legislation will be useless.",73

679,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Yes . I a wrong thing to ask a dying Parliament to legislate in this manner. The Bill should be kept back until the electors have voted position beyond question. on the financial agreement.,73

Why, because an imaginary line divides New South Wales from South Australia, should those on one side of it be asked contribute £ 3 per head out of the States' surplus revenue, and those on the other side £ 2 ? The arrangement is not an expresthat sion of the Federal spirit. The Treasurer seems to think that it is sufficient that Premiers have agreed to it .",73
682,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,That New South Wales is being called upon to pay £ 3 per head and South Australia only £ 2 is an argucause ment against the financial agreement.,73

If Mr MCGowen and Mr Holman, members of the Labour party in the State Parliament, instead of saying ""ditto, ditto"" to Mr Wade, were to oppose him, they would be surprised at the support they would receive.

716,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [10.35] - I beg to move That this Bill be now read a second time. I think for sturdiness of character, patient endurance of adverse conditions, unselfish devotion to duty, and the knack of doing well his appointed task, the seaman is second to none. None of us, I trust, has become so affected by the cynicism that sometimes comes with public life, as to be incapable of doing justice to the sailor-the handy man of modest bearing and proverbial courage, often as poor in material as he is rich in manly resources, one of the few men still left in these limelight days who are true to the finer traditions of a class, and who, with a spirit trained to fortitude in the riot of the elements, can answer without hesitation to the last call of duty. I think, after that, I might descend to dry 'matters of law. Honourable members who, as members of Parliament, are assumed, although they may not often be found, to be omniscient,will, perhaps, pardon me if I refer to one or two, to them, truisms as regards the law of seamen's compensation and employers' liability generally, as a sort of preliminary refresher to their memories. The general law is that a person is liable for his own negligence or the negligence of his servants. He is liable to'the general public who come upon his premises at his invitation on the business with which he is concerned. In the case of Priestly v. Fowler, decided in 1837, it was held for the first time, and it came somewhat as a shock even to lawyers, who very seldom can be shocked at anything, that the principle of liability for the negligence of one's servants did not apply where the negligent act was that of a fellow servant, because it was laid down by those wiseacres of the law that, by entering into common employment, a' man had voluntarily incurred all the risks incident to it, and, therefore, came a voluntary contributor to his own injury. That almost reminds us of the theory of Rousseau, that human society is based upon a contract, and, of course, all the risks incident to it, on the same principle of reasoning, would apply right through - society. The doctrine of common employment, then, meant that wherever a mar» was injured by his fellow servant of the same grade, and under the same master, the master was not responsible. That principle was extended even to this length, that miner and overseer, or foreman and workman, were supposed to be in the same grade for the purpose of the doctrine of exemption. The law also enabled the employer to make an arrangement with an employs' to contract himself out of any liability. ' About 1880,. for the first time a remedial Act was passed in England, recognising in certain cases,, and to a limited extent, the old principle which was supposed to have beenthe law before 1837, when the case of Priestly v. P'owler was decided-that a master should be responsible for his own negligence or the negligence of his servants even in the case of common employment. This Act provided that in five cases the master should be responsible, those five being, to put them shortly, these-wher e the injury occurred through some defect in the works, machinery, or plant; or through the negligence of a superintendent; or of persons to whose orders the employee' was. bound! to conform; or to some defect in the by-laws or instructions; or, in the case of railway companies, to the negligent management of trains* points, and signals. Under this Act, and subject to a limit as to the amount that could be recovered, the o l d law was restored. No exception was made by this in connection with employees, but the exception which drew them out of the general principle that fastens negligence upon the master was modified in the particular cases mentioned. I say that ^because some thought that that Act was a concession toemployes. _ It was nothing of the sort. All that it really amounted to was a restoration to some extent of the law as it was supposed to be. prior to 1837. However, in the particular cases mentioned, where the employer would be responsibleunder the Act, any defence that was openat law in cases of negligence where there was no common employment, could be employed as a defence in actions arisingthrough common employment. The result be- - was that in many cases the Act was found' really not to cover, or very much help, theemploye's, and in 1897 a Workmen's Compensation Act was passed which, in certain specified cases, and in certain defined_ industries, declared the principleof liability apart from negligence. In. fact, it was an Act based upon in surance of the employees. In 1906 the principle of that Act was extended to all employments of manual labourers, where the employment was not merely casual, and also to injuries caused through what are called industrial diseases-injurie s not caused in the ordinary sense by accident, but through some disease brought on through the nature of the employment. It applied, then, to all cases of master and servant employment. I do not use those words in any invidious sense, but they are the words that correctly interpret the meaning of the Act, which applied where the - workman was engaged in manual labour at - wages that did not amount to more than £250 a year. The only exemptions made were casual employees, police, outworkers, and the naval and military forces. Seamen were included ; the pilot was included ; the captain was excluded by the £250 limit in most cases, and also in some cases the engineer. This Act practically meant compulsory insurance in all except a few occupations. I think that is a very humane principle, called for by the industrial .conditions of a highly' complex society. In most cases in the colonies prior to Federation, and in some cases after Federation, the Employers' Liability Act of 1880, which was not based upon insurance, was - adopted. In the case of two or three of the colonies seamen were included within .that Act, although not to the full extent that they are included in the English Act of 1906. They were included in the South Australian Act where the accident occurred in port. When the Navigation Conference sat in London in 1907, it recommended that seamen should for all purposes be included within the purview of the Employers' Liability Acts, or any Act based upon the principle of workmen's compensation-that is, any Act based upon the principle of the English Act of 1906. This Bill is based upon that Act. A special provision is made by it for seamen who are engaged in the coasting trade of the Commonwealth. Some of our seamen are covered by State Acts, and we are now making provision for 'Cases which that legislation cannot reach. Everv seaman engaged in the coastal trade of the Commonwealth comes within the scope of the Bill. The measure is comparatively short, some of its provisions having been struck out in the Senate. The limitation of £250 was struck out, as was also the provision exempting those engaged in fishing occupations from the application of the measure, and another provision which allowed benefit schemes of equal value to that under the measure to be substituted for it. The discussion of the details of the Bill are best left to the Committee stage. Provision is made for the payment of compensation on death or total or partial inqapacltation. Generally speaking, if a man is killed, his family may obtain compensation up to the measure of his earnings for about three years, or .£200, whichever is the larger amount. The total recoverable in case of death is not to exceed £500, the original provision being £400. Compensation for total or partial incapacitation runs up to 50 per cent, of the average earnings during the twelve months preceding the accident, and is not to exceed 30s. per week, while certain allowances are provided for. The assessment of the compensation is in some cases to be made by arbitration, and in others to be determined by a Court., The measure gives an optional remedy to those who are injured, who may take proceedings in a court of law or on arbitration. Compensation in case of death is to be paid to certain dependents, who are not to Be excluded from the benefits of the measure by illegitimacy. Of course, in other cases payments must be made to the injured man himself. No substantial amendment will be proposed by the Government in Committee, but there are one or two technical amendments which are necessary to make the provisions of the measure in certain respects more consistent.",77
717,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Kalgoorlie) [10.48] - I think I may guarantee, on behalf of the Opposition, that no serious objection will be raised, to the passing of .the Bill in the shortest time possible. It .is apparently an honest endeavour to place the seamen, who follow a hazardous calling, under conditions similar to those enjoyed by employees on land, by entitling them to compensation should they be injured. While in Committee an examination will be made of some of the clauses, generally speaking, we shall facilitate the passing of the measure.",78
718,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Dalley) [10.50] - I compliment the Attorney-General on the unusual course which he adopted in commencing his speech on the second' reading with a peroration embodying a panegyric on the sailor. As he likes a literary quotation, and mentioned Rousseau, I will give him a German one. It was a saying of Goethe that if you want to know which is the ripest cherry, ask the boys or - the blackbirds. I have been associated with"" sailors for years, and if you want to know anything about seafaring men, ask those who have been associated with them.",78
719,Mr BATCHELOR,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Is the honourable member the small boy or the blackbird?,79
720,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Some persons' vanity makes them like to be spoken of as big men; but I am content to be referred to as a small boy.,79
721,Mr ROBERTS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Like all small boys, the honourable member gets his finger into every pie.",79
722,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I do not get much for myself, but am pleased to get this legislation for the seamen. The honourable member for"" Kalgoorlie spoke of the pleasure which he felt at the introduction of the Bill. He would have had more reason to be pleased had it been accompanied with the Navigation Bill, which our seamen should have received long ago at the hands of this Parliament. The Vice President of the Executive Council made a powerful speech in introducing the measure in another place, and good old salts like Senators Guthrie and Turley gave it their benediction. When sailors have endorsed the measure, it comes to us with a good recommendation. - Mr CROUCH - Fro m the sailors' point of"" view.",79
723,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It may be regarded as well recommended from the people's point of view, too. In New - South Wales, compensation for injury was allowed to seamen under the Employers' Liability Act while they were in port, and within a limited distance from the coast. The measure is an extension of the principle of the Workmen's Compensation Acts. vides that when injury or death results from accident, seamen or those dependent on them shall be entitled to compensation. It was only in 1006 that Great Britain passed an Act of this kind. Prior 'to that, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Holland, and Denmark had passed similar legislation, and in Denmark and Holland that legislation covered those engaged in the fishing trade as well as seamen. Australia is only following the example of Europe in this matter. . The Government are to be complimented upon the conversion of the Honorary Minister, who, a few years ago, in Queensland, was bitterly opposed to legislation of this character. I am glad that his association with other Ministers has converted him to more liberal views. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - The honourable member might have left that out. He has gone out of his way to give a man a dig.",79
724,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I am only showing that I take a close interest in all matters of legislation. According to Voltaire, the consideration of petty circumstances is the tomb of great things. I present that quotation to the Minister. I rejoice in the conversion of his colleague. I hope that the (Fusion Government will not stop at this advanced legislation, but will, in the next Parliament, again bring forward the Navigation Bill, and have the assistance of the Honorary Minister in getting it passed. As I can best serve the interests of the seamen in my electorate by shortening my remarks, I shall not sa.v more than that it is very creditable to the Government that this measure has been introduced by them.",79
725,Mr ROBERTS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Adelaide) [10.55] - I hope that you will permit me, Mr Speaker, to put on record the expression of my pleasure that the Ministry has seen fit to introduce this Bill. I could wish that the Attorney-General would speak equally well of sailors 'when they become politicians. The measure is a tardv recognition that seamen are human beings, and are entitled to the same consideration as is paid to those employed on shore. The Bill is capable of improvement, but as the session is near its end, and we have received an unmistakable intimation from the Government that amendments are not desired, and may result in the defeat of the measure, I hope that they will not be moved. The Bill having been considered by the Senate, requires only the consent of this House to make it law. Much as It prowe may desire to improve it. attempts to do so at this stage may result in its benefits being lost by the seamen, whose interests we have at heart. I am very grateful to the Ministry for its introduction, although it does not meet all the requirements of the case. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clauses 1 to 4 agreed to. Clause 5 (Compensation for personal injuries to seamen).",79
726,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Calare)[10.58] - On behalf of the honourable member for Herbert, who is keenly interested in seamen, and holds a very important position in their organization, but is, unfortunately, too unwell to be present to-night, I move That after paragraph d of sub-clause 2, the following paragraph be inserted :"" Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph should any person entitled to compensation under this Act die in any public institution leaving no dependants, then such institution shall through its officers be entitled to receive compensation to the extent of a sum not exceeding Twenty shillings per day for every day or part thereof during which such injured person remained an inmate of the institution."" I hope that the Government v ill accept the amendment. The desire of the honourable member is that, should a sailor be injured and taken to a hospital, or some similar public institution, and die there, the authorities shall be able, in the event of his leaving no dependants, to recoup the cost of his attendance by charging his employers at the rate of 20s. a day, instead of making his care a burden on the charity of the community. Of course, where there are dependants, the compensation will go to them, and the institution which has looked after the injured man will have its claim on them. I trust that the Attorney-General will accept this proposition.",79
727,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [11.0] - Whils t I sympathize with the honourable member in his desire that the claims of these people should be recognised, I have to point out that this Bill deals only with seamen who suffer injury in the course of their employment, and that this amendment would be altogether irrelevant to it. Amendment negatived.",80
728,Mr ROBERTS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Adelaide) [ n . i ] should like to ask the Attorney-General whether he can see his way to agree to the excision of the words, "" if not settled by agreement,"" in paragraph 3. words leave a loop-hole by which the settlement of a difficulty may be deferred for weeks, if not months."" The honourable gentleman will probably know that under the Workmen's CompensationAct of South Australia, where there is a loop-hole to suggest a settlement by agreement, of any difficulty arising in relation to an accident, endless delay occurs, because one party to the dispute does not desire an agreement of any kind, and invariably puts various difficulties in the way of a settlement. The omission of these words would not interfere materially with the wording of the clause, and it seems to me that the Senate would accept such an amendment. If , however, there is a danger of the clause being interfered with because of the omission of these words, I shall not press my proposal.",80
729,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Angas-Attorney-General ) [11.3] - I hope that the honourable member will not press his request. The words to which he objects are only in the nature of a declaration that people may' make an agreement. They do not prevent a sailor or his representatives taking advantage at once of the compulsory provisions of the Bill. If there is no agreement the party has a remedy at law. These words will not compel a seaman to wait for any term before taking action. Clause agreed to. Clause 6(1.) Proceedings for the recovery under thjs Act of compensation for an injury shall not be maintainable unless notice of the accident has been given. . . . and unless the claim for compensation has been made (e) in the cnse of a ship lost with all hands - withi n eighteen months after the time ' when she was last heard of. . . .,80
730,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [11.4] - I move That the words "" time when she was last c heard of,"" line 8, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" date when she is deemed under section 12 of this Act to have been lost with all hands "" be inserted. Those words are used in clause 12, and I think it well to bring the two clauses into line. This is a. purely technical amendment, and will also bring the clause into line with English legislation.",80
731,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Kalgoorlie) [11.5] This is a proposal to bring the clause into conformity with clause 12, and I am .in- I clined to think that it will be an improvement.",80
732,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,It will mean that the Bill will have to be returned to the Those Senate.,80
733,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I was about to ask the Attorney-General whether he thinks it advisable to proceed with an amendment of this kind, which is not of material importance, and the acceptance of which may endanger the Bill.",80
734,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It cannot possibly endanger the Bill. The amendment"" was really asked for by the Board of Trade, but I think it will be better also for the seamen's representatives.",80
735,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I think that the one phrase is almost as indefinite as the other, but if the Attorney-General can give the Committee an assurance that the Bill will not be endangered by being returned to the Senate with this amendment, I shall not object to it.",80
736,Mr GLYNN,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"It cannot possibly be endangered. I think the amendment will be advantageous to the seamen's representatives. The words "" the time when she was last heard of "" are very indefinite.",81
737,Mr FRAZER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The honourable member is probably right. The only question is as to the effect which the passing* of this amendment may have on the fate of the Bill.,81

745,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Dalley) [11.11] - I desire to allude to a matter to which I was not allowed to refer this morning. On that occasion I wished to compliment the vernment on their desire to push on with business and upon the work that they had of life have been put on one side. accomplished. In the early stages of the session they were attacked by an obstructive insect, but soon got rid qf its sting, and they are to be. complimented in the main on having passed some useful and interesting legislation. But the people of my electorate are deeply concerned at the failure of the Government to pass legislation with respect to the new Protection. I was the first member of the late Opposition, when sitting on that side of the House, to declare myself a believer in the policy of the new Protection. When the honourable member for Ballarat introduced that new economic principle 1 immediately subscribed publicly to it, although many of the members of his present Ministry who were then sittting in Opposition with me were bitterly opposed to it. I am glad to see them now associated with the honourable gentleman who proposes to make the policy of the new Protection a cardinal feature of his platform. When I announced my acceptance of the principle I received a rather severe roasting at the hands of some of my colleagues who are today members of the Ministry and advocates of that policy. I think, however, that .we ought to have something m<gte than a mere advocacy of it. We ought to have an instalment df new The Inter-State Commission Bill, which deals incidentally the matter, has been abandoned, apparently, in another place. Many honourable members voted for the new Protection, believing that it would enable the to be of assistance, not only to manufacturers, but to their employees and the consumers generally. Those of a Radical turn of mind, although Free Traders, were willing to renounce their fiscal faith when it was shown that under the policy of the new Protection, benefits could be given, not merely to a few manufacturers, but to the workers and consumers. I was a Free betTrader because I did not think that the adwhole community should be taxed for the benefit of a - few manufacturers, I immediately subscribed to a in the policy which would extend the benefits of the Tariff, not only to manufacturers, but to their employees, securing the for them better wages and improved conditions of labour, while at the same time conserving the rights of the consumers. As pointed out previously, the employers and manufacturers have not been negGolected, while the workers, who have had to bear the increased cost of the necessaries I am told that the Prime Minister even yet may be prepared to do something this session ; but, as a Radical on this side, I say that the Government's neglect in this matter is a disgrace. I hope we shall have some strong intimation from the Government as to their intentions.",81
746,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"A referendum is necessary,",82
747,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The Leader of the Opposition is quite right; it is of no use to tinker with the matter.,82
748,Mr WEBSTER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Gwydir) [11.16] - I see that in consequence of the .lamentable coal strike it is proposed that the churches shall abandon their night services in order to save the gasThis is a very serious matter, because, what will happen if the people, who usually go to church, are driven into the unlighted parks? It is time that something was done, in the interests of morality, to terminate the strike; and I desire to know whether the Prime Minister has decided to take any steps, and, if so, what?",82
749,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Corio) [11.18] - Some comment has been made upon the number of men likely to attend the Kitchener camps, and it has been stated that the Victorian figures are underestimated. Personally, however, I think that the figures are overestimated. I should like the Minister of Defence to make' some new arrangement as to the date, so that the Kitchener camp may fit in with the ordinary Easter camp. Mr JosErH COOK - I only wish that could be done.",82
750,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The difficulty is that, after seven or ten days' shutting down of factories at Christmas, it is rather difficult for the men to give another ten days, however willing the employers might be. I know one factory where, if a second holiday were taken, the billets could not be kept open. As tQ the number attending, if in Victoria the Minister gets anything like 25 per cent, it will be very good under the circumstances. I understand it is suggested that Lord Kitchener will take charge of the camps, while a District Commandant will take each side, and, if anything will attract men the novel sight of a Commandant in charge of troops ought to attract a large attendance, for this, I should say, is about the last matter on which the Commandants have any knowledge. Such an event would add to the jollity of the country, and a fair number would turn out to see the joke. I know that there is the highest official disapproval of the system under which Lord Kitchener is to be used.",82
751,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,What I,82
752,Mr CROUCH,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I know that the proposals are not approved, in his Department by persons whose advice is worth consideration. If Lord Kitchener had gone through the district commands and organization, and spent a certain amount of time at Head-quarters, he could have done good work, and could have seen all that was necessary, in a camp in two days.",82
753,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [11.21] - Lord Kitchener's itinerary is already pretty well fixed and cannot be altered. I only wish it were possible for him to be at the ordinary Easter encampment. We cannot have two camps, and if the one he attended were held for only two or three days, it would cost almost as much as an eight days' camp, because the bulk of the expenditure is on transport. I am afraid that, inconvenient .as it may be for some of the troops, we must go through with the present arrangements. With the exercise of a little selfdenial on the part of some employers, there ought not to be much trouble in having a good camp, so far as numbers are concerned. With regard to the question put by the honourable member for Dalley in connection with the new Protection, I am afraid that there is not much chance of our being able to get the Inter-State Commission Bill through this session, as we should very much like to have done.",82
754,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,It is perfectly useless for the purpose for which it was introduced.,82
755,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,There is his answer for the honourable member for ' Dalley.,82
756,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,But what about the referendum ?,82
757,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"This Government is not in favour of such a referendum as the Leader of the Opposition has proposed. I hope, that statement is quite plain.'",82
758,Mr ROBERTS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The Government are not in favour of trusting the people to express an opinion on the subject of industrial legislation.,82
759,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The Government are not in favour of such a referendum as that proDOsed by the Leader of the Opposition. That is to say, they are not in - favour of the Commonwealth taking over the whole of the industrial power of the States.",82
760,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,They are not in favour of protection for the workers.,83
761,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"We say that it is not necessary to do that in order to protect the workers. I hold a very strong - opinion on the point, as the Leader of'the Opposition is aware.",83
762,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Are the Government in - favour of the new Protection?,83
763,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The honourable member for Dalley now has his answer. It is impossible to pass the Government proposal for new Protection in this Parliament in consequence of the uncompromising and bitter opposition and repudiation of the Leader of the Labour party in this Houie, amongst others.",83
764,Mr THOMAS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Has the Government not a majority without us?,83
765,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"Unfortunatel y in the Senate, as in this House, there are one or two of the Government party who have a way of going on their own, and the honourable member who interrogated me on this subject is a very fair example of them. The honourable member for Dalley exercises his own individuality very freely.",83
766,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,And I do not object to others doing so.,83
767,Mr ROBERTS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The Minister says that because the Opposition object the Government are unable to carry certain measures.,83
768,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The proposal is a sham, and the Government knew it.",83
769,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,Has the honourable member anything else to say ?,83
770,Mr FISHER,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,The Inter-State Commission Bill is but a sham for the purpose for which it was professedly introduced.,83
771,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,We will leave it at that. That is the answer to the honourable member' for Dalley. I hope the honourable member is satisfied.,83
772,Mr WILKS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,I do .not want the answer of the Leader of the Opposition. I am asking for the Minister's reply .to my question.,83
773,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I should have thought that in a matter of this sort the - views of the Leader of the Opposition would have very great weight with, the hononble member. I am trying to explain the reason why we are not able to proceed with that measure this session. We have not sufficient strength to carry it through the Senate as we should like to do. The reason for that is the uncompromising opposition of my honourable friends opposite and their confreres in another place.",83
774,Mr THOMAS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"The Labour party opposed the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill, and yet the Government carried it in the Senate.",83
775,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"A m I saying anything that is incorrect ? If not, why these angry interjections?",83
776,Mr ROBERTS,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,There is no anger; there is only sympathy for the Minister.,83
777,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PORT AUGUST A TO KALGOORLI E,"I suggest to the honourable member for Gwydir that he should interrogate the Prime Minister tomorrow on the question of the strike. For the rest, I wish to say that 1, for one, feel deeply obliged to my honourable friends opposite for the splendid way in which they have worked today. I hope they will come again tomorrow in the same mood. Th'ey have done well today, and I am very much obliged to them.
