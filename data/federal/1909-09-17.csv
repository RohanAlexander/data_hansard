4,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"There is no statement in the report, but from personal representations made to me, I think that the period of investigation ought not to exceed another"" two months. QUARANTINE. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Can the Attorney-General say whether the Common: wealth will take over the control of quarantine from the States, so that Tasmania may have a chance against her bigger neighbours ?",14
5,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"As the matter concerns the Department of Trade and Customs, it would be well for the honourable member to give notice of his question. We have passed a Quarantine Act, and it contains a power under which a proclamation may be issued for extending its operations in respect to certain matters now forming part of the jurisdiction of the States. CRITICISM OF LABOUR PARTY SUPPLY BILL (No. 2).",15
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In today's Argus it is stated that the Labour party occupied the whole of the sitting last Tuesday, when the Supply Bill was introduced and passed, and that the result of that obstruction has been that the wages of public servants authorized under the Bill have not been paid, and cannot be paid in some States until Monday next. For that hardship public servants have to thank the Labour Party. I ask the Treasurer whether it is not a fact that the Supply Bill was passed through all its stages on the day on which it was - introduced into this House, and again passed through all its stages on the day on which it was introduced into the Senate, and whether the statement in the Argus is not grosslv inaccurate?",15

17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUNGAREE POST OFFICE,"The late Sir Thomas Bent rendered many remarkable services to Victoria. As Speaker of the Legislative Assembly; later, as Premier for many years, and in various other ways, he did good work for his State and for Australia generally. We remember only those services today, and it is fitting that in the chamber where, for so long, he presided over the deliberations of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, we should pay this tribute to his memory, and acknowledge all he has done for the public weal.

His ideas and ideals. were altogether different from those of the party with which I am sociated. But nobody can avoid paying the late honourable gentleman a. tribute admiration for his courage and for that individuality which marked him from the courage. ruck. Like other men, he has done good and evil, things. That is the lot of all men who do things rather than have things done for them. Criticism fell upon him during his later years, perhaps, in overhis whelming measure, but posterity will do most courageous. him justice. He was a prominent figure in the history of Victoria for very many years. He seemed to meet every phase of fortune with courage and dignity. For a little while he was in the backhas ground, but I do not think that I am expressing my individual opinion when say it was the confident belief of the people of this country that he would emerge and take his place in the foreNumerous front. He has now passed away, and I join with the Acting Leader of the House in extending to his relatives and friends a tribute of sympathy and condolence. feel very sure they may rest satisfied that flying colours. there is no bitterness in the minds of who called themselves, and were indeed, his public opponents. Rather do they feel that at the back of all his acts there a desire to do that which he conceived be his duty to his country - ha s Mr W.'H.

The news of his sudden decease, which reached me only during the last few minutes, has left me without the means expressing as fully as I should have liked to do my sentiments towards an old friend. Death has removed one of the most interesting and remarkable - figures from the political life of Australia. glad that the Acting Leader of the Opporecollections sition has paid a well-deserved tribute our deceased friend's courage. Right or wrong, he was never deficient in that quality. Perhaps it may not be known to many honourable members with that that quality was exhibited in a far more remarkable degree in connection with his private misfortunes than it was in the public acts of his exceptional career. I need not say anything more, except that I always found him a loyal and warmremoved. hearted friend and colleague. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [10.45]. --Wit h the permission of the House, I should like to say a word or two in regard as to the late Sir Thomas Bent, who was a very old personal friend. I have known of him for thirty-three or thirty-four years, and I have always admired him for his He did many things ""in a rugged way, but everybody admitted his courage, which, as the honourable member for Flinders has observed, was exhibited in a remarkable fashion in connection with private troubles. In misfortune he was It was then that he would pull himself together, with that singular courage which always marked his public career.

DISSENT FROM RULING. NA UNDER STANDING ORDER 241.",16
20,Mr HUGHES,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,West Sydney) [10.48]. it - I move That this House dissents frorn the ruling of,17
21,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"That the closure could be applied to the question understanding order 241, ""That the Speaker do now leave the Chair. ' 1 In submitting this motion to dissent from your ruling, sir, I am actuated by a desire to settle a point which I feel certain you will admit is at least arguable. The position is, I think, without precedent in this House, and in the very short time that has been available to me, I have been unable to discover any reference to it in May. The point which I take is that, where no precedent has been laid down, and where the practice is not clearlyestablished, you, sir, in the interpretation of our Standing Orders, must be guided by the general rule's relating to the interpretation of laws, ancl that where there is a doubt you should give the benefit of that doubt to the House ancl in the direction of the most ample discussion. The principle of the closure is to prevent obstruction, and the very n.iture of the motion that "" Mr Speaker do now leave the chair, and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply,"" takes it out of the operation of that standing order. The intention of the motion is that there should be from time to time an opportunity to discuss grievances before granting Supply. May says at page 611 of the n t h edition that the Committee of Supply ""must be kept on foot throughout the session until closed in due course."" The right of the House of Commons-the people's House-to ventilate grievances before granting Supply is most ancient ancl valuable, and any invasion of it ought not to be permitted without the clearest and most direct mandate. closure resolutions were adopted by this House for the sole purpose of preventing the obstruction of Government business. If you look, Mr Speaker, at the circumstances surrounding their adoption you will see that they have relation only to an actual or contemplated attempt to prevent a majority proceeding with any business. I submit that they have no relation to the ancient and invaluable right that we have to ventilate grievances on a formal motion of Supply. In its very nature the question before the Chair when the closure was applied in this case is differentiated from an ordinary motion. It was not moved by an honourable member; it was simply put formally by yourself. That, I submit, takes out of the operation of the closure standing order. Mr W. H. IRVINE - How can the honourable member get away from the plain language of the standing order?",17
22,Mr HUGHES,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I submit that the question of Supply does not come within the application of the closure standing order. As you said last night, Mr. Speaker, it is a mere cover under which we discuss grievances. Will you say, sir, that you have no discretion in this matter? If you hold that you have not, then a majority, sufficiently disciplined and resolute to apply the closure upon every occasion, could move its application as soon as you put the .question, ""That I do now leave the chair, and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply."" If a Minister moved at that stage, "" That the question 'be now put,"" would you put it, and so strangle debate? If you would, then I say most emphatically that this House would cease to be a deliberative Assembly, and would become merely a place where.the Ministry recorded their opinions, and alone had the right to express them. Apart altogether from the principle involved, and dealing with the merits of the question of Supply as though it were not a. motion differentiated from others, I hold that the occasion in question was not one for the application of the closure, and that even assuming that you rule that the closure standing order does apply to such a question, you have discretionary power, and ought to have exercised it last night by declining to put the motion.",17
23,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"There can be no question more important to the House than one relating to the ruling of the Chair. I The hope, therefore, that honourable members will give to this matter the attention which is necessary in order that a proper conclusion may be arrived at. I ask the honourable member for West Sydney where in the Standing Orders it is shown that it is possible for me to exercise discretionary power in this matter.",17
24,Mr HUGHES,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"We are to assume that every standing order has relation not to an abstract but a concrete case, namely, the conduct of business in this House. Certainly no standing order can Ibe taken so to apply to a condition of affairs as to render a deliberative assembly, which this House is, absolutely impotent and prevent deliberation and argument.",17
25,Mr WILKS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The Speaker of the House of Commons has discretionary power.,18
26,Mr HUGHES,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"He has, and declines absolutely to put the closure or the guillotine unless he thinks it should be applied. I remember a Chairman of Committees declining to put the motion.",18
27,Mr KELLY,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,A discretionary power is vested in the Speaker of the House of Commons by the Standing Orders.,18
28,Mr WILKS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"But the Speaker of this House has no discretionary. power vested in him. . Mr HUGHES' - Every standing order must be interpreted in the light of its application to concrete facts. Supposing that directly the House meets it were possible to move "" That the question be now put,"" on, for instance, the Order, of the Day that a Governor General's message be considered in a Committee of the whole, and it is carried and the business ended, it is quite conceivable that the Standing Orders might be suspended on a similar motion. Was it contemplated for a moment that such a monstrous perversion of the ordinary and constitutional method of discussion in this House should be permitted? If you should rule that way, then we may at once abandon any pretence of conducting Parliament on the basis of a deliberative assembly. If we may not ventilate grievances and make our protests-if we are at all times to be subject to the caprice of a majority, who may, if they chose, trample every right under foot-and you have no discretion, then, for my part, I should question very much the expediency of remaining any longer in a chamber where one's voice is at any time liable to be drowned in an unseemly roar from honourable members opposite, and where it is impossible for the minority to express their opinions on projected legislation in the time-honoured fashion of Parliamentary government since its inception. It would be a disastrous thing if you declared that you had' no discretion. If you take the words of the standing order as if they meant that you are to put any motion that anybody moves, then I shall be able to demonstrate in this Chamber within a week from now, that, under the same standing order, we on this side can make debate absolutely impossible. If you are to have no discretion, and must put the motion, ""That the question be now put,"" every time it is moved, the fact of the question being put will make it impossible to carry on business in an orderly way in a deliberative assembly. I say, therefore, that you have discretion, and ought to exercise it-that you ought not to rule that you have no discretion until you have claimed discretion and been denied it. If you abandon that control which the Speaker of the House of Commons exercises, without claiming at least the right to exercise discretion, and submitting your view to the decision of the House",18
29,Mr WILKS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,When the closure proposal was introduced the Speaker in the House of Commons objected to being authorized to exercise discretion-it was forced'on him.,18
30,Mr HUGHES,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I claim that you, sir, are clothed with' every authority that the Speaker of the House of Commons has.",18
31,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I am very anxious not to restrict the scope of the debate unduly, but I point out that the question now before the House is, not whether there is discretion vested in the Speaker, but whether a certain ruling was correct or otherwise; and I ask the honourable member to direct his attention to that question.",18
32,Mr WISE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Mr Speaker, I rise to a point of order. You, yourself, asked the honourable member for West Sydney a few minutes ago to point out where the standing order gave you any discretion. Mr SPEAKER' - I do not think that that is a point of order, but rather an attempt to put the Chair in a false position ; and I hope the honourable member will not do that. The honourable member for West Sydney made an assertion, and I asked him to show me where it was supported in our Standing Orders. The honourable member did not deal with that question any further; and he is now dealing with another part of the subject altogether. He is really taking the debate into an avenue into which I hold he is not competent to take it at this juncture; and I ask him, therefore, to confine his remarks to the question whether the ruling was correct or otherwise.",18
33,Mr HUGHES,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I regard this as a fundamental question; and it is quite impossible for me to argue it if I am not permitted to show that the closure motion ought not, and does nor, apply to the motion understanding order 241, and that, in any case, you have discretion. With all deference, I submit that my remarks are perfectly relevant, and within the scope of the question before the Chair, which is that your ruling was not correct, in that you ruled that the closure motion did apply. Supposing, Mr Speaker, you had said that the closure motion did not apply to the motion understanding order 241, would not that have been to exercise a discretion? And is it not conceivable that some other honourable member elected to the Chair might decide otherwise? It is conceivable, and, therefore, there must be room for discussion on that point. In the very nature of things the Speaker of a deliberative assembly must have discretion, as in the case of the Speaker of the House of Commons, on which the procedure of this Chamber is modelled; and that discretion you ought to exercise. I claim that this is an argument why you were wrong in your ruling-that if , by virtue of your exercising that discretion, you decided in a wrong way, I am justified in my present attitude. Do you say, Mr Speaker, that, under all circumstances, and on every motion:-for the suspension of the Standing Orders, for the discussion of grievances and every other motion-the closure motion applies? If so, would you rule that it applied in the case where an honourable member, on rising to move "" That the question be now put,"" was, before he could move the motion, met with another motion that he be no further heard ? I am sure, Mr Speaker, that you would not give any such absurd ruling. Yet, if vou say that you have no discretion, then if the second member gets up in time, you must put the second motion first, and stop the first member from moving ""That the question be now put."" But, you will probably say that you cannot do that, and must bring to the interpretation of the Standing Orders and apply to the business of the Chamber that common sense which is exercised by every judicial tribunal. You have exactly the same discretion as a. judge has. There is no mandate to you in the standing order to accept the closure motion in all circumstances. Standing order A says"" After any question has been proposed . . . a motion may be made .' . . ' that the question be now put,' and the 'motion shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate."" Sir JOHN .QUICK - Is not that mandatory? - - ",18
34,Mr HUGHES,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I am willing to accept everything that that means, but it does not mean, Mr Speaker, that you must put every motion in all circumstances, without exercising your discretion and deciding whether the subject is a fit and proper one. I therefore submit that your ruling was wrong, and I hope that the House will dissent from it, or, if that be not done, I hope, at any rate-for I should be the last to desire to do more than to prevent the repetition of the application of the closure to this class of motion-that the House will express the opinion, or that you will do so, that there is a limitation to the application of the closure. I am expressing no opinion as to whether the Government ought or ought not to have applied the closure later in the evening. Clearly, the closure does apply to all these other motions, and I express no opinion as to the expediency or policy of using it. But I claim that there is a clear line of distinction in regard to this class of motion, that the closure was never intended to apply to them, and that to apply it to them is an invasion Of the primary privileges of the House.",19
35,Mr WILKS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"If the honourable member reads further on, he will find that under the Standing Orders the Speaker has a discretion ",19
36,Mr HUGHES,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I submit that the Standing Orders should be interpreted by you with due regard to the conduct of business, and to the application of what is . the first principle of this Chamber',' namely, the right of honourable members to discuss every question that comes"" before them.'",19
37,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I desire, before the matter goes any further, to draw the 'attention of honourable members to what actually occurred last evening. The question was submitted to the Chair as to' whether the closure standing order should apply to the motion that was then before the House. In giving my decision, I quoted from both standing orders-the one which provided for the question to be placed before the House, and the other, which provided for the application of the closure. My decision was based upon the ordinary meaning attached to the Words. The standing order provides that the closure can be applied to any question which, had been proposed, and I showed that the question had been proposed understanding.order 241.",19
38,Mr FRAZER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Would you say by whom? Mr...SPEAKER - B y the Chair. In those circumstances, I ruled that, as any question which had been proposed could be closured, this question, which had been proposed, came under the operation of - the rule. I submit to the House that that is really the only question which is now before us. . That is the only decision - which was given, and it is the only decision which has been questioned. Supposititious cases, and the question of my discretion, are matters which do not come within the"" scope of the present discussion, and I would urge honourable members of experience to remember that the occupant of the Chair can do nothing more dangerous than to express an opinion upon some case that may happen. I have determined to refrain from doing so until it is absolutely necessary that an opinion should be expressed, and I think every honourable member of - experience will see the wisdom of that course. I submit to honourable. members that any further discussion upon the matter should be confined to the question which is before the Chamber, and that is the question whether my ruling, that the question "" That the Speaker do now leave the Chair,"" is covered by the closure standing order, is or is not correct. Mr W. H . fIRVINE (Flinders) [11.17]. - I think the very serious step of challenging the ruling of the Speaker in connection with this particular matter comes with peculiar'appropriateness from the honourable member for West Sydney. I am sorry the honourable member has seen fit to leave the chamber. Although it is undoubtedly the right and privilege of every member in this Chamber to challenge your decision under the Standing Orders, it is a right and privilege which it is unwise, in the interests, not of any party, but of the dignity of the House, to exercise, except upon real and substantial grounds. I have never heard any proposition of the kind brought forward, or attempted to be supported by more flimsy and inadequate arguments than those which have proceeded from the honourable member. That such arguments should emanate from a lawyer probably explains the somewhat timid and tentative way in which he brought them forward, and the mildness of his demeanour, because, as a lawyer, he cannot for a moment have really believed in the arguments which he was advancing. The case is so perfectly plain in the language of the sons. standing order that I cannot believe that the honourable member did not perceive the true reading of it. .",19
39,Mr FRAZER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,And the honourable member feels competent to diagnose his state of mind?,20
40,Mr WH IRVINE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I shall tell the honourable member another reason. It is, as I said, remarkable that the first challenge of the exercise of this power should come from the party which itself moulded the change of procedure. Will you permit me, sir, to submit, in regard to the portion of the argument of the honourable member for West Sydney which he addressed to your discretion, that in one aspect, and one aspect only, the honourable member was within his rights in referring to your discretion? The question of whether your ruling was or was not right involves two questionsfirst, whether motions understanding order 241 are covered by the closure standing order-and the words do cover them-and secondly, whether, if they do cover them, you did in fact exercise your discretion. With the question of how you should exercise your discretion we have nothing to do. That is not the point of order at all, but the question of whether you did in fact exercise your discretion is a matter which, I ' venture to submit, is open to the honourable members to discuss. Suppose that you, sir, said, "" I rule that I have no discre-. tion "" ; and suppose that the House came to the conclusion that you had wrongly ruled. Then your ruling could only be challenged in the way in which the honourable member for West Sydney has proposed to challenge it.",20
41,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I hope that the honourable member will not set up any more supposititious cases.,20
42,Mr WH IRVINE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I am not putting a supposititious case. As I understand the position, the honourable member for West Sydney says that your ruling was wrong for one of two reasons-firs t of all, because the closure provision does not apply, to a motion understanding order 241; and secondly, if it does so apply, that you, in fact, ruled that you had no discretion, and did not exercise any discretion. As you have pointed out, the matter is one the importance of which is not confined to the particular subject now before us. I have already said that in m'y opinion, a formal challenge of your ruling ought only to be undertaken under a sense of the gravest responsibility, and for the clearest of reaBut when your ruling is challenged, I believe it to be our duty to lay down the line which is to guide us in future with regard to the interpretation of this standing order. For that reason, I venture to submit that the only method of challenging your ruling is the methfod which the honourable member has adopted. But the point to which I wish to come is this: The honourable member for West Sydney was a leading member of the party-althoug h I think he was absent at the moment-whic h refused to give you discretion in this matter when it was suggested that you should have it. Not only was this very drastic weapon-'becaus e I admit that it is very drastic-forge d by the honourable member and his party; but when it was suggested that it was too drastic, and ought to' be coupled with some condition giving you a discretion in its application-whe n it was proposed that some such rule should be adopted as has been adopted in England-whe n it was proposed here that the English practice should be followed-ever y member of the party to which the honourable member for West Sydney belongs voted in favour of wiping away any condition or restriction.",20
43,Dr MALONEY,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,When was that done?,21
44,Mr WH IRVINE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"On the 23rd November, 1905. The English rule, which was before the House at the time when we were dealing with the matter, was thatAfter a question has been proposed a member rising in his place may claim to move "" That the question be now put "" ; and unless it appear to the Chair that such motion is an abuse of the rules of the House, or an infringement of the rights of the minority, the question be put forthwith, and decided without amendment or debate. Does it not seem perfectly ridiculous now, Mr Speaker, that these honourable members who, when it was proposed that the rights of the House, or the rights of a minority of the House, should be protected by giving you a discretion in a matter of this sort, refused to give you that discretion, should be the very gentlemen who take the serious step of challenging your ruling that you have no discretion?",21
45,Mr FRAZER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,What has this to do with the point of order?,21
46,Mr WH IRVINE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I have sat here day after day, week .after week, saying nothing, listening to endless obstruction and endless abuse of the privileges of this House for the purpose of preventing the course of public business; and I am going - to brand this attempt of the honourable member for West Sydney to challenge your ruling as another endeavour. to obstruct business. Mr 'HUGHES - I rise to order. point is, that the proposal before the House is that your ruling be dissented from. Your ruling was that the closure could be applied to motions understanding order 241. I submit that what the honourable member for Flinders is now saying has nothing whatever to do with the question before the House, and that, therefore, his observations are out of order.",21
47,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"As far as I have followed the honourable member for Flinders, he was dealing strictly with the motion of the honourable member for West Sydney, and was expressing his opinion about it. I trust that his expressions will be couched in such terms as will not cause irritation or offence.",21
48,Mr WH IRVINE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I shall certainly endeavour to comply with the spirit of your ruling. But I must ask leave to say that because some of us have, during this session of Parliament, refrained from expressing our opinions strongly with regard to the conduct of honourable members opposite, it must not be supposed that we are entirely free from the ordinary feelings that such conduct generates. Here we have the ridiculous and absurd position that the very party that would not permit the House to give you, Mr. Speaker, a discretion which was suggested to them at the time, in order to protect shall those sacred rights to which the honourable member for West Sydney has referredshall the right of the minority, the right to criticise the Ministry, the right fo challenge the grant of Supply; that when the minority asked for this not at all unreasonable restriction on this drastic power, the party to which the honourable member belongs said: "" No , we are going to sharpen this weapon in such a way that you .will feel it . "" Well, it so happens that the first to feel the sharpness of the weapon are the party to which the honourable member belongs. There is an old saying about "" biting the file.""- I shall not allude further to that.",21
49,Mr MCDONALD,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Does , the honourable member contend that Mr Speaker has no discretion ?",21
50,Mr WH IRVINE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Yes. . I am coming to that point. I shall quote the amendment which was moved by Mr. Robinson, a member of the then Opposition.",21
51,Mr FRAZER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"A good, smart chap; one of the ablest men in the Opposition.",21
52,Mr WH IRVINE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I quite agree My with the honourable member.

54,Mr FRAZER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I think there was; but there was no general agreement about the question. point.,22
55,Mr WH IRVINE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"If the suggesthem, tion was made by one member of the orable member's party, it was evidently overruled by the majority. What I have very innocent. read was the only attempt at a restriction which was proposed by any member of this House, so far as I have been able to observe. On the 23rd November, 1905, Mr Robinson, having proposed to insert the words, "" with the consent of Speaker or Chairman of Committees, as the case may be ' ' - I find that the House divided on the question with the rejustified sult that there were thirty-one . ayes and nineteen noes. * Every member of the Labour party then present voted with the majority to do away with the only opporward tunity afforded by the House to give Speaker the kind of discretion which now think he should exercise. With the standing order stated in the express then adopted, with the English rule becussed, fore us, and in view of the fact that when a proposal was submitted by an honordeavouring able member to give the standing order slightly different form it was rejected, can it possibly be contended that it was intended that a discretion should rest the Speaker? No mani, much less lawyer, could pretend to argue that the Speaker has any discretion in the matter.",22

What a remarkable thing it is that last evening, after the question was by the application of the closure, and it a motion followed fixing the resumption the Committee of Supply for today, honourable members opposite, having on that motion a full opportunity to bring forward any grievance, sat absolutely dumb, and did not take advantage of their oppor",22

IRVINE - It . was put foras a cogent argument by the honour the able member for West Sydney that, for they some reason that has not yet been disclosed, the formal Supply motion, under form cover of which grievances may be disdoes not fall within the standing order providing for the closure. I was ento show that there is nothing exa pressed in the standing order to show that how such a motion does not fall within it, and that if we consider the matter we shall, with find that there is every reason why it a should fall within the order, because such a motion could be more easily used as a weapon of obstruction than almost any other that could be mentioned.",22
64,Mr WILKS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"The late Speaker restricted the discussion of grievances when the Estimates were before the House, and they are before us now.",22
65,Mr WH IRVINE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Honourable members are aware that much wider liberty of debate is permitted on such motions than is allowed upon ordinary motions, and consequently they afford an infinitely wider field for obstruction. When it is not so expressed, how can it be implied that the standing order providing for the closure does not cover motions of this kind? The closure'is an extremely drastic power. I venture to say that in taking this power Parliament took it as it takes every power which it can take, subject to the effective check and control of public opinion. That public opinion is expressed on one side or on the other at the elections.",23
66,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"And honourable members opposite would not seek that opinion. Mr W. H - IRVINE - We shall, of course, be obliged to seek it. I am discussing the matter apart from party considerations. No matter which side may be right, the effective test of the propriety of the exercise of such a very drastic power as this must be whether it is sanctioned by public opinion.",23

68,Mr WH IRVINE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I am afraid the honourable member's anger, rather than his reason, speaks in this matter. I have nothing further to say, except that the propriety of the exercise of this drastic power is not to be decided by the House determining to disagree with the Speaker's ruling.

The honourable member distinguished himself in that way some years ago, and, during the time that has since elapsed, he has apparently kept in close touch with coercive methods.",23
70,Mr WH IRVINE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,To what proposals does the honourable member refer?,23
71,Mr FRAZER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"The honourable member knows them. I should be out of order in specifying them, but he doubtless remembers the railway strike in Victoria, his association with it, and the Coercion Bill he submitted in the State Parliament of Victoria.  gast said about him also.",23
72,Mr FRAZER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Dealin g with the matter under consideration, I wish to say that, yesterday afternoon, when you, sir, gave the ruling that the closure motion could be accepted, I think I was the first to take the point of order that it did not apply to a motion submitted from the Chair understanding order 241. I think the argument of the honourable member for West Sydney on that point is absolutely sound. If the formal Supply motion was properly before you, sir, it must have been moved by some one on the Government side. If it was a motion in the ordinary acceptance of the term, some honourable member opposite must have moved it. If any honourable member opposite did move it, he subsequently voted against it, and that should not have been allowed. But, as a matter of fact, it was not submitted in the form of an ordinary motion. From your position in the chair, Mr Speaker, you assumed the responsibility of submitting the question without any motion "" That you do now leave the chair"" having been moved.. The question having been presented to the House in that particular way, it was not a, question to which standing order 262A could properly be applied.",23
73,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"The honourable member will note the language of the Standing Orders. In standing order 241, the words to de- are, ""The question shall be proposed,"" and in standing order 262A, "".After any question has been proposed.""",23
74,Mr FRAZER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"That is. correct. I wish now, sir, to ask you whether you think it is within your province as Speaker to put to the House a question on a motion that has not been submitted to you? If you, sir, as Speaker, have the right to submit a motion under such circumstances that is, in effect, altering the forms of the House. If an honourable member had moved the motion he would have been compelled to vote for the question that you leave the chair. But, as a matter of fact, all those who might bave been expected to move the motion voted against your leaving the chair, and you have admitted that the question was never submitted to you by a member of the House.",23

79,Sir JOHN QUICK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Yes , by the standing order.",24
80,Mr FRAZER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"The opinion of the the spectacle honourable gentleman may carry considerable able weight, but my interpretation of the standwithout ing order is, that when a question is subroughly mitted from the Chair without a motion sity for convinced having been moved, it does not come within Standing Orders, if not the scope of the closure rule. sir, that if your ruling is accepted as a precedent, Ministers, if they have a majority, can deny to honourable members the right to discuss for even a moment the administration of their Departments. Every third Thurshave day is set apart as a day for the ventilation of grievances before the granting of Supply. Yesterday some honourable members who were anxious to obtain a Ministerial pronouncethe ment on several important questions did not ""get an opportunity to speak. I do not think that I have spoken more than a few times on grievance day. Yesterday wanted to. refer to several matters, got no opportunity to do so. If the opportunity for ventilating grievances can be spent on nothing? taken away by what I regard as an unreasonable interpretation of the language the Standing Orders, that will seriously curtail the liberties of honourable members. On the question of discretion, that is, to whether or not Ministers shall have honourable member the power, without the authority of the Chair, to conduct the business of the House, I am in agreement with the I Standing Orders. I do the question as to whether or not the majority shall have an opportunity to press their opinions ought to be subject the veto of the Chair. Although we can reasonably assume that, as a rule, get an impartial decision from the Chair, yet there may arise a set of conditions honourable member would not do so. I think that the majority ought to be able to conduct their business without throwing upon any person the responsibility of saying whether or not a motion of which they are in favour shall be submitted. I do not hold with the honourable member for West Sydney in regard to that particular quesOrder tion, and I think it would be unwise be to follow the precedent of at least one In his endeavour to throw a certain amount of odium upon the Labour party, the honourable member for Flinders pointed out that we, as a party, were responsible for introducing the closure rule. That has nothing to do with the ruling under review, but, as the honourable gentleman referred to the matter at length. I think that if he had been a member of the House in 1905, and had witnessed of a dozen members being to hold up the business for a week talking once on the subject under consideration, he would have been thomaking that there was a necessome amendments of the so rigid as those I submit, which were adopted.",24

89,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I interpreted it as question.,25
90,Mr FRAZER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"When you, sir, interthe preted that as a question which had heen proposed, although no honourable member can be named as having proposed or honourable seconded a motion, and one which came under the closure rule, I think that your judgment was faulty; and I am prepared vote in accordance with my views.",25
91,Mr WISE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Gippsland) [11.48] - Hav ing regard to the fact that standing order 241 was adopted for the express purpose securing to honourable members a very great privilege-that of ventilating grievances without the leave of anybody- I do not it was ever intended that it should be ject to the application of the closure At the same time, unfortunately, we have nothing to do with the question of intenAdmitting tion. According to my reading of the words of standing order 241 and the closurepoint rule, there cannot-be any doubt that nically your ruling was absolutely right. I agree with what appeared to be your view on the question of discretion when said to the honourable member for West Sydney, "" Show me where the Standpenal ing Orders give me a discretion."" concur with the statement of the honbeing orable member for Flinders, that under the rule you had no discretion whatgrievance ever. I take this opportunity to put it cord that I endorse the opinion so expressed, for which the honourable member gave exthe cellent reasons. He pointed out that when it was proposed to give Mr Speaker dispresentative cretion, the House refused to do so, and there can be no doubt that, as you have suggested, you possess no discretion in matter. I agree with the honourable memmy ber, too, that the safeguard against proper use of the closure is the fear of public opinion. The majority of the can apply the closure to any motion, whentary ever it pleases, but its action.in so doing will be judged by the public, sooner later. I agree with the honourable member for iFlinders in that, and I say, the sooner the better.",25
92,Mr MCDONALD,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Kennedy) [11.52] I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland. I do not think it right that Speaker or the Chairman of Commitwhoever may fill those offices, should be given discretion in a matter of this kind.  queswhen the standing order was framed.",25
93,Mr MCDONALD,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Yes , for the reason that it was felt that it would create a a tendency to throw upon the presiding officers an onus which should be borne by House itself. I hope that the time will never come when honourable members will shirk responsibility in that way. The members for Flinders and Gippsland are right in stating that neither Mr. Speaker nor the Chairman of Committees to has discretionary power in regard to the application of the closure. It is for the - Government of the day to say how business shall be conducted, and to use that of standing order as it thinks best for the expedition of business. The responsibility of saying when the closure shall be applied think would be too heavy a burden for the subshoulders of either Mr Speaker or the rule. Chairman of Committees to bear.",25
94,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Wide Bay) [11.54] what has been said by' the two speakers who have preceded me, I would out that a bigger question remains to techbe discussed. In a matter of this kind, where there is doubt, the ancient priviown leges of Parliament should be respected. you It is a legal maxim that where there is a shadow of doubt as to the application of clauses, the benefit of it must be I given to those who stand in danger of injured. That applies to Standing Orders as well as to other rules. On day there is no motion before on rethe House. I understand that you, Mr. Speaker, consider that a question is before House just as much as if a motion had been moved in the ordinary way by a reof the people, and the Postmaster-General stated that there is a proposition before the House by virtue of the the declaration of the Standing Orders. In view it is not so. It is impossible for ima proposition to be properly before the House unless it has the individuality of a day mover behind it. The proper Parliamenview is that the representative of a constituency must be responsible for every or question submitted to the House, and the closure rule was framed to be applied whenever the majority had resolved that the proposition before the House had been sufficiently debated, or that the discussion taking place was useless, or preventing the consideration of more important business.",25
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The Standing Orders presume the putting of a motion.,26
96,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"The closure rule applies to definite motions or amendments moved by a member. Those are not the - words used, but that is the assumption.",26
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Surely where all the representatives have agreed to a certain - course a question is regularly before the House?,26
98,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"If the whole House, with one exception, wished to do a certain thing, and the member who was in the minority objected to its being done, the Standing Orders, if he were within his rights, would protect him. The soul and principle of the Standing Orders is expressed in an illustration such as that. While they are framed for a guidance of the majority, and the preservation ot order, they are primarily intended to protect the minority against the abuse of the majority.",26
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,And to protect the majority against the tyranny of the minority - Mr FISHER - The point which I am,26
100,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"That is so. A closure rule is a very proper one for a democratic Parliament to have ; I complain not of its use, biit of its abuse. But if it can be applied to a question which has not been put before the House by an. individual representative of the people, it can be applied in other similar cases, and we might have, under the Standing Orders, a number of questions, submitted without individual responsibility, though that would be most undesirable - Does the Minister of Defence think that it is advisable to apply the closure to the discussion bf grievances before the granting of Supply to the Crown? I do not think that honourable members generally would admit that the closure should be applied to such a debate.",26
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I do not think that it should be applied to any debate until there has been reasonable discussion. Mr FISHER. - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie said that he was pleased to hear .the honourable member for Flinders speak as he did on the question, as he was capable of dealing with it. In my opinion, the speech was absolutely a political one. The reason given by the honourable member for Flinders for applying the closure to the discussion of grievances was practically that the right of the representatives of the. people in. Parliament to discuss grievances, in order to secure the taxpayers against wrong-doing by those in possession of Crown authority, might afford an opportunity for obstruction. Things have come to a fine pass if special pleading of that kind has to be indulged in. Are the Standing Orders to be strained so that the majority may not be inconvenienced? The idea underlying the granting of power to honourable members to ventilate grievances before going into Committee of Supply was not to provide the majority with an opportunity to enforce their will any more than it was to permit the minority to express their views.",26
102,Mr JH CATTS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Unde r the decision which has been given, criticism of the Government might be entirely squelched.",26
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,But we have been engaged a whole week in discussing grievances.,26
104,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,We may well leave the consideration of that matter till another occasion.,26
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Unfortunately , we cannot. now discussing is one of first-rate importance from my stand-point. It would be extremely - difficult for Mr Speaker to take upon himself the onus of deciding that the proposal for the House to resolve itself into Committee of Supply is not covered by the closure. In the absence of specific words to the contrary, most persons would be apt to hold that the Standing Orders relating to the closure are applicable to every question which may come up for our consideration. But, if I occupied the position of Mr Speaker, I think that I should say that the proposal that the House should resolve itself into Committee of Supply is not covered by the closure. It is not a question which is ""before the Chair"" in the sense that is meant by our Standing Orders. At the same time, the matter is one of extreme difficulty, and one which permits of a doubt being entertained. But in a case of this kind, I submit that unless the language of the Standing Orders is clear and unmistakable, the benefit of the doubt must be given to those who would otherwise be. inconvenienced. That is an axiom of law which is never departed from. It is an axiom which is respected wherever an attempt is made to restrict the liberty of the individual, and I contend that it should be equally applicable to any attempt to restrict the liberty of the representatives of the people. Even if-as urged by the honourable member for Flinders-the discussion of grievances would afford members of the Opposition an opportunity to obstruct business, the rule to which I have previously alluded ought not to be departed from. The circumstance that the procedure for which I am contending would afford an opportunity for obstruction has no bearing upon this matter whatever. It is a consideration which ought not to be taken into account. But I would point out that our Standing Orders provide that grievance day should come round only once in every three weeks. then can an honourable member with any sense of proportion argue that the opportunity afforded for ventilating grievances can be regarded as a serious obstacle in the way of the Government proceeding with the business of the country ?",26
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The honourable member is assuming that the business proceeds with ordinary expedition on other davs.,27
107,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I submit that consideration of the way in which business has been proceeding has nothing whatever to do with this question. Nobody is permitted to make a single allegation against an accused person before our criminal courts in respect of his previous career.,27
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,That is a strange doctrine and one which I have never heard of before.,27
109,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I have heard of it. Until an accused person has been convicted it is not open to anybody to rake up his past record. If the honourable member attempted to do that in the case of an accused person, the Judge would soon correct him. It is only after the jury have recorded their verdict that the record of an accused person can be brought under the notice of the presiding Judge. What may have occurred in connection with the conduct of business in this Chamber,- I submit, ought not to have any bearing upon your decision, sir. The Minister of Defence, - however, claims that your decision should be influenced by that consideration.",27
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I have claimed nothing of the kind.,27
111,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Then I can assure the Minister that I misunderstood his remark. The honourable member for Flinders made a political, rather than a judicial speech, for reasons which are best known to himself. I do not iake any exception to that, because he did not exceed the bounds of legitimate criticism, although he sailed rather close to the wind when he affirmed that the motion which we are now considering is another deliberate attempt on the part of the Opposition to delay the transaction of business. »",27
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Does not the honourable memher think that we have had enough of this?,27
113,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Does not the Minister of Defence recognise that I am addressing myself to a serious question? Since the present Government assumed office, it has become the practice for them to .wish to close discussion the moment members of the Opposition begin to debate their proposals. How Mr SPENCE (Darling) [12.10] - It is, 1 think, incumbent upon Mr Speaker to maintain the dignity of the House, so far as he is able, by insisting upon its business being conducted in an orderly way. We all recognise that the occupant of the Chair must be vested with certain discretionary power. But it is clear that that power is confined to certain limits, because Standing Orders have been laid down for his guidance. The history of the great mother of Parliaments offers an additional guide to Mr Speaker, and the limitations are as wide as experience can suggest. It cannot be denied that occasions must arise when it will be necessary for you, sir, to exercise a certain measure of discretion. You hold that in this case you have no discretion, and a fairly strong case has certainly been made out for that ruling. The standing order is so framed that under it any honourable member may move the application of the closure. The honourable member for Flinders went a little out of his way to make an attack upon the Opposition because they were parties to the adoption of the closure resolution. He failed, however, to remind the House of the fact that, although it has been embodied in the Standing Orders for nearly four years, the party which adopted it has never applied it, and that it remained to those who had opposed its passing to first put it into operation.",27
114,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,--That shows that there was no necessity before to apply the closure.,27
115,Mr SPENCE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I do not think the honourable member will seriously raise that contention. I differ from the view expressed by the honourable member for Flinders as to obstruction having occurred; but that point ought to be excluded from this discussion. The application of the closure may be moved by any honourable member, and the decision as to whether or not it shall be enforced rests with the majority of the 'House. This discussion will. not have been wasted, since it has exposed to the House an' evident danger. The closure was moved in this case by Minister, and its application was, thereable fore, made a party question. I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay others who have pointed out that in applySpeaker ing the closure to a debate on a formal Supply motion, we are treading upon gerous ground, and that the result may far more serious than any 'so-called struction. Grievance day has 'been looked upon in the House of Commons, as well motion. as in State Legislatures, as that on which any citizen has a right to have his grievdealt ance stated in Parliament. If every of the seventy-five members of this House chose to exercise the right to ventilate grievto ances, there would still be no justification for the application of the closure to motion specially framed to to do so. The right to have grievances ventilated in Parliament is unThis doubtedly a most important one. House may think that an honourable ber is speaking too long in voicing grievance, but there is something more portant and sacred to be considered, and I hold that it is wrong to irrespective apply the closure to such a motion. I do not think it has been clearly shown, Mr Speaker, that the ruling you gave wrong; but a wrong has been done by those who framed the closure resolution failing to give you the right to refuse apply it to a particular motion. The delay that has taken place in dealing with public business has been due, not to the Opposipersonally, tion, but to the failure of the Government to bring forward their measures in a per way. During recent discussions it been clearly shown that the constant appli30,000 cation of the ""gag"" is likely to lead greater delay than would arise if it were not applied, and deliberate obstruction indulged in. I hope that this discussion will have a wholesome effect upon Minisruling ters, for I have felt from the first that they would display a little more tact, more business would be done. At the same time, I deny that there has been any obstruction. Now that the whole question has been roughly ventilated, I think that it would be wise, perhaps, for the mover of this people outside see motion to withdraw it. I am strongly of opinion that the closure should not be applied on grievance day, and that just as could see! the great Supreme Court of' the TJnited States of America has recognised the portance of placing a liberal interpretation upon the Constitution, so you, Mr time. Mr Spence. Speaker, should so interpret our Standing a Orders as to protect the right of honormembers to ventilate grievances. There is a great deal in the point that has been and made that the formal motion that Mr. do. now leave the chair, and that the House resolve itself into a-Committee danof Supply, is not moved by any honourable be member, but is simply put by you, sir, and ob1 think the Government were wanting in tact in applying the closure to such a This discussion must satisfy honourable members that it is time that we with our Standing Orders. Standing one Orders have not yet been adopted by the House, and when we proceed, as we ought do as soon as possible, to revise the temporary set, the discussion that has taken a place upon this motion ought certainly to enable them be of value to' us.",27
116,Mr JH CATTS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Cook) [12.19] is a motion of great importance, and The before a vote is taken, I wish to express memmy views in regard to it. The standing a order relating to the formal motion of imSupply is designed to give honourable members an opportunity to ventilate grievances, of whether or not such ventilation is approved by the Government of the day. If it is possible for the Governis ment to say that, because they do not appreciate the criticism, they will stifle in it, and, having the numbers behind them, to will carry out their own sweet will, the position is a most invidious one. This is a matter which does not affect members but affects the interests they represent; and, in this great Commonprowealth, where the electorates are large, has and members on the average, represent electors each, it is of vital concern to that they should not be restricted in the exercise of their rights at the captious will were of a tyrannical majority. I have no wish to charge the Speaker with having given a which' he is not perfectly satisfied is if correct; but we are in the unfortunate position that' our only appeal is to the same tyrannical majority; and, therefore, we cannot hope for any. successful issue from thothis debate. All we can do is to place our views before the country, and let the",28

119,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,That is not the question before the Chair.,28
120,Mr JH CATTS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"The Minister of Defence, is interrupting with irrelevant matter.",29
121,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,That is no excuse for an honourable member departing from the question before the Chair.,29
122,Mr JH CATTS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"- I have noticed that in the High 'Court the rule is followed that where two interpretations can be placed on a Statute the interpretation which fits in with the general scheme is the one accepted; and I submit that the whole scheme under the standing order, is to guarantee to honourable members, irrespective of the Ministry, the right to ventilate their grievances. Of what use is the right of criticism, if the Ministry, with a majority behind them, can apply the "" gag ""? Such a ruling-negatives the whole object of the standing order, and, therefore, should be dissented from. The honourable member for Flinders exercised his arts as an advocate this morning, when he urged"" that the Ministry are justified in their action because of the obstruction of business. The Prime Minister a few days ago, when he moved to deprive honourable members of the time now devoted to private business, expressly stated that it was the desire not to interfere with grievance day. Prior to the grievance motion being proposed, the adjournment of the House was moved on the question of old age pensions, and the debate occupied us until half-past 4 o'clock. Allowing for the dinner adjournment of an hour and a quarter, only two and a half hours, between then and a ouarter past 8 o'clock, were allowed for the discussion of grievances.",29
123,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,That is not the question before the Chair. Mr T. H . CATTS - The honourable member for Flinders was allowed to charge the Opoosition with obstruction.,29
124,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I point out that, even if the honourable member for Flinders transgresses the rules-though , I may say, I have no recollection of his doing so that does not justify another honourable member in doing the same thing.",29

126,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Wide Bay) [12.40] - I take this opportunity of reading a telewarranted, gram which I have just received from Adefact. laide, stating that it is reported there the Government are disseminating tion to the effect that the reason why they cannot pay salaries to the public servants is because they were unable to get their Supply Bill through on account of obstrucpossible tion.",30
127,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The motion before the Chair relates strictly to the High missioner Bill.,30
128,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The motion involves grant of Supply.,30
129,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"It involves a grant of - Supply for a specific purpose, but honourable member will not be in discussing the whole range of financial affairs.",30
130,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Do you rule, sir, that a motion covering an appropriation for purposes of the High Commissioner and the subject. his officials does not enable me to deal with a question relating to the ""expenditure of public money ?",30

The expenditure involved is purely to cover the purposes of the office about be crested,30

133,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Honourable members should have a' little patience. .,30
134,Dr LIDDELL,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,We are indignant at the honourable member's attitude.,30
135,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I should like to ask whether the Government are prepared to say when the appointment of High Comconsider missioner will be made? This matter has a history, which is, perhaps, better known to proceed to an appointment. to me than to any one else. I told the Government that I would aid them in every possible manner to get this Bill put through.",30
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,And the honourable member has done so!,30
137,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I did not speak on the of motion for the second reading at all.,30
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,But the honourable member took good care that others should speak.,30
139,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"That insinuation is unand what it implies is not a Apparently, the Minister of Defence that does not know what honour is when he informamakes such a charge.",30
140,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I would point out that if honourable members make interjections of a personal character, it is hardly for me to maintain strict order.",30
141,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"When I first entered this Parliament, I stated that I was in Comfavour of the appointment of a High Commissioner. In every possible way I have assisted to bring the question forward. I a had no idea that any trouble would arise when the Bill was laid before the Chamber. I trust that the Government will, at the the earliest possible moment, proceed to aporder in point the High Commissioner.",30
142,Mr GROOM,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,We made that promise in Committee on the Bill.,30
143,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Ver y well; but I have the heard nothing from the Prime Minister on,30
144,Mr GROOM,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I said that the High Commissioner would be appointed at the earliest possible opportunity. As soon as it is posfor the man to be found, the appointAffairs ment will be made. is ex Mr FISHER - The appointment ought to be made before the session closes. Under ordinary circumstances, before an appropriation of revenue is made, some idea to should be given to Parliament as to what is in the mind of the Government.",30
145,Mr MCWILLIAMS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The Government certainly ought not to sav whom they are going to appoint before the Bill is passed.,30
146,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"The honourable member is sufficiently acquainted with Parliamentary procedure to know that there is usually an understanding before a final determination is arrived at by Parliament as to a measure of this kind-. I do not claim that we have a right to know whom the Government intend to appoint. But I that it is my duty and my right to ask whether the Government are readyI t is of no use for them to ""ask for money unlessthey are ready to appoint the High Commissioner forthwith. I shall strongly protest if it is the intention of the Government to pass this Bill through and then to delay further action.",30
147,Mr MATHEWS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,It would embarrass the Government if they had to make an appointment.,31
148,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I do not care whether it would embarrass them or not. The appointment ought to be made early; and when it is made. I trust that it will lead to what we all hope for-the better representation of the Commonwealth in London, at the centre of the Empire.",31
149,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Hume) [12.48]. - I made a few remarks upon this Bill last night, but I should like to say a few words more with reference to the proposed appointment. I hold that it should be made as early as possible.",31
150,Mr MATHEWS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The honourable member would not make a bad High Commissioner himself.,31
151,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I would not have it. The gentleman appointed should be one who thoroughly understands and knows Australia, and is imbued with the Australian sentiment.",31
152,Mr WILKS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,And one who keeps in remembrance what the Australian sentiment is.,31
153,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Quite so. also think that in making the appointment the Government should hold in their hands the power of recall, in case the High Commissioner does anything which is considered to be detrimental to Australia. I would not allow any one to hold such an ofiice for a term of years without being subject to control by the Government. There should be power to recall the High Commissioner if he does anything anti-Australian, or anything that may be objected to by Parliament itself: When I was speaking last night and mentioned this idea, some one interjected, "" It could not be done."" But some honourable members know what Sir Henry Parkes did when Mr William Forster was Agent-General for that State. He did something which Sir Henry Parkes and his Government did not consider to be in the interests of New South Wales, and he was recalled. I forget who was appointed in his place, but I think it was Sir ""Saul Samuel. Mr MATHEWS.T-We had a Victorian Agent-General who cleared out before could be recalled.",31
154,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Seeing that the Victorian Agent-General was paid only ^1,000 a year, I . do not wonder that he did clear out. Whoever is appointed to this position should be in ""touch with the Australian people ,and sentiment. Probably one great objection which a person getting on in years would have to accepting this position, if he were a public man, would be that after five years in London he would find when he got back to Australia that he had lost touch with the people. That is an objection which would weigh with me if I were considering the acceptance of the position. It is almost impossible for a man who has spent a few years amid the associations and surroundings of London to avoid losing touch with Australian sentiment. For this reason I urge that the Government would do well to take up a strong position in this matter, and retain the power to recall a High Commissioner who, after three or four years' occupancy of the office, showed that he was no longer in touch with Australian sentiment. Mr 'FISHER - If the High Commissioner were recalled before the close of his term of office, would he receive salary for the full five vears?",31
155,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,That is a matter which I wish to.have made quite clear.,31
156,Mr HARPER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,He would not get salary I for the five years if he were recalled.,31
157,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,We have in New South Wales a Railway Commissioner who was introduced from abroad under an engagement guaranteeing the position to him for seven years.,31
158,Mr HARPER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,That would be under a different arrangement from that proposed in the Bill.,31
159,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"The difference would not be very great, and I know that it would be very difficult to get rid of the New South Wales Railway Commissioner to whom I refer without having to pay his salary for the seven years, unless he had done something very seriously wrong.",31
160,Mr STORRER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,He would be in the position of the late Director of Education in Tasmania.,31
161,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Jus t so.,31
162,Mr WILKS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,What about a Judge of the High Court? How would he be dealt with?,31
163,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I do not wish to go too far afield in discussing the mathe ter. The Judges of the High Court occupy a very important position. Mr KING O'MALLEY - What entertaining have they to do compared with, what would be expected of .the High Commissioner ?",31
164,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I shall have a word to say on that subject also. In my opinion the High Commissioner will oc-' cupy a more important position than will any other representative of the Commonwealth. When he opens his mouth he should speak with no uncertain sound the feelings and wishes of the people of Australia. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He should have a sovereign to jingle in his pocket.,32
165,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I said last night I should be prepared to give the High Commissioner a salary of ;£io,ooo a year, not in order that he might pocket the money, but in order that he might properly represent the Commonwealth. I was surprised to see the way in which some honourable members voted last night, after the speeches to which I had listened.",32
166,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I ask the honourable member not to traverse the votes given by honourable members. We are dealing with the necessary appropriation for the purposes of the Bill.,32
167,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,That is the very matter with which I am dealing. I was surprised that the amendment which was submitted last night was not carried. I should like very much to see the proposed salary increased.,32
168,Mr JOHNSON,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Le t the honourable gentleman move that it be increased.,32
169,Mr JH CATTS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The honourable member for Lang would not support the honourable gentleman if he did.,32
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"If the honourable member for Lang says that he will support an increase, I believe him. I do not wish to submit any motion of the kind, because it would at once be said that I was taking the matter out of the hands of the Government. This is not a party matter. From my experience in London, I feel that no man can do justice to this position unless he is given a good salary. Holding this position, he will be entertained by wealthy people, and he should be able to return the hospitalities extended to him.",32
171,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The honourable gentleman is now making a second-reading speech. The question before the Committee is that it is expedient that an approable priation of revenue be made for the purpose of the Bill.,32
172,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I think that I am in order in... giving my views on the financial position which ought to be held by the High Commissioner. Unless honourable members state their views on the matter, the Government will not know what is in their minds. It is their duty to see that a message is brought down which will cover the amount of money to meet the reasonable expenses of, and provide an adequate salary for, this officer. I think it would be very much better to give the High Commissioner a salary instead of having to investigate and catechize him upon every little item of expenditure. We should give him an adequate salary, and let him make the best arrangements he can. The Minister, or Ministers in another place, if it is not convenient to do it now, might make some suggestion on the subject. 1I have in mind in this matter what is due to Australia. I am not particularly concerned about the individual, though I should not like the High Commissioner of the Commonwealth to become bankrupt.",32
173,Mr WILKS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,We do not want him to be stranded in London.,32
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I was going to say that I once sent a gentleman to London in a representative capacity. I found money for him, but I did not find enough, and the press was full of notices that he was stranded in London. It would be very much worse to have the High Commissioner of the Commonwealth stranded in London.",32
175,Unknown,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Sitting suspended from i to 2.15 p.m.,32

177,Mr MATHEWS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Melbourne Ports) [2.16] - I had not an opportunity of addressing myself to the Bill before, but I think that I have made the fact very apparent that I am against the appointment of a High Commissioner; not because I am against the Commonwealth being represented in London by a High Commissioner, but because the proposed salary is wholly inadequate. I intend tc vote, not against the creation of a High Commissionership, but against the Bill itself.",32
178,Mr HARPER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Why ?,32
179,Mr MATHEWS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,For many' reasons.,32
180,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Order ! The honormember cannot make a second-reading speech.,32
181,Mr MATHEWS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I do not wish to enter into details, sir. I think that in many ways the Bill is faulty.",32
182,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Order ! I ask the honourable memher to confine his remarks to the question of appropriating the necessary money.,33
183,Mr MATHEWS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"To my mind, sir, the intended appropriation for this office is altogether inadequate. I am aware that on an earlier occasion I was not able to raise this question. There is already a big charge upon the States for representation in London. There has been an endeavour to curtail the expenditure on the High Commissioner, but I hold that the proposed salary is quite inadequate to induce any gentleman to accept the position.",33
184,Mr GROOM,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The honourable member made that statement in a previous speech.,33
185,Mr MATHEWS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I admit that, but even at this stage I think that some step might be taken to provide an adequate remuneration. When ithe Prime Minister met the Premiers in Conference he might have made a financial arrangement with the States",33
186,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Order ! Is the honourable member going to connect his remarks with the question before the Committee ? . Mr MATHEWS - I thought, sir, that I would be in order in dealing with the subject at this stage.",33
187,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"The question before the Committee is the necessary appropriation for the High Commissioner, and not the general proposal.",33
188,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Wide Bay) [2.17] - I desire to say a few"" words about the time at which messages covering appropriations are submitted. I have raised this question on many occasions, because, in my opinion, the Government always choose a most inappropriate time for bringing forward proposed appropriations. The custom has been for. the Government to throw a Money Bill or a Bill leading to an appropriation upon the table, discover the opinions of honourable members, and base their policy upon the action of the House. This leads to excessive expenditure and the absence of that care which responsible Ministers ought to exercise in the interests of the general public. I notice that the Attorney-General is looking up the provision in the Constitution Act. Of course I am aware that the Government have the right to bring forward a message of this kind at any time. But I was trained in a Parliament where a message involving an appropriation is not permitted to be considered at this late stage, and no doubt the Treasurer had a similar training in the Parliament of Western Australia. In the State Parliaments the Ministers are bound to bring down the message with the Bill. That is a very good rule, which I appeal to the Government to adopt. It is the best and safest course to pursue, and undoubtedly it leads to the Government coming down with a policy which they approve and intend to carry out. This expedient of delaying the consideration of the message until the Bill itself is about to be read a third time is an unwise one.",33
189,Sir JOHN FORREST,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"It is always a formal matter, as the honourable' member knows very well.",33
190,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Evidentl y the honourable member has not been following my argument.,33
191,Sir JOHN FORREST,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I know that the honourable member is wasting time,33
192,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Apparentl y it is of no use for an honourable member to give the reasons for any view which he holds.,33
193,Sir JOHN FORREST,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,That is so.,33
194,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I believe that. Sir JOHN FORREST. The honourable member has sickened us all,33
195,Mr FISHER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"In three Parliaments I have raised this question, and will raise it again. I hope that if ever I have a say m the control of business, I shall act differently from the present Government. Ihe submission of a message at this late stage in the passage of a Bill is an abuse of parliamentary privilege, and leads to loose administration, no matter what Government may be in office. _ Mr THOMAS (Barrier) [2.20] - I am in favour of the proposed appropriation, because I am in favour of the Bill being passed. I supported its second reading, but I have no sympathy with those who argue that it will be necessary for the High Commissioner to spend a great deal of money in entertainments. I know that some honourable members consider that a certain sum should be voted for that purpose, because, in their opinion, the High Commissioner will not be able to make a proper impression in London unless he attends a large number of banquets and gives dinners. I do not think it will be necessary for a man of ability to advertise himself simply by going to banquets or giving dinners. We have men who would make a great impression in London by delivering some speeches, by the way, in which they could present Australia to the public.",33
196,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Order ! I must ask the honourable member to confine himself to the message recommending that a certain sum be appropriated for the High Commissioner.,34
197,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"What I am arguing, sir, is that a certain vote is required for the High Commissioner. Some honourable members contend that it is necessary to vote a very large sum, in order to provide that officer, not only with' a salary, but with an amount for entertaining. Whilst I think it is necessary to appoint a High Commissioner, and am here to support the Bill, at the same time. I do not consider that it is necessary to vote money to cover entertainments and dinners. It seems to me that in taking that line of argument I am in order.",34
198,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"The honourable member would be in order if we were discussing the general financial aspect of the Bill ; but the question before the Committee is a proposed vote for the salary of the High Commissioner, not for his establishment.",34
199,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"It seems to me, sir, that there are two questions before the Committee, namely, whether the amount to be paid to the High Commissioner shall cover salary and out-of-pocket expenses, or Avhether it shall be allocated to certain purposes. The honourable member for Hume was one of those who argued that a lump sum should be paid to the High Commissioner. It has been contended that he will have to give grand dinners and other costly entertainments. No doubt such expenditure will be considered necessary by men of a certain type.",34
200,Dr LIDDELL,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Is the honourable member in order, seeing that the question before the Committee is whether the proposed appropriation should be made?",34
201,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The honourable member is quite in order.,34
202,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"If a gentleman like the right honourable member for East Sydney were made High Commissioner, he would not find it necessary to give large banquets in order to impress his individuality upon the people of London.",34
203,Mr TUDOR,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Why does the honourable member single him out from among the other candidates?,34
204,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I am not discussing his general fitness for the post. I merely say that he would be able to obtain publicity for'Australian views without large expenditure on entertaining. On the other hand, I think that the right honourable member for Swan, if he were sent, would have to give big banquets.",34
205,Mr GROOM,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,'Is it necessary to discuss this matter now?,34
206,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,We are divided in respect to the Bill only on the question of salary and expenses.,34
207,Sir JOHN FORREST,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,But the Bill has been passed.,34
208,Mr GROOM,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,And the honourable member expressed his views last night in a very good speech.,34
209,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,That is such a rare thing that I should like to do it again today.,34
210,Sir JOHN FORREST,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Any reason is good enough for occupying time.,34
211,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I do not think that any one will complain that I have occupied much time.,34
212,Sir JOHN FORREST,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I make the complaint now.,34
213,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"It is very unkind of the right honourable member to do so, because I have probably not spoken for fifteen minutes during the last three weeks. The Minister of External Affairs last night asked for a direction, stating that the Government was not bound to its proposal to fix the salary of the High Commissioner at ,£3,000 a yeai, allowing him £2,000 for an official residence.",34
214,Mr GROOM,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I said that it was the view of the Government that the emoluments of the office should be fixed in that way.,34
215,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,But I understood that the Government was prepared to accept the decision of honourable members on the matter ,34
216,Mr GROOM,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The Government stood by its Bill.,34
217,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Then I am pleased to support it. The honourable member for' Darwin made a powerful speech last night in favour of increasing the salary of the High Commissioner; but I am opposed to extravagance in that direction.,34
218,Mr HARPER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,We are now dealing only with the Governor General's message.,34
219,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The matter to which I am referring can be discussed on the motion before the Chair.,34
220,Mr GROOM,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,Such a discussion on this motion is most unusual.,34
221,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Why is the Governor General's message recommending appropriation considered in Committee if .it is not to be discussed ? I left a little before midnight yesterday, and understood then that the Ministers had an open mind regarding the salary which the High Commissioner should receive, but since luncheon to-dav a different complexion has been put on the matter.",34
222,Mr GROOM,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I said all through that we would stand by the Bill : but last night, as a' technical difficulty had presented itself, I explained how it could be got over, and the views of the Committee expressed.",35
223,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"I understood that the Government was prepared to accept the view of the Committee in the matter. However, as Ministers intend to stand by the Bill, it-is not necessary to say much more on the subject of salary. There is another matter that .1 should like to discuss- I refer to the qualifications of candidates for this office.",35
224,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,I must ask the honourable member not to debate that question.,35
225,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,What I wish to argue is that no member of Parliament should be eligible for appointment to the office of High - Commissioner.,35
226,The CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,The honourable member will not be in order in doing that.,35
227,Mr THOMAS,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Then I shall take another opportunity of raising the question Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported and adopted. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [2.39]. - I move That the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering clause 6. I do so with a view to subsequently moving that the salary of the High Commissioner shall be fixed at £6,000 annually, in lieu of -£3,000.",35
228,Mr KELLY,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"Wentworth) [2.40] - I am one of those who think that the salary payable under this Bill to the occupant of the distinguished office which we are to create is altogether inadequate. But there is a time in Parliamentary procedure when it becomes the duty of the minority to bow to the will of the majority. I have advocated the payment of a larger salary than £3,000 to the High Commissioner for the purpose of enabling the Government to select the best man available for the position, irrespective of his private means. My opinion has not changed in the least, but I do not see what useful purpose can be served by reconsidering clause 6; for we - tested the question of the salary which should be payable to the High Commissioner last night, and were soundly defeated. seems to me that we can be afforded an opportunity of satisfactorily reconsidering that matter only in the event of the Senate reversing the decision at which this Committee arrived last night. Unless such an opportunity be presented to us, it would be a mere waste of time for the Committee to again deal with it. It is within the recollection of all that most of the members of the Labour party who spoke against the salary fixed in this Bill voted with the Government when the pinch came. That fact in itself evidences that they were chiefly concerned with delaving the passage of this Bill.",35
229,Mr SPEAKER,APPLICATION OF CLOSURE TO QUESTION,"The honourable member for Darwin has stated that he has sub-' mitted this motion with a specific object hi view. I wish, therefore, to point out that it would not be competent for him to effect his declared purpose even if the House again referred this Bill to Committee. In point of fact, I do not know whether I ought not to at once accept the responsibility of ruling the honourable member's motion out of order, seeing that he has already stated his reason for bringing it forward. Under the circumstances I would suggest that he should withdraw it. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [2.42].' - I have no desire to fight this battle again if there be no chance of winning it. But it seems ""to me too bad that in the very cradle of this Commonwealth we should be' afraid to offer a reasonable 'salary to ' the High Commissioner, in order to enable us to command the services of the best man available for the office. Under the circumstances, I ask leave to withdraw my proposal. Motion, by leave, withdrawn. Report (from the Committee' on the Bill) adopted. NA (FINANCE) BIL L. Debate resumed from 10th September (vide page 3357), on motion by Mr. DEAKINThat leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to alter the provisions of the Constitution relating to finance.",35
230,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Melbourne Ports) [2.43] - When the debate upon this mo.tion was adjourned on Friday last, I was pointing out that the question which it raises is not a party one. There is nothing to prevent the supporters of the Government from voting against any amendIt ment of the Constitution for the purpose of adjusting the future financial relations 'of the Commonwealth and the States. The electors ought to be permitted to consider this question strictly upon its merits.",35
231,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Prime Minister made the same statement.,36
232,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I hope that all didates at the forthcoming election adopt a similar attitude. I am sure that it is not the intention of the Government any more than it is the desire of the position to deceive the people. .The Prime Minister accepted this agreement as best that he could obtain from the State Premiers.,36
233,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And they accepted it as the best that they could obtain the Prime Minister.,36
234,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Exactly . I fail to see why the Government should make passing of this Bill vital to their existence.,36
235,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It will not be passed they do.,36
236,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is my belief, and it is for that reason that I urge orable members when before their constiwhen tuents to express their own individual opinions as to the wisdom of the proposed amendment in the Constitution. My obbeen jection to the agreement the amount which, it provides shall be returned to the States. Indeed, if it were only temporary, I should oppose it on the ago. ground that the amount proposed to be returned is too small. By accepting this payment of 25s. per annum per head of the population the States will dislocate whole of their finances. The Premier New South Wales made that plain a few days ago, and the Premier of Queensland also did so. ' Mr Wilks - TSTe w South Wales for first year or two will lose £1,250,000 annum.",36
237,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so. Mr. Watt, the Treasurer of Victoria, has expressed the opinion that the finances of subdivision of large estates. this State will be dislocated under the arrangement. The Conference should have 'drawn up a temporary agreement under which a larger sum would have been turnable to the States. I approach sideration of this question from the of view, not of the Commonwealth versus the States, but of what is best in the terests of the people. This Parliament presents the people of all the we should, if possible, arrive at an agreement that will be beneficial to them, avoid the imposition of unnecessary taxawould tion. If new taxation is to be imposed time. it should be levied, not by the States, but by the Commonwealth. The functions of the States should be reduced, and as those of the 'Commonwealth increase, its expenditure must grow, and any additional cantaxation that may be necessary should will therefore be imposed by the Commonwealth. I deplore this agreement chiefly for the reason that its acceptance will Opmean that we shall never be able - to bring about the consolidation of the State debts. the The Prime Minister will doubtless disagree with that view, and will tell us, when he introduces the Bill relating to State debts, that under it he will be able from to make arrangements for their transfer. Although I have never known the honourable gentleman to pose as a financial authe thority-and he has not held office as Treasurer of the Commonwealth or of a unless State-it would be foolish for me to attempt!, to pit my views against his. In doing so I might lay myself open to a honcharge of being extremely self-satisfied in reality I am not. But it would have been far better had an arrangement been made whereby the States would have relieved of the necessity of imposing is not based on further taxation.",36
238,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That was the Prime Minister's own proposition about four months,36
239,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so. The Treasurer of Victoria recently stated in the Legislative Assembly that this agreethe ment made it necessary for the Governof ment to propose further State taxation, and he referred to it as one of the reasons fr,r the proposal of the Victorian Government to impose a land tax. Whilst I the admit that we ought to obtain revenue per from a tax on land, my desire is that such a tax shall be imposed by the Commonwealth, not so much for the purpose of also obtaining revenue, as to bring about the I believe new that fresh taxation is necessary, but that it should be imposed only by this Parliament. If the States are not to impose remore taxation, it will be necessary to rethe conturn to them more than 25s. per annum point per head of their population; but the Slate Parliaments are so tenacious of their in-, sovereign rights that they are not prepared reto relax in the slightest degree the hold States, and they have upon the people.",36
240,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If they allowed the Comand monwealth to take over their debts, they not transfer their assets at the same",36
241,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My surprise is that, in the interests of the people, an arrangement was not made for the transfer of the debts of the States to the Commonwealth. If we had arranged for their transfer, and for the return to the States of a larger sum, to be used wholly in paying interest on their debts, as at the time of transfer, and in providing for necessary sinking funds, those debts would have been wiped out in due time, and the States would still have retained possession of the works in respect of which a large propor.tion of their indebtedness was incurred. The people themselves have always looked forward to the growth of a broad national feeling, and I regret that this agreement .will perpetuate the individuality of the States, and impress upon the people for all time the stamp of provincialism. Those who favour the agreement say that if the people can provide for its embodiment in the Constitution now, they will have power later on, if they so desire, to eliminate it from the Constitution.",37
242,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the three smaller States could block such an amendment of the Constitution.,37
243,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is the trouble. I fear that the majority of honourable members of this House, aided by the State Premiers, and those who cry aloud for State Rights, will be able to secure the amendment of the Constitution as proposed; but that it will be much more difficult to eliminate these provisions from it later on, if they prove to be unsatisfactory. This Parliament is elected on the broadest possible franchise, but that is not the position with regard to the Parliaments of the States. Adult suffrage exists in connection with the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, but we must not lose sight of the fact that most of the Upper Houses of the State Parliaments are elected on a limited franchise. The Legislative Council of New South Wales is a nominee Chamber.",37
244,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The franchise is not very limited in the case of the Legislative Council of Victoria.,37
245,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I can hardly expect the honourable member for Mernda to agree with me on that point, because, while I have been fighting for some twenty-one years to reduce the property qualification for the Victorian Legislative Council, the honourable member has been working in the other direction;' and he is quite justified in doing so from his stand-point in politics. I agree that the nominee Legislative Council of New South Wales may be just ai democratic as the elective Upper Houses in the other States, and possibly more so, because nominee Houses can, as vacancies occur, be recruited from the democratic representatives in another place. In Victoria, however, with a limited franchise, there is no chance to democratize the Upper House; and anything done by that Chamber must have the taint of Conservatism. A - per capita basis is the only one on which Tasmania can ever get a fair share of the Customs and Excise revenue, though I know that an arrangement has been made to give that State a certain amount when Victoria disgorges what she has received over and above her fair share. While the per capita arrangement may not be perfect, it is the.best available ; and Victoria will always be the distributing centre for Tasmania. Under the proposed agreement, we should still have six States borrowing at their own sweet will; and if the Conservative section of this House continues to predominate, the Commonwealth will also adopt a borrowing policy.",37
246,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,All on this side are not in favour of borrowing.,37
247,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know; but when the whip is cracked, honourable members opposite will vote as directed. The honourable members behind the Government do not agree with much that has been done here during the last few days, although they are of the Government party.",37
248,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member has no right to say that.,37
249,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Honourable members have so expressed themselves in the House. Recognising that the Prime Minister has made the best arrangement he could, according to his lights, those honourable members are supporting the agreement, even though they do not approve of it. The strongest reason I have for opposing the agreement is that I am an industrial Protectionist, and would pro-, hibit the importation of all goods that can be manufactured here, while admitting free all that we cannot ourselves produce. The proposed agreement, if carried out, will prevent our ever having a scientific Tariff or a real industrial fiscal policy, and will, for revenue reasons, necessitate the reduction of high duties, and the imposition of duties on commodities which are at present admitted free. My object, as a Protectionist, is to prevent goods from coming here; but if we are to have revenue there must be importation.",37
250,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member does not desire that we shall have any revenue from Customs?,38
251,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No doubt we reBut quire revenue, in order to make the paythe ment to the States, and to finance Combelieve monwealth affairs.",38
252,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we do not pay the States, where are they to get revenue?",38
253,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I agree that the payment to the States is not enough; and my objection to the arrangement is that is permanent, instead of temporary. One of the hest things we ever did was the abolition of revenue duties representing some £400,000, in connection with the cotat ton items on the Tariff; but honourable members will remember how the honourable member for Hume, who was then Treaof surer, almost cried when that step was taken. If the agreement with the Prenot miers is carried out, these duties will have to be reimposed.",38
254,Mr ARCHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Their removal was they simply a present to the merchants, beas cause cotton is not a bit cheaper.",38
255,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We cannot go into that question now; but the honourable fcer knows that the price of cotton has creased all over the world during the last summation - of the agreement. two cr three years, and that is why got no immediate benefit from the aboliprotest tion of the duties. The application of duty must always make a commodity dearer, unless we have local manufacmoment ture; and, in proof of that, I could, i permitted, cite many instances. Under the proposed agreement, it will to obtain revenue from Customs duties, and 'the free list will have to be entirely suspended, and duties of 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, collected, with the result of wiping out manufactures in Australia. The honourable member for Capricornia is of opinion that it would be just as well posedif the duties on cotton goods were reimposed, seeing that the people are getting the commodities no' cheaper under a free list; but I know the honourable member to be a Revenue Tariffist. The honourable member for Robertson, the honourable placing member for Lang, or the honourable memposing ber for North Sydney would not, I am sure, be willing to see duties imposed these goods for revenue purposes, or, must have changed their opinions very much during the last twelve months. I not wish to labour the question, but merely to place my protest on record. I shall take the opportunity during the coming election to place my opinions before the people of Victoria, and I am sure that all those on this side will do the same. I should like honourable members on other side, who in their hearts do not in this Bill, but who are going to support it - I do not say for party purposes so much as because they feel that they must stand by the Government in the present state of affairs-to advise the people during the election campaign as to it the grave danger of altering the Constitution to give effect to the arrangement arrived at by the Prime Minister and other Federal Ministers with the State Premiers the recent Melbourne Conference. There will be no disloyalty on their part if they do that. I also hope that the newspapers Australia will be true to the Australian sentiment which they profess to share, and be influenced by narrow parochial considerations of what is best at present for their own particular States. I trust that will take a broad view of the question it affects the future of Australia. In fact, I feel certain that, while they may be strongly in favour of the Government proposal themselves, they will lay bememfore the public clearly and truly the indangers that will arise from the conAs an we industrial Protectionist, - I enter my against the Bill, and utter a warna ing to my fellow Protectionists-no t that they need any warning from me-that the the arrangement is perpetuated, it f will sound the death-knell of the manufacture of Australian goods for consumption be necessary by the Australian people. Debate (on motion by Mr HARPER) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. Motion (by Sir JOHN FORREST) proThat the House do now adjourn.",38
256,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Coolgardie) [3.10] - I .do not know what the Government really think about the position in which they are themselves, but their action in prothe adjournment of the House at 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon, when memon bers who have to travel cannot get their they trains until about 5 o'clock, shows the hypocrisy of their professions of a desire do to get on with public business. The Government have been using the gag this morning, and used it last night with loud protestations that they desired to get on with the business of the country, but they refuse to take this opportunity to go on with business in the middle of the afternoon. Honourable members who wish to go to Adelaide cannot leave Melbourne before 4.30, while those who are going to Sydney cannot leave until 5 o'clock. There is time for a member to deliver a speech of one hour and a half on the important question of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States, and I take it that the honourable member for Mernda believes that he will deliver an important speech; yet the Government at this hour actually move the adjournment of the debate and the adjournment of the House, for I take it that the honourable member for Mernda did not move the adjournment of the debate without the concurrence of the Government.",38
257,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I informed the Government that I intended to do so.,39
258,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member must have moved it with the concurrence of the Government, or he could not have secured the adjournment. I point out the inconsistency, if I cannot call it hypocrisy, of the Government, in pretending that they desire to proceed with public business, and at the same time agreeing to the request of one of their supporters to adjourn the debate at so unreasonably early an hour. When a point of order of the highest importance to the privileges and safety of honourable members was being discussed this morning, the Government were so anxious to conclude the debate that they applied the closure. Yet now, when we have an opportunity to continue the debate on the financial relationship of the Commonwealth and the States- a matter of the utmost importance to the people of the Commonwealth",39
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the honourable member refer to the High Commissioner Bill, the completion of which the Opposition has just blocked ?",39
260,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the honourable member think that, in face of the unreasonable attitude which the Government adopted towards those who wanted to discuss that Bill, we were called upon to allow the Standing Orders to be infringed to let them pass it through ?",39
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We might have got it to the Senate on Tuesday.,39
262,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does not that interjection show the hollowness of the Government's pretence that they desire to proceed with business? The Minister would know, if he were acquainted with the proceedings of Parliament, that the Senate stands adjourned for a fortnight. Apparently he wants the High Commissioner Bill sent up ten days before the Senate reassembles. The question of the financial relationship of the Commonwealth and the States ought to be fully debated, and every honourable member who wishes to address himself to it ought to have the fullest opportunity of being heard, because the public desire the most ample information upon it. It is certainly the most important question that has come before honourable members during this Parliament, because the decision on that Bill will settle whether or not the Commonwealth will have financial freedom in the future, and yet the Government allow the debate on it to be adjourned at 3 o'clock in the afternoon ! The Prime Minister, in introducing the subject the other day, said- "" Finance is government, and government is finance."" That was not an original observation, but it was new enough for the Prime Minister. At all events, it was a good statement.",39
263,Mr CROUCH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On e that the honourable member has recollected.,39
264,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , and one with which I was well acquainted long before I heard the Prime Minister use it. When we are considering financial proposals that will make or mar the progress of the Commonwealth for years to come, and when every honourable member should have an opportunity of expressing his opinions, how are we treated by the Government? We have the adjournment of the House moved at ten minutes past 3 o'clock on Friday afternoon at the request of a Government supporter, and I suppose that the Opposition will be gagged on Tuesday. The honourable member for Corio will, of course, address himself to the question, and then I suppose he will move the gag upon those who wish to follow him. This Government have taken a particular fancy to the gag. They seem to think that honourable members on this side should be gagged whenever they endeavour to speak. Before the gag is moved today, however, there are two or three things to which I wish to refer. While grievances were being debated yesterday, I was prevented from expressing myself. I - shall therefore take the present opportunity, unless the Government gag me before I have said what I desire.",39
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It seems that the honourable member wants to be gagged. He keeps on asking for it.,40
266,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister for Defence can accept my assurance that he will never hear me squeal about being gagged.,40
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I quite believe that.,40
268,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Furthermore , the honourable gentleman can take it from me that he will get the gag jammed down his throat as soon as I get my way with a majority. I promise him that: This Government has done a thing which I do not hesitate to say is beneath contempt. The other day the Treasurer took the meanest possible way of trying to throw on to the Opposition the responsibility for the fact that the public servants throughout the Commonwealth were not paid their salaries on the day when they were due. Does the Treasurer say now that he believes we were responsible for the delay ?",40
269,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , I do.",40
270,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not only has the right honourable member made the statement, but General. he now says that he believes it. I am prepared to admit that a man in his present frame of mind can believe anything. During the last five minutes he has been enduring the denunciation of his colleagues for having dared to move the adjournment. Now, the Supply Bill was presented on 14th of the present month. The Bill was so frequently. passed through all its stages inside of four hours. It was sent to the other Chamber, and passed through all its stages there the same day, 15th September.",40
271,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It ought to gone through in five minutes.,40
272,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The right honourable is member, with his twenty-five years' Parliathing said. mentary experience, knows very well that four hours is not an unduly long time to spend upon a Supply Bill. The following telegram, however, ,has been day from Adelaide:Federal salaries-usually paid on 14th and 15th each month not paid yet. No instructions received from Treasury to pay. Delay attriasked buted to obstruction of Supply Bill .",40
273,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear; the before. blame has got on to the right shoulders this time.",40
274,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Minister who will wealth. assume responsibility for that statement looking at me. will say anything, and has absolutely consideration for veracity if he repeats it.",40
275,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! The honorit. able member must not make a statement of that kindI ask him to withdraw it.,40
276,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Well , Mr Speaker, if the statement which I have made is out of order. I do withdraw it.",40
277,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member inform us who sent the telegram?,40
278,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes . It was sent by the honourable member for Adelaide to the Leader of the Opposition. He concludes his messages in these termsCall attention to this matter and check Ministerial machinations. Well may the honourable member ask that attention should be drawn to such an outrageous statement. The facts of the case are well known to all honourable members. The Supply Bill was passed in this House on the very day when it was presented. The Standing Orders were suspended in order to enable it to be passed.,40
279,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We had to send the Bill for the Royal assent, the honourable member must recollect.",40
280,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The right honourable member now wishes to blame the Governor,40
281,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not.,40
282,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This is rank disloyalty.,40
283,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I point out to the Treasurer that he has moved the motion for the adjournment of the House. If he continues to speak he will close the the debate. I must ask him not to interrupt,40
284,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In the first instance the Treasurer endeavoured to throw the on blame upon the members of the Opposition. Now he wants to shelter himself have by blaming the Governor General.,40
285,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is an outrage. This the first time. I have ever heard such a,40
286,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Treasurer seems to indicate that the Governor General's assent to the Bill has not been forthcoming withreceived toin a reasonable time.,40
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,40
288,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On several occasions yet this session Ministers have come down and the leave of the House to do certain things which ought to have been done Now, what is the position with! regard to the payment of the salaries of public servants throughout the CommonI see the Minister of Defence Let him move that the no question be now put if he likes.",40
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I never thought of,40
290,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have not the slightest objection if the Government think it well to apply ""the gag, and conclude the business of the day at 10 minutes past 3 o'clock. If they think they can mislead the public by applying the gag, they are at liberty, so far as I am concerned to do so as often as they please. They may hear some objections to its use, but they will not hear any squealing from this side.",40
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I quite believe that.,41
292,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-We appear now to have reached such a stage in the transaction of public business that the Treasurer, knowing that payments must be made on the 15th of the month, brings down a SupplyBill to meet them on the 14th. The Government were aware that the Senate would not be sitting until the 15th, and they delayed the introduction of the Bill until it became impossible to pass it before the salaries of the public servants became due. Then they adopted the miserable pretence of blaming the Opposition, and now we have the Treasurer attempting to cast a veiled responsibility for the delay upon the Governor General.",41
293,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who cannot protect himself.,41
294,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The last Supply Bill was brought down on the 29th of June-befor e the month had run out.,41
295,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"So it ought to have been.. If a man has to meet obligations on the first of the month, surely he will not wait until then to make the necessary financial arrangements for the purpose?",41
296,Mr CROUCH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Le t the honourable member continue his speech on Tuesday. . Mr Frazer - The honourable'member will hear all I desire to say today.,41
297,Mr CROUCH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I want to leave.,41
298,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The dignity and intellectual standard of the House would not suffer if the honourable member were to leave for ever. I think it is probable that he will leave for a term when an opportunity is presented to his constituents to deal with him.,41
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think the honourable member has said that of every honourable member on this side.,41
300,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have said it of five honourable members, whom I do not expect to see again returned to this House.",41
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It has been said by various honourable members opposite of every honourable member on this side.,41
302,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If honourable members on the Government side got their deserts it would be true of them all. As we have to deal with probabilities, the statement be applied only to a limited number, of whom the honourable member for Corio is one. I wish to refer to the administration of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Honourable members opposite laugh when the necessities of old-age pensioners are referred to. They gagged the honourable member for Melbourne when he was trying to put forward the case of some of the old-age pensioners. If the pension of a Judge were in question, we should find the gold medallist of the Royal Geographical Society taking a very keen interest in it. When we find that many of the aged people of Australia are being denied the old-age pensions to which they are entitled, because they have been thrifty, and have paid something into a miners' provident fund, some explanation should be afforded by those responsible for the administration of the Act. The Treasurer is aware that its administration in Western Australia has been anything but satisfactory. Very few of the applicants for pensions in that State have been able to secure a satisfactory adjustment of their claims.",41
303,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How many have not been attended to?,41
304,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Quite a large number. By every mail we learn that applicants have been unable to satisfy those who are taking too stringent a view of the provisions of the law. Mr HUME COOK:- I would not use the same telegram for all the Departments.,41
305,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not wish to have anything at all to say to the Government Whip. I am addressing the Treasurer in connection with a matter which seriously affects a number of electors in Western Australia. It is a matter of much greater importance than whether the clock points to half-past 3 or half-past 4. Instructions should be given to those who are responsible for the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act in Western Australia, that proof of the age of applicants need not be submitted .by formal document. A person seventy years of age, who is a native of another country, and has lived in Australia for a number of years, separated from his relatives, has the greatest possible difficulty in producing the documentary proof that he was born on a certain day. The neglect to do so is being used against eligible claimants for old-age pensions in Western Australia at the present time.",41
306,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable can member might mention some cases.,41
307,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I mentioned a case to the Commissioner yesterday, and communications regarding two or three other's have come to hand today. I desire to direct public attention to the matter, because there noon. is a growing suspicion that the Treasurer is not sympathetic in his administration of the Act.'",42
308,Mr ARCHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have found the right honourable gentleman very sympathetic.,42
309,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then the honourable member has had an unusual experience. - There are many on this side who are prepared to say that they have found him extremely unsympathetic.,42
310,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who are they? Let us have their names.,42
311,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member for Newcastle is one.,42
312,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have said a good many times that I have done all I could for the honourable member.,42
313,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do ""not accuse the right honourable gentleman of being personally interested in the robbing of these people of their just rights under Commonwealth legislation. I contend that it is important that the Act should be liberally interpreted and administered. I wished to say something about the mail services on the south-east coast of Western Australia. There is much justification for ment felt by people living on that coast at the manner in which the mail service between Albany and Eucla is being conducted. A steamer was provided, towards the cost of which a certain sum of money was contributed by the Western Australian Govei'nment. Unfortunately, the vessel was disabled, and one quite unsuitable for the service has been put on temporarily to take her place If the Postmaster-General were present, I should like to have heard him on the matter. I suppose that, in anticipation of an early adjournment, the honourable gentleman has gone home. I do not care to refer to the matter in his absence, but it is one of the questions which I intended to bring forward yesterday afternoon, if honourable members on this side had not been; gagged in their efforts to ventilate grievances. I ask the Government whether they feel satisfied with their achievement of today. They professed a desire to get on with public business. They got rid of the most important question in connection with the Standing Orders which has been before the House for many months. They closed a debate by applying the gag. But as soon as they got. to the serious business of the day-the adjustment of the financial relations-the y asked for leave to go home at io minutes past 3 o'clock on Friday afterWe have been sitting since half past 10 o'clock with an adjournment of an hour and a-quarter for lunch. One hour of arduous labour tired a Government which wants to get on with business, and then they moved the adjournment of the House.",42
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We were at work late last night.,42
315,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable gentleman was at work late last night, but he would have been at a more advanced stage with business today, if he had not kept the House sitting so late. I believe that if the Government were to adopt a more reasonable attitude in regard to suggestions from this side, business would be proceeded with very much earlier than it is. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the High Commissioner Bill should be brought forward. On his special request it was made One of the prominent planks of the Government programme for the session.",42
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then the honourable member admits that he has been obstructing business?,42
317,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not admit or sugthe resent- gest anything of the kind.,42
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It looks as though the honourable member does. Mr Frazer,-The honourable gentleman can draw any inference he likes, and no one is more competent to draw inferences to suit himself than he is. There was a unanimous desire on this side of the Chamber to assist the passage of the High Commissioner Bill, of course with reasonable discussion as to the merits of the clauses.",42
319,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,For how many hours was it discussed?,42
320,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister knows that it was not discussed for more than eight or nine hours altogether.,42
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is entirely wrong.,42
322,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable gentleman look up the facts and see whether my statement is wrong or not?,42
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is wrong.,42
324,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . The Opposition, I repeat, were desirous of passing the measure after reasonable discussion. Further than that, we wanted an appointment to be made when it was passed, 'but the Government did not want that.",42
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not dispute that. I only disagree with the honourable member as to what is reasonable discussion.,43
326,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable gentleployment man talked for so many_ hours when he in Opposition that if he hears an honortractor able member speaking now for five-minutes from this side he thinks that his old is being played; but we have no desire do that. We passed the Bill within reasonable time. We were gagged today by a Government which professes a desire to go on with business, but their profesa sions can only be taken as rank hypocrisy when they are presented to the people of this country.",43
327,Mr COON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Batman) [3.39] - I agree with the honourable member for Kalof goorlie respecting the question of old-age with business. pensions, because the regulations must been drawn up by a Ministry formed from the members of the Legislative Council Victoria in its most Conservative time.",43
328,Mr CROUCH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What Ministry brought the regulations?,43
329,Mr COON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Fisher Ministry. The regulations were drawn up, in my .opinion, with a view to prohibit persons from getting pensions, and there is no liberal interpreful, tation of them. I venture to say that Ministry composed of the rankest Conserof vatives in Australia would not have drawn up such regulations. On nearly every day they are condemned by the party which was cers was introduced late. responsible for their adoption. The party which was in power for the purpose of aseven sisting the aged and the poor were sible for framing regulations for which parallel cannot be found in any part of world. On that point I am at one with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. think that the earliest opportunity should be taken to amend the regulations in a the Senate. liberal fashion, so that they shall be less complicated than they are. I shall gladly give my vote in that direction. that the Government will soon bring into force regulations of a more liberal characpresentations ter. I desire to bring under the notice the Acting Leader of the House, in the absence of the Postmaster-General, the case of a number of men who are registered the Commonwealth office for employment occurred. in Victoria. It has been asserted that a member of the Opposition has been enthing deavouring to get the Postmaster-General to insert a new clause respecting the wages to be paid for contract labour. I trust the Ministry will not agree to the employ the ment of that kind of labour. I think that [129] the work should be done by day labour. If it is done by contract the result will be that the 300 men who are now registered for emwill have no opportunity of getwas ting work, because very likely the conwill select his own men. In order to give the men an opportunity of obtaining game employment, I ask the Acting Leader of to the House to convey to the Postmastera General or the head of his Department the wish that, if possible, this work shall IXJ done by day labour, because that will be means cf affording all these men an opportunity of getting employment.",43
330,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay) [3-43]-The Government have taken an unusual course today, first in suppressing the discussion business and then in declining to proceed It is most unusuai that have gentlemen who assemble here to conduct business should be treated in that fashion. of But that is nothing compared with the unusual lapse of the Treasurer regarding the in payment of public officers. Through their agencies-pres s and other-the Government have attempted to make the grossest misrepresentation as regards the position of the Opposition. They have been successso far, in the dissemination of false a information, undoubtedly to the detriment the public interests. It has been clearly proved from the records that the Bill for the payment of the salaries of public offiI t was passed through this House within four hours, and, if those hours had been saved, the Goresponvernment would haye gained nothing, a because the Senate was not sitting, and the therefore the Bill could not have become law on that day. These are the absolute I facts.",43
331,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It was delayed in,43
332,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It went through in one I trust day in the Senate.,43
333,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The outrageous misreof the press, supported by of honourable members opposite, are as nothing to the statement of the Treasurer today that the representative of His Majesty the at King is the cause of the delay which has",43
334,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I did not say any of the kind, and the honourable member knows it. He is misrepresenting me.",43
335,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In reply to a question that by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Treasurer clearly stated that the reason why the wages of the public servants could not be paid was that the Bill had not received the Royal Assent.",43
336,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I did not say anything of the kind.,44
337,Mr STORRER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The right honourable gentleman said that he had to get the Royal Assent.,44
338,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is the Royal Assent but the signature of the Governor General ?,44
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The right honourable gentleman did not say that that was the reason why there has been delay.,44
340,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If he had any purpose in making the statement which he made, it was, first, to show that the Opposition delayed the passing of the Bill-no t by blocking it, but by merely discussing its provisions-and , secondly, that there has been further delay through the Royal Assent not being obtained.",44
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The object was to show that the delay between the passing of the measure through both Houses and the securing of the Royal Assent was unavoidable.,44
342,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Ministry was responsible for it. Ministers should know exactly what the financial requirements of the Commonwealth are, when they must be met, and where the representative of the King is to be found, and they should provide for all contingencies. They are paid to do so.",44
343,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The mail train leaves at 5 o'clock every day.,44
344,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am inclined to think that the Governor General's assent to the Supply Bill might have been obtained by telegram. I do not propose to dogmatize regarding a constitutional point which I have not considered, but Ministers certainly know where the representative of the Crown is, so that the Bill could have been sent to him without dejay, and, if necessary, could have been introduced a day earlier. If the facts were put before an honest jury of citizens, to what conclusion would they come ? Only that the Government has no foundation for its charges against the Opposition. Why is not that admitted? It was my good fortune, in my early public life, to oppose a Government whose Ministers would have scorned to use subterfuge to shelter themselves from charges of maladministration or want of foresight. They accepted the responsibilities attaching to their offices; and I hope that we shall soon have in power here men who will observe the same standards of conduct. I wish now to refer to the statement of the honourable member for Batman, who created a good deal of laughter by asking, "" What Government drafted the old-age pensions regulations?"" They were drafted by the Go-' vernment of which I was the head, and, I admit, are strict, but they do not reflect in any way on any applicant. The desire was to obtain the fullest information regarding the claims of applicants. I knew when I assented to them that they were severe, but as a strong supporter of the principle of old-age pensions I wished to prevent the slightest abuse at its initiation. No worse service could be done to the people than by allowing abuses to creep in under looce administration.",44
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Honourable members opposite have complained that the regulations are not just.,44
346,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Who has done so? Mr GROOM.^-The honourable member for Melbourne, for one.",44
347,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He has complained about the number of questions to be answered, and the difficulty of filling up the forms. I anticipated such complaints, and have been surprised that there have not been many more. The honourable member for Batman said that if an honourable member on this side moved to have the regulations altered, he would support the motion. The honourable gentleman either lacks knowledge of what is necessary to secure the alteration of the regulations, or seeks to misrepresent the position. If the regulations are too stringent, they can be altered by Executive act, and the alteration could take place tomorrow. After three months' experience of the working of the Act, the Treasurer should know better than any member of the Opposition whether the regulations should be altered. Did honourable members think that a Labour Government would allow abuses to creep into the administration of a measure of this kind, when it was their bounden duty to protect the interests of the public, and of pensioners? It was best to have the regulations severe in the first instance. They can be modified as experience suggests. As a matter of fact, they are not so severe as to prevent the number of ' pensioners in every State from having increased, though, happily, the number has not largely increased.",44
348,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Surely the honourable memquestions ber does not regard it as a happy thing that the aged poor are increasing in bers?,45
349,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , but we are happy that more of those who need pensions able to get them.",45
350,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I take full responsiof bility for the regulations. The statistics show that under them the number sioners has largely increased in all the States. Mr HUGHES. - In Victoria the increase tered ? numbers 4,200 pensioners.",45
351,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think it is really greater than that. The most liberal State Old-age Pensions Act was that of QueensThe land, but even there the number of sioners has considerably increased under Commonwealth administration. If , hownition ever, the regulations need altering, the Treasurer can alter them in a day. Act, In addition to framing these regulations, which - are considerably stricter than might desire them to be under other cumstances, the Government of which had the honour to be the head instructed all the public officers of the Commonwealth to assist old-age pensioners in their claims, and even went so far as to pay half-a-dozen clerks in Victoria to undertake this class of work. I am glad that the honourable gentleman for Batman has returned to the chamber. T wish to say that the authorship of the regulations not in doubt. They were drafted by the late Government in a strict form for protection of the pensioners themselves.",45
352,Mr COON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the regulations the pensioners.,45
353,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They were drafted in strict form so as to prevent the possibility of abuse at the initiation of a great undercharitable. taking.,45
354,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the regulations have been proved to be faulty, why do not the Government alter them?",45
355,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Treasurer can after alter them in a day if he so desires. honourable member for Batman has spoken about the necessity for submitting motions to that end. Such a course of procedure is entirely unnecessary. When the Sugar Bounty Act became operative very severe regulations were framed in order to prevent the undeserving from profiting by that legistions. lation. That was the sole object in view. I shall be glad if the Treasurer can devise any method of reducing the number of known [129]- 2 that are put to applicants whilst simultaneously conserving the interests of numthe country. We must not lose sight of the fact that if these regulations are drawn loosely persons may obtain pensions who are are not entitled to them. We might thus create a public feeling against the payment pensions. I , am glad to know that in every State, and particularly in Victoria, there has been a large - increase in the numof penber of successful applications.",45
356,Mr COON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think that the regulations should be al,45
357,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not in possession of any information that would enable me to answer the honourable member's question. Treasurer ought to be in possession of penthat information. So far as I know, the regulations have not prevented the recogof any legitimate claim. Of course I cannot defend the administration of the because that has been entirely in the hands of the Government. The Ministry one of which I was the head vacated office cirbefore the Act became operative, so that I if any fault is to be found with its administration it belongs solely to the Government of which the honourable member filling in for Batman is a supporter.",45
358,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) U . i ] - I should like to ask the Minister of Defence, who is now leading the House, how long the majority of honourable members are to is allow the sufferings of the aged poor of Australia to be made a subject for political the advertisement by a certain section.",45
359,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does not the honourable member think that that insinuation isunforget charitable as well as mean?,45
360,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that the tactics a which are being resorted to by honourable members opposite are both mean and unThe Leader of the Oppositionhas admitted the authorship of the regulations under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act-regulation s which have been the subject of attack by the Opposition day day. Yet the Treasurer has been held The up to public hatred and ridiculed as the administrator of a set of inhuman regulations which no loyal Labour Government would dream of framing 1 We now at last have the confession of the honourable member for Wide Bay that he himself is responsible for the drafting of those regulaI am justified in asking the Minister of Defence how long we are to be subjected to this sort of tactics. It is well that a new state of affairs has arisen in the conduct of the business of this House. One method that is adopted by my honourable friends opposite, and which 'strikes me as being a singularly petty one, is to endeavour to subject the Government to humiliation and difficulty by discussing motions for adjournment about the time that the trains leave for thg adjacent States, and Ministerial supporters desire to quit this building for their homes. In the view of the fact that the Government know what is going on",45
361,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-Does not everybody know it? . Mr KELLY - Everybod y knows it, including the honourable member who is a prime mover in these tactics. The time has arrived when the Government should see that within a reasonable time after the motion for the adjournment of the House being moved, debate upon it shall be closured, so that the business of this Chamber may be brought to an end with fitting decorum and despatch. I make this suggestion in regard to future action. I do not say that it should be adopted on the present occasion. My honourable friends have already talked at considerable length, thereby hoping to submit the .Government to a certain amount of inconvenience. But I may tell them that they cannot succeed in their endeavours this afternoon. I make them a gift of that information. If the Government have any regard for the proper conduct bf business, they will see that' this new method of conducting political warfare is properly countered by an arrangement for. the closuring of debate upon the motion for adjournment after a reasonable time has elapsed.",46

I had arranged to bring it forward yesterday, but as the Government saw fit, in accordance with the policy which has been advocated by the honourable member for Wentworth, of closuring the discussion uppn grievances I was prevented from doing so. Consequently I have no option but to mention it at this late and inconvenient hour. I regret that the Minister of . Home Affairs is not present, because the matter is one which relates to his Departtcent. ' Mr ATKINSON - I beg to call attention to the state of the House. ..
