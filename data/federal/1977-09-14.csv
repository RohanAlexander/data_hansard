The Acting Clerk-Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Private Nursing Homes: Pensioner Patients To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the pensioners health benefit card, have suffered undue hardship as inmates of private nursing homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as laid down. Many pensioners whose spouse was an inmate of the private nursing homes suffered poverty in an endeavour to sustain their partner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the tribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of life and death to pensioners, but because of the cost of installation phone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very little else to live on and are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the tralian Government as a matter of urgency to1. Make sure that subsidies paid to private nursing homes are such that each pensioner holding a pensioners health benefit card will pay the private nursing home no more than the statutory minimum patient contribution, which will allow six dollars per week to be retained by the pensioner patient for their personal use. 2. That a pensioner holding a pensioner health benefit card shall have a telephone installed free very nominal charge. 3. That those pensioners who have only very little else to live on, shall receive a subsidy to assist them. The subsidy to be governed by a means test.

3,Dr KLUGMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister who will be aware that the Public Service Board in its annual report for 1977 commented that the restrictions imposed on Pubhc Service staff ceilings had adversely affected operations of the Commonwealth Employment Service, Northern Territory Hospitals, the administration of changes to the pensions means test and the processing of unemployment benefits. The Prime Minister will be aware also that the Auditor-General, in his report tabled yesterday, estimated that $50m had been misappropriated through overpayments of the unemployment benefit and that, because of inadequate staff resources, none of those payments had been recovered. I ask the Prime Minister: As these reports suggest that the arbitrary staff ceilings applied by the Government are causing gross inefficiencies in the Public Service and the wasting of millions of dollars of taxpayers money, will he give an undertaking to review the projected staff ceilings announced by the Treasurer in the Budget, which imply a further reduction in the current financial year of more of Australia respectfully than 3,000-o r about 1 per cent-in the number of pubhc servants? If he will not give that undertaking, does the Government intend to forgo funcuons or tc reduce standards of service as the PubUc Service Board suggests will be necessary if these ceilings are applied?",16
4,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"I think it would be a good idea if honourable gentlemen kept various aspects of these particular matters separate and did not attribute the wrong causes to the wrong results. On a careful reading of the report of the Auditor-General it will appear to all honourable members, I believe, that the main reasons for the overpayment of the unemployNotice of Motion ment benefit were procedures, that also it was noted that the procedures had in fact been changed and that the changes were announced in the Budget. Attention was drawn to the fact that payments of the unemployment benefit were made two weeks in advance, whereas under the old arrangement they were made in arrears. It of magis- was the previous Administration which made the decision to make those payments in advance. It Act to was significantly as a result of those procedures that the situation to which the Auditor-General so properly drew attention arose. Let me emphasise also that the Norgard and Myer reports provided the framework for the action which was then taken. Also the Department of Social Security carried out an examination of the efficiency of the various methods and procedures adopted internally in the Department. These are all steps that had been taken before the publication of the report of the Auditor General. Therefore, while the Auditor-General's report certainly revealed a serious situation, I suggest that it was one in relation to which the Government had already responded. Let me give some further information to honourable members. As I am advised, over the course of the last year the staff ceilings for the Department of Social Security have increased by 8 per cent or 850 personnel, despite the fact that overall staff ceilings through the Public Service have been reduced by about 2 per cent. The staff ceilings are implemented on advice from an interdepartmental committee. The recommendations made have in fact been pursued. In no case did the Public Service Board advise me that existing staffing levels would result in inadequate control of payments made by the Department. In any case in which the PubUc Service Board, together with members of the interdepartmental committee, did recommend an increase in staff railings, such a recommendation was accepted. In addition to that, the PubUc Service Board some knows very well that there is an overriding requirement, in relation to the administration staff ceilings, that services to the pubUc are not be prejudiced as a result. I think if honourable members read the PubUc Service Board report accurately they willfindthat the Board is addressing itself to the prospect of cuts beyond those that have already been announced rather than to the staff ceilings that have already been effected. The most important element in this matter, course, is the substance brought forward in the Auditor-General's report which reveals that overpayments have been made. However, the Government has already taken action in relation to that matter and it is therefore well in hand. NA  Environment, Housing and Community ond report. Development seen or heard a statement which claimed that uranium and nuclear power is the address most violent source of energy known to husafe handling manity? Can the Minister say whether the statetechnology forofthewaste. ment is correct?",16
5,Mr NEWMAN,NUCLEAR POWER,"I welcome the question for asked by the honourable member for Brisbane. It raises issues which are important in this chamber and for Australians as a whole. I have seen statements by members of the Opposition, use particularly the one by the Deputy Leader of Opposition. There have been others including those by the Leader of the Opposition. There no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have is embarked on a wilful campaign to misrepresent, mislead, confuse and cause fear amongst the people of Australia. They are harsh words, but I shall give some examples. In the last two days the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made the statement referred to by the honourable member for Brisbane. It is quite false. In fact, the operthe ations of the nuclear industry around the world have a proven record which is such advice to this Government shows that no member of the pubUc has ever been injured the operauons of a nuclear generator. Of the technicians involved, only a handful have ever that. been involved in an accident. This compares thousands killed on the roads and hundreds gentleman killed by the pollution from coal-burning generators. Two Sundays ago the Leader of the Opposition made an address to the nation. The Prime Minister has already shown the dishonesty of of the things he said. I shall point out a few other dishonest statements. The Leader of the of Opposition misquoted the Ranger report in relato tion to waste. He misrepresented the true state of technology concerning the disposal of waste. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I did not.",17
6,Mr NEWMAN,NUCLEAR POWER,"I am wilUng to give the honourable member the examples. The Leader of the Opposition queries the statements about what the Ranger Commission said. He claimed in his address to the nation that Mr Justice Fox of recommended that no mining or export of uranium should take place until the safe disposal of waste had been solved. This is untrue. What Mr Justice Fox and his fellow commissioners said was that the present situation with waste was such that it did not justify a decision by Australia not to export uranium. If the Leader of the Opposition wants the references they are 178 of thefirstreport and page 2 of the secThe second misrepresentation he made in his was that there is no technology for the That is also untrue. The handling of high level radioactive waste exists. It is proven. The technology the solidification and vitrification of waste which will lead to ultimate disposal does exist and is being developed on a commercial scale. The vitrification and solidification process will boro-siticate material like this which I hold in the my hand. It will be encapsulated in containers which, of course, will be many times bigger than is this cube which I now show to the House.",17
7,Mr YOUNG,NUCLEAR POWER,I raise a point of order. Because it not a broadcast day could the Minister assist us by giving a proper description of the object he is holding mstead of referring to it as' this 1,17
8,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR POWER,"There is no point of order. I call upon the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development not to describe objects. His answer has already taken a considerable period of time. I think it is time he drew that all the it to a conclusion. through Mr NEWMAN-I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition would Uke me to do with Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable will not reflect on my ruling. It was I who asked the Minister to draw his answer to a conclusion.",17
9,Mr NEWMAN,NUCLEAR POWER,"Mr Speaker, I think I said enough to demonstrate that the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Leader of the Oppofrom sition nave embarked on this campaign to fuse and mislead. I am sure that the people Australia will see the campaign, panicularly the part of the Leader of the Opposition, for what it is- a sly fabrication",18

G. Whitlam- I ask a question of the course Prime Minister and I assure him that I have read the PubUc Service Board report tabled last week, the Auditor-General's report tabled yesterday staff and the Myers report tabled a few weeks ago. am anxious, as he adjured us, to keep the various aspects distinct. I ask the Prime Minister how can explain that, whilst there were no changes the procedures for making advance payment of unemployment benefits, there should have been an increase from $11.6m in 1975-76 in the overnot payments of those benefits to about $50m 1976-77. He will remember that I am quoting Also, from the Auditor-General's report aspect. I ask him how he explains that there should be an increase of about 330 per cent in the overpayments when there has been no August change in procedure in the two years. Next I ask him whether the Myers inquiry also vanced recommended that the aboUtion of advance payaggregate. ments of unemployment benefits should be accompanied by an aboUtion of the seven-day waiting period because, as Vice-Chancellor Myers said, the two measures fit hand in He said that fortnightly payments in arrears without aboUtion of the waiting period would cause hardship in the period before cheque was received. I also ask him: Will there be considerable confusion from 1 November next that will lead to many more millions dollars of overpayments this year since from date there will be two unrelated benefit ments systems operating, contrary to the mendations not only of Vice-Chancellor have but also of Mr Norgard and Professor Henderson? I therefore ask him, as my colleague Prospect asked him: Since the Treasurer conthis week has announced adjustments to the of Budget of four weeks ago where injustices were on found, will he also now announce that the projected ceilings on the Public Service, particularly in respect of the Commonwealth Employment benefits, and processing of unemployment will not be applied? I point out that on this aspect the PubUc Service Board has not only advised him but has advised the whole Parliament yesterday that if the ceilings which have been announced are in fact appUed, the Government should forgo functions or reduce standards or in Mr MALCOLM FRASER-Let me state again that the PubUc Service Board was addressing itself to cuts beyond those which had already Let me also state again that at no time in the course of the past year has the Board advised me, and I think at no time in the of the past year has it advised the Minister assisting me in PubUc Service matters, that overpayments could in any way be attributable to ceilings. Also I think it worth noticing that in I the situauon in which beneficiaries failed to notify within seven days their return to employhe ment, no action appeared to be taken to recover in payments made in advance for the days of the benefit period during which the beneficiary was employed. I understand that that action could be taken because of an amendment that had in been passed by the previous Administration. it is pointed out in the comments on the Deon that partment of Social Security: As mentioned in the Budget Speech delivered on 16 1977 the Government has decided that in future unemployment benefits will be paid fortnightly in arrears as it has become evident that the present arrangement for adpayments is producing a substantial over-payment in I would have thought that that paragraph from the report makes it perfectly plain what was the glove. cause. That cause has now been removed. the first SWEDISH PARLIAMENT DELEGATION",18

15,Mr BRADFIELD,SOCIAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT,I ask the Prime Minister question. What is the latest evidence of a substantial decline in the rate of inflation? How does this square with the aim expressed in 1976 single digit infiation figure?,19
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SOCIAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT,"The latest terly estimates of national income and ture which were released a few days ago reveal substantial and continuing process in the fight against inflation. If we compare the June quarter 1977 with the June quarter 1976 we see that inflation as measured by the implicit price deflaare tor for gross domestic product was 9.2 per cent. questions. As honourable gentlemen would know, this measure of inflation always included health costs. It did not make changes to health costs were measured because they at time were paid in one way and at another time aU. were paid for in another manner. As all honourable members know, that measure distorted utterly the consumer price index over the of that period. But the implicit price deflator gross domestic product indicated June 1977 on June 1976.",19
17,Mr SINCLAIR,SOCIAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT,A very good result too.,19
18,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SOCIAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT,"As my colleague remarks, it is a very good result. It is a remarkis able improvement on a comparablefigureof ducers' 16.2 per cent that had occurred vious year. Obviously that is an improvement of resource tax, whether the 7 per cent during the course of the year. Although I beheve all honourable gentlemen should take pleasure from that improvement, far as the Government is concerned the rate of inflation is still too high and the Government's policies will be pursued to bring inflation down much further. Such a decrease is necessary if business and employment in this country are to improve as I would hope all honourable gentlemen would want. But the impUcit price deflator which was published a few days ago is very real and accurate evidence of the success the Government's overaUfinancialpoUcies. NA",19

What has Australia done about making its views known on that subject?  on mutual military Umitations in the Indian Ocean between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics held in Moscow in June. This followed the disMinister cussions that Secretary of State Vance had in March on a total package regarding disarmaGovernment ment matters. The aim of the United States these discussions is to prevent any further up of US and Soviet military presences in Indian Ocean, to establish the status quo and perhaps later to reduce the current level of these rather presences. This mirrors the long standing pohcy of this Government.

35,Mr YOUNG,BUILDING SOCIETIES,I ask the Prime Minister Did the Government authorise the use of a VIP airof craft on Monday of this week to carry the Leader of the South Austrahan Liberal Party between Adelaide and Mount Gambier?,21
36,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,BUILDING SOCIETIES,I am not aware say of any suchflightbut I will be happy to make inquiries to see if there was such a flight. NA  Transport whether he is aware that the Kingscote Council on Kangaroo Island has suffered a reduction in road funds this year. The Minister will be aware of the difficultfinancialplight many local councils in South Australia and where in Australia in thefinancingof their road programs. Can the Minister inform the House whether local government in South Australia has a better deal from the Commonwealth in its 1977-78 road allocations than it the past? Can South Australian local government and the users of local roads look forward to increasingfinancialassistance for their road needs?,21
37,Mr NIXON,ROAD FUNDS TO SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"Since coming to office Government has made it quite plain that it wanted to see a lift in funds made available rural and urban local shires. A Bill will be introduced into the Parliament tomorrow in this regard. Two special provisions to increase the level of funding have been made to those areas in the last 12 to 18 months. In the Bill to come into the House tomorrow provision been made for an increase in funds to local cils for road construction. I point out that South Australia the increase in funds for urban local roads is 100 per cent and the increase in erly based. funds for rural local roads is 26.4 per cent from $5.3m to $6.7m. That supports what I have said-that there has been an increase in government aid to local councils and that this is the aim of the Government's pohcy. It is interesting to note that in South Australia the relative needs of local councils are not sidered to be very high. Apparently they do not rate any priority at aU because the South Ausas traUan Government has not aUocated any funds from its own resources to either rural or urban local shires. This must be thefirsttime in history that a State government has done something that. I am surprised that the South Australian Government should act in such a way and so I deter the capacity of local government associations and shires to complete the road constructions they want. The upshot of that is that in total VIP FLIGHT terms-that is the combination of Commonwealth and State moneys-as a result of the lack interest by the State government, 3.5 per cent less, in total terms, will be avaUable for expenditure on rural local road programs. I do not Uke being poltiical, as the House knows but I have to that this is an absolute indictment of the Dunstan Government for its attitude towards local government.",21

So far the question has not been propMr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, I think I shaU satisfy you. real Mr SPEAKER-It had better be done quickly. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Oh, yes. I ask the Prime Minister whether he gave an undertaking conto the Premier of Queensland that there is no intention to impose a resources tax in any area, the Premier stated in the Queensland Legislative Assembly last Thursday. Also, since the Premier has today reiterated-reiterat e was the word he used-the indication that the Prime Uke Minister gave to him when he spoke to him about resources taxes on coal, oU, uranium or whatever it is, I ask the Prime Minister whether he gave such an undertaking as the Premier has stated and has reiterated?",21
40,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PREMIER,"I think it would be a good idea if the House understood the full background of the conversation to which the Premier was referring. For some time the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government have been in negotiation about further development of the Gladstone power station. As those with an interest in Queensland will certainly be aware, for reasons which the Queensland Government judges to be good, the construction of that power station is now being processed over a longer period than originally envisaged in the agreement between the Commonwealth and Queensland. The Premier put it to the Commonwealth that we should extend our financial assistance to Queensland for the construction of the Gladstone power station over a further three years. After my discussions with my colleagues, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and with other Ministers, it was agreed that the Commonwealth should meet the wishes of the Queensland Government in relation to these matters. The Commonwealth will support Queensland in achieving an additional $25m in semi-government loans over a three year period. I think the greater part of that amount will be raised thisfinancialyear-abou t $16m.",22
41,Mr HAYDEN,PREMIER,"That belts your Budget around again, does it not?",22
42,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PREMIER,"Again the honourable gentleman shows his ignorance. Semi-government loans do not appear in the Government's budgetaryfigures.This scheme will add significantly to Queensland's capacity. I am sure the proposal was welcomed by the Premier of Queensland. Regarding the other elements of the honourable gentleman's question, let me say, as I have said on previous occasions, the statements of the Deputy Prime Minister in relation to a resource tax are correct. HOUSING: BUILDING SOCIETIES",22
43,Mr MACKENZIE,PREMIER,"I ask the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development a question. Does the Commonwealth provide funds to the States for building society advances? Is the Minister aware that building societies in New South Wales must inform borrowers that their loans are being provided from funds from the New South Wales Government? Does this condition reflect the true funding situation? Will the Minister ascertain whether the New South Wales Government wishes to continue in funding arrangements with the Commonwealth, such as the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement?",22
44,Mr NEWMAN,PREMIER,"I am aware of a direction by the New South Wales Government concerning funds provided to terminating building societies. Perhaps I should explainfirstlythe arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States regarding funds for the Home Builders Account. Honourable members will recall that under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement funds are made available to the States at an interest rate of 4Vi per cent and that 20 per cent to 30 per cent of those funds can be allocated to the Home Builders Account in each State. In 1977-78 New South Wales was given $128m under the Agreement, which means that 20 per cent or 30 per cent of that can go to the Home Builders Account. In addition, under previous arrangements money has been given to the States under the Agreement. New South Wales, I am informed, has $22m in a revolving fund. Early eachfinancialyear the State breaks up the money that it has in the Home Builders Account and allocates it to the various terminating building societies and the Rural Bank of New South Wales. Therefore it seems rather odd that the New South Wales Government is directing terminating building societies that when they onlend the borrowers should be told that the funds are coming from the New South Wales Government. If the New South Wales Government is doing that and if it is using funds provided under the Agreement, it is certainly grossly misleading to the borrowers and, I might say, damaging to the co-operative effort under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement between the Commonwealth and the Government of New South Wales. I suppose I would have to say that if the State Government is granting out of its own resources additional funds to the terminating building societies that is to be applauded. To sum up, I think the New South Wales Government should clarify this situation. If it is allocating funds in addition to those provided by us, it should make that clear. If it is using only our funds, that letter should be withdrawn and the true position made known to the borrowers. NUCLEAR WASTE: DISPOSAL Mr E. G. Whitlam-Did the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development hear or has he since been shown a transcript of the remarks made on AM yesterday by a committee chairman of the United States Congress to the effect that the United States had a staggering problem of both cost and environmental danger in regard to what to do with the temporarily stored nuclear waste much of which is in liquid form, something like lons of the stuff, which hasfifeof anywhere 1,000 years to 250,000 years'? Will the honourand able gentleman augment his efforts to curb memHouse bers of this Parliament by taking steps to curb as hashave foreigners who are guilty of such misrepresendrought the tation, dishonesty and sly fabrication?",22
45,Mr NEWMAN,PREMIER,That sort of insinuation the Leader of the Opposition is typical of what was accusing him of before. Mr E. G. Whitlam-You do not doubt the quotation?,23
46,Mr NEWMAN,PREMIER,"No , I am going to try to exment plain it to the honourable member, if he will give me a moment. The statement made on AM yesterday has been brought to my attention. not have a copy of the Congressional report which was quoted in the statement. I have issued directions that we should get a copy as soon as possible so that it can be studied. But I make this point about high level liquid wastes stored America: First, a distinction has to be drawn tween those wastes which have accrued from military processes in producing weapons and those which have accumulated as a result commercial operations of nuclear reactors. The facts of the matter are that only about 600,000 gallons of high level wastes have come from commercially operated nuclear plants and these are stored completely safely. There is question of the safety of their storage. So the great bulk of the liquid waste about which the honourable member was talking has resulted vided from military technology of the past. I see nothpayable ing incongruous or at odds with what I fore about the development of technology in regard to the ultimate disposal and handling of wastes. It is quite consistent with what I said before. NA NA",23
47,Mr GILES,AUSTRALIA,"Has the Minister for Primary arily Industry noticed a statement made by the Premters. ier of South Australia that $1.5m has now been spent by the South Austrahan Government drought relief in South Australia? Is that ment correct? How long a period can be coveredemployment. by a State applying for such Commonwealth Government reimbursement? Can employment schemes be counted in such expenditure? WUl the Federal Government, subject to the considerfails ations I have mentioned, be prepared to honour its previous agreement which, in the case of South Australia, depends on its originally spend74 million galing $ 1.5m on that basis? from Mr SINCLAIR-The honourable gentleman other South Australian members of this referred on a number of occasions, Government, to the very serious which exists in a number of areas in South Australia. However, it is regrettable that by the Premier and State Ministers of South I Australia persist in playing poUtics instead of worrying about the real position of those who are anected by the drought. In fact, to the best of my knowledge and the knowledge of the Treasurer, the Federal Government has received no notification from the South Australian Governwith respect to the expenditure under the just $1.5m program, within which program there would be some arrangement for reimbursement I do of funds spent above that amount. If that position does now pertain within South Australia and those funds have been spent in this financial year then ofcourse, in accordance with in the prevailing arrangements for assistance for benatural disasters, the Federal Government will be prepared to pick up the range of assistance proposals which are agreed to between the States of and the Commonwealth. There has been quite protracted discussion between State Ministers of Agriculture and, in some instances, other Ministers, regarding the detaUs of the program of acceptable works. The Federal Government does provide, for example, low interest funds which no can be passed on by State governments to enable producers to finance their operations at a very significant discount. Indeed, the money is proat no cost to the States and any interest is only as a result of the appUcation of that said beinterest by the State authorities. Similarly, there is a wide range of measures which are intended to try to relieve disaster situations. In some instances it is freight concessions; in others it is assistance towards providing fodder, providing water, and so on.

It has been brought to my attention only this morning that yesterday in the debate on the matter of pubUc importance the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) again misrepresented what I have said about taxation, particularly relation to those people who have a taxable income of more than $15,000. Yesterday he to changed his tack and quoted from two daily Hansard. newspapers, but he faded to mention that on the following day I put out a Press release correcting the reports which appeared in those newspapers.

I will not ask for your indulgence for too long, Mr Speaker, but I wish to quote from parts of the release because it corrects the points of quesmisrepresentation he has made. It reads: Labor's economic program, to be considered at the Conference in Perth next week, does not include to higher taxes or to a pool of unemployment. should anything said by me at the Press Conference the Nauonal Economic Committee's recommendations have been interpreted this way. Quite the contrarydespite some newspaper reports and editorials over the past two days. The Press release goes on to state: We recognise that there are restraints on the implementation of those programs, one of them being that there is a limit to the funds which can be collected from personal income taxes. That limit has been reached, which is why we are promising full tax indexation, not the partial one instituted by the Fraser Government.

Mr Speaker a reference to those who contribute the top 10 per cent to revenue is different from what the Treasurer misrepresented me about, namely, a reference to the top 10 per cent of taxpayers, as you would know. He has misrepresented me and, as I have stated, he continuin ously misrepresents me. I am glad to have this opportunity to make the correction.

There has been so much criticism of what I did NOT that I am obliged to draw attention to what is in the docupriorities ments and what I did say. Labor is determined to pursue as two of its main aims employment and the reduction of inequalities. Because of the way statistics are collected, and the number of itinerant workers, people between jobs and special regional factors, full employment as measured CES can be interpreted as somewhere between and 2 per cent. Basically we want the same number of job vacancies as there are people looking for jobs. We believe that indicative planning and using the sector are essential for achieving our aims. We suggested and are suggesting improved public achieve those aims. We recognise that there are restraints on the implementation of those programs, one of them being that there to the funds which can be collected from personal taxes.

NORTHERN TERRITORYSELF-GOVERNMENT Ministerial Statement",26
69,Mr ADERMANN,TAXATION AND FULL EMPLOYMENT,"by leave-In making this to the Parliament today I acknowledge with considerable pleasure the presence in  appointed Majority Leader and therefore the incoming Chief-Secretary of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, and other Executive members. It is certainly very appropriate that a statement of such great importance for die Northern Territory happily coincides with his presence in the House today. In a pubUc statement dated 17 July 1977 I gave a broad outline of the Government's deto confer responsible self-government on the Northern Territory in the period to 1 July 1979. The decisions taken by the Government resulted from consultations and agreement with of Executive members of the Northern Territory of Legislative Assembly. Following the election for the Legislative Assembly held on 13 August 1977 there were significant changes in the composition of the Executive and I considered it appropriate to obtain a reaction from the new Executive on the proposals. I am now able to confirm that the previously announced program for constitutional reform in the Northern Terriaway the tory is acceptable to the new Northern Territory from Executive and the Government will proceed with minds of the the implementation of that program. Because of their historical significance and the implications which they wtil have for the Parliament itself, it is appropriate that a detailed statement of the proposals for the conferral of responsible self-government on the Northern Territory be made in the Parliament. Before coming to office the Government made a pohcy commitment to devolve executive responsibility on the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and to bring the Northern Territory to ultimate Statehood. We have acted quickly to give effect to that The Northern Territory (Administration) Act was amended in 1976 to factiitate the transfer of executive responsibiUty to the Territory Legislative Assembly through the appointment of Executive members of that Assembly. The new provisions of the Act were brought into effect from 1 January 1977 and Executive members having administrative responsibility for a range of local functions were which I appointed from that date. Following on from these transitional arrangements it is proposed to create a government of the Northern Territory, with responsible Minisany ters having control over and responsibility for ownfinancesas from 1 July 1978. It is our inten-in tion that the new government should be given autonomy to conduct its own affairs subject only to the general oversight of the Commonwealth but without direction from it other than tional circumstances. In our approach to this matter we will be guided by the principle that thewhich essence of responsible self-government is that a Territory. community should be free to make its own desuch legislation cisions in the full knowledge that it will be lowing required to live with and be responsible for all the consequences of those decisions. We are cerned to ensure that the new political entity which we are proceeding to establish will be truly responsible in all respects. The constitutional structure to be developed for the Northern Territory will be directed towards ensuring to the greatest possible extent that conterminality is achieved between responsibility, authority and accountability within the structure of government in the Northern Territory and as between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments. Establishment of a Government of the Northern It is proposed to introduce legislation during the autumn sittings to formally establish government of the Northern Territory. Provision will be made for the appointment of Ministers administer Northern Territory PubUc Service dethe partments and for the establishment of a separobjective ate consoUdated revenue fund for the Territory. After self-government the office and title of the Administrator of the Northern Territory will remain. The Administrator will continue to be appointed by the Governor General and shaU hold office at the Governor General's pleasure. However, in matters pertaining to appointment or withdrawal of the commission the Administrator, the Commonwealth will sult with the leader of the Northern Territory government. Legislative Authority The Legislative Assembly presently has authgovernment ority in the broadest terms to make ordinances for the peace, order and good government of the Northern Territory. No change will be made in relation to this authority but in the coming months consideration will be given to means by which legislation in respect of matters not falling to the responsibiUty of the government of the Northern Territory will be introduced into the Assembly. At present the Administrator may reserve for the pleasure of the Governor General ordinance passed by the Legislative Assemits bly. In keeping with the principle that authority government should equate to responsibility, the Government sees no reason to justify the reservation of ordinances in respect of matters for whichresponsibUityhas been transferred to in excep-the Northern Territory Government. There is a body of Commonwealth legislation has particular appUcation to the Northern In general it is not intended to disturb respects:at this stage other than in the folcon- (a) The Payroll Tax (Territories) Act be amended to allow the Northern Territory government to impose a Northern Territory payroll tax; (b) The Northern Territory PubUc Service to be excluded from the operations of the Ombudsman Act; and (c) Capital works undertaken by the government of the Northern Territory to be excluded from the operation of the PubUc Works Committee Act. Because important issues of national pohcy-for example, in relation to uranium-ma y make it desirable to have Parliament pass further legisTerritory lation in respect of State-type activities, the Government does not undertake to refrain from a introducing such legislation. However, the Government will only proceed in this manner into exceptional circumstances and even then only to extent necessary to secure the relevant policy and in consultation with the governNorthern ment of the Northern Territory. Financial Arrangements The implementation of the proposed constitutional reforms will be dependent upon the finalisation of firm undertakings between the the Commonwealth Government and the Northern of Territoiy Executive on thefinancialarrangeconments that will apply when the Territory achieves self-government. The fundamental criteria governingfinancialassistance to the Northern Territory must be that, to the extent that citizens of the Territory determine the amount of expenditure in the Territory, then there should be procedures designed to ensure that there is a direct relationship between the amounts of such expenditure and the total level of taxes and charges levied in the Territory. In the absence of such procedures, self-government would faU short of being responsible government. It is proposed that this will be achieved by following financial arrangements broadly on the same Unes as those that exist now between the Commonwealth and the States, due regard being had ofcourse to the particular circumstances and disadvantages of the Northern Territory. Consistent with this approach the CommonNorthern wealth will provide the government of the partment Northern Territory with personal income tax vices, sharing payments as it does with the sideration will be given to the possibUity of the Northern Territory government having revenues from a Commonwealth income tax surcharge within the Northern Territory on the same basis as the proposals under tax sharing arrangements with the States. Some Land Commonwealth funds will be provided as loan funds under the same terms and conditions as State borrowings through the Loan Council grams. Negotiations of thefinancialarrangements will take cognisance of any special disabiUties of the Northern Territory as assessment will be made periodicaUy of the disabiUties of the Territory vis-a-vis the States. As a general proposition the assets and liabiliRegistration ties relative to non-revenue producing functions Soil will be. transferred to the government of the Northern Territory withoutfinancialadjustment. Government business undertakings will be handed over as going concerns with financial Payroll adjustments as appropriate based on book values. Appropriatefinancialadjustment will be made in respect of agency services rendered as between the Commonwealth and the Northern Darwin Territory governments. The Commonwealth will acceptfinancialresponsibUity for any restoration or reconstruction of Territory assets that remains attributable to damage caused by cyclone Tracy.

71,Mr ADERMANN,TRANSFERRED,"It can be seen from the statement that the transfer covers a wide range of functions such as primary industry, famUy and community welfare, payroll tax and stamp duties. In addition to the foregoing it will now be necessary for a governof the Northern Territory to have its own and audit instrumentalities such as a office and pubUc service commission and to make provision for the servicing Territory of its administrative structure. In order to avoid unnecessary dupUcation and reduce the overall cost of government in the Northern a Territory certain administrative service r example, staff, housing, purchasing and transport services-wi U be undertaken through the use of agency and/or contract arin a between the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments. DetaUs of such arrangements, including which government will have primary carriage, will be a matter for resolution between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory executive. However, where the Commonwealth provides a service on behalf of the Northern Territory government it will be the responsibUity of that government to determine pohcy and to commit funds in respect of its use of that service. Commonwealth-State Consultative Machinery The establishment of a self-governing Northern Territory as a new poltiical entity within the Commonwealth will have implications for Commonwealth-State consultative machinery. At present executive members of the Legislative Assembly attend most, if not all, of the Commonwealth-State standing ministerial councUs and committees with the status of observer. It is appropriate that where executive members presently have observer status at Commonwealth-State ministerial meetings, the Ministers of the Northern Territory government should be accorded fuU membership of such bodies upon that government assuming responsibiUty for the relevant function. The Commonwealth Government will sponsor such membership at the relevant time. As I indicated at the beginning of this statement the proposed estabUshment of a Northern Territory government is further confirmation of the Government's determination to give effect to its undertakings on the constitutional development of the Northern Territory. The move is fully consistent with the Government's underlying phUosophy of devolving authority in government to those areas which can best meet the needs of the community. It is also consistent with our poUcies on co-operative federalism and with the inevitable march of the Northern Territory towards Statehood.

Although we welcome that statement we wish to express here today some of the fears that people of the Northern Territory have about statehood.

I want to emphasise the point that there needs to be complete consultation not only with certain people who are deemed to be executive members because they may be affiliated with a certain party but also with all people in the Northern Territory. By way of explanation, the Minister for the Northern Territory (Mr Adermann) says on the first page of his ministerial statement: 'WeU, I did indicate development would take place in a statement. I made on 17 July. I now indicate that I had a chance to have discussions with the new executive'. I think the Minister would agree that these are the facts: There was an election recently in the Northern Territory and all seats have not been declared. In fact, this will not be done until tomorrow. One wonders what type of executive with which there was consultation. I am very mindful of the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in a sense of exuberance on IS August following the election in the Northern Territory on 13 August issued a Press statement mdicating the splendid results that had been achieved by the National Country Party and congratulating Dr Letts, the Leader of the Country Party in the Northern Territory. Of course, he was defeated in the election. Not only was he defeated but also his deputy leader was defeated. A number of other E eople lost their seats. The point I make on bealf of the Australian Labor Party is that there was a substantial expression of public opinion at that election. The people of the Territory were fearful of what statehood means. Does it mean that the people of the Northern Territory will have to bearfiscalresponsibUity because that seems to be the underlying factor in and tenor of the Minister's statement? If honourable members look at Budget Paper No. 11 they will notice that there are a mere 16,000 taxpayers in the Northern Territory. They will also notice that 5,000 people in the Territory earn less than average weekly earnings. Further, they will notice that 11,000 people earn less than $10,000 a year. So the people of the Territory wonder where this burden offiscalresponsibUity will Ue. Honourable members will see in Budget Paper No. 4, which relates to expenditure, that the amount of responsibiUty in monetary terms for the Northern Territory is $193m. Equating that to 16,000 taxpayers, each taxpayer would have a burden, if I can put it that way, $13,000. Are we talking about statehood in this sort of climate? By all means allow for the devolution of responsibility in a proper, orderly fashion. We have always encouraged that. In we can take credit for virtually stimulating sort of development. The report of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory presented to the Parliament on 26 November 1974 stated: The Committee does not recommend the transfer of responsibility for all 'State-type' functions to the Executive out proposes that functions of local significance transferred as soon as possible and that, for the time functions of national concern be retained by the Australian Government. The proposals of the Committee are, in that all 'State-type functions Executive, except that major functions such as rural mining, education, health . . . be retained by tralian Government and other major functions such ports,fisheries,national parks and the police be shared. Therefore, statehood would not be given on the basis that there would be centralist control from Canberra. In fact, it would be on the basis that there has to be some fiscal support. It is quite erroneous in law to suggest that have to create a State in the Northern before the Territory can have what is deemed to be their ownfiscus.It has been clearly established by the High Court in a recent case known as Berwick's case that a territoiy can still have ownfiscus.The Government is running a surreppopulated titious program in which it says that full reof sponsibiUty means statehood. The point we of the Opposition make is that there can be full sponsibility without the burden of statehood. That is not what the Government is saying. The Minister uses language in his statement that worrying to the Opposition. I refer particularly page 2 of the Minister's statement and I quote what he said: In our approach to this matter we will be guided principle that the essence of responsible self-government that a community should be free to make its own decisions the full knowledge that it will be required to live with pay for all the consequences of those decisions. It was as a result of that poltiical environment and in that context that at the last election in Northern Territory the National Country Party did not do so well. Concern was expressed there as to what the people would be burdened with. They have not had fuU and open discussion about what is in the mind of the Government. is not much good the Minister coming into the Parliament and saying that there has been cussion with the Executive in the Northern tory because that Executive was defeated at the last election. The point we make in order to assist the of Government is that it should consider aU the fears of the people of the Northern Territory. A mere 40,849 people are enrolled in the Territory. The number is less than in any other electorate in fact Australia. We do not want to over-emphasise the that point by saying a large group of people is involved. The population is a relatively small group and it is widely dispersed geographicaUy. Those people do need consultation and understanding as to their needs. They do need substanTerritoiy tialfinancialsupport from the national Governbe ment. Nobody wants to interfere with their local being, administration. The point we seek to make is that there should be uniformity of administration in effect, Australia. A decision by a person in Darwin to go be transferred to the Territoiy 1 land, to Uve in Perth should not be influenced by the Ausdifferent standards in those cities. Laws and as roads, opportunities for chUdren, for example, should be the same everywhere. Likewise, if a person in Perth wants to go to Darwin that person should be able tofindthat there is no change of administration and no lack of opportunity there. That is what federalism is all about. Federalism is not just afiscalarrangement-the idea that if people we are going to make their own decisions they have Territory to Uve with them and pay for them. People in the Northern Territory have to make its decisions on the basis that they are in a sparsely area and far removed from a number essential services. Their decisions have to be balanced in the Ught of those sorts of burdens. reThey needfinancialsupport and they should be getting more ofit, particularly in view of the very few taxpayers and the slenderfinancialresources is avaUable there. People in the Northern Territory to are concerned about this question of autonomy. They think that they have been hived off or dumped because that wtil make the Treasury by the figures look a bit better. The Treasury can say is that the responsibUity rests with the people of the in Northern Territory and that they wtil have to do and their best to raise the taxes that are needed. We see this emphasis coming through in this ministerial statement. On page 4 of his statement, the the Minister said that the people in the Northern Territoiy wtil be allowed to levy their own payroU tax. That is a pretty regressive tax at any time but they wtil be expected to use it. Any soundthinking economist, looking at the massive It unemployment that faces us these days, is very concerned with the fact that if more people are to disbe employed the employer must pay more tax. TerriGiving therightto impose payroU tax to the States was probably one of the worse actions that could have happened. The people in the Northern Territory are excluded from the operations of the Ombudshonourable man. Why? Why should we not have an ombudschallenge man to look at the laws and ordinances and the administration thereof in any part of Australia? Why should we say that there wiU ombudsman in the Northern Territory? If it is good enough for the Commonwealth Governyou ment to pay for an ombudsman, why could he the Minister not be avaUable to deal with aU the obvious government'.interjected difficulties that will arise in the Northern Terrinations that went on. Obviously tory? I infer from what the Minister said that, if would have prevented any challenge the people in the Territory want an ombudsman, they will have to pay for him. That would be a have territorial representation in the Senate. can pretty substantial burden. We in say that we will get money from the taxpayers all over Australia to have an ombudsman but if people in the Northern Territory want one had better arrange it themselves. From the point of view of federalism in this country I do not think it is proper, fair, or intelligent to worry about the State and Territory boundaries in relation to this great land mass. far as we of the Opposition are concerned, a State boundary merely means the extent of the administration. A State boundary should not mean an alteration in the type of administration. That is why we are encouraging the development of the Albury-Wodonga area. It crosses State boundaries. There can be regional autonomy and development with local people making their own decisions. The nonsense drawn up in the trying Colonial Office ISO years ago as to where a State began and where itfinished,thus enabling different laws to be made, has bedevUled this country. We know that for a fact. Consider the situation now in relation to this so-called fair Constitution and how it is being interpreted against these very same people in the Northern Territory. The Minister for the Northern Territory. tory is a member of the Party which is in power reason. in Queensland. Mr Adermann-It has good government.",29
75,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TRANSFERRED,Good government! Consider it in the light of what I am about to say. The Queensland Government is now challenging therightof the people in the Northern Territory to have any representation in the Senate. One would have thought that there would have beenfor consultation within the Minister's Party about territorial representation. The Constitution allows for it but he is a member of the National Country Party and a government of that persuffer suasion is challenging therightof people in Territories to have representation. Yet he says is good government. I say it is dishonest. It is itical manoeuvring. to be Mr SPEAKER-Order! I should remind the gendeman that the hearing of that in the High Court has been completed but the decision has not been given. I ask him to restrain himself from comment as to the subnot be an stance of the matter.,31
76,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TRANSFERRED,"I appreciate what say, Mr Speaker. You wtil have noticed that I am and said: 'It has good talking about the machiconsultation to the fact that these people in the Northern Territory I this Parliament make no other comment.",31
77,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSFERRED,The honourable gentleman they may proceed with the rest ofhis speech.,31
78,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TRANSFERRED,"I wish to make another point about consultation. The Government parties should look at the question of territorial representation in the Ught of our ConstiAs tution. The Western Australian Government is challenging therightof Territory representation in this House. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) is under that cloud. I would have thought that the poltiical parties backing the Government would have had enough influence with the governments of their poltiical persuasion that I have mentioned to prevent that sort of challenge. Is the Government to say to the people of the Northern Territory that it really is interested in them? The Labor Party has always said so and it has paid the penalty politically at the ballot box on many occasions as a result of being misrepresented. I am happy to see that, as a result of the recent election, the Australian Labor Party now has a substantial representation in the Northern TerriIt has that representation for that very Mr Adermann-The Labor Party has six members.",31
79,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TRANSFERRED,"The Minister should not despise the fact that it has six members. The number will build up and we will have a majority. The issue is what is to be done about the concern of the people in the Northern Territory their needs. We need more consultation and consideration, not the confrontation that we have had in the past. What about the financial burdens the people in the Northern Territory wtil if they are to be given what they need, the what they want and what we in the Opposition it would readily give them? They want autonomy polin the sense of decision-making but they should not suffer the burden of having to pay all the costs of adrninistration because of their Umited resources. It is for those reasons that I am making these achieved comments. I do not want the Minister to think We that we applaud his statement merely because was made in the House and contained some good points. The underlying fact is that these people will have imposed on them the burden of has raismg their own taxes. On page 5 of the Minisof getting ter's statement, he said that there will be consultitled as anout tation with the people of the Northern Territory about income tax payments just as there is with the States. There is a Umited number of taxcause payers in the Northern Territory and they have provided. of poor financial resources. Yet the dares to suggest that it is going to consult with them about income tax sharing arrangements, whether it should be 33.6 per cent or anything else. That is just a mere figment of the imagina ation when we come to consider what resources are needed. We want to buUd up the Northern Territory. We want to give the people there the ultimate in faciUties. The whole concept of Labour administration has been to look at where the needs are. Whether it be in the area of health, transport or education, the national Government has even had to supplement State governments. Is it any wonder that the Federal Government will have to give substantial aid, magnificent aid, to people in these far flung areas who face this problem of distance? The people of the Northern facUities. Territory are doing a splendid job in administerDebate ing that area.",31
80,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSFERRED,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. (Extension of time granted).,32
81,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TRANSFERRED,"I thank the Minister and the House. I shall be brief. I make the point, as it has been emphasised to me, that we are very concerned because there has not been proper consultation. We ask that the Minister to look the questions he has raised in this statement and consult with all people in the rather than just the few executive members, whoever they are. That is not good enough. There is a worry that the facUities in respect education and health, which are included in the transfer of the functions outlined in the stateplaces. ment, are not as good as they should be. They are run down. There is a shortage of staff and facUities. For the Territory to take them over in that run down condition is not fair and reasonable. The Territorians are asking that the Government should build them up before it hands them over.ing It is for those reasons that we want to see Government actively involved in helping the Territory in its administration. We want to see the Territory autonomous but we want it on a uniform basis. We emphasise that. are not at all married to the suggestion that it because there are State boundaries nobody need worry about what goes on within those boundaries. Far from it. The Constitution of this nation to lead to one nation and one people. Everybody should have a fair and reasonable chance of Ufe everything to which he is enAustralian. Our efforts in communication have been magnificent in this regard be there is no distinction between people on the basis where they Uve. The facUities are The new technologies of television and Government satellite communication are avaUable and we should be utilising them to benefit these people. It is wrong to suggest that this will become just fiscal operation and that because the Territory has asked for autonomy it will have to pay the penalty. I ask the Minister again to look at the fine points in his statement and to look at what the Territorians are going to say. They should have been consulted, particularly as there is a new Legislative Assembly there. It is for those reasons that the Opposition, whilst welcoming the statement, is very concerned about the type of taxation that will be levied on people in the Territory and about their inability to bear it, because it could lead to a run down in existing (on motion by Mr Calder) adjourned. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",32
82,Mr SPEAKER,WATER PROJECTS,"I have received letters from both the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by at Standing Order 107 I have selected one matter, that is, that proposed by the Leader of the OppoNorthern Territory sition, namely: The Fraser Government's abdication of responsibility for water projects. of I therefore call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion torisein their More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplacesMr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (3.48)-Ha d we predicted durthe 1975 campaign that water projects were the among the areas marked for destruction by a Fraser government we would have been accused of'clutching at straws'. Yet water projects have joined Medibank, hospitals, schools and cities in the long Ust of broken programs and broken promises. There is nothing more depressing in private life than the back-sliding of a reformed sinner. There is nothing more frustrating in public life than having to argue all over again propositions which the nation and the Parliament settled more than a decade ago. With this Government, one has to have the patience of a saint and the persistence of Sisyphus. This is not just a a reactionary government, it is a recidivist government. There is no worse example of the back-sUding of this Government than its attitude to water conservation projects. There is no matter on which the nation was better entitled to believe that successive parliaments and successive governments had established a settled principle-the principle that the Australian government would share responsibUity with the States for specific water projects. Thirty years ago, the Chifley Government not only inaugurated the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme but also was co-operating with State governments in the comprehensive water scheme for Western Australia and the development of the Burdekin VaUey in Queensland. The Menzies Government inaugurated no water projects before 1963 but in that and every subsequent year the Menzies, Holt, Gorton, MCMahon and Whitlam Governments introduced BUls for such projects in every State-3 7 in all. The principle was established 30 years ago. It was revived IS years ago and has been confirmed by every government and Parliament since. Now the whole thing is thrown into the melting pot. Under this Government, Australia is going back not just pre-1972, not even pre-Menzies, but pre-war. On 3 May last the Deputy Prime Minister and water Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) every subsequent authorised this answer to a question on notice: The present Government does not have a program of assistance to the States for water projects. It is of the the new Commonwealth/State financial arrangements should provide greater flexibility to the States in their own priorities in water resource matters. On 17 August the Deputy Prime Minister made a statement which signalled this Government's dication from participation in new water projister ects. He said: In the present difficult budgetary circumstances monwealth will not be allocating funds for individual resources projects. This is the first budget in 14 years to fail to do Thus in 1977, the national Government of the world's driest continent, yet a continent racked by flooding on its eastern coast, will play no part in planning orfinancingnew water projects-for the firsttimein nearly a generation. One has to go back to 1962 to find a similar abdication of responsibUity-in the same terms, by the same gentleman, but then merely the honourable member for Richmond. You, Mr Speaker, at least, wtil remember that throughout 1962 the then Opposition and particularly the former honourable member for Cowper, Frank MCGuren, consistently urged that the Commonwealth should share equally with the New South Wales State Government in flood mitigation works on the northernrivers.On 4 October 1962, the present Deputy Prime Minister said: When the honourable member for Cowper rises in this chamber and says that the Commonwealth should enter this field, he is only trying to create a diversion. He is trying to pass the buck on to the Commonwealth Government, although this is a State responsibility. He went on to say: I think the State Government should find the whole of the money. He also said: It is all very well to say that the Commonwealth Government should give assistance to the States for this purpose; but where would it end? Exactly a year later the right honourable gentleman had somewhat changed his tune. It may be that the impending elections brought on a year ahead of time had something to do with it. On 17 October 1963 he asked the question which gave Sir Robert Menzies the opportunity to announce arrangements with New South Wales which the honourable member for Richmond had denounced a year previously. The then Government tried to suggest that the flood mitigation legislation was a special case. But thefloodgates were open at last; the dam had burst. Thereafter, sequent projects were provided in every subyear, in every subsequent Parliament, by government, with every State. I give this background to stress two points. view that First, the Fraser Government's abandonment of national responsibiUty for water is not a temporordering ary departure because of the present economic crisis. As the Deputy Prime Minister's statements show, it is a long-term approach which will take abAustraUa back 15 years. The Deputy Prime Minhas gone full circle-fro m nothing back to nothing. Secondly, this approach not only the Comrepudiates initiatives of my Government; it water repudiates and ante-dates the MCMahon, Gorton, Holt and the last two Menzies governments. so. It is preposterous to dress up this abdication as 'new federalism'. It is just the old irresponsibility, the old buck-passing, the old aUbi, which coalition governments, Federal and State, have used for generations to escape their proper responsibUities. The Australian people were entheir titled to believe that that era had ended, at least where water projects were involved. I need back no further than the Governor General's Speech opening the 1967 Parliament when he said: Recent drought experience emphasises the importance water conservation in our program of national My Government has announced its intention to nauonal water resources development program with Object of increasing water conservation. There is hardly an important matter where water national responsibiUty, in every sense of the word, is so relevant as water conservation. not only a question of the States'financialinitself abUity tofinancehuge water projects unaided. some of the most important projects, specific needs and problems have arisen in one State cause of decisions and actions by other States and by the national Government itself. I give examples, Adelaide's water supply and TownsNorthern vUle's water supply. These are matters which out: cannot be left to the parish pump; they are national responsibUities. Adelaide is the driest tralian capital in the world's driest continent. Its water supply depends mainly on the Murray. The Cook University Deputy Prime Minister himself acknowledged Marine on 17 March last in answer to a question from the created honourable member for Angas (Mr GUes): The problem that arises is that because from many of the irrigation areas in New South Victoria into the Murray River, there is a build-up down the Murray especially of the Murrumbidgee. That of course has serious quences for South Australia. Yet he went on to say: The problem in South Australia is very much South Australian Government. That is, he concedes that activities in the southgrowth eastern States create the problem, yet the probthere lem thus created is one for South Australia In February 1973, on my initiative and for the first time in 60 years, the Prime Minister and theseven Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and face severe South Australia, met to review the and responsibUities of the River Murray ComThe mission in order to permit it to regulate not just in the quantity but the quaUty of the water in our its report: greatest river and its tributaries. Introducing the if Funher Urban and Regional Development (Financial tural Assistance) Bill m November 1974, my Deputy, then Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), said: Adelaide's water comes from local catchments and River Murray-bot h are contaminated and the city's water supply falls far short of intemauonal standards for logical and chemical quality. Those citizens of Adelaide who can afford it must datiy emulate the miracle of Cana and substitute superb wine for their lousy water. In this year's Budget the appropriation for the Adelaide go water treatment program has been reduced by 45 per cent in real terms, that is from $9.7m in 1975 to $6m this year. My Government undertook a program to bring Adelaide's water supply of to an acceptable standard by 1982. By reneging development. on the agreement this Government has set up a dishonoured an Australian Government underthe taking. A second example of national responsibUity for a regional problem is the TownsvUle supply. If Adelaide is the driest capital in the driest continent, TownsvUle is the centre for a It is water-rich tropical area, although TownsvUle is relatively dry. But many of the demands In on TownsvUle's water supply result directly from action by the Australian Government. Introducbeing the Ross River Dam Bill on 17 December 1974, authorising a non-repayable grant of two $2.56m for stage 2 of the dam the Minister for Development, Dr Patterson, pointed Townsville's growth over recent years owes much to AusGovernment decisions such as the location of defence installations, the establishment and growth of the James and work now in progress on the Institute of Science at Cape Cleveland. It was specifically in recognition of the burden on the public utilities of Townsville by such Australian Government initiatives that we decided to provide a grant of Sl.Sm in 1973 towards stage 1 of the drainage of the Ross River Dam. Wales and In September 1973 my Government had perof salinity suaded the Queensland Government to estabUsh in that section past the junction consea joint Burdekin Project Committee. It reported last June. Its investigations cost $lm. Its report wtil now be pigeonholed. The TownsvUle City Council has, in fact, calculated, as reported in the one for the TownsvUle Bulletin of this month, that: Townsville will face severe water restrictions, stagnating and possibly record unemployment by 1980 unless is immediate State and Federal Government funding alone. for the Ross River and Burdekin Dams. Figures released by the Townsville City Council yesterday showed that if the aty and surrounding Thuringowa Shire per cent annual growth rate continues, Townsville will water restrictions by 1980, and restrictions could operations be imposed as early as 1979. Joint Burdekin project committee concluded water supplies will be necessary by the mid-1980s the continued growth of the lower Burdekin for agriculand other purposes is not to stagnate. The committee pointed out in its report which it made in June this year that it had not, in fact, made a full economic assessment of the various the projects. It is quite clear, however, that no time bacterioshould be lost before that economic assessment is undertaken. The matter is urgent from the point of view of preserving the viability of existing mary production in that area and also so that Townsville will have an assured water supply. In his statement of 17 August the Deputy Prime Minister attempted to Unk his abdication of national responsibUity with short-term budgetWeirs ary considerations. This is as misguided in short term as it is in the long term. Amongst the industries worse hit by the present Government's economic poUcies are the construction, steel and cement industries. These are the industries-private industries-whic h stand to benefit most from water projects. cause the plans exist, there is the least delay tween planning and production, the least gap tween jprovision offinanceand the creation of jobs. For example, the Bundaberg irrigation scheme requires some $4m for completion. The operation involved is relatively straightforward; it is ready to go. The scheme maintains the area's sugar industry. The region itself is one of Queensland's high unemployment areas. Yet the scheme is brought to a halt in this Budget. The race to abdication, the haste with which this Government is abandoning responsibUity, can be seen by contrasting the 1977 Budget with the Hayden Budget of two years earlier. In 1975 provision was made forfiveQueensland projthat ects, namely, the Kinchant Dam, $2.8m; the Bundaberg irrigation scheme, $2.5m; the Mount Jutius Dam, a loan of $2m; the Ross River Dam, $1.4m; and the Proserpine RiverfloodmitiDevelopment, gation, $ 120,000. A further $2m was made avaU Mr able forfloodmitigation in New South Wales the and $12m for the Dartmouth Dam in Victoria. I tion stress that aU these projects were the result of construction consultation and planning by the Federal State governments concerned and by the water The authorities of the Federal and State governments already concerned. They were properly investigated, properly planned, co-operative ventures. Last year's Budget reduced the list to four projects and this year it has dwindled to a mere two projects, that is $6.5m for the Dartmouth Dam and $lm for New South Walesfloodmiti1973 gation. The trend is clear and ominous.The sition intention is obvious. This Government is abanthat doning a national responsibUity accepted by largely every Australian government during the past years. It is turning its back on the undertakings previous governments, turning its back on its own undertakings, given in 1975, turing its even on the achievements of its own forerunners - successiv e coaUtion governments from Menzies to MCMahon. pri Mr GILES (Angas) (4.3)- I think it probably is as well to go through what this Government has done since it has been in office. I refer to the Queensland Grant (Prosperpine Flood Mitigation) Act, the Act affecting the Namoi River in New South Wales, and the States the Grants (Water Resources Assessment) Act 1976 and also I refer the House to the Budget papers where honourable members wtil see mention of the Ross River Dam which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) mentioned in passing and urban water supply grants of $22.5m which wtil be provided to South Australia. I have Bejust had time to find a speech given by the beLeader of the Opposition in 1974 to the Murray beValley Development League. I notice he mentions that one should query the amount of pubUc funds used-seriously though they must be Viewed, if one can take note of a specimen which the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) held up in the House the other day-in relation to the salinity which is not cured by the nitration processes. In those days the Leader of the Opposition was talking a lot of sense. Of course, salinity in my State remains a secondary issue to the whole future not only of the development of South Australia but also of the substantiation of what is there now. It is secondary only to the volume of water. I shaU talk about a Uttle bit as I am grateful that the honourable gentleman mentioned Adelaide. Before I do I refer to a Press release dated 1973 which states: Mr Fairbairn, Opposition spokesman on National said today that he was horrified to learn that Whidam had written to Mr Dunstan informing him that Federal Government had endorsed one recommendaof the Coombs Task Force that, if possible, the rate of of the Dartmouth Dam might be slowed down. and The Press release also stated: attempt to delay the building of a dam which was authorised must make us all realise that the possibility of any new moneyThat has a familiar ring about itbeing made available under the National Water Resources Development program during the life of the Whitlam Government is either extremely rare or non-existent. There is a familiarity between the terminology of and precisely what the Leader of the Oppotried to teU the House today. The truth is there was an era of development, based on water resources, for some years in this 30 country. One can think of the Nogoa Dam, of which became known as the Fairbairn Dam, and of the Ord River. It is worth thinking about the back Ord to see whether that was a proper use of development funds or whether they could have been better used in some other way. It is all right to speak now with hindsight. That was an era of development. That era came to a halt, not with the advent of this Government but, as Mr Fairbairn pointed out in his Press release, with the advent of the Whitlam Government. I would like the next speaker, I think it is the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), to explain to me where the Whitlam Government allocated funds for water resources. If I remember rightly, in the days when Mr Fairbairn was Minister, is $150m or $250m a year was allocated for that purpose.",32
83,Mr LLOYD,WATER PROJECTS,It was at least $ 150m.,36
84,Mr GILES,WATER PROJECTS,"As far as my memory goes, havbeing ing just been alerted that I was to reply to this matter of public importance, the Whitlam Government certainly did not make any alloregarded cation. He cannot have his cake and Either the Whitlam Government stopped allocating funds in this way for the proper ing of resources or, as he maintained, we did. I think he is wrong. I am certain that any accurate look at the National Water Resources Fund any impartial observer on the political scene show that Prime Minister Whitlamfixedthat one and settled it once and for all. I want to take a little time in following up this matter because it has caused most serious concern to me and to a lot of people in South Australia. In about 1970, I think, the Minister, Mr Fairbairn, announced, to the horror of South Australia at the time, that the total yield to South Australia would be greater if a dam were contion structed at Dartmouth and not at Chowilla. He had a very torrid time getting through to people of South Australia the economic sense the proposition. It is all very well to have sight. At that time Premier Steele Hall negotiated with the Federal Government for an increase disposable water for South Australia of 37 per cent- a total of 0.25 million acre feet, if my memlevels ory serves me right. To this day that remains last significant action taken by anybody to care for, protect or increase the water flow or the water resources avaUable to South Australia. What happened after that? The Speaker in South Australian Parliament was an Indepensaying dent. I suppose the Speaker should be indepenbut dent. Steele HaU did not have the numbers able him to sign indenture agreements with the Commonwealth Government for the buUding of Dartmouth Dam. Speaker Stott stood him up that issue. So we had a somewhat historic elecHaU tion campaign at that time on the issue of whether Dartmouth Dam should be buUt. cause Logically, looking back and being wise with hindsight, it was not an issue that attracted bulk of the people. Other issues were flying around. Steele Hall was defeated. Never let us forget that he got 37 per cent more disposable water for South Australia, the driest State in the Commonwealth. I am trying to compress my detailing of the sequence of events into a few minutes. With the defeat of Hall's Government, Dunstan's party won the seat of Chaffey, which currently in the federal electorate of Angas. He won it on the promise that he would renegotiate with the Whitlam Government the prospect of buUding ChowUla Dam not Dartmouth Dam. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will excuse me for not pohtical as there is to be an election in South Australia this weekend. Quite frankly the action of Mr Dunstan was regarded and is in that area now as a highly irresponeat it too. sible action. He won the seat. harness Mr LLOYD - Who was irresponsible?",36
85,Mr GILES,WATER PROJECTS,"The present Premier of South Australia. He won the seat then, but he has not by won it since because people know he did not will mean to renegotiate on the ChowUla Dam. In general, his stocks in that area are not very high because ofhis action. I suppose that is what politics is about. I shall deal with things in chronological order. Next there was a big debate in which the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) and myself were on either side of the central table. We agreed on all sorts of things-I will not menthem-whic h have come into effect since then. Some of them came into effect during the the period of office of the Whitlam Government. of From the point of view of South Australia the hindWhitlam Government achieved nothing, bar very minor alterations to the River Murray Comof mission Act. The Premier of South Australia has achieved nothing. In fact he has allowed salinity below the Waikerie area this year in excess the of 1,000 parts per mUlion. He has done nothing at all at this stage. One of the issues in the present election is water. The Liberal Party has said that it will negotiate with the Federal Government for the buUding of a second dam on the River the Murray. It is not being parochial or one-eyed that the dam must be buUt at Chowilla, it is appreciated that there must be a further to enincrease in water resources to that State. Let us look for a minute at the problems which on flow to South Australia. After Premier Steele negotiated an increased water supply the people of South Australia were fairly happy bethey thought this would eventuate. To their amazement, on a celebrated occasion in this the House Mr Uren, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, made an announcement that the decision to build Albury-Wodonga was a purely political decision. That announcement had the House a trifle amazed at the time. also said that we need not worry about water resources because Dartmouth Dam would be in a position to supply the extra requirements. This introduced a real problem for South Australia. At that time. I gave the advice- I have not any reason to withdraw it-that both the Dunstan Government and the Whitlam Government Queensland, should, as responsible parties to the agreement that estabUshed Albury-Wodonga, have put an optimum poUution count that must be abided Government. by, for the future protection of South Australia. That was not done. I probably made three or unmistakable: four speeches on this issue. Today South Australia is drawing in excess of three-quarters of its total water supply from the River Murray. There are appalling salinity probCertainly lems. The water is drawn not only for Adelaide but for the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline and other areas also. I shaU not seek leave to have incorprimary porated in Hansard a Ust of these areas. I merely quote thefigureswhich I gave at the time. country. Albury-Wodonga, with an ultimate population professional of 300,000, wtil require 10.9 bUUon gallons year, based on an estimate of 100 gallons per person. Monarto, with an ultimate population of 200,000, will require 7.3 bUUon gallons a year. The requirements of the Port Pirie petrochemical plant, Port Stanvac, Riverland towns, local industries, Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta industry build up an enormous total with which the resources of the State cannot cope. One of the few long term projections that the Premier of South Australia grabbed hold of and shook around on several occasions was requests of this Government and I believe of the Whitlam Government to use some source of nuclear power so that desalination methods could be adopted to help the entire State of South Australia to get quality water, if a sufficient quantity could be obtained. Only in the past months have we seen him running away totally from that picture. One ponders where Australia willfinishup unless someone has the intestinal fortitude to grab hold of this issue again and to try to promote it for the sake of the oh people of South Australia. I think I have said enough, in a quiet and provocative style, to point out to the House that we did not stop the national water resources fund. The big era of dam building and water resource harnessing in Australia under previous Minister Fairbairn was some years ago. It did not stop with this Government. I have indicated schemes with which we are involved now. The era of the harnessing of those water suppUes stopped with the Whitlam Government, which He took advantage of the recommendations of the Coombs task force. At the time those recommendations quite possibly were correct, although most of them were not looked upon as being correct by people in my electorate. ReaUy and truly, with great respect, I think the Leader of the Opposition, particularly after his tour through has got on to a lame duck with this because he cannot blame us for any difference in in trend-the trend was there before, with his",36
86,Mr HAYDEN,WATER PROJECTS,"One thing is The conservative coalition Government has dumped the rural areas of Australia. The Budget is coldly indifferent to the gravest needs of rural industry in this country. there has been some adjustment to the tax averaging system, but the adjustments are going to assist largely the wealthy and successful producers, who represent a smaU proportion of the total beef producers in this The adjustment will give most benefit to men in the capital cities with rising a incomes who, as a tax avoidance measure, take up farming properties somewhere. There is no new provision of aid for the impoverished dairying industry. The poverty stricken state of the beef industry is ignored. The Government seems to be determined to alienate our important sugar markets. It ignores the plight of the tobacco industry. It cuts back on the real road effort. It abrogates its responsibUities in water conservation. It is often pointed out that this country is one of the thirstiest continents-if not the thirstiest continent-in the world. Accordingly, water is a most precious commodity. It needs to be conserved carefully. It is one of the priority responsibUities of any government in this country at anytime.To say that is not to assert that aU water conservation projects have to be sup6 ported. They have to be subjected to as rigorous economic justification as any other national priSouth ority development project. Having acknowledged that, one does not go to assert that, accordingly all water conservation projects can be ignored. Yet that appears to be the situation with this Government, as indinoncated in statements made by the Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) in this Parliament and as shown by the recent Budget. Not one new commitment to a water conservation project is contained in the recent Budget. It is incontestable that the national Government, this the conservative coaUtion Government, has wiped its hands of any responsibUity for new water servation projects. It abrogates its responsibUity. The Minister for National Resources said on May 1977 the House. There are only two Opposiuon memrelevant legislation would bers here and neither of them voted for you.",37
87,Mr HAYDEN,WATER PROJECTS,The Minister for Foreign lation. Affairs claims that it is my misfortune not to a supporter in the House to listen to me except for a couple of people-the important few. ,38
88,Mr HAYDEN,WATER PROJECTS,"It is better than being in the to Minister's position in Cabinet where he has no one to support him. The Minister for National Resources stated on 24 May 1977 in answer to question on notice: Responsibility for water projects is essentially the State governments and, under the new Commonwealththe Statefinancialarrangements, they are now in a better ition to order their own priorities in water resource What demonstrable nonsense! What arrant hypocrisy on the part of the Minister! The States are not being better servedfinanciallyas a result of any changes to thefinancialarrangements tween the national Government and the State governments. If one considers the total outlays for the States as payments to or for the States Loan Council program assistance over the period 1975-76 to 1977-78, in a real relative sense States are seen to be considerably worse off. In 1975-76, the year for which we produced completed our last Budget, we provided to the States as payments and as Loan Council program support a total amount equal to 12.1 per cent of gross domment estic product. The following year that support went down to 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product. In comparative money terms, it $637m less than it ought to have been. For the current year it is down to 11.1 per cent of gross domestic product. In other words, if the Governcent ment were to be as generous to the States real relative sense as we were in our last Budget as a proportion of gross domestic product it would provide $923m more than it proposes to provide in the current Budget. So the States are not in a sounder position to provide the sort development which is essenual to maintain the level of economic activity and the economic growth that is necessary for the future of this country. Let us look as some specific projects have been neglected by this Government. Monduran dam outside Bundaberg has been Council, totally ignored by this Government. It is refusing by default to fulfil commitments of earlier congovernments-a n earUer Labor government and before that an earUer conservative coaUtion 24 government. When we were in office in 1974 we increased to $ 17.2m our commitment to these projects. We made it clear that we honour our commitment under the to all the aspects of the developments which were detaUed in that legisThe situation now is that the project has have almost ground to a halt for want of financial assistance-for want of about $4m from the Australian Government. That is a bagateUe in terms of national expenditure, but it is essential to maintain the development of this program and bring it to a speedy completion. As I understand information we have received a from officials of the Queensland Government, including Mr Wharton, the Minister for Irria matter for gation and Water SuppUes in that Government, project is in a more less suspended state at no posmore than 25 per cent of its total development matters. and wtil languish somewhat at that point unless the Australian Government fulfils its commitments and honours its undertakings made in earUer years. A rather minor amount of moneybe- $4m-wil l allow the project to be moved on quickly. It will allow connecting channel development to be undertaken so that within a and very short time there wtil be 50 per cent completion of the program. The fact is that the Burthe nett and ChUders district channel reticulationthe largest part of the whole program-canno t be honours those unless the Australian Government earlier commitments. The present conservative coalition Governhas turned its back on rural interests in this country. It has dumped the farm industry. The Burdekin River project was mentioned by was the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). It is incontestable that the technical features of this project are estabUshed. The rejoint report of the Australian Government in a and Queensland Government establishes that beyond any doubt. The report indicates also that tofinalisethe whole exercise so that afirmcommitment can be made on a justifiable basis the in-depth economic analysis of the project has to of be completed. There is no evidence to indicate that this Government is prepared to move ahead quickly to complete that essential report. On the basis of evidence which I can extract from this joint report and the comment from Alderman which Eamon Lindsay, the Chairman of the Water The Resources Committee of the TownsvUle City it is my view that the economic justification of this report wtil be established. The fact is that Townsville's development will come to a dead halt, according to Alderman Lindsay, in the early 1980s unless the second stage of the Ross River Dam project is proceeded with. the best that will do will be to satisfy only to ago. mid-1982 the water requirements of Townsville. Accordingly, the Burdekin River project must between proceed if Townsville is to continue developing. Government The Julius Dam at Mount Isa was a project for which we indicated, when we were m governallow ment, that we were prepared to meet one-third the total cost, but the Queensland Government buried that proposition. Accordingly, it must accept a great proportion of the responsibility the problems which now arise. The Mount City Council claims that it is facing bankruptcy and that it faces being sacked because the payers are unable to provide the sort of money Dawson necessary to service the debt. It is a shame that I do not have more which to follow through the day by day saga of the statements made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). He started off by sayvious ing that a $4.6m grant was available from Australian Government and that that grant could be used for the Mount Isa project. He ported in the North-West Star of 22 August saying that the money was given with no strings and no guideUnes as to how the money was spent. He went on to say: I believe it was suggested that a portion should towards Lake Julius and the Bundaberg irrigation On the following day he confirmed that that was so. A Uttle later, on 25 August, he suddenly became indisposed for 48 hours with influenza by people raised questions about whether suchcompleted money really did exist. Then on 26 August this report appeared in the North-West Star. Mount Isa City Council opened its budget discussion morning under the shadow of a statement by the member Kennedy, Mr Bob Katter, that the mysterious $4.6m grant to the State Government did not in fact exist. He blows his trumpet profusely, but on that occasion he had only a tin whistle.",38
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WATER PROJECTS, agreed Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,39
90,Mr FISHER,WATER PROJECTS,"I never cease be amazed at the tremendous abUity of the position to raise issues in this House which serve to demonstrate further its total lack of action and its attack upon matters which vitally affected the well being of Australia's rural munities during its term in office. It was perhaps in the area of water resource programs and ects that its record was the most dismal. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) has just mentioned that the Government has totally ignored the Monduran Dam. I put it to him that that Queensland storage was completed with the But use of Commonwealth funds some two years Let us look a Uttle further at what happened 1972 and 1975 when the Whitlam thankfully had a short term in office. Very few commitments were made. I wtil the House to judge the reasons why the of commitments that were made were made, particularly in the electorate of Dawson. For instance, the Kinchant Dam represented a comfor mitment of $5m while the Proserpine flood mitiIsa gation project represented a commitment of $120,000.1 suggest to the House that those two ratemost important projects to the electorate of were made then only for poltiical expediency in a vain attempt to save the then memtime in ber for Dawson. Thankfully it failed. Every other major expenditure was made only to honour former commitments made by the precoalition government. I shall mention some the of them. The Bundaberg project cost some $ 17.2m, and that was a commitment made by is re-the previous coalition government. Of that as amount, $ 12.8m had already been allocated and only $4.4m had to be expended by the Labor Government to complete the project. The New South Wales coastal rivers flood mitigation be used scheme fits into the same category, as do the scheme. Tailem Bend and the Lock Kimba pipeline schemes in South Australia. The commitments made in respect of all those projects were made as the former coalition government, and by the Labor government. I believe that during its term the Whitlam Government actually reneged on a commitment made in relathis tion to the Pikes Creek project. I remember at for thattimethe successful representations made by federal the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) to the then Minister for National Development, the Honourable Reg Swartz, who to sharing with New South Wales and Queensland the cost of constructing the Pikes Creek dam. Preliminary work was being carried out when the Labor Party came to office. The to Whitlam Government abdicated its responsiOpbiUty to carry on with that project which had only been agreed to by the previous Government. Let us look for a moment at the development comof our national water programs. After two years of prolonged discussion with the States on a projnauonal water program between 1973 and 1975, the Whitlam Government was not able to obtain a single commitment; it did not enter into a commitment in relation to any individual project. The present Government has achieved and will be achieving a great deal over the three years as far as our national water programs are concerned. Already $lm has been allocated to New South Wales for the Namoi River weirs. One could refer to the statement made by the Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) in relation to the water hyacinth program which effectively assists the States of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. At that stage the Commonwealth announced an allocation of mous $50,000 to New South Wales during 1977-78 towards the cost of an action program to control the water hyacinth infestation on the Gingham Watercourse on the Gwydir River. Since then, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have each matched the Commonwealth's conthis tribution. This year the program will concentrate on improving water management in the infested areas, selective spraying and further research biological control of the water hyacinth. There is no doubt that that program ultimately will assist in protecting the lower reaches of the River ray system from water hyacinth. Of course, one can refer also to the fact agreement has been reached in principle with New South Wales local authorities for the coasharm. talriversfloodmitigation program which is estimated to cost $28m. We have also announced a water resources program under which the system, Commonwealth wtil consider grants to the States for projects which they believe should receive the highest priority. We have embarked on a three year water assessment program with the States a cost of $6.6m over each financial year. Of all the measures commenced and underof taken by the Government none has been more important than the extension of the role to be played by the River Murray Commission. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) o mentioned the work that he did in that regard, relation but it was only when the coalition Government come to power that the role of the River Murray Commission in relation to water quality was tually broadened. The Commission can now conand sider water quaUty in the operation of works under its control. It can now carry on a water quaUty monitoring program on the main stem and on the lower end of all tributaries. It can tiate, authorise and co-ordinate studies on ters directly concerned with water quality agement on the main stem of the River Murray. It can also recommend to the States standards water quaUty in the main stem of the River Muraltered. ray, and it can make recommendations to the States on the operation of State salinity and drainage works which affect water quality the main stem of the River Murray system. These next two and are important changes? However, it is doubtful whether the increased responsibUities of the River Murray Commission go far enough. In my view, it is important that a national authority be formed to oversee all aspects of the vast River Murray system. The River Murray system includes 1.6 million acres of highly productive land. It represents an enorinvestment in land resources and people. It was with that in mind that our present Minister for National Resources recently made an extensive tour from Albury at the upper end of the Murray River system through to Adelaide. He took into account the various factors that affect vital River Murray basin, including flood mitigation, irrigation, urban water supply, salinity, pollution and even such important aspects on as recreation and the environment. MurOver the years there is no doubt that parochialism and poltiical expediency, both intrastate and interstate, have caused many vital that problems to the River Murray system. In many aspects they have probably done irretrievable It is important, however, that we utilise this most important system to achieve the optimum development of Australia. It is an integral and basic logic demands that it should be so managed. There is no doubt that excessive utilisation of water is taking place towards the headwaters in New South Wales. It is being at over-allocated with the result that in critical times there is insufficientflowin theriversto contain pollution and meet the needs of vast lengths the lower reaches. This is happening as far upstream as MUdura. It is likely to extend further upstream to Swan HU1 and into the lower reaches f"" the large tributaries. At critical lowriverflow times tremendous problems are likely to occur into saUnity in future years. acI ask the House where we wtil get the quaUty quantity of water to maintain irrigation and further urban and industrial development in the general lower Murray area and the industrial and urban South Australian regions. Even now inithe quality of water in the lower reaches is below matthe standards of the World Health Organisation manfor drinking water. It is unsuitable for many industrial and agricultural purposes. The for environment has been and is being dramatically With these things in mind I believe that the recent visit by the Leader of the National control Country Party and Minister for National in Resources was most important. Irrigation development in the Murray system was sponsored by the Government. It is vital to the welfare of thousands of whole communities in Australia and to decentrahsation. This mattei of pubUc importance today is at best only a smoke screen in attempts by the Opposition to make people forget the devastation to Australia's water resources projects during its term in office. It will take 20 years for rural people to forget the destruction that the Opposition brought upon rural communities when it was in office. The tremendous benefits that tax reforms, tax averaging, income equaUsation deposits, superphosphate and nitrogen bounties, changes in the pension system and the unemtions ployment benefits scheme have made to rural communities cannot be hidden. It is most unjust and only a smoke screen when the Opposition endeavours to bring forward a matter importance which has no bearing on the problems Australia is facing.",39
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WATER PROJECTS," points Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA QUARANTINE STATION, WALLGROVE, tine security NA APPROVAL OF WORK: PUBLIC NA",41
92,Mr MCLEAY,WORKS COMMITTEE ACT," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry following proposed work which was referred to the mentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: struction of an animal quarantine station, Wallgrove, South Wales. The proposal is for the construction of a comprecome hensive animal quarantine station comprising the following main groupings of buUdings: quarSydney antine security area, administrative and pubUc area, service buildings and three staff residences. The estimated cost of the proposed work $4.6m. The Committee in recommending the construction of the proposal made the following recommendations: 1. the Department of Health should examine the proposed horse grooms' acincluded commodation with a view to providing less costly solution. 2. further consideration should be given the siting of the manure pit and incinerator within the secure quarantine area. 3. the internal roads should be planned to ensure segregation of vehicles servicing manure pit and incinerator and the vehicles supplying the bulk feed store and bedding store. 4. a review of existing bee importation arrangements should be undertaken together with an examination of the feasibility of establishing a bee quarantine facUity. 5. when assessing animal quarantine charges, in addition to the recovery of operational costs, consideration should be given to the recovery of some level of the capital costs of animal quarantine stations. The Government accepts these recommendaand they will be taken into consideration in the development of the project. Upon the concurrence of the House in this resolution, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the of pubUc recommendations of the Committee.",41
93,Dr KLUGMAN,WORKS COMMITTEE ACT," I support the construction of this facUity. I shall raise two because they have been raised with me by a number of persons living in the area, especially those who have investments in Uvestock, et cetera. Some people are worried that the quaranarea is not secure enough. I am not an expert on this matter. I reaUse that the pubUc Works Committee sat in Blacktown. It had a good look at the matter and apparently it is satisfied about the possibiUty of viruses escaping the area. I am not sure whether the second point which seems reasonable to me relates Public specifically to this subject. It relates to the out the transport of animals when they land in Australia Parliafrom the point of entry, say, Darting Harbour or Conelsewhere in Sydney, to Wallgrove. There seems New to be a worry- I certainly could not say that this was not a possibiUty-that flies or bisects could in contact with those animals or that a truck could break down somewhere between and the Wallgrove area. I hope that the Government wtil take these points into consideration and make sure that there are no potential is dangers from the quarantine station.",41
94,Mr BUNGEY,WORKS COMMITTEE ACT,"As a member of the Public Works Committee it pleases me to see that the Government has accepted the rerecommendations which the Committee in its report. Firstly, I shaUreferto the a points raised by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman). The Committee was very concerned with these two aspects, that is, to the question of security within the instaUation itself and the transportation of animals from the airport or sea port to the quarantine station. In the transcript of evidence which has not yet been the pubUshed it will be seen that these questions were examined at some length. The Committee was satisfied with the projected plans and arunofficiaUy rangements. The Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) referred to a number of reservations which the Committee had in relation to the conpeople struction of this quarantine station. I am pleased that the Government will pay attention to the recommendations we made m relation to the grooms' accommodation, the siting of the manure pit and incinerator and the road layout in the area. Interesting evidence was given to the Combe mittee on quarantine faculties for bees. The dence given by the Commercial Apiarists AssociWorks ation of New South Wales and the Federal acted Council of the Australian Apiarists Association should be examined carefully by quarantine officers in the Department of Health. It is quite clear that there is a need for quarantine facultiesOctober in this area. This station will have a significant effect in safeguarding Australia against rabies outbreaks. At the moment there are only 12 ken-is nels in the whole of Australia which are secure for the importation of dogs. The new installation at Wallgrove will to be increased to 609,597 being provided in the new instaUation. I am also pleased that the Minister has accepted the recommendations of the Committee to examine charges to see whether capital costs can be incorporated. It seemed the Committee that there should be some charge in this respect. I refer to the capacity of facUities for importing horses into Australia which will now be provided at WaUgrove. The Committee was not aware that additional funds for those culties would be provided in the most recent Budget. WaUgrove will provide 90 horse stalls. At the moment there are only 10 stalls with porary facUities for perhaps an additional 20 staUs at WaUgrove. The Committee was not aware ofit at the time, but in the Budget provision is made for an adpeople ditional 32 horse stalls at Spotswood during financial year, which will Uft the capacity of Spotswood to about 40. Provision is also made for an additional 36 horse stalls at Torrens IslandMinister in South Australia, which will Uft the capacity that area to 41. In effect, after the completion of WaUgrove, Spotswood and Torrens the total number of faciUties avaUable for horses will be 171. When one compares this with the current capacity of 31, one sees that it is a very large increase indeed. If the Committee had been aware of these definite additional arrangements for thisfinancialyear it may have had a different outlook on the provision of horse faculties at Wallgrove. The Committee was very doubtfuldoubtful, because it made no official recommendation on it-as to whether horse facUities should be decentralised. It was felt that importing horses could well afford to pay any additional price made necessary by the centralisation of horse quarantine facilities. I think that the Committee would accept the need for dog and cat faciUties to be segregated but felt that, with the greater range of aircraft and the greater size of aircraft shipping horses, there would be some way in which centralisation could estabUshed. I think this report also indicates evithat a number of other reports of the PubUc Committee in this area have not been on. Let me refer to several of them. Firstly, the animal health laboratory at Geelong was the subject of a report by the Public Works Committee. In its sixth report for 1974 dated 17 1974 it recommended the buUding of an animal health laboratory at Geelong. At that stage the recommendation was accepted, and it one of the few recommendations of the PubUc rabies Works Committee in which the Committee stressed that it was a matter of urgency that the allow this number work proceed. I point out that only about $91,000 has been spent on preUminary site work for that project to and also a further $181,000-odd on site work construction. So with a total estimated capital cost of $67m in 1974 this significant and vital program has still to be proceeded with. Let me also refer to the delays in the high security faoffshore quarantine station project which was also examined by the PubUc Works Committee. In itsfifthreport for 1973 dated 13 September tem1973 it recommended that an offshore high security quarantine station be established on West Island in the Cocos group. At that stage the estimated capital cost of the project seemed to be $2. lm. It is gratifying to the Committee and to aU interested in quarantine work to note that this the sum of $6.9m has been provided in the Budget for work in this area. As a member of the Public Works Committee I am pleased that the and the Government have accepted the inrecommendations of the Committee.",41
95,Mr MCLEAY,WORKS COMMITTEE ACT,"in reply-Very briefly I would Uke to thank the honourable members who have taken part in this debate-the honourable member for Prospea (Dr Klugman) and the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey). The comments of the honourable member for Prospect wtil certainly be taken on board by the Government and I will raise them with the officers of my Department although, as the honourable memcovering ber for Canning said, this matter heavily canvassed during the sittings. I want to respond briefly to what the honourable member refresh for Canning said about the animal health laboraas to the the tory at Geelong. I must say that the design team on that project is still intact and still working. have forgotten how much has been spent on the Act actual design work but it is certainly in excess of paidsobyasthe $ 1 m.

97,Mr MCLEAY,WORKS COMMITTEE ACT,"Who knows what will happen That in the future? It has been intact for a couple of years now. If I were someone inclined to bet, would say yes. Once again let me say that this bate demonstrates the undoubted value of the work of the Public Works Committee that in the not too distant future we will be able to enlarge its activities. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA Motion (by Mr Staley) agreed to: That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament 1974, the House of Representatives approves the following proposal: Construction of an electrical substation at of Parliament House, Canberra.

98,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the homes indulgence of the House to raise a point of proport. cedure on this legislation? Before the debate resumed on the Bill I would like to suggest that may suit the convenience of the House to have general debate covering this Bill and the National Health Amendment Bill as they are related measures. Separate questions course, be put on each of the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr may Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject subject matter of both BUls to be discussed in this standardoffees. debate.",43
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,Is it Committee the wish of the House to have a general debate both measures? I will aUow that course has been fairly to be followed.,43
100,Dr KLUGMAN,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"Let me memory of members of this chamber purposes of the two BUls we are debatI ing today. ThefirstBUI amends the National Health Act and the Nursing Homes Assistance to provide for increased benefits to be Commonwealth in respect of eUgible in approved nursing homes and to provide for registered hospital benefits organisations to pay sinular benefits to eUgible who are patients in approved nursing homes by making such benefits a condition of registration for hospital benefits organisations. is the main provision of thefirstBUI. The only aim of the second Bill, as I see it, is to ensure I that aU privately insured patients wtil pay for depathology services provided by the Commonwealth Health Laboratories. The Opposition wtil and I hope not oppose this legislation. In the second reading speech the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) became rather ecstatic about the legislation he was introducing. In part ofhis speech he said that this introduces a new era of financial security for nursing home patients. Of course it wtil not do anything of the sort. It wtil succeed only in helping patients very temporarily. I think that that is an important point and Act that is why we support it. Annual adjustments the rear have been promised but they are not in the legislation. I hope that this Government, which has broken many of its promises, wtil not break this one. It is important to point out that although the Government says that it introduces yearly adjustments it does nothing of the sort. It makes Second Reading yearly adjustment possible, in the same way as adjustments have been possible in the past. I think it is relevant to relate how this Bill was introduced and what is to happen. The Governadmitted that many patients in nursing or their relatives were in dire need of supWhilst admitting that on 16 June and sayis ing that this legislation would operate from 1 it October, the Government did not introduce this a legislation until two weeks ago. I presume that the legislation will pass throught this House today, through the Senate later and will come will, of into force on 1 October. For the benefit of honourable members who not have taken a very active interest in the nursing homes, I give the definition of I think there have been a number of definitions in this respect. The report of the on Care of the Aged and the Infirm, commonly called the Holmes report, which was presented to the Government in January this year, defines the standard fee. The standard weekly fee has increased quite considerably since this Government came to office about 23 monthsOctober ago. The standard fee for a State is defined as fee which would cover 70 per cent of all nursing home patients in that State. In other words, E er cent of all the beds in nursing homes would e charged for at that fee or below that fee. is where thefirstdifficulty arises. Originally the standard fee was calculated the basis of fees charged by all nursing homes. Fees vary considerably from State to State. For the purposes of this legislation the standard has been increased because it covers 70 per of all private nursing home beds and therefore covers probably some 90 per cent or 85 per centMr Huht-85 per cent November 1975 July 1977 October 1977 (proposed) Percentage increase November 1975 to July 1977 (21 months) Percentage increase November 1975 to October 1977 Expected standard weekly fee June 1978 Patients contribution in addition to standard weekly fee in July 1978",43
101,Dr KLUGMAN,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,The table contains the stanrisen dard weekly fee for all States for November 1975 and for July 1977. These two sets of figures are relevant because both were calculated on the standard fee covering 70 per cent of all beds particular State. It also contains the standard for October 1977 at which point there is to be change and a significant increase because the standard fee is to cover 70 per cent of private nursing home fees. The table gives the percenhave tage increases from November 1975 to July 1977 and from November 1975 to October 1977. My calculations are based on the percentage increases that have occurred over the past two years during which time there has been no majorcent; change excepting a change of government. It important to remember that there were major changes to the costing of nursing homes in about 1973 when female wage rates were made to male wage rates. I think it would be fab: to state that over last two years nursing home fees should have,44
102,Dr KLUGMAN,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"Yes , 85 per cent. Therefore there is some difficulty in comparing the standard fee that is proposed to come into force in 1977 with previous standard fees. theNevertheless, I have prepared a table which I am sorry to say I have not shown to the Minister for 70 Health. However, I did show it to the Minister who was at the table before the Minister for ThatHealth entered the debate. I asked whether the Government would grant leave for the table to be incorporated in Hansard. He agreed that on leave would be given. The table sets out the standard weekly fee in different States at different times as well as other things. The table has been fee prepared by myself and I accept responsibUity cent for its contents. May it be incorporated? it Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The table read asfollowsNA NSW Vic.

Inflation rates vary quite significantly from State to State. I have no way in a by which to determine why they vary so sigfee nificantly. I will give thefiguresthat I have used a so that the Minister can at some stage give some explanation. The assumed percentage increase in nursing home costs for a 9-month period which I used for the purposes of working out an expected standard rate fee for June 1978 are as follows: New South Wales, 13 per cent; Victoria, 11 per cent; Queensland, 13 per cent; South Australia, 11 per cent; Western Australia, 17 per and Tasmania, 16 per cent. I have based is those percentages on cost increases during the previous two years. I do not know why there should be such a big difference, for example, beequal tween Victoria and Western Australia. the The second last Une of my table sets out the expected standard weekly fee at June 1978. In the final line I have subtracted the expected dard weekly fee from the proposed standard weekly fee as of 1 October. The difference, of benefit. course, if the nursing homes are allowed to increase their charges by that amount, will be the amount patients will have to contribute in dition to what they receive from either the Government or from the funds plus their own patient contribution as it exists at the present time. The patient contribution will, in fact, increase slightly during that time because pensions will up during that time. The patient contribution basically the single pension rate. I have calhomes culated that in about nine months' time a New South Wales nursing home patient or his relaavailable. tives will be up for about $18 a week. The amount in Queensland will be nearly $17 a week and in Victoria it will be about $20 a week. It is also important to remember that already many beds cost much more to maintain than thego standard weekly fee. An answer to question No. 247 asked by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) appears at pages 975 to Hansard of 8 September. The question and answer relate to areas which could not be regarded as well-off areas even though some of them are temporarily represented by members of the Liberal Party. I refer particularly to the torates of Parramatta and Mitchell. In his reply the Minister gave the names of nursing homes approved under the National Health Act, their addresses and their weekly charges as at 31 July 1977. We find that the fees charged in the first four nursing homes in the Parramatta electorate are above the proposed standard fee for 1 certain October. So already at the end of July this year the first four nursing homes mentioned in alphaganise betical order charged more than the proposed standard fee. For example, the Aloha nursing home at Epping as at 31 July charged $152.18 week for two, three and four bed wards. The proposed standard fee will be only $142.45 week. Therefore the patient will have to contribnot ute about $10. The charge for a one-bed ward was $173. It is fair enough that patients wishing to be placed in a one-bed ward should contribute much more. The minimum charge at the Curie Nursing Home was $151.55 and'the maximum partment charge was $163.45. We can see from these Minister's figures, taking into account that there has been no increase in the standard fee from 1 July, thathas patients are already paying $10 a week more than the benefits they will receive. important to realise that fact.",44
103,Mr HUNT,STANDARD WEEKLY FEE,"Do you know what the gap is now? stanDr KLUGMAN-It would be much more now. I accept that the Government is increasing the My criticism is that this increase is only a temporary improvement for the vast majority of patients. What will be the result of all this? As I adunderstand the position from persons to whom I have spoken in Sydney-it probably applies to other States-matron s and proprietors tend to reject patients who have no private means or significant private assets or patients with relatives who are not prepared to contribute significant amounts of money towards the cost of maintaingo ing elderly people in nursing homes. We cannot is blame the matrons and proprietors of the nursing for doing that. There are more people trying to get into nursing homes than there are beds To some extent the nursing homes can pick and choose. They do not want to take the risk of taking in pensioners who have no other income and who have no relatives prepared to supplement the benefits received from the government. Therefore matrons and proprietors to a lot more trouble assessing the assets of a patient rather than the patient^ medical condition. It has become very difficult tofindbeds 979 of for would be patients without assets. In passing I would like to point out what is required, certainly in the capital cities. What is required is a type of nursing home bed clearance elecsection such as the hospital bed clearance sections. If a medical practitioner has difficulty in finding a bed in a nursing home he should be able to ring a telephone number and tell the person running the bed clearance section, whether it be run by the Department of Health or some voluntary organisation, that he has a patient with a medical condition who requires a bed in a nursing home. The section should then try to ora bed for that patient. I understand that something akin to this is run by the New South Wales Council for the Aging. I think it has a difficulty inranningthis service without accepting commission from the nursing homes. I think a the Minister would agree with me that it would be a good idea for that sort of bed clearance section to be run by an organisation which gets kickbacks from the nursing homes because other problems would arise. The New South Wales Council for the Aging is subsidised by the Deof Social Security. It is not under the control. I understand that its subsidy has remained unchanged since 1972 or 1973. It had to dismiss one of its very small staff just at a time when it is trying to get something I think it is worthwhile for the aged. I want to refer to some other proposals by this Government. Thefirstmatter I will mention is costing. I do not want to be too critical of publicparticularly servants because I know the difficulty which they work. Obtaining statistics involves getting co-operation from all kinds of people,but from nursing homes, from State government departments and from federal departments. All kinds of surveys are necessary. However, I have little confidence in thefinalfiguresprovided.to Holmes suggested at page 96 ofhis report that there would be a saving of $75m if the funds paid nursing home benefits and that about 33 per cent of the people belong to funds. The Ministerwith for Health suggested in the Medical Letter about two weeks ago that about 30 per cent of nursingEmployment home patients belong to funds and this wouldramatta. provide a saving of $S0m. There is very little difference between the 30 per cent mentioned by the the Minister and the 33 per cent mentioned byParramatta Holmes in his report yet there is a difference SO per cent in the amount to be saved by the Government. I do not know the correct answer.Liverpool Holmes admitted that he was guessing to a large extent. I do not know whether the Minister wasfact guessing or was hoping or was confident aboutdo thefigure.That is one of the difficulties that arisestatistics when I look at the answer by which I referred previously. After all, he sponsible for the answers to questions that he provides for Hansard The Minister was asked the names and tion. addresses of registered nursing homes in certain electorates, including my own electorate of Prospect. At page 978 of Hansard, reference is made to four nursing homes. Three of them are not in my electorate. The addresses are provided. It would have been just a matter of looking the pubUcation produced by the Commonwealth Electoral Office or at a map in order to ascertain which nursing homes were in which electorate. The pubUcation produced by the Commontions with the funds. wealth Electoral Office contains lists of streets, roads, et cetera in the Sydney area together with the subdivision, Commonwealth division and State electorates in which each thoroughfare is located. I suggest that the Minister's officers obtain a copy of that pubUcation for use when providing answers for Hansard. It was really sUly for the Minister to say that there were four nursre-insurance ing homes in my electorate. I have no objection to having nursing homes in my electorate. One of those mentioned is only a short distance away but two others are some distance away from electorate. At least one of the nursing homes set out as being in the electorate of Mitchell is in middle of my electorate. When I look at answers Uke that I do not have much confidence about other answers. I assume that the Public Service keen to provide correct answers for underMinisters and members of parUament.",45
104,Mr HUNT,STANDARD WEEKLY FEE,My officers are good on statistics they might not be very good on geography.,46
105,Dr KLUGMAN,STANDARD WEEKLY FEE,"I hope that their statistics are better than their geography. This is not pecuUar the Department of Health. I raised a simUar question with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street). He provided figures about the number of people registered the Commonwealth Employment Service in various electorates. There is a Commonwealth Service office in the middle of ParThe Minister claimed that the people of the Mitchell electorate provided 90 per cent of registrants at that office whtie the people of itself provided only 5 per cent. This ofis impossible. It would not happen. For some reason he claimed that my constituents go to to register at the Liverpool Commonwealth Unemployment Service office when in they can register at the office in Fairfield. I not want to get involved with side issues, but are important for planning and for nursthe Minister to ing home purposes. is reHolmes suggested that the funds ought to be paying for people who are privately insured. To some extent this suggestion has been adopted by this Government. I agree with Holmes' suggesHowever I am not so sure that the $50m in savings which the Minister mentioned or the $7Sm which Holmes mentioned will be anything like the truefigure.I think that what wtil happen is that there wtil be an increase in the Commonwealth subsidy. I hope not. The Minister for up Health seems to be fairly aggressive about the private funds at the present time because they have been running a campaign against him. I hope that will put some backbone mto his rela",46
106,Dr CASS,STANDARD WEEKLY FEE,Ge t stuck into them.,46
107,Dr KLUGMAN,STANDARD WEEKLY FEE,"Exactly . The Minister should get stuck into them. As I see the situation, the Commonwealth will contribute to payments by the private funds via the re-insurance pool because the patients wtil automatically go mto the pool, as the Minister pointed out. Holmes did not suggest that they automaticaUy go into that pool; he suggested that certain conditions should be laid down. Secondly, by an my increased subsidy for the 'hospital only' patients-this is one of my worries at the present the time-as honourable members interested in this issue are aware, people can pay the Medibank levy plus, in the case of families, a subsidised is hospital-only insurance which costs SBS a year. In that sum of $135, there is a significant element of government subsidy. I think it is between $40 and $50 per year per family.",46
108,Mr HUNT,STANDARD WEEKLY FEE,It depends on the State.,47
109,Dr KLUGMAN,STANDARD WEEKLY FEE,"Anyway, there is a significant subsidy. If the funds have to pay the nursing home benefits, as they should, for their patients who are insured for hospital only they will ask the government for a larger subsidy. I hope that the Government will insist that they use up their reserves, or a significant portion of them, before agreeing to that proposal otherwise all we will be doing is transferring the cost of nursing home benefits across to Medibank. The total cost to the taxpayer will be exactly the same. One of the interesting things is the significant difference between the States in the use of ing homes and the cost of nursing homes. Figures provided to me show that at 30 April this year the proportion of nursing home patients in New South Wales receiving intensive care, as it is called at present, or extensive care, as it will called after 1 October, was 39.84 per cent. Let say 40 per cent. In Victoria two months preavailable viously, and I assume that these are comparable figures, the proportion of intensive care patients was 93 per cent. What a huge cent in New South Wales as against 93 per cent in Victoria. I suppose that that helps explain the standard weekly fees in each State. The ment is now doubling its subsidy for extensive care patients from $3 per day to $6 per day. One hopes that that will encourage the Victorian fees to come down closer to the fees in other States. To take two extremes, the proposed standard weekly fee in Victoria as from 1 October 1977 will be $184.45 and in Western Australia it will be $129.15-a huge difference of $55.30 a week. It is difficult to see why that should be so. I given the proportion of intensive care patients New South Wales and Victoria but I will give one additional figure so that people who are interested in this subject will be able to find information in Hansard. The national figure, cluding Tasmania, for the proportion of intenment sive care patients at February this year was 67.42 per cent of all patients. That is nearly double figure for New South Wales but still well below the Victorian figure of 93 per cent. I will leave it to others who are participating the debate to mention some of the other relevant points in the legislation and the general probthrough lems. I know that this area is a difiicult problem. Generally speaking we are dealing with an group that can be divided into categories from medical point of view, even though this may be an over-simplification and may involve a significant amount of overlapping. The categories would be the well, the frail and the sick, and it is terribly important from the point of view of the aged people affected and from the point of view of the community which has to bear a significant proportion of the cost to make quite sure that these different categories of patients are in the most appropriate accommodation for them, whether that be their own homes, hostels, nursing homes or hospitals. We should make sure that as many people as possible are able to get into accommodation appropriate to their category so that we avoid a patient being put into, say, a nursing home, not because he needs nursing home accommodation but because no other kind of accommodation is available. This will need co-operation between the Department nursof Health and other government departments such as the Department of Social Security, the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development and Treasury. They are all relevant departments. It is a question of trying to be provide accommodation for aged people at an us appropriate cost so that such accommodation is to the aged in our community to prevent their health deteriorating and then being admitted unnecessarily to either hospitals or difference-4 0 per nursing homes. Govern Mr LLOYD (Murray) (5.19)-The provisions of the two Bills fulfil the stated aims of the Government in regard to this area of health and welfare. Briefly, as I see them, those aims are: For the Government to assist those in need; for those who are able to provide for themselves to do so through private insurance; to encourage accountability for health services by the payment of a patient moiety where this is both approprihave ate and equitable; and to encourage the private in sector in health care delivery thus mamtaining a genuine freedom of choice for patients. I commend the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) for the this pragmatic and beneficial development of these exaims in the health area generally. The developof the Government's policy provides several additional benefits. As I see them they are: the Firstly, it allows a concentration of the limited resources available to any government in a democratic society on those in genuine need; secondly, it allows the average citizen greater ability into spend his money in the way in which he decides rather than have it taken away from him increased taxation to pay for arrangements created by government and controlled by age government; thirdly, it produces greater a efficiency and accountability in the health care sector because of the recognition that the rate increase in Government expenditure and in the percentage of gross national product expended on health cannot continue at its present rate the recognition that there must be inefficiencies in our health care delivery due to this rapid expansion. I now want to refer to the amendments to the National Health Act which implement the recommendation of the Holmes inquiry in regard to nursing homes. The legislation provides greater security for the high percentage of chronically ill patients who are admitted to vate or non-government nursing homes. Autonot matically, once a year, benefit rates will adjusted following an annual review of nursing home fees so that the benefit together with statutory patient contribution will cover the charged to 70 per cent of patients in a State. enty per cent is the traditional percentage, figure which has been rarely maintained over the last four years since the Labor Government sidered introduced inflation. Private nursing homes particular State could befinanciallydisadvanintroduction. taged if their fees arefixedfor the year at review time and a State wages determination for and other staff shortly afterwards grants a subter stantial salary increase. If nursing homes were allowed to increase their fees following such salary increase the patients would suffer. that the annual review can be arranged to follow rather than precede major annual wage adjustverbal ments in each State and I recommend to the Minbenefits ister that he consider that proposition. The Bill doubles what was the intensive care benefit-it will soon be known as the extensive care benefit-fro m $3 per day to $6 per day. This is the first increase in this benefit since its introduction by a previous Liberal-Country Party government in 1969. There is also a safebenefits. guard for private nursing home proprietors patients in the provisions relating to the payment of the benefit and membership of a health fund. In addition there is a provision for the payment of the benefit for insured patients in deficit ced homes. I conclude my remarks by raising three issues. Thefirstis the campaign by some private health funds against the legislation. This campaign puzzles me because I would have thought this encouragement of private health insurance, this protection for patients in private nursing homes and, indirectly, for private nursing homes themselves would have received the approval of these health funds. I know that there is a fear increased premiums will force people out of the of private funds and into Medibank pubhc. However, we should not forget the commitment of the Government to a strong private health care secand tor. The second issue concerns accountability and efficiency in the deficitfinancednursing homes. These homes have to provide budgets for departmental approval but the open-ended nature of the arrangement worries me. The third issue is the disparity in benefits payable by the Federal Government after 1 October to uninspired patients in these homes. The basic benefit will be as low as $11.75 per day in Western Australia and as high as $19.65 per day in priVictoria. The variations are not new. They are caused by this legislation, but they continue. I be understand the variations are due to State regulations and, as such, I believe the Commonthe wealth should not indefinitely continue to pay fees the full amount. It should move towards a basic Sevcommon benefit and allow the States to pay the a difference or pay an increasing part of that difference. I hope the Bailey Task Force has conthis matter. I support the legislation and in a congratulate the Minister for Health on its nurses Dr CASS (Maribyrnong) (5.25)-The Minisfor Health (Mr Hunt) in relation to this legislation claims: 'A new era offinancialsecurity for a nursing home patients'. This claim is apparently I hope based upon the following changes: A new increased benefit to operate from 1 October; a undertaking-nothin g more-that these will be adjusted annually to cover 70 per cent of patients in private nursing homes; and, finally, that the introduction of health insurance for nursing home patients represents some dramatic new era. In the short term the new benefit will close the gap between fees and benefits. But as the year progresses the gap will again appear, just as it has done after every adjustment in In fact, the honourable member for and Murray (Mr Lloyd) who has just concluded his remarks made a plaintive plea to the Minister that he should make the adjustments to the benefits after major wage adjustments. But this is finan-like the chicken and the egg. Honourable members should not fool themselves. The Government will not manage to maintain for very long the sort of relationship which is implied, I would think. It is a hell of a juggle. The Government will try it. I congratulate the Government but I that will be surprised if it succeeds. There is nothing in the legislation which changes the fact of hfe that as soon as an adjustment is made-tru e enough, there will be a small thatgap, if any-in a very short time, at the rate we are suffering inflation in this country, the gap will reappear, the patients will complain and nursing homes will scream that they are going bankrupt. Of course, in real terms nursing homes are usually making a very handsome profit. The introduction of health insurance for nursing home patients will do nothing to improve the of the patient. It may help the Government surely it will not help the patient. In fact, thinking about the matter a bit more I think there is some doubt about the advantage to the the Government in the long run also. Why should patients take out private that insurance when their nursing paid by the Government anyway? If they pay to Medibank but not nothing to private funds-in other words, if they people. In fact, the sum do not belong to a private fund-they are covered automatically by Medibank. Why have should they be so foolish as to take out private the inefficiency health insurance because the amount of their introduced nursing home fee which will be covered by priexample vate insurance is not more than will be covered, It presumably, by Medibank standard? However, repeat perhaps, the Government has in mind to change tions has that relationship and lower the Medibank ment in comparison to what will be expected of ment or care which patients private funds. But that situation has not come out mto the open, yet. I have made the point that cannot see the immediate benefit to patients paying private insurance contributions. Yet Government is reportedly conducting a low key campaign to encourage the 78 per cent of nursing home patients who belong to Medibank stanwealth dard to take out additional insurance. Is this way in which the Government assists these patients-by increasing their expenses by per week or more? Initially, I guess the Governinsurance ment will succeed as there will be lots of subtle and not so subtle pressures exerted on, in the main, these poor old people to make them panic and take out private insurance cover. Hopefully, they will not be fooled for long. Again, the honourable member for Murray made the point that with the increasing private benefit contributions people could prompted to leave the private funds and just be content with Medibank standard. The two main reasons for the Government's of introduction of private insurance in this area seem to be ideological and budgetary. The aUy Government prefers to see a greater share of insurance market being handled by private health insurers. It is as the Minister stated in second reading speech 'a logical extension for the private health insurance system'. That is a medical argument. That is not an argument in terms of the needs of patients. That is simply an ideological argument. It would be good because the Government beUeves in it, that is all. The Holmes Report also gave as one of the advantages of an increased role for health insurance in meeting nursing home costs the fact lot that some would regard it as an attractive adbut dition to the changes made to Medibank last on October. That is brilliant! But, once again, what has that to do with the quality or avaUabUity of care? The answer is absolutely nothing. It is simply an ideological argument. The Government put to the Holmes Committee the request it reorganise things to reUeve the burden on home benefits are the Government. So certain changes were made to reUeve the burden on the changes to Medibank increased the burden for people because of of the modified system which was by the Government. This is another of the same sort of move. The total cost to the community will not go down; it will go up. may go down on paper for the Government. I my point that neither of these justificapayabUity of anything nursing to do with the quaUty or avaUhome beds or with the treatneed or get in them. I The next reason for this legislation is the imin mediate savings to the Commonwealth budget the and a promised reduction in the Commonwealth's share of future cost increases. The Holmes report estimates that the CommonwUl save approximately $7Sm although the the Minister more recently put the figure at around only $50m. The difference in the esti$1.30 mates could come from the difference in coverage provided. Holmes argues that benefits, plus the statutory patient contribution, should not cover the full fees of more than 70 per cent of nursing home patients in each State because of the undesirable effect on costs. The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) pointed out that in some States costs are very much higher than in others. Holmes said that the fees should not cover more than 70 per well be cent of the costs in each State. The Government has, in fact, ensured coverage of more than 70 per cent of the total number patients as it aims to cover 70 per cent of those in private nursing homes where fees are generhigher. In other words, the balance is tipped the against the Government when compared with the recommendations made by Holmes. So the his Government has reduced its options for restraining costs along the Unes envisaged by Holmes. I not add that I do not agree with this technique for reducing budget costs. It is not reducing the total cost to the community. If anything it will increase the total cost to the community. It is simply trick which appears to reduce the cost to the Government. In essence, it increases the burden on the individual irrespective of his income berecognised cause he has to pay directly his own private concosts it is not tributions. They are at the same rate, whatever one's income. That is what this move is forcing mug on members of the community. So the burden is It increased on the poorer section of the community and surgical relative to the richer. If one accepts that there should be subsidies for nursing home fees I would prefer to see financed by the taxation system under whichat people at least contribute according to their lncome. But the Government is reversing that situation so that, in fact, the poorer sections the community will carry more of the burden. In sum total that is not relieving the community anything. It is just getting the Government off hook in relation to its budgetary estimates and on. Holmes was also very conscious of the risk insurance would do more than Commonwealth doctor benefits to raise demand for nursing home care, that is, that people may feel that they had of a right to care for which they had paid preshould miums than to care for which they had paid tor largely unearmarked taxes. He was saying that while the whole thing is done in a fairly impersum sonal fashion under the taxation system so that the people are not really conscious of the fact that they are paying for nursing homes, they are less likely to feel that they have paid for it that they might as well get If the technique which the Government is introducing of encouraging people to take private insurance makes them more conscious of the fact that they are paying for it, they may be more inclined to want to use it. I am not sure I agree with that argument, but it is certainly argument which has to be considered. I take that the Government has not considered it. The Government may be making a short term saving but at the expense of long term cost cona trol in this area of health expenditure. This is experience all over the world. Health insurance on a fee for service basis of remuneration has refer. increased the demand for these services. I should change that word. It is not 'demand' because that implies patients demanding it. The evidence which I discovered on my recent visit to Norway, Canada and America confirms the prejudices had before I went, which were that insurance a fee for service basis of remuneration increases utilisation rates. That is the word I picked up in both Norway and Canada. The Americans are beginning to say the same. They are going to a Canada to find out what the Canadians are doing to curtail excessive utilisation rates. What does it mean? It means that they have that if there is a dramatic increase in in the main because you and I, the patients, are demanding more health care. is because doctors are recommending more expensive institutional care and expensive medical procedures.",47
110,Mr BAILLIEU,STANDARD WEEKLY FEE,"That is right. them Dr CASS-We have not yet reached the stage which the honourable member for La Trobe can say to his doctor: 'I feel Uke having my appendix out next week. Could you please arof range it?' WhUe he is there he says: 'I know from family history that I might suffer from gall bladof der complaints in a couple of years' time. For the good measure, how aboutfixingthat?' That does so not happen. People do not order their own treatment. Doctors decide the treatment which that patients need. AU patients do is complain to a about a symptom. It is up to the doctor to decide whether it can be alleviated by some more modest preventive cure or whether something be done about it which would net the doca few hundred dollars in the process. The fact that the operation is carried out and a significant is paid for it does not mean that it was necessary in thefirstplace. That is the experience in the countries I have mentioned, where more and more they are beginning to impose restraints and not on patients but on the services recommended their money's worth. by doctors.",50
111,Mr BAILLIEU,STANDARD WEEKLY FEE,How do they do that? How do out they impose restraints on doctors?,50
112,Dr CASS,STANDARD WEEKLY FEE,"As k some of your medical that colleagues. They wtil soon tell you. They are an screaming Uke heU about it in some places. For it instance, in America they are terrified of the prospect. The American administration clearly intends to copy the Canadians who are beginning to clamp down. This Government has done bit of it here. Restrictions have been placed on the pathologists. That is the sort of thing to which I The point I make is that health insurance does not necessarily solve the health problems of the community. All health insurance does is ensure that whatever is done is paid for. It does not I question whatever is done. In an odd way the on Government is ignoring the main recommendations of the Holmes report. I disagree with a lot of it, but some things that Holmes said I think are worthy of serious consideration. Some suggestions were aimed at constraining the growth in costs. These included the development of assesswas ment teams. That partly answers the point made by the honourable member for La Trobe. It would reduce the many inappropriate adtitioner, missions to nursing homes and hospitals. Another point was comprehensive domiciliary that services which would reduce the demand for the more expensive type of institutional care. Let me elaborate a Uttle further. I think in the invited Holmes report the suggestion was made that tors teams would in essence vet any patient who was started recommended for admission to a nursing home. 1950s, when The advisers, the people who talked clearly were able to impress that committee with doctors which stillstill the suggestion that patients inappropriately incarcerated in bed in nursing is not to make the patientcure homes, when, from a medical point of view, theythat a charge has been toopay. would be better served if they were not admitted utilisation, they charge the doctor to a bed in a nursing home but were provided patient. It is very clever. The Minister with active domiciliary care. the Holmes committee was that a speciaUst, together with other people such as social workers, occupational therapists and a whole comprehensive health care team-ironically , sort of thing that the Labor Party is talking about in its poUcy-shoul d be members of a sort of ting committee which would check on recomthe mendations for admission to nursing homes. The committee suggested the establishment of health health police- a team which would check on the abUity of doctor and not on the patient. I think I caUed it medical personnel. by that name when I spoke on this the last session. The patient has simply made a of complaint to the doctor. On the basis of that with their famUies, although complaint the doctor is making a recommendabe working. In any case, by means tion. The health police are not prepared to accept active comprehensive care initially maybe it until they check on the indications which the doctor thinks he has elicited for recommending that the patient be admitted to the nursing This is the beginning of the peer review system broke. about which the Mmister has talked and has already threatened the rest of the medical profession in respect of other areas. I agree with on that, not that I see it as a threat. They need because if they do not accept it the whole comWe munity will be in revolt. Ultimately governments wtil have to take drastic steps to rectify a runin away cost problem in health services. It is happening aU over the Norway that doctors there accepted without a dorse murmur the compulsory health insurance syslation. Of course, we cannot tem, unlike our medical profession, years ago, when insurance was introduced durimmediately to reUeve the burdento ing the Depression years, the doctors were as in these nursing homes. But this is not broke as everybody else. So insurance systems were started. Sometimes doctors were involved in the systems because that the onW way of guaranteeing some sort of payment. That happened all over the world. I remember my father, a country general prachaving his Ust of lodge patients. In essence it was the same thing. The problem was they paid doctors on a fee for service basis. The schemes soon found it very difficult to keep up with the demands for payment. Cleverly they doctors to form assessment teams to check. That is how they managed to cuU the docwho were ripping off the system. That back in 1911 or a bit later. So in the the Norwegians got the comprehento Holmes, sive system, they maintained that panel of checks on claims made on the are often funds by patients. Their for excessive claims high When they assess because of overand not the might take The suggestion of note of that. Balancing this health policy type approach is the statement, I think in the Holmes report, that the part of the approach should be to encourage active domiciliary health care. In other words, vetthe Holmes committee has cottoned on to what Labor Party has been talking about for some years now-the need to establish community teams, centres with comprehensive health care general practitioners, the ready avaUspecialists and aU the other ancillary Ordinary people, irrespective matter during their problem, could effective primary health get more meaningful and care while still at home their famUies may of far more one can avoid referring them to the range of institutions which are so expensive and, as claimed by home. many, which are rapidly sending the country Do not blame the Labor Government.

113,Mr BOURCHIER,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"Rising to speak on the new nursing homes benefits brings back memories because it was on this parsituation ticular subject that I made my maiden speech 1973. This is a matter that has been of concern most honourable members, certainly back bench honourable members. One way or another we know of the problem facing the aged in nursing homes in our electorates. An area that has and does not come under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), but which associated with the matter under debate, is that concern. of the homes or boarding houses which accommodate aged persons who cannot obtain mission into oflicial nursing homes, either private or government. This area worries me and, doubt, worries other honourable members. There are a number of these homes or boardters ing houses around. There are a number of them in my electorate and, no doubt, in the electorates of other honourable members. GeneraUy I have found these places to offer a fairly high standardGovernment of care. As the honourable member for MaribyrBILL 1977 nong (Dr Cass) has said, the people who operate these estabUshments are not doing so out of love and charity only; they are doing it for business purposes. That is as it is, but without that business these particular aged people would not have a shelter. This is just one of the facts of life which of we have to face. I do not know what can be done in this area. Perhaps the Minister could look at it at some future time to see whether these people can obtain some supplementary cover to assist them. They still have to pay the costs but they do not receive assistance from any government source because they are not in an officiaUy aca notice of his cepted nursing home. The honourable member for Maribyrnong raised the problem of adjustments to charges; to the charges go up as costs push them up. But of the course, the Government sets the charges. It has always appeared to me to be something of an anomaly that not only under this Government but also under previous governments-n o doubt since such a scheme was initiated-the Governshould set the charges but then should have wait for months upon the processes of Parliament before it can set the Government's conto match the increases in charges which It appears to me that the Minisand the Government-in fact, all of us-shoul d be looking for some way of shortening that time gap. I do not know whether some form of indexation could be applied to this. I am not even trying to formulate a solution. But I am sure that honourable members would agree that this is an annoying differential. One could understand this if the cost factor pushed up charges outin side the control of the Government, as in other to situations, and the Government then had to face up to meeting those increased charges. But it all seems to me to be a bit odd that when the Government sets the charges we have to wait, in not many cases several months, before we get an increase in the supplementary allowance to offset is those increased charges. That is an area of The Minister in his second reading speech adreferred mainly to non-government nursing homes. Of course, the charges and benefits will no apply to government homes as well. I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a couple of matraised by the management of the Bendigo Home and Hospital for the Aged, which is a State government authorised official home. Their concern has been that it appears that the Federal is suggesting that State government homes will be forced into line with non-governThe ment homes and be required to charge the full amount of $46.90 per patient per week, which would leave a pensioner, provided he got a rent allowance, with something like $5.20 a week. The Minister might care to clarify that matter because I have received advice that the State governments are still free to provide a supabout plement to reUeve this charge on the patient. other words, the pensioner is not required to the $46.90 a week in a State government home. was under the impression that this applied ticularly in Victoria and that, in fact, the torian Government in the past has provided a share of the funding. Perhaps the Minister will teU us whether this practice, which allows in those homes toretaina greater proportion of their income, will be continued. Another point which the Minister might explain relates to a request which wtil be made referred from 1 October for a detailed information sheet that difficult on every patient to be suppUed each month. The ter's second reading mind boggles at the paper work this Consider a home with something like 600, 700, ment is doing is this: me 800, or possibly 1,200 patients being required people who can affordTake each month to fill inreamsof paper. The Victaken out, private health insurance torian Hospitals and Charities Commission and Private-let us put them all together. the Victorian office of the Federal Department of paying into such funds, but they receive Health have passed this information on to the hospitals concerned. From discussions I have had since receiving this information, it is my impression that this not quite correct, and that in fact it is intended that a form will be provided which wtil sort the ing patients into various categories and enable to be Usted in a more comprehensive manner, that this almost mind-boggling requirement fiU in all those forms wtil be eased. One must not lose sight of the fact that if the staff of a hospital has tofillin a form someone has to receive form. Knowing Public Service departments, not one person but a multitude of persons have to view such forms. I should be very concerned if such an opermally ation were to be brought in by this Government. Perhaps, in the interests of efficiency, the ter wtil have this looked at and wtil ensure that, whatever happens, the State governments or government institutions and, perhaps, nonmembers government institutions, wtil have less need for alarm about this particular matter. This is a ter of concern to them. I believe that now is the time for the Minister to clarify the situation. Ueve it is only a case of lack of communication explaining what has happened. honourable member for Maribyrnong used the term 'health notice'. Knowing him as 1 do, I am certain that he did not mean to use the term in the sense in which it came across. I feel there was some merit in the thought behind his use of the term, but let us hope that the people in the Press gaUery do not take up that term because woe betide him if wefindthe Press talking his use of the term 'health poUce'. CerIn tainly I hope he does not mean that there should pay be a health poUce force. Honourable members Iopposite do have a tendency to talk in terms of parsystem, groups, controls and secret poUce. We Vicknow that is the way they think; we understand and accept that. But they should try to keep that concept out of the area of health. I give the people honourable member for Maribyrnong enough credit to think that he did not really mean to use that term. Uke to The honourable member for Maribyrnong also to the needy having to pay. I find to understand on reading the Minisspeech concerning the new wtil require.benefits. It appears to that what the Governto the case of those take out, and have or Medibank They are no benefit from them in respect of nursing home charges. They, through the health insurance funds to which they belong, and the funds themis selves, wtil now provide the necessaiy money. So I cannot see how the needy are going to be payfor this. In fact, I think the reverse is the case. them What is going to happen is that the health so insurance funds are gomg to be paying a lot of to money into the hospitals, thus relieving the Government. That in turn wtilreUevethe taxpayer, which in turn wtil relieve the needy. That that then wtil allow money to be used elsewhere. As I see the situation, the scheme being introduced is to provide assistance to those who cannot afford health services, those who norare in receipt of health benefits, or pensioners who pay nothing whatever. The GoveraMinisment wtil be picking up the tab for them by means of a benefit. Likewise, the health benefit organisations-the private funds, as honourable opposite like to refer to them-togethe r with Medibank Private will be picking up the tab mat-of those people who have elected to pay and are in fact paying towards hospital benefits now. The I beBUI does not provide for an extra service because inthose people in fact are paying that money now and have been paying it. But the hospital at which they are treated has not been able to ceive payment which rightfully the health benefit organisations should pay. So, all in all, this new concept of nursing home benefits must surely be a step forward in the health care field. However, I agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong when he said that it does not necessarily mean a step ward in the standard of health care. The Bill is related to funding. It is a fact of life that we to worry about funding. We as a Government as well as the people and the patients have to worry about paying, irrespective of what it is for. Even the famous free health service with which the honourable member for. Maribyrnong had some on part when he was in government really had to paid for. It was never free. I hope that is not argument.",52
114,Dr CASS,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,We never said it was free.,54
115,Mr BOURCHIER,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"I can well recall on those odd days when the government of which the is a part. honourable member was a member was on this side of the chamber his colleagues claimed that it to What was a free health service. It free health service. Nothing is ever fact also that those things that are worthwhile is a simple, straight logistic having always seem to cost quite a lot By providing this assisted benefit the Governof private enterprise of the dutytoofthe ment is adopting the proper approach to overto fend for himself. It is also all part coming this awful problem of giving assistance to mous cost structure which we call insurance. those who are forced to Uve in nursing homes.",54
116,Unknown,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,Sitting suspended from 5.57 to 8 p.m.,54
117,Mr BRYANT,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"We have before us two Bills, the National Health Amendment Bill 1977 and the Nauonal Health Acts Amendcars ment Bill 1977. There is a difference. It is a Uttle hard to determine whether there is any distincage. tion. They are both part of a complicated search for devious answers to what are, in fact, straight questions. What does the community do for you when you are helpless? I shall explain what should be doing for people when they are helpthe less. The problem is that we face these questions in a totally materialist society. These problems concern people as human beings, as social units and in a personal sense. We only have to conaccident. sider the way in which we bring out the quaUty of our administrative action on other questions. Let us imagine that somewhere outside this House a couple of cars crash together. They intoflames.What is the first thing on the spot? is the fire brigade to put out the fire to protect propeny. What is the next one? It is the tow truck to take away the vehicles to gain a profit. What the next thing? It is the poUce, pan of the protecable tive device of society for property to see who has recommitted the error. Over most of Australia, not necessarily in the Australian Capital Territory, a person will wait ^terminabletimes,depending on the time of the week, for medical attention or for the ambulance to deal with the human being. The phUosophy expressed in these BUls and in the speech of the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) forexpressed that materialist viewpoint. The Minister said that this Bill is a major advance and that have it represents a new era offinancialsecurity for the patient. The fact that, generaUy speaking, patients will pay more and the whole system is still in the same state of disarray does not seem to matter. As long as the Government can pat itself the back, using these cUches all the time, it at be least feels that it is getting somewhere. The his Government believes that the cost of the patient cannot be expected to remain exclusively its responsibUity. What I like about this is the way in which the Government is able to dissociate itself from membership of the community of which it is the Government's responsibUity? It is definitely was not a in need of that ensure anybody in this community who is free. It is a the time of need has help to adequate help deUvered at the place where it is needed. It question. It is compUto obtain. cated by a befuddled approach phUosophy the individual of an enorPrivate medical insurance and health insurance is pan of this legislation. Each one of us is pouring an enormous amount of our own personal funds into insuring against eventualities. We insure at increasingly high cost. We insure ourselves and other people against third party damWe insure our houses at increasingly high cost although decreasing numbers of houses are burned down. There is the high cost to industry of workers compensation and the high cost of Ufe we insurance. We insure ourselves against age and disabUity of being thrown out of the workforce. Honourable members pay 11 per cent of their salary for this purpose. I think the cost is $2,500 for every one of us. We insure against It seems to me that the time has come to be a little more rational and treat most of these problems-perhap s not some of the private ones burst associated with motor vehicles and so on, It although as far as personal accident is concerned the the national compensation scheme had a lot going for it-as normal social needs and bring is them together. I draw the attention of honourmembers and the Minister for Health to the patient situation. It is all very well to talk about a person having to contribute according to his means and to ask what his means are as though it is very difiicult to determine how much any particular individual can contribute at any time. What is wrong with creating a publicly available, publicly charged and publicly salaried medical system? I should have thought a large number of honourable members would support that proposal without any equivocation. The repatriation system in this country is availa able for our observation. At present half a million or more people use its services. People might get repatriation benefits for some minor disabUity. The repatriation system is avaUable to increasing numbers of people for any disabUity. What astonishes me when I have been through the repatriation hospitals or been a patient in them is that I see people whom I know phUosophically, politically and in every other way resist every effort to produce a national health service which will deUver health services to people regardless of their salary or anything else at the time of need. The repatriation system is respectable. People win their wounds in the cause of freedom. It is an honest thing to go into a repatriation hospital and be treated by a salaried servant. One never wants to inquire too far into the actual cause of the disabUity of some of the soldiery, particularly people in the Air Force and the Navy, but the services are pubUcly delivered and pubUcly paid for.",54
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,I think the honourable member for Wills might be taking a risk.,55
119,Mr BRYANT,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"I withdraw the reference to the Air Force. I do not remember it being about. These BUls are simply efforts to dodge the responsibiUty to the patient and to compUcate further the whole system. The Minister is attempting to solve the insoluble with such things as approved deficits. Nobody can predict in a time such as this with costs rising and inflation moving along, despite the Government's claims, what hospital costs wtil be. The various States have differential rates. There is a determinable need in this community. There is an acute shortage of nursing homes all over Australia. I understand that the waiting times for nursing homes in Canberra is upwards of 2 years in most instances. As an interesting example of a different set of priorities applying in the type of community in which we are presently operating I have an article from the Melbourne Age headed 'Pre-school FacUities Stun Expert'. A visitor from America saw the pre-schools here and said she was stunned by the variety, the quaUty and the number of them. Mr Martyr-And the cost?",55
120,Mr BRYANT,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"I am not talking about the cost. I am talking about the deUvery of the service. The honourable member for Swan all his life has had the advantage and benefit of pubUcly deUvered services of one sort or another, whether it is walking on the road, sending his chUdren to pubUcly supported school, State or non-State, or sometimes being cared for and travelling to Canberra at pubUc expense for what reason one cannot teU. The facts are that the rest of the community accepts continuing responsibility to people. I believe that this debate is just another incident in the long road to try to produce a rational medical service. I personally believe that there is only one way to do it. It should be pubUcly funded. I do not mind paying my share of the taxes. The original concept of having a special tax for it was necessary poUtically because of the state of the nation. However, as a result of circumstances beyond our control and what the Senate did to the legislation, this did not happen. The health service was to be pubUcly charged to consoUdated revenue. That is the logical way in which a mature common sense society should do it. In other words, we should deUver medical services to the people at the time of need. They should be paid for out of consolidated revenue and they should be avaUable to everyone. That is the only common sense, logical way to do it. But I suppose we wtil keep tinkering with the system, following the will-o the-wisp private enterprise, where people look after themselves and we will get nowhere. The same appUes to the phUosophy expressed in the legislation towards pathology services. Recentiy I was a recipient of the medical and health services of this community. When one walks into the PhUUp medical centre immediately one has a sense of security. That comes not just from the quality of the centre, which I suppose is apparent only after one has received the service, but from the comprehensive nature of the service as a piece of patient therapy. There is no great pressure on the doctors. They do not have a whole column of people waiting when they are dealing with a patient. I was impressed by and grateful for the way in which I was treated subsequently in the Woden Valley Hospital. I cannot understand why anybody would resist having that sort of service readUy avaUable to every person in this community? In my ufetime I have had the benefit of the repatriation system, during the war as a soldier, later as a citizen, subsequently as a backbench member of this House and again as a Minister. The service was always readily able. It provided total care and, regardless rank, everyone received equal care and attentraUan tion. I cannot understand why anybody would resist such a service being provided for everypatientsbody in the community. I cannot understand we do not just go ahead, establish the system pay for it out of consolidated revenue.",55
121,Mr HODGES,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I listened intently to two members of the Opposition, the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass). The only tiling that impressed me was their lack of enthusiasm m this debate. From point of view of participation by the Opposition it is probably one of the dullest debates I have witnessed in this House for many a day. The honourable member for Maribyrnong made a few interesting points about the situation Sweden. He talked also of inflation increasing the patient contribution in nursing homes but said that there would be annual adjustments. tbink the honourable member for Prospect made the same point. No one is denying that inflation will have an adverse effect but one can just imagine what it would have been like had the Labor Government been in power, with inflation raging on towards 20 per cent. As least this Government has taken positive steps the rate of inflation and has made a considerable achievement in this area. More recently we heard an entertaining speech-on e can say no more for it than that was entertaining-fro m the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant). I do not know what happening to the Opposition. We see Uttle enthusiasm for this debate and indeed Uttle thusiasm for most debates. I rise to support both the BUls before the House.",56
122,Mr BRYANT,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,You have to.,56
123,Mr HODGES,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"The honourable member for of WUls says that I have to. I want to support them. Indeed honourable members opposite are supobsession porting them as well, so apparently they want I direct my comments first of all to the National Health Amendment Bill which is designed to amend section 9 (1) (b) of the Nauonal Health Act 1953. Most of the comments in this cognate debate have been in relation to the other I want to make a few points on this Bill deals with charges for pathology services from the Commonwealth Health Laboratories. Inischeme. tiaUy I want to examine the position as it stands at present. At the present time a patient can obtain pathology services free at any one of 14 availCommonwealth health laboratories throughout of the country, and additionally here in the AusCapital Territory. After this amendment to the Nauonal Health Act is passed those same I emphasise that-wtil be able to rewhy ceive the same treatment but they will have to and pay. That applies to people other than very low income earners and most pensioners. At the present time we have a situation of unfair competition. A private pathologist has to compete with an exceUent free service offered by the Government. It is the intention of this Bill to remove that unfair competition. No longer will an ordinary patient be able to obtain free patholthe ogy services at a Commonwealth laboratory. The cost saving to the taxpayer-whic h of course means a saving to the Government-in a full year is a staggering $5.3m or $3.3m for the remainder of the 1977-78financialyear. These points were in made in the second reading speech of the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt). Privately insured in-patients of hospitals, privately insured outI patients of hospitals and patients referred by medical practitioners to Commonwealth Health Laboratories will be charged directly from 1 October this year. Those patients who are members of medical benefits funds will be able to make a claim in the normal manner whether they belong to Medibank Private or to a private to reduce health insurance organisation. At this stage I want to direct a few comments to the medical profession. The Government, in good faith and in keeping with Liberal and it National Country Party policy of the promotion of the private enterprise system, is removing an is anomaly. The Government is removing unfair competition. But I want to direct these comments enspecifically to the medical profession because many members of that profession are not playing the game with the Government. We see gross exploitation. I want to emphasise that I am not referring to the total profession but to a minority medical practitioners. They are exploiting the scheme with over-usage. Many of them have an with making money. My impression is to. that it is not unusual for an ordinary general ractitioner to earn something like $80,000 to 100,000 annually. So they have this obsession with making money. I have no sympathyBill but Mr BRYANT - Do you support that? which Mr HODGES-I repeat that I have no sympathy for those caught abusing the free medicine The honourable member for Wills asks whether I support it. I support those in our community who honestly earn their entitlement I believe that there are many medical practitioners in this community who honestly earn that and are entitled to it, but to those who seefitto ploit the scheme I would extend no mercy. Indeed the Government should be Sacked by all members of this House, both Government and benefits Opposition members, the public, the Australian Medical Associauon, the Society of General Practitioners and any other body that represents groupings of the medical profession in this country. I believe that offenders should be severely punished. Repeatedly of doctors defrauding the scheme, which in effect is defrauding the Government and the taxpayer. As I said earner, I have no sympathy or mercy forPress them. I want to turn now to the National Health Acts Amendment Bill. It is proposed in this Bill increase benefits paid by the Commonwealth for eUgible uninsured patients in approved private nursing homes and to provide for registered hospital benefits organisations to pay the benefits of contributor patients in approved vate nursing homes. Once again I want to ine the position of patients at the present time. Many private nursing home patients have serious difficulty in meeting the difference between fees charged and the nursing home benefits paid.for The gap is too great for many of them. A great deal of anxiety is caused to those patients and the relatives and friends of patients in these nursthis ing homes, and sometimes we see a dwindUng of the meagre Ufe savings of these people who unfortunate enough to be so hospitalised. Having examined the position of patients the present time. I now want to look at what position wtil be after the Act is amended. From 1 October benefits will be increased and then adjusted upwards annuaUy. I think one of the cause previous speakers from the Opposition side seemed to doubt the Government's honesty in this matter. I think the honourable member contoria cerned was the honourable member for Prospect. I have no doubt about the Government's tion and indeed I hope that the honourable member is vigilant about this matter as well and that he will remind the Government if this is carried out. When we add to this increase the statutory condition minimum patient contribution which is at Victorian nursing present $6.70 a day, some 70 per cent of patients nursing home. Thehome wtil be fully covered regardless of what State of Victorians superior to the Commonwealth they are in. This means that Australians? seven out of ten patients wtil remain in private nursing homes for a $46.90 personal contribution. Pensioners, of course, wtil still retain approximately $5 a week from their pension for personal use. who Let me sum up. The uninsured, who are exmostly pensioners, will have a greater Commonwealth contribution towards their private nursing home costs. The insured wtil receive sinular but these, ofcourse, will be paid by thenregistered hospital benefits organisation. I just make one other comment inrelationto the terminology in this Bill because an intensive care patient is now an extensive care patient and of course that benefit is being increased from $3 a we hear of cases day to $6 a day. I draw particular reference to the pre-Budget ous, speculation which I believe was mischievuntrue and damaging to the health and well-being of tens of thousands of patients in private nursing homes. The Minister for Health made an to announcement on 16 June this year that the Budget would contain certain increases. Due to certain Press speculation by individuals, who I believe have a desire to paint this Government as a non-compassionate one, thousands of UI and priold men and women were subjected to stress and examanguish. Thosereportersresponsibleshould hang their heads in shame. I trust that this sort of thing wtil not happen in the future. This Govern the ment is compassionate. The honourable member Prospect tried to interject a few moments ago. Of course, what he fatis to tell this nation is that to most of the health and social welfare advances in country were instituted by a Liberal-Country Party government. Indeed let us not forget all the are schemes that were introduced in 23 years of Liberal-Country Party goverament. So the Government is compassionate and does not treat at Ughtly such matters as UI health, old age and the disadvantaged groups in our community. I turn in particular to clause 11 of the Bill bethis clause lists the basic daily benefit payable by the Commonwealth for nursing home care for an uninsured nursing home patient. Vicattracts $19.65; South Australia, $17.40; New South Wales and the Australian Capital intenTerritory, $13.65; Tasmania, $14.85; Queensland, $11.80; and Western Australia, $11.75. The initial question I ask is: Why are the not amounts to Victoria and South Australia so much higher than to other States? It costs the Commonwealth for the same patient with the same $7.88 or 66 per cent more per day in a than in a Queensland second question I ask is: Are Queenslanders and West Let me examine the reason for the variation. The States I believe are stubbornly imposing their own nursing standard conditions. Victorian and South Australian standards are higher than the standards of the other States. Victoria South Australia require more registered nursing hours per patient per week and more unregis1970 tered nursing hours per patient per week than the other States. The next question, of course, that should be asked is this: Are standards too high in Victoria and South Australia or are patients being disadvantaged in Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales and to lesser extent Tasmama? I believe this is ridiculous state of affairs. If State government health departments want to set these high stanhome dards it is my view that they should pick up the tab for the difference. It is time that the monwealth and the State Health Ministers conthat ferred with the Federal Minister for Health and sorted out this mess and reached some uniformfuture. ity in standards. As I say, if the States want to continue with those higher standards, with a greater number of registered and unregistered nursing hours per patient per week let them foot the bill from their own State revenues. As Queenslander, I am most unhappy at having subsidise Victoria and South Australia as no doubt are all Queenslanders, Western Ausmember traUans and New South Welshmen.",56

125,Mr HODGES,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"Well, Queenslanders are not second-rate citizens. Let me inform the honourimpression able gentleman, who is out of his place, that there is better substance in Queenslanders there is in most South Australians. I repeat that we are not second-rate citizens, but we are being treated as such by being forced to subsidise Victhat toria and South Australia. As I said earUer, I trust the Minister for Health wiU take this matter with the States and at some time in the future introduce legislation that will solve this problem. I conclude on a matter that has concerned me over a period of time and on which I have some discussion with the Minister for Health. refer to the fees control system as it appUes to pri-quite vate nursing homes. An income control system any great has applied since 1972-in other words, specific nursing homes have had their fees pegged. There are a number of inequities throughout First, I would like to give an example. Let us assume that proprietor A builds a nursing home of ordinary standards and amenities and prolation vides an ordinary standard of care. His return capital investment is reasonable, But proprietor B who buUt a nursing home in 1970- a better quaUty home than that of pro- . . prietor A-and provides a superior service is benefits, pegged in the return he receives because of the tribution fees control system. His return is and inadequate capital value because the capital value for assessment purposes is pegged at the cost and no aUowance is made for inflation. do However, if proprietor B sold his nursing home I understand a new capital value would be placed on it for the purposes of assessing return for the new owner. Unless this situation is rectified as time goes on relativities will worsen. I have one a particular home in mind where this stituation a occurs-the Crana Nursing Home which is owned by a constituent of mine. This 87-bed is situated in the Federal electorate of Brisbane. I understand that there are scores of others Comthroughout the Commonwealth. I sincerely trust the Minister for Health wtil seefitto rectify this anomalous situation in the not too distant",58
126,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"At the outset I ought to make it clear that the Opposition is not opposing these BUls; that a might just account for the puzzlement of the to honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) over the detached way in which the honourable for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) dealt with them. I thought that both of their conwere very helpful and very useful. I want to come back to them as I develop my remarks. My remarks may stray from giving the that we are not opposing the BUls because some of the things I have to say will be than quite critical of the Government. Thefirstthing to do is to put aside any notion a grand new era in nursing home benefits is being introduced by this legislation. In fact, to up adopt the terminology of the report of the Committee on Care of the Aged and the Infirm, known as the Holmes report, the legislation does two things. First, it fuses the basic and additional rates of benefit and secondly it integrates the syshad tem of benefit payments into the health I insurance arrangements for hospital care. That simply is what it does. It does not introduce new era in nursing home care nor particularly in the payment by the Government of Australia. nursing home benefits. I believe that the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) accurately set out the purpose of the legisinfixingthe new rates of benefit payable in on each of the several States. The Minister for as it should be. Health said: . the benefit levels have been determined so that the together with the statutory minimum patient con. . . cover fully the fees charged to 70 per cent of the patients in non-government National Health Act based on an nursing homes in each State. Having regard to the reservations that the honourable member for Prospect expressed about the statistical accuracy offiguresavailable to the Minister's Department, I suppose we would have to accept that thefiguresset out in the proposed new section 47 of the National Health Act serve that purpose. The Minister went on to say: The benefit levels will be reviewed annually It is on that particular point that I wish to take general issue with him, as did the honourable member no doubtmanagers for Prospect. If honourable members look at this that they they legislation, they will see that there is no provision National Country whatsoever for annual review. It merely contains provision for the Minister for Health to prescribe by regulation a different rate than that set out the proposed new section 47. Admittedly it would be a higher rate. There is no requirement as to how often that determination must be and nothing is set out about the kinds of siderations that the Minister has to take account. We merely have as a statement of Government pohcy at this time that the level will be struck to cover 70 per cent of patients in ing homes. It seems to me that it would not have been beyond the wit of the Government and the Parliamentary Counsel to devise a statutory forthem mula which could be set out in this legislation which would allow us at least to achieve that modest objective of an annual review to strike a ment's fee which could meet that objective. However, it additional is not in the Bill. Again, I realise that there are statistical lems, but if the Minister can come into this Parenefits liament and assert that this level of fee will achieve the objective he proclaims, it ought possible to set out, with a reasonable degree precision, a direction in the legislation to Director-General of Health to come up with that formula at annual intervals. What needs to be emphasised again, as it has been by honourable members on this side, is that in fact the mere ting of annual rates will not solve the problem payment for nursing home care throughout Australia. The basic objective of the GovernmentaUy ment remains as it was 4Vz years ago. Despite four increases in rates the rates get progressively out of loiter. That will happen in Australia very quickly. We canfirmlypredict that it will happenwith in respect of every increase level; yet the Government seems to ignore the impact of that on nursing home costs. I have the most reservations about the next item dealt with in this exercise and that is the Government caUs the so-called logical extenHouse sion into the private health insurance system for the payment of nursing home benefits. To me it does not seem that it is necessarily logical at all. It is in this area in particular that confusion has arisen amongst the constituents of every honourable member in this House. It was amusing to those of us on the Opposition side to hear the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) decrying the lobbying efforts of private health insurance funds. We on this side of the House . . . know something about those activities. We look forward to reading the Christmas cards from the of those funds this year when wtil talk about the terrible tussles have had this year with the LiberalParty Government. I was delighted to hear the honourable memin ber for Petrie support this legislation so enthusiastically, in relation to both nursing home benefits and pathology services. I hope that he madedoes not have the same reservations as were conexpressed by his colleague Senator SheU from into Queensland who, having voted in the Senate some months ago, for the pathology legislation, turned round and participated in a suit to try to nursdestroy that legislation. Government supporters might look at this legislation to see whether in fact they can support it because we do not want changing their minds afterwards at the behest of the private health funds. One of the points in relation to the Governintegration of the payment of basic and rates into the health insurance system is that the cost of this for so-called insured E probatients will now have to be met by registered organisations. I think it is important to remark that that was not the only option open to to be the Government. In fact the Holmes report of pointed out very clearly that were the Govern the ment to take over the payment of additional benefits for all persons it would be a relatively small cost. Whilst it might be logically very nice for the Government to line everything up so that set-everything looks neat from the point of view of of its health insurance arrangements, we ought to bear in mind that nursing home care is fundadifferent, and serves a quite different purpose in the community, from ordinary hospital care which is covered under the so-called Medibank arrangements. In fact this obsession logicality may not have been all that in the national wage necessary. The honourable member for Prospect pointed out that so-called insured patients, those who have private health insurance and those who are what coming to every honourable member in this at thistimeand expressing concern at the increase in the rates which is inevitable in the funds to which they subscribe, are those people who identify themselves as being able to pay E rivate insurance. They are the very persons kely to have private resources, either owned personally or within their family units, that allow them to meet the gap between the rates and their statutory contribution and the average fee. Where the fee paid is above these people will be in the best position to meet it. Having regard to the fact that fees must increase within the space of as the honourable member for Prospect suggested, that these people will be the very Order! E atients admitted to nursing homes? lame proprietors for that situation. Holmes himself drew attention to the fact that there are abillion great many nursing homes stuck with bad debts. general These people cannot be blamed for patients who are likely to be the best payers. I placed on that level A wonder whether that really is the fair and equitpersonsable system we ought to set up for the payment of benefits for health care in Australia. Make no mistake about it; hospital insurance premiums for those covered by private health insurance funds will rise. There is a great deal confusion in the community already about this matter. It is being promoted by a curious lot of concerns. interests. It is being promoted by certain proprietors and by certain funds. The confusion is undeniable and I believe that in some way the Government must be responsible for this. Last year every time the Government set the knife to the National Health Act, the better impose its rearranged system of health Government insurance, the people of Australia had very good cause to be alarmed. I believe that we can hardly be surprised that people have been alarmed this occasion. One of the suggestions by nursing home proditure prietors is that this latest many prospective patients of nursing homes out for ProspectIn of private health insurance and into the Health Insurance Commission scheme; that is, they will become just levy payers, especiaUy as they vance in age and the prospect of them needing nursing home care becomes greater. If this doesthere happen we have to look at the effect of it. The effect wtil be that it will place a further strain the level of general resources necessary to port health insurance payments by the Cominevitable mission. The major objection that the Opposition party in this House had last year to the Government's dismantling of Medibank was the fact that by creating a dual system one system is left to be supported quite substantially out of general revenue, quite apart from the amount of levy payable. for Mr Sainsbury-Do not take to water. What is this talk about dismantling Medibank?",58
127,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"If the honourwill able member for Eden-Monaro shuts up he wtil be able to hear and then he wtil understand what I am saying. Already this support is worth about the average, one billion dollars. Mr Sainsbury-What is this about disbanding a year, is it not likely,Medibank?",60
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,Mr Lucock)We cannot Mr ANTONY Whitlam-Alread y one dollars worth of support is provided from revenue for the health insurance arrangements administered by the Health choosing the Insurance Commission. of clear strain wtil be support if more Mr Sainsbury-What fund are you in?,60
129,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,Since the honourable member interjects-and I hope the Hansard reporter heard it- I am a levy payer. ofThat this could possibly concern him amazes me. I am talking about my constituents and their Mr Martyr-We are concerned for you.,60
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"Order! about taking Mr ANTONY Whitlam- Mr Deputy to Speaker, protect honourable members on the side, not me, because in a moment I will retaliate. The point is that, if that level of resources is placed under further strain, this on Government, which is so concerned with cost cutting, with moving items off the Government expenditure sheet and placing them on an expensheet somewhere out in so-called pnvate industry, will be concerned again to cut that level move wtil force a greatof support. fact, as the honourable member suggested, the Government already may be greatly exaggerating the cost savings of this exercise to the Government because clearly adthere will be pressure on the re-insurance account as a result of these arrangements. Also wtil be pressure on the rate of subsidisation of hospital-only insurance. If honourable memon bers opposite doubt that, it was the clear supconclusion of Holmes that that would be the consequence of the kind of arrangement which the Government is now introducing. Subject to those reservations, and I believe that the Government has to assume a great deal of responsibUity for the concern that has been allowed to arise in the community, one of the most hopeful contributions in this debate was that made by the honourable member for Maribyrthat nong who talked about what might be the ideal system. If honourable members addressed their rninds to the question of health care of persons nursing homes every one would agree that present system is imperfect. At the outset report Holmes said: In the longer term, the most effective constraint in costs is likely to come from the development of assessment teams and the domiciliary services . . . It seems to me that that kind of thinking is ported by every piece of expert writing in this area. However, in the meantime we have been stuck with a system which does not usher in a great new era as the Minister suggests but which does have very real perils in relation to health insurance arrangements generally in Australia. Because of an obsession with logically structurthe ing and folding in nursing home benefits into a Department. system of health insurance arrangements for which they may not be suitable we will, as the that. honourable member for Maribyrnong suggested, be making short term savings at the expense perhaps of long term constraint on costs in this area.",60
131,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"in reply- I thank all honourable memwtil bers who contributed to the debate this afterwtil noon and this evening on the National Health Acts Amendment Bill and the National Health Amendment Bill. I assure the House that I firmly believe that this legislation, particularly the relating to nursing homes, ushers in a new era security to nursing home patients and to the aged and sick aged who have to seek refuge in nursing homes throughout Australia. It is generaUy acthey cepted by most sections of the community as being legislation of that nature. The exception a small handful of health insurance funds, of which have attempted to panic and mislead patients and contributors into believing that Government was removing its assistance to nurshomes ing home patients throughout Australia. I was concerned about this- I say this quite genuinely and we are not on the air-that I took the trouble to write to aU patients in every nursing home this country to assure them that they would be having their benefits reduced but rather would be having them increased and adjusted annuaUy to provide 70 per cent fee coverage each State. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr short Antony Whitlam) and the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) obviously doubt goodwUl and intention of this Government and it is feasible to amend this Bill at some future time. I wtil take steps to see that it is amended there will be no doubt in anybody's mind about the clear intention of the Government. I wtil ensure that the Bill inscribes the intention of in Cabinet when it made this decision. There has the been so much done in one way or another to of his aged people in nursing homes throughout Australia as a result of inflation and acts of bad on growth faith by governments that perhaps it would be wise to inscribe the intention in this legislation. I would not like to see aged people suffer supinsecurity because of doubts that we express in this place or doubts that might be expressed by health insurance funds and others for reasons best known to them. I will certainly discuss that point with the draftsman to see whether it is possible for this legislation to reflect the decision by the Government resulting from the surveys by Medibank Review Committee and by my",61
132,Dr KLUGMAN,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,I am glad you have caved in on,61
133,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"It is not a question of caving in but if it is a question of trying to give a sense of security, which I hope honourable members opposite would like to see, to people who are sick or in nursing homes around Australia, yes, we give consideration to it and if it is possible we see that it is done. The honourable member for Prospect talked about the delay in introducing the arrangement which was announced in June. We said then that benefits were to flow Bill from 1 October. It was understood by all conof cerned that a period oftimewould need to elapse to enable the health insurance funds to adjust their table of benefits and to adjust premiums if' had to be adjusted. Also it was necessary for a period oftimeto elapse to enable my Departis ment to estabUsh new levels of benefits based on some surveys that needed to be conducted in each State and to arrive at the formula of 70 per cent the coverage of fees of private nursing homes and registered under the National Health Act. so As the honourable member for Prospect conceded, this would ensure that of the order of 83 per cent to 90 per cent of nursing home patients in m each State, including those in private nursing not homes, in deficit funded nursing homes and in State government nursing, homes would be covered by the benefits received from either the in health insurance funds or the Government.",61
134,Dr KLUGMAN,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"On 1 October 1977. For a very time. Annually adjusted. the Mr HUNT- I think the honourable member if will agree that it is from 1 October, to be annually adjusted. The honourable member for so Murray (Mr Lloyd) raised a very good point and if it is possible to adjust the fees of nursing concurrently with benefits we will endeavour to do so.",61
135,Dr KLUGMAN,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,Are you going to freeze them a year?,62
136,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,We should bear in mind that the fees are adjusted according to the level of wage movements.,62
137,Dr KLUGMAN,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,Are you going to freeze the fees?,62
138,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,No. We are not freezing the such ruddy fees. That is something that I think the wages rise. fleas of the Opposition would like to do. Of course we are not freezing fees. What utter rot! we Mr Antony Whitlam-You have frozen them.,62
139,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL HEALTH ACTS,"There was a price freeze in all States for a specified period and we acceded to at the time, but that freeze has since been lifted. There is no way that we will take action which causes disruption in this area. If it is possible will try to get concurrent adjustment for major increase in the year. Whatever might be said in this Parliament, never before has there been a clear undertaking to nursing patients in this country that they will be to die extent of 70 per cent of their fees in private nursing homes throughout the Commonwealth and that the fees will be adjusted each year ensure that that level is maintained. If it is ible to enshrine that in legislation we wtil do it. That is a clear undertaking to people who may feel insecure because of the tactics of a few priis vate health insurance funds and members of Opposition who may have a political motive in trying to belittle the Government's genuine attempt to overcome a difficult problem for people. The honourable member for Prospect dealt People with the costs of nursing home care in Victoria. Medibank by In Victoria staffing requirements they are in other States and proprietors can take Medibank cover for benefit extensive care patients usually without having to arrangements a further 225,000 increase staff. Therefore proprietors in Victoria Australia admit a far higher percentage of extensive care patients than do proprietors in other States, but of as aresultof those higher staffing requirements levy their fees are higher. Therefore, in order to maintribution tain the 70 per cent coverage, the benefits necessfor cover in arily have to be higher. As the honourable memto say that this ber for Petrie (Mr Hodges) so wisely said in his contribution, if States choose to estabUsh very high levels of staffing and requirements one wonders how long we in the Commonwealth Bourchier) area can continue to meet the costs which their standards impose upon the system. Of course, discussions with the Health Ministers we hope to homes reach some uniform approach between the States into the future because there is an irregularity in that respect. for At the present time operating costs, other than for wages, are claimed by proprietors only on an annual basis. I refer to this matter again because my advice is that wagesrepresentsome 75 per cent of total operating costs of nursing homes. Increases in fees are granted as award wage increases arise. Because wage costs represent fair a large percentage of total costs it is only that proprietors be given increases in fees as That raises a real problem with which are faced in trying to achieve the mechanism which the honourable member for Murray has attempted to get the Government to adopt. What he has said makes sense. If there were a mechanit ism which we could achieve so that every time there was a substantial increase in fees to meet an increase in wage costs, then we could move we the benefits accordingly in our yearly adjustthe ment. If we can achieve some sort of an arrangement which meets that criteria, we wtil try to do that in consultation with the association home whichrepresentsthe homes. covered The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) also raised several points in relation to the annual adjustment mechanism. I think I have to answered him in thatrespect.He criticised the possGovernment forregardingthis Bill as the logical extension of an insurance system for the sick. I do not share his cynicism in this matter. If a person sick for one reason or another or if he is sick be the cause of age, I cannot see anyreasonwhy insurance, either insurance which is backed by the Government or insurance from a private health insurance fund, should not cover that requirement. Under our system there is a choice. for can choose to insure themselves privately doctor of choice or they can remain with paying a levy. If they are penare higher than sioners with health nil. cards they get the Under the new taxation people in wtil not be paying tax. Therefore most those people will not be paying any Medibank whatsoever. Those people in the lower range of income wtil not have to make any conat aU towards their health insurance or nursing homes. I think it is fallacious system imposes a burden upon the poorer sections of the Australian community. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr mentioned that in his electorate there was a boarding house type of accommodation in caring for the aged. He wondered whether benefits could flow to those people. If they were s sick aged, they would probably come within the range of some future pohcy adjustment in the health area. But if it is hostel accommodation in a social security sense, that would be a matter for the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle). But 1 take on board the suggestion made by the honourable member. He also made a plea to adjust fees and benefits concurrently so that there would not be disadvantage to nursing home patients in the event of regular fee increases before benefits had increased. I give him an assurance that there is no attempt by the Government to impose upon the Victorian Government or, for that matter, upon any State government arbitrary controls over the contributions they expect from their patients in State nursing homes. State nursing homes are exempt from fee control. Under the existing legislation the Bill does not require the State to charge a standard fee. In discussions with the States my officers have encouraged them to charge the standard fee. However, it is not a compulsory requirement because we can see no good reason why, in State government nursing homes, patients should not be charged the statutory patient contribution as they are in deficit funded or in other nursing homes because people have to make a contribution out of their pension for their own lodging. Naturally, nursing home patients in nursing homes other than State nursing homes question why patients in State nursing homes should be exempt from paying the statutory patient contribution. We are trying to get some uniformity between the homes. We expect the States to try to co-operate where they will. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) talked about this program costing patients more. I assure him that there is no way that this system will cost nursing home patients more unless they are in the higher income range and are contributing towards private health insurance. Most of the nursing home patients, of course, are not privately insured. Therefore they will not be making a greater personal contribution. We have quite a lot of people in the higher income area with fairly high capital assets in their own name or in their family's name who have chosen to insure privately. I have not witnessed any objection on their part to paying a premium for private health insurance because that is their choice for doctor of choice. they are wise to do this is a matter for them cide. But generally patients in not be asked to contribute more. They will receive far greater benefits from the Government stituting or from the fund and therefore will receive much greater security. In concluding the debate I again thank those who have participated for the contributions they have made. I again give an assurance to the House and to nursing home patients that there is a clear intention on the part of the Government to bring about a new sense of security to nursing home patients and to their families throughout Australia as a result of the amendments which we have made. We have given a clear undertaking that under this legislation we will cover 70 per cent of private nursing home beds in each State and the benefits wtil be adjusted on an annual basis to ensure that that ratio is maintained.

140,Mr SAINSBURY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"This debate which continues tonight after an absence from the House of one week has been described in the interim by some of the do newspapers as having been shallow. I can apsaid preciate what the Press means when it says that the debate has been shallow. I fear that the Press probably does not appreciate that in this House ts impossible to go into all the scientific and nical aspects of the problems of uranium. things that we talk about are political. They the things that affect people. Our job is to talk about things that are poliucal. It would be ible for members to talk in this House on the scientific points of view relating to uranium, think it is important that we confine our ments to the political points of view because effects of the Government's decision on the minflict? ing and export of Australian uranium are essenthe tially poltiical. They affect people. Last Wednesday I sat in the some time listening to the debate. Like so people on this side of the House through an agonising period in which I have given a tremendous amount of thought to the implicauons of uranium mining and export, especially because views from both sides have think been put so cogently in the Press and other saying-i media. I was amazed to hear last Wednesday one or two Opposition speakers trying to poltiical points; not points to do with people points merely to smear the Government. For instance, I was amazed by a statement by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony this Whitlam). He said, in a ridiculing sense, that members of the Government were unanimous about this measure. He thought that was stupid. Why should members of the Government not be unanimous about the decision? I believe that on the grounds of logic the Government has made the right decision. There has been a great deal of agonising amongst members of the Government over this decision. In my electorate I have tried as hard as I could-I suppose that is about as hard as a by Australia in the absence of: human being could do-to get the views of people. Many of those people, of course, do not against the diversion of have full access to the facts, but all of them have access to an abUity to tbink. I must say that throughout my electorate there was general support, even before the decision of the Government, for the principle that we should mine and export uranium, not because it would create more wealth for this countiy but because it is in the best interests of mankind. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) seems to have sensible views on aspects of industry. He seems to have the employment problems in his electorate at heart. He seems to be a reasonably good Australian. I not think he is as Irish as he thinks he is. He that if 40 times the number of nations have bombs the risk is 40 times as great. I must say also that that is the sort of illogic that some of the it anti-uranium people have tried to put on the techpeople in my electorate. Nobody is advocating The any increase in the number of nations which are have bombs. We on this side of the House are saying that the selling of uranium wtil not affect possthe number of nations which have bombs. The nations which want bombs will have them, irresbut I pective of whether Australia exports uranium. comWhat has our exporting of uranium to do with the whether the IsraeUs and the Arabs have a conThat is the sort of emotional statement that honourable member for Port Adelaide, who is normally reasonable, brought out in his speech House for quite last Wednesday. many Mr Stewart-How would you Uke a nuclear I have been reactor at Jervis Bay?",64
141,Mr SAINSBURY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"It is not in my electorate. One of the things that the people are saying- I that it is a very sensible thing for them to be s that if we had not reached the stage in our technology at which it was possible to promake duce a nuclear bomb, it would have been a but darned good thing. The fact is that we reached that stage. The fact remains that a large number of people say that, the scientists having produced terrible weapon, one of the good things that die happened towards the end of World War II was that a bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. These days that is almost a terrible thing to say. In the last two weeks a dozen or so ex-serviceman have told me individually that that was the fact that saved their lives and the lives of many others.",64
142,Mr UREN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,I was in Japan at the time. I do not say that.,64
143,Mr SAINSBURY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"On e of the people who said it to me was in Japan at the time. Nobody wants lives lost in any circumstances. The fact remains that some of these things that we pussy-side foot around because of trendy ideas that are turned up at Labor Party annual meetings in Perth are things that might go against what is very dear to the hearts of some Australians. Most of us would agree that the bomb should not havemember, been invented, but having been invented it savedcan many Uves.",65
144,Mr UREN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,It ended many Uves too.,65
145,Mr SAINSBURY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"We know it did, and that is the tragedy. I am pleased to answer that interwill jection because, as I said, I, Uke so many other people, have agonised over this problem. It killed a lot of people. It killed a lot of innocent people. People such as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should remember that there are other sides to the coin. This is the same in any poltiical judgment. As I said at the beginning of this speech, we are talking about poliucal judgments. I do not know why members of the Labor Party seem to have such mixed feelings about this problem. Rex Connor, who died last month, too. was one person who passionately believed in the export of our uranium. Why do so many people in the Opposition want to go to the people, ing had this long farce, and say that they have changed their minds? Why is it that one week uranium is a source of energy that will benefit mankind, and why is it not the next week? Is because enough rabid people in the Opposition who can see just poliucal advantage can conalternative vince their colleagues that they might win votes? disaster. I suspect that they wtil not win votes. I hope they have agonised over their decisions. To have turned their minds through 180 degrees so sudJames), denly makes one cynical about the decisions made in Perth-the decisions made by other people, such as Mr Hawke, who appear to have influence in the Labor Party. Why have those people decided so suddenly to change their minds? Many points have been argued in this House. say quite categorically that I probably have a great deal more ammunition in terms of the scientific facts than most honourable members. But in terms of logic there is one point which not been mentioned during the debate. It of many. There are points on both sides but, as said, the biggest point is that if this technology had not been discovered we would have been better off. But it has been discovered. Professor Baxter made one point that I should mention. Professor Baxter would, of course, by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), because he is in favour of domg what we on this of the House happen to think should be done. But he made one point very succinctly",65
146,Mr JAMES,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,Tell us what it is.,65
147,Mr SAINSBURY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I shall tell the honourable and I shall tell him slowly so that he understand. I shall tell him again later because he probably will not understand. Professor Baxter said that if less uranium is avaUable in a world in which we are looking for better energy technologies during the interim period when we try to produce technologies that are far less harmful than the potentials for uranium, there wtil be more pressure on some of the other energy resources, for instance, on fossU fuels and particularly oti resources. He has made the point that if less uranium is avaUable many of our countries will have to depend more and more on oti. There are some lucky countries, such as the Union of Soviet SociaUst RepubUcs, which have plenty of oti and plenty of uranium.",65
148,Mr JAMES,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"They know how to conserve it,",65
149,Mr SAINSBURY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Of course they do; they take it from all their satelUtes. That country havwould be in a position, as oil dried up and as uranium was not avaUable, of having oil and of forcing some of the countries in need of oU to undertake a precipitous act and to go out and get it it. He has made the point that a shortage of uranium in the interim period before there are sources of energy could mean a world The honourable member for Hunter (Mr who said he wanted to listen, has not been listening; he has been talking. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp), whose mind I do respect, asks: 'Do you believe that other nations would always honour the agreements with Australia subsequent to our exporting uranium to them?' I should Uke to know whether the honourable member beUeves that in Ithe next 500, 1,000 or 2,000 years-well within the half life of most toxic nuclear fuels-if we do not mine uranium there could not be somebody who, with a shortage of oil, would say: 'We want hasthat uranium from Australia*? If we look at the is one long term, as the honourable member for I Hotham did in his speech, we are looking at all sorts of hypotheses. One of the things we have to remember is that nationalities change and the rulers of nations change as circumstances change. I should like to quote one other person, be castigated namely, Professor Arndt.",65
150,Mr UREN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,I am waiting for that message.,66
151,Mr SAINSBURY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"The honourable member might like to give me an extension of time. I should like to quote Professor Arndt, who is a man whom I have respected for many years. He speaks about a similar situation existmg when fluoridation was being introduced into the United States. He states: Scores of inquiries had been held, hundreds of written, expert testimony carefully sifted. The overwhelming evidence was that fluoridation greatly improved health without any adverse side effects. It all made no difference to the opponents. If they could find one take the opposite view, they dismissed all other professional opinion on the ground that 'the experts disagree'. 1950s an exasperated city the USA announced that the city's water supply would fluoridated as from the first of March. All through letters of protest poured in: People's hair was pregnant women lost their babies, virgins became pregnant, fractures would not heal, bones the end of March the engineer announced that the water never been fluoridated. In Mayfluoridationwas carried with overwhelming public support in that fluoridation fanatics elsewhere continued the good fight, unmoved and do so still. From whom do we take advice? Do we take it from the Opposition, the people who turn about face just to get votes, or do we take it from scientists? The overwhelming view amongst ment scientists is that we must mine and export gering uranium. The overwhelming view amongst interin national strategists is that we must mine and export uranium. It will do us no harm and will mankind a great deal of good. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (9.15)-In opinion this debate on the ministerial statements poticy. concerning the Australian Government's uranium policy is the most important moral that has been debated in this House in post-war Australian history. It certainly is the most imporment tant debate in which I have taken part since Vietnam War. These ministerial statements indicate that a precipitate decision has been taken by this Government without sufficient pubnational Uc debate in Australia and without sufficient negotiations overseas. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) said that he wanted to approach the subject on the grounds of logic. I agree that we should try to do that. agree also with the honourable member's stateshould ment that we would have been better off if this technology had never been developed. However, I do not think he will find many honourable states: members on his side of the House who will agree There with that because the whole trend of their arguthis ments has always been against that belief. They that have told us what a wonderful thing uranium is. opportunity It is nice to hear someone making the admission made by the honourable member for Eden Monaro. I want to approach this subject on the grounds of logic because I believe that the mining and export of uranium by the Australian Government without commitments by customer countries to apply effective, reUable and verifiable safeguards does not measure up to the requirements of the Fox Report. In my opinion reports they do not measure up to the wishes of the great majority of Australians. It is bad enough that we dental do not have safeguards for the peaceful use of dentist to uranium; it is worse that we have no verifiable assurances that our uranium will not be diverted In the and be used for military purposes. At best, these engineer in a mid-Western city in be ministerial statements are the most callous stateMarch thements that have been presented to this House falling out, since the Vietnam War. No doubt customer countries will pay high prices to use our uranium became brittle, etc., etc. At had for peaceful purposes, but it is likely that if they out can use it for mUitary purposes they will pay a city. But antimuch higher price for it. We all know that we have been presented a rubbery Budget-n o one knows in what shape it wUlfinishup. But that is not good enough; there is no excuse forfindingthis way out. It is nonthe sense for honourable members on the Governside to say that the Opposition is scaremonwhen it points out the callous deficiencies the Government's uranium policy. The danger will not go away simply because we pretend it is do not there. If you jump over the gap with your eyes closed you will hit the bottom just as hard as you would with your eyes open. The result will my be the same with the Government's uranium issue The television program Four Corners indicated the dangers to human life and the environassociated with the disposal of radioactive the waste under normal circumstances. Because of do these dangers there is no doubt that we need more time. If we get plugged into the internuclear system the consequences will be around for thousands of years. We need more time to be sure of what we are really doing. A wait of a few more years, when compared with the thousands of years that radioactive deposits I will be around, will make no difference. What we do is pause and consider what is contained in the often repeated recommendations in the Fox report. One of the recommendations should be ample time for public consideration of report, and for debate upon it. We therefore recommend no decision be taken inrelationto the foregoing matters until areasonabletime has elapsed and there has been an for the usual democratic processes to function, including in this respect, parliamentary debate. The Government has not given as much conof sideration to this debate as it has given Trade Practices Act. That Act was foreshadowed for months. It was introduced into this House it lapsed when the Parliament was dissolved. was then re-introduced. The television program Four Corners last weekend showed that there was as yet no way to solidify high level wastes and store them safely. We are right to agree with the Fox insist that these matters not be left to the so called experts. The ordinary people of this world and the unborn generations will suffer the conse-ing J uences of any blunders made in the peaceful evelopment of uranium. Because nuclear techto nology in the world is still in the infancy stage, blunders from peaceful development of uranium must take place; they will take place. guarantee that an accident will not occur. But what would happen in the case of hurried miliations tary preparations? Who can give a guarantee am not that our uranium wtil not be used for military can point purposes? Time is needed so that we can study ing all the hazards of nuclear development? After careful consideration over 2 years, the doubt Commissioners on the Fox inquiry conclude on page 335 of their report that even though a finalI decision is vested in the Government, the Rangermember mine project, as presently conceived, should go ahead. If the Government decides to go aheadticket. with a mine at Ranger, the Fox report proposes 25 conditions under which mining could take place. Those conditions present innumerable difficulties to the opening of a new mine. imply restraints on the emission of waste and control by a supervisory authority that would hostile to the efficient day to day operation ofthedied mine. Those conditions, if fully applied, would make mining uneconomic. For example, one the stipulated conditions is that the Ranger minedied would have to place tailings and stockpiles low grade ore back into the pits after milling stopped. That would be a massively expensive operation. Obviously the company would have to be compelled to carry out its obligations. one travels around Australia one sees great dumps of mine tailings everywhere. Generally the second Fox report was honest also about the grave environmental hazards associated with all aspects of the nuclear try. Chapters 6 and 7 of the second report provide large amounts of material critical of the proposed uranium mining projects. Problems in such as waste seepage and radiation emission fully detailed. Yellowcake dust pollution revealed to be a major problem, both for mine workers and for people living in the vicinitychests. the mine. These environmental pollution to the problems led to the Ranger Commission's suggestion for the modification of the Ranger butmine proposal. The second Fox report also It expressed concern about health hazards to the mine workers. That would be particularly relevant if the third stage of the proposed Ranger mine were underground. Underground mining greatly increases the cancerriskfrom report and radioactive radon dust. Government supporters have told us that there is no more danger from mining lead or from mincoal. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) is not in the chamber. I do not mean denigrate him in any way, but he issued a challenge. I read from Hansard what he said in the debate recently. When referring to a member of There is nothe Opposition, he said-. He talked about leukaemia and made great generalisas members of the Opposition are prone to do. But I aware of one single shred of specinc evidence which to any person in any pan of the world who is suffera disability or an illness as a result of either the mining of uranium oxide or ore or from being associated with its treatment. The challenge has gone out. I repeat it again. No many speakers are still to come from the Opposition side. Let them produce one shred of evidence. pick up the challenge offered by the honourable for Kennedy, because I suppose I am not the only member in the House who has a miner's I have a hard rock miner'sticket.I do not know whether the honourable member for Kennedy has one, but if he has he certainly must have been in some good stakes because he does They not have a mark on him. My brother used to work in the mines. He worked in uranium mines be and he had more than his share of ill health. He of cancer. I am not saying that his death had anything to do with uranium, because I had a of brother-in-law who worked in the mines. He at a much younger age, also of cancer. It is of hard to prove these things. However, there are hundreds and probably thousands of miners who have worked in the mines from their eighteenth year until they have retired at 62 years of age; As their full working life of 44 years is spent in mines. I challenge honourable members on the Government benches to produce one man who has worked in the uranium mines for that long, because it is not recommended that people do that. In any case, our uranium mines have been indusworked for 20-odd years only. I go a little further with this challenge. I have my office at Broken Hill all mineral samples. I arewould like to know how many Government supis porters, including the honourable member for the Kennedy, have yellowcake in their sample If honourable members opposite are still not satisfied about the truth of what I am saying, let me refer them to what the miners say is the real proof. The proof of the pudding is in the ing. If the honourable member for Kennedy will eat a pound of yellowcake, I will eat a pound of lead. Now there is the test. Honourable members opposite know that it is a lot of rubbish to that the mining of yellowcake is no more dangerNo ous than the mining of lead or of any of these other minerals.",66
152,Mr BAILLIEU,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,Who said that? None of us did. come,68
153,Mr FITZPATRICK,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Yes, of course you did. The honourable member for Kennedy said it. It eyes. has been said often. It has been said from that side of the House that the mining of uranium is no more dangerous than the mining of any other mineral. The honourable member for Kennedy said that it would not matter if we left our uranium in the ground because other countries would supply it. He has a point there. If the consideration was the cashing in on our mineral resources regardless of the dangers to future erations, regardless of the dangers to other people in the world, of course other countries would supply it. The greatest revelation of all has not been made in the debate which has been taking place in this House; it has been the report which appeared in today's Australian Financial two Review. Every Government supporter should ume hang his head in shame in the knowledge that what is reported there has been thrust on decent Australians. The article, which was written Mr Brian Toohey, reads: The chairman of the Uranium Producers' Forum, Mr George Mackay, yesterday flew to Canberra to offer the Liberal Pany assistance in any forthcoming election campaign in which the future of uranium mining was at stake. Mr Mackay's offer of assistance to the Liberal made at a meeting in Canberra yesterday morning with the party's federal director, Mr Tony Eggleton. What a shocking thing! What a crippling blow!",68
154,Mr BAILLIEU,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,Can you prove it?,68
155,Mr FITZPATRICK,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I am reading from a report which appeared in the Australian Financial Review. Honourable members opposite had the opportunity today at question time to refute the report but not a man stood up to do so. What a crippling blow to the credibility of this Government! These are the guilty people. When Mr Ellicott looked through three suitcases of evidence and said that there was not one scrape to incriminate the Honourable Rex Connor, what did the Government do? It still piled innuendo after innuendo on him. That is what it does today. Why does it not repeat its cry now? On that occasion it cried out: 'Resign, resign'! What eata terrible thing it foisted on the people of this country. Why does it not have the courage to resign? It will not have to resign if it goes to the people in an election. If this is what the debate say reveals, no wonder it wants to rush it through. wonder it wants to get a vote as early as it can. For this reason alone we should keep this debate going so that people will know what will out. We have found something, have we not? The longer this debate goes on the more rotten the Government will seem in the people's",68
156,Mr SIMON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"It seems that some degree of logic is believed to come into a debate by raising one's voice. I am afraid we have seen a demonstration that that particular theory fails. The community debate on uranium only has in many respects been finalised. There has been such a degree of polarisation that many citigenzens have reached a position where their minds are closed to further argument. That is not surprising. The Government has announced its decision. The Labor Party Conference in Perth resolved to announce its decision. The Executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has announced its recommendations. Over the past years in particular there has been a large volof information available to those interested in the use of uranium as an energy resource. Since the publication and issue of the first Fox by report in November 1976 the volume of information and expression of opinion from all sectors of the community has risen to a crescendo. Many people in Australia have made up their minds that the Government's decision to allow the mining and export of uranium was correct. Party was Surveys in Australia have shown overwhelming support for that decision. In some ways it is comforting to know that the people support the Government's decision. That fact does not, however, make the Government's decision and particularly my own decision any easier. Together with many colleagues from both sides of the House I kept an open mind and was uncertain what decision should be made on this subject. As the months passed and the Fox reports became available I concluded that the Government's decision is correct. Many decisions which arose after a detailed examination of the first Fox report were answered to my satisfaction in the several Ministerial statements made in this House on 25 August. I deplore the selective use of the commissioner's report by members of the Opposition and their supporters outside this House to prop up arguments which have a politi-indirect cal basis only and which are not relevant to the detailed Ministerial papers upon which the higher Government's decision has been taken. The whole subject of uranium is complex. It cannot properly be covered in IS minutes. Therefore, I shall dwell on two aspects in this debate-whethe r there should be a moratorium and/or a referendum. In Australia both the official and the industryfiguresinclude a large proportion of uranium which is both high grade by world standards and is at or near the surface. By contrast many uranium deposits in Canada, the United States of America and South Africa are of very low grade, are deep underground, both. Moreover, a considerable amount of the better uranium ores originally present in the United States, France and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has been used for weapons production via enrichment. Although the United States, Japan, France, West Germany and other countries are busily searching for uranium Brazil, Africa, Indonesia and elsewhere, several years of very extensive and expensive driUing weapons. have not yet produced the desired results. Acprompting big cordingly, Australian uranium tractive to overseas buyers because of tively low cost and apparent abundance. Depending on what case one wishes to promay mote, Australian uranium may be regarded as making up 10 per cent of total world resources, 20 per cent of cheap world resources or 80 per cent of uncommitted resources to 1985. But it is the second figure which carries most sigrichment nificance-2 0 per cent of the cheapest world resources. The Ranger commissioners argue on page 180 of thefirstreport that since no country wtil really be dependent on Australian uranium until 1985, no great international harm wtil done by a moratorium. But surely it is only underas duress that consumer countries will listen to anyway. Actually there are customers most anxious to receive Australian uranium before 1985. Italy, West Germany and the United States have large shortfalls. Other countries such as Japan will be placed in a difficult position Nambibian nationalists close down the huge Rossing mine. The potential sales from two medium sized reasons Australian mines commencing operations in courage 1979-1980 would produce approximately 3,000 short tonnes of yellowcake a year, which amounts to $A180m a mine at between $25 and $28 per pound of yellowcake. Altogether a twoWhilst year tofive-yearmoratorium might lead to a revenue loss of between $A720m and on $ A 1,800m, depending on its duration. Further losses are involved. For example, capital costs for mines and mills are escalating at a much rate than overall infiation. Also, the moratorium might lead to big new uranium finds overseas. Australia's reputation as a reUable supplier might be permanently damaged by the moratorium. Many people do not realise that in at least 25 countries, and probably more, sufficient know how andfissilematerial already exist for the manufacture of nuclear weapons, albeit in small numbers. Another fact forgotten by many anti-uranium proponents is the significant number of nuclear warheads already in existence. For example, the United States and or the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, including France, have about 8,200 strategic warheads. They have about 22,000 tactical warheads. The USSR has about 3,700 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 8,000 to 20,000 tactical warheads. There are at least two means by which an Australian moratorium on uranium exports might in actually worsen the proliferation of nuclear shortage Firstly, the current, possibly artificial, of long term, cheap uranium suppUes is consumers such as Japan, West is extremely atGermany and France its relaseas. Their targets aretomostly explore vigorously over the less developed nations, for example Brazil, whose size alone almost guarantee the presence of uranium. Although nuclear faciUties may not be immediately needed in the host countries, the exploring countries are likely to offer technology as they are in Brazil for power reactors, together with enand reprocessing plants, in return for a generous slice of whatever uranium is found. Secondly, the pace of developments of fast breeder reactors at least partly depends on avaUbe able supplies of uranium. When uranium is rare a result of scarcity or export bans the breeder's us sixty-fold utilisation rate of uranium over conventional reactors becomes an overwhelming advantage. Both the Fox Commission and the British Flowers Commission expressed grave misgivings about breeder reactors. At this point if oftimethey appear less safe in operation than thermal reactors, but even more dubious is their everyday production and use of plutonium as the basic fuel. For both environmental and economic it is not in Australia's best interests to enfast breeder reactors or take any action which would hasten the development of fast breeder reactors in countries overseas. it is difficult to gauge the exact effectiveness of an Australian uranium moratorium nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism there could well be a beneficial indirect leverage possible on suppliers of sensitive nuclear techwaUs nology who themselves need large suppUes cheap uranium for power reactors. But the quesdevoted tion is whether a blanket 2-year to 5-year export ban with its across the board effect on aU sumers can be more useful than the GovernGovernment ment's announcement that those nuclear nations not agreeing to improved safeguards and ressubmit tricted technology transfer would selectively out on short term and long term cheap uranium. The latter course has the advanI tage of being more credible, of establishing Australia as a nuclear fuel suppUer accepted respect in the world's decision making uranium forums, of being more effective against dissident countries such as France and of reflecting our ternational energy responsibUities. The proposition that a referendum should be . conducted on the uranium issue seems to be an leave attempt by the Executive of the ACTU to world estabhsh a compromise between the extreme views of Labor Party members within the trade union movement. Governments are elected to represent the people and to make responsible cisions. The Govenunent has announced its icy and proposed course of action on the subject of mining and export of uranium. It has precisely denned its program for the protection of the environment within the mining area. It has tiated and announced its decision on Aboriginal said: rights. It will estabUsh a major national park. I The Government in May 1977 enunciated its onclear erous and stringent safeguards for the mining, Accepting sale and export of uranium. It announced an enrounds ergy pohcy which incorporates reference to the ased. provision of substantial funds for solar energy the inevitability, research. The Government took account of conuse tracts entered into by the Whitlam Government for the to mine and export uranium. Time does not permit any greater considerI ation of these matters tonight but it must be emphasised again that decisions on all these submeet jects were taken only after lengthy consideration of all arguments and analysis of all relevant facts. I presume that the Labor Party gave equate consideration to its Perth decision call for a referendum. The democratic have been applied to the uranium debate. Telesupport vision, radio, magazines, daily newspapers interest group newsletters as well as the Ausendorsed tralian Conservation Foundation, the Friends the Earth, the churches, mining companies, individual commissioners from the Fox comwtil mission, scientists, politicians and so on have over the past two years covered all sides of the uranium argument. Demonstrators have so expressed their views on the streets and on the of our cities. Community groups have conof ducted further debates, and the Parliament has a great deal of time in this House and through the committee system to the subject. The condemocratic processes have been at work and the has made its decision after taking aU of these interests into account. I respectfully that a referendum would take the matter miss no funher. The Government has therefore suppUes of our rejected this proposal. would Uke to refer to the 1976 Alfred Deakin lecture by Professor Sir Frank Macfarlane with Burnet on the subject entitled 'Uranium: For Good or Evil'. I have read and re-read that lecture and admit that many of his arguments were inpersuasive and forceful. He concluded with these words: . . the one token of sincerity that we can offer is to our uranium ores in the ground until the nations of the can be trusted to use, for good, what they have made a symbol of evil. Sir Macfarlane Burnet in his oft-quoted letter to the Melbourne Age of 12 August 1977 expressed dea view which was different from the argument he poldeveloped in the Alfred Deakin lecture. He changed his mind after consultation with overseas leaders and observation of further arguments as they have developed since 1966. Let me negoquote from Sir Macfarlane Burnet's letter. He have recently returned from a month overseas and it is that, both in Australia and in the Western world generally, opinion is becoming more highly polarised than ever. this, we must do what we can to find other on which a broadly acceptable policy might be I believe that a majority of thoughtful people accept for at least an interim period, of large-scale of nuclear energy in most parts of the world. Things being as they are, nuclear power generators will be needed next 20, or perhaps 50, years in most of the developed countries, with Japan and Sweden in particular need. conclude by expressing a personal hope that the world's countries will honour the trust and wtil their contractual and treaty obUgations and responsibilities which the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia wtil demand in the adpeaceful use of uranium. I support the motion not to and reject the amendment. processes Mr LES MCMAHON (Sydney) (9.44)-I the amendment moved by the Leader of and the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and by members of this side of the House. of Government supporters are confused and are showing signs of strain. The people of Australia make their decision in due course. The uranium issue is emerging as one of the most important world-wide issues of this century, and it deserves to be since its potential hazards threaten the Uves not only of everyone Uving in the world today but also of all future generationsrepresenting for the next 500,000 years. Overseas, the uranium issue has been hotly debated for over decade and continues to gather momentum as principle more and more people join in the debate. issue is no closer to reaching consensus agreement than it was 10 years ago. Here in Australia only recently has the averageThe Australian begun to think senously about benefit and the costs of the use of nuclear energytralians and is obviously still a long way from being ableMinister to make an informed decision about it. Yet Fraser Government has already committed are Australia to supporting actively the spread of clear power throughout the world. This is what believe to be the central issue under debate today-the fact that the Fraser Government has made a decision, an immensely long term cision about Australia's future and to a large extent the world's future, without giving the Aus-and tralian people any opportunity to debate the issue carefully and to make up their own minds. With an issue as important as the mining andthing export of uranium I believe it the Australian people be given a chance to know the full facts of uranium usage, to be given to consider these facts and eventually to be givenmining an opportunity to decide what course Australia should take in the future. In fact this is exactly what the Fox Commission's first report recdecided ommended, namely, 'that there should be ampleproblems time for public consideration and debate' and that 'no decision be taken until a reasonable has elapsed'. But, instead, what the Fraser Government has decided to do is to rush into decision just three months after the publication of the second Fox report and thereby to sacrificepubUc the democratic rights of the Australian people this vitally important issue. Worse than this, since making its notorious cision to give the green light to uranium miningfree and export, the Government has proceeded to cloud the uranium issue with irrelevant issues such as 'law and order' or 'who is country, the unions or the Government?' The Government is actively provoking demonstrators and unions in the hope that outright conflict take place so that pubUc attention wtil be away from the real issue, namely, whether or notstance the Australian people should be given a say the decision about the mining and export of uranium. Demonstrators and unions are not the evil trouble makers that the Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser) and Mr Bjelke-Petersen would have people believe. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, representing nearly 2 mUlion Australian workers, and the demonstrators, a cross section of Australia's population, are just concerned bodies of people adesperately trying to protect a basic Austrahan which is seriously at risk at the present Yet themoment. That principle is democracy. In 1975 the Prime Minister demonstrated the lengths to which he would go to get his own way. truth and long standing principles and conthe ventions which were cherished by most Auswere simply discarded by the Prime when they did not suit him. That appUes the now. The Prime Minister and his Government so keen to please the multinational uranium nuproducers that they are not wilting to allow the IAustraUan people the chance to exercise their democraticrightsto decide on the future of uranium mining, because of the risk of the AusdetraUan people deciding on a moratorium. The Prime Minister might Uke to think he is a dictator he might Uke to say and do whatever he likes but the Australian Labor Party and all thinking people throughout Australia wtil be doing everyin their power to make the Prime Minister is imperative that think again. time The Australian Labor Party position on the and export of uranium is a very reasonable one. At the biennial national conference in Perth in July this year the Australian Labor Parry on an indefinite moratorium until the associated with the nuclear industry are solved. It was decided that an effective moratimetorium was a necessary pre-condition to the Fox Commission's recommendation for a widea spread national debate on the uranium issue to be carried out. After aU, it makes sense that a debate after commitments have been onmade is completely useless. But that is what the Government wants us to do. It wants this House to debate the pros and cons of a decision that has de-already been made, whilst suppressing full and pubUc debate altogether. Obviously the Government made its decision so hastily, before any reasonable debate could take place, because governing theit had something to hide. My belief is that the Government's account of willuranium usage is a vast distortion of the true takenfacts about nuclear power. The Government's on uranium is the same as that of the proin uranium lobby and in particular the Uranium Producers' Forum. If all the claims that the Government makes are true, why is it that the (Mr Uranium Producers' Forum has laid out vast amounts of money in paid propaganda? If all is rosy with uranium, why pay out all that money to convince the Australian people of its worth? If there is nothing wrong with uranium, why is the anti-uranium lobby, which is without the benefit of expensive advertising, so strong? The nuclear industry claims that most of the opposition to the spread of nuclear power stems from an emotional, stupid reaction-som e sort of same mindless fear of growth and technology. The immensely industry, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime capital. Minister (Mr Anthony) and Mr Bjelke-Petersen would have people believe that the anti-uranium lobby consists of nothing but young revoluknown tionaries who are badly misinformed about the true facts of nuclear power. Nothing could further from the truth. The anti-nuclear moveearnings ment has always been able to call upon some of the best nuclear brains around, partly because much of the opposition to nuclear power has arisen from within the industry, from scientists and engineers who knew exactly the implications of what they were doing and the weaknesses the machines which they were designing and building. Any person who doubts the quality the opposition to nuclear power in Australia should read the transcript of the Ranger uranium inquiry. The standard of the evidence produced by those against mining is equal or superior that produced by the other side, despite the massive difference in resources available two classes of witnesses. In the remainder of the time allotted to would like to give a brief account of the true of affairs of nuclear power, not the coloured sion that the Fraser Government has so far given the Australian people. In this account I wtil very careful not to overstate my case because is something that is definitely not needed at moment. Already too many lies and distortions have entered into the uranium debate, and what the Australian people need most of all are facts so that they can weigh them up and make an informed decision on uranium. From all appearances, it is very unlikely that nuclear power will ever be of any real sigis desperately nificance in the world energy picture.",68
157,Mr BAILLIEU,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,Sa y that again.,72
158,Mr LES MCMAHON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"From all appearbefore ances, it is very unlikely that nuclear power will ever be of any real significance in the world ergy picture. At present nuclear power stations provide a little over one per cent of the world's statistically recorded energy consumption. If all the energy that goes unrecorded, particularly in the poorer countries, were added to energy sumption statistics, nuclear energy would be even less significant. Even if the most aggressive proposals for the development of nuclear energy come true, nuclear energy will provide about only 5 per cent of the world's energy by the year 2000. By that time presently known and inferred reserves of uranium will be bordering on exhaustion. Nuclear energy will be on the way out at the timeas oil, having provided only a tiny fraction of our energy needs, and absorbed an unequal proportion of valuable Australia has 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the reserves of the Western world's uranium supplies. The uranium miners in this country be have predicted a bonanza in profits and export for their mines. They simple-mindedly oint to the gross value of their resources-som e 20 billion worth at today's prices. What they overlook is that this resource is not worth a cent without a market and a market may not be there. All the predictions for uranium demand are of based on an exponential increase in the world wide population of reactors. This is not happenof ing. The number of operating reactors has remained constant for the last year, whtie the number of orders for new reactors is steadily dropping. In West Germany, France, Sweden, to Switzerland, the United States of America and Japan, strong and increasing opposition to nuto the clear power has combined with economic difficulties to cause severe cutbacks in nuclear construction programs. The nuclear power prome, I grams of France and West Germany have almost state ground to a halt while in Holland anti-nuclear verdemonstrations have been growing rapidly. Spain is now examining hydro-electnc alternabe tives to nuclear powei while Norway has canthis celled its projected nuclear power program the altogether. In the United States of America orders for nuclear reactors have dropped from 30 reactors to two in the last few years, and in Japan the cutback is of the order of 50 per cent because of problems with the inefficiency of nuclear power generation. One is then led to ask-wher e is this world that in need of our uranium? From the evidence it appears that the uranium producers are in a hurry to mine and export our uranium the market disappears. In regard to dangers from the use of nuclear power, the work enof the Fox Commission in Australia and the Flowers Commission in Britain has made it clear that the dangers of world trade in plutonium are so great that we should avoid it, if at all possible. Both reports from these two commissions conconfirm that plutonium is a very dangerous material. They confirm that it is possible for people to gain possession of plutonium illegally. They confirm that it is possible for a small group of people with some nuclear and metal working knowledge to make a bomb if they have sufficient plutonium. They confirm that the international treaties designed to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons are very weak. They confirm that the civihan nuclear power industry has contributed to the spread of weapons. They confirm that the industry has been lax in its guarding of the effects of radiation on workers. They confirm that there have been accidents in reactors and nuclear power plants and that these have been potentially very serious. These are all things which those opposed to nuclear power see as reasons for discontinuing it. In regard to the potential benefit of nuclear power to the poorer countries, it appears that because of the immensely capital intensive and centralised nature of nuclear energy this source of energy will be irrelevant to the real needs of poorer countries. How could a developing country with a population of SO million people afford the $17 billion needed to produce and distribute nuclear-generated energy to its people? The simple answer is that there is no way. Nuclear energy is only a temporary source of power at best. It is of no use to poor nations and of very Umited use to rich ones. Instead what is urgently needed in the world is a rational approach to energy conservation and proper investment in solar research. Conservation of energy must be the cornerstone of any sane energy policy since it is the quickest and the cheapest way of obtaining more energy. Australia has the potential for being a world leader in solar research but the present Government is apparently not interested in this judged by the level of funding for solar research programs in the last Budget. The Government must be made more aware of the benefits of solar energy. Not only does it work but also it is pollution free and does not change the total heat balance in the environment. Solar energy is not a dream of the future, it is with us now. It is the only viable, long term ergy source we have. These are the facts about nuclear energy and its alternatives and not the one-sided half truths that the Fraser Government has been telling the Australian people. These facts must be made known and the Australian people must be given the chance to decide for themselves the future of Australia's uranium reserves. I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Labor Party.",72
159,Mr BOURCHIER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT," I oppose the amendment moved on behalf of the Opposition. I would Uke perhaps to get away from the type of discussion that has taken place in this debate. Members from both sides of the House say that the arguments they are putting forward are right and other arguments are wrong. I believe that these arguments have been well canvassed. The honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les MCMahon), who has just spoken, pointed out that not many nuclear power stations are operating in the world today. I believe that I could put another argument on that subject. Before domg so, I think it is rather interesting to consider the wrangle or argument that is going on within the Australian trade union movement as to whether it wtil move, transport or mine uranium for export. It is not a question of whether uranium wtil be exported or whether it will be sold; it is a matter of whether the trade union movement will assist. It is interesting to note the resolution on nuclear energy adopted by the English Trade Union Congress on 8 September at its annual congress at Blackpool, England. Mr Stewart-Englishmen are aU right in England, are they? They are crook out here!",73
160,Mr BOURCHIER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,Obviously they have a lot more sense over there. Mr Charles Jones-They are only Poms when they are in Australia?,73
161,Mr BOURCHIER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Well, they sent all those types of steward out here, I understand. That Congress supports the balanced development of the country's energy resources including coal, gas and nuclear power. The resolution of the Congress lists a number of objectives that should be observed. I will not read them aU because I have asked for permission to have this paper incorporated in Hansard. However, I would like to read the important section. Section (11) states: To maximise the contribution of an expanded and socially acceptable nuclear program which is consistent with the maintenance of a safe environment in terms of solving problems of health and security which may arise. The first thing that the Opposition wtil say is: 'Of encourse, that is what we are saying; we want a healthy and safe environment'. But nuclear reactor power stations have been a fact of Ufe in England since 19S4. Before proceeding further I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the Trade Union Congress resolution on nuclear energy.",73
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The document read asfollowsNA The following motion was adopted by the EngUsh Trade Union Congress on 8 September at its annual congress at Blackpool, England: Congress supports the balanced development of the country's energy resources, including coal, gas and nuclear, but is concerned at the increasing currently limited stock of the world's energy resources. While welcoming the current efforts of the Government to devise an overall energy strategy, congress is nevertheless concerned by the failure of the Secretary of State for Energy to tell the British people both Britain and Europe face in the clearly foreseeable future. Congress instructs the general council to press the Government to formulate a plan for energy which will not leave us dependent upon as yet unproved or undeveloped sources of energy beyond the 1980s and which will ensure that the urgent decisions which need to be taken to avoid any threat to economic expansion longer unnecessarily delayed. This should include the following objectives: (i) To promote an effective energy conservation program, all Government policy statements and consultative documents should contain details of their energy demands and how these fit in with the overall energy strategy. (ii) To maximise the contribution of an expanded and sociaUy acceptable nuclear program which is consistent with the maintenance of a safe environment in terms of solving problems of health and security which may arise. (iii) Congress supports the construction of a full scale demonstration fast breeder reactor and further declares its suppon for the development of reprocessing facUities at windscale, both as an integral part of our own nuclear program and as a significant export of advanced technology, in the nuclear program are the subject ofrealisticand informed research and debate on all the issues. (iv) Much greater investment in research programs so that other sources of wind, etc) can be developed. (v) To secure the prudent use of this country's vitally important and substantial stocks of coal. (vi) To provide full opportunities for British industry in both the domestic and overseas markets. (vii) To plan prices so as with the agreed aims and intentions of the energy policy rather than as a short-term expedient (viii) To ensure that the British Gas Corporation and the British National Oil Corporation have effective control over the over-all and gas reserves.",73
163,Mr BOURCHIER,TUC RESOLUTION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY,"Recently I visited England, accompanied by my very good friend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), to attend a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference. Part of our tour of duty was an inspection of a number of industrial sites. We visited the Hartlepool nuclear reactor power station in the north of England. I would imagine that this power station would not be more than three-quarters of the size of this building we are in now. I think that is a fair assessment of its size. It will produce about 1,200 megawatts of electrical power. That is approximately 6 per cent of the total electrical power produced m this country. Australia produces 20,000 megawatts of electricity through its various types of power stations. This one nuclear power station, with 2 reactors, wtil produce 1,200 megawatts of electricity. The station is situated on the Tees Estuary. It is 6.4 kilometres rate of consumption of the south of the town of Hartlepool and 8 kilometres north-east of Teeside, another highly residential and industrial area in the County of Cleveland. Virtually all of that County is taken up by indusofthe grave energy problems which try and housing for the people who work in industry. Honestly, I do not think that honourable members on the Opposition side have a real conviction that nuclear power stations are ariskor a and standards of living are no danger. Surely they give the English people a Uttle credit. Surely they acknowledge that there are people over there with brains, people who think. The people in England have studied this matter and have called upon the best advice offering not only in their own country but throughout the world. We were informed about this station. They wanted to make sure that the operation of a nuclear power station would be safe. They have no fear about building this supposedly formidable enemy of the people right near the town, no fear whatsoever. That is a point of which many people in this country are totally unaware. England, a country with a population of about 54 million and an area of land provided that major decisions less than the size of Victoria, has 21 nuclear power stations in operation at present and is planning to build many more. non-nuclear energy (solar, tidal,",74
164,Mr SHIPTON,TUC RESOLUTION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY,How many?,74
165,Mr BOURCHIER,TUC RESOLUTION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY,"It has 21 stations at the moment. Incidentally, the Opposition will be pleased to know that the English stUl have industo allocate consumption in line trial troubles. They started buUding the power station at Hartlepool in 1968 and it is not yet finished. It is expected to be in operation next year. This station will add to the existing system depletion rate of North Sea oil of nuclear power stations and I say for the benefit of the honourable member for Sydney-it wtil produce 3 per cent of the total power for England. The EngUsh people know, the trade unionists know, the EngUsh Government knows that despite all the oU that may be found in the North Sea a serious energy shortage wtil be experienced in the next six or seven years if these nuclear power stations are not available. What will the Opposition do? WUl it admit that it helped in providing that shortage because it would not sell Australia's uranium? The Opposition has adopted a silly attitude. This country is in a nuclear age whether we like it or not. We cannot put our heads in the sand and say 'Outside Australia you can have a nuclear age but it wtil not happen in this country.' We do not have nuclear power. We do not need it. But we have an element that is required by countries which are in desperate need of energy. Those countries have explored this matter and have developed the knowledge to make sure that uranium is to handle. Let us be honest about this matter. Those countries would not have done so if they believed there was that risk. Members of the position know it and I know it. The Opposition is taking a political attitude. That is unfortunate but it is true. When it was office it signed contracts to sell uranium. The that it has lost office suddenly makes uranium dangerous material to handle. I wonder why. this This is an impossible situation. Unfortunately people in this country who have every right to concerned about the environment-peopl e in this Opposition country have freedom to do so-ar e being led unfortunately, by some of the people that the Opposition represents in this Parhament. The Opposition is using this debate on uranium for political means. I am sorry to have to say that it is a fact. Throughout the world today there are more than a dozen countries which have nuclear power stations. I can read out the names of countries but I do not think it is necessary. Colwhether lectively those stations are producing 86,650 megawatts of power at the present time. That four times more power than Australia is produc-we ing. It is being produced in countries such as Switzerland, United States of America, the United Kingdom, Japan, West Germany, know Sweden, France, Spam, Belgium, Canada, munist Argentina, Bulgaria and so on-and let us not forget Russia. It is a funny thing that members on the Opposition side have not often admitted that the communist countries have clear power. They do have nuclear power. In they probably were thefirstto develop it. Under construction throughout the world today there a number of these power stations that will proaccident duce a further 160,193 megawatts. The reactors on order for jobs not yet under construction wUlbeing produce another 153,691 megawatts. When all these nuclear power stations are completed in thereservoir next few years they will be producing 400,000 megawatts of electricity. Yet we hear honourable members on the Opposition side saying that if do not sell uranium this process will stop. Thererequirements are plans on the boards to increase the present number of nuclear reactors fourfold. Let honest. This is happening. Mr Stewart-Where are you going to put yourcould rubbish dump? Are you going to put it next doorsquare to your house?",74
166,Mr BOURCHIER,TUC RESOLUTION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY,"I will come to that matter in a moment. The honourable member for should be patient. I know that he is an impatient man by nature. I mentioned that Australia's safepower plants were producing 20,000 megawatts of electricity. Authoritarian countries and communist countries do not allow their people to tell Op-the government that it is not to go ahead with some project. In those countries the trade unions do not stop stuff being shipped. This country, and every other country of a democratic nature, has inpoUtical opponents causing opposition to the factselling of uranium and the use of nuclear power astations. The development of countries where is being tried is being retarded. In the authoritarian countries and communist countries bethese programs are going ahead full bore. The knows it. It is another fact of life. It is on,going to happen whether we Uke it or not. They are going to want uranium. I wonder what the Opposition would do if it were in government and the communist countries wanted to buy our buturanium. I would like to know what it would do. It certainly would not refuse them; that is for sure. those The real problem facing democracy today is we can create a society that wtil live m a nuclear power world. We are going to see a nuis clear power world. It is going to happen. WhUst know that through our democrauc processes we give our people the right to reject decisions, and that might well happen in some areas, we that the authoritarian countries, the comcountries and the dictatorships are going to go ahead. They are not going to wait to be told honourablewhether they can do it or not. nuThe Opposition has talked about the problem factof risk. A report produced by the Canadian Atomic Energy Commission stated quite clearly is that theriskof 1,000 people being killed by an with a nuclear reactor is about one-ten thousandth of theriskof that number of people lulled as a result of the failure of a dam or a reservoir. How often do we hear of a dam or a failing? Just imagine how remote is the chance of that happening. Much has been said about the problem of nuclear waste but let us welook at the real facts. If Australia's total power from this day to the year 2000 was produced by nuclear reactors-that is 20,000 us be megawatts a year from now to the year 2000-the resultant high level solid waste, the stuff that everybody is so terribly frightened of, be contained in a room measuring 50 feet by 16 feet high. So, how much waste are we talking about? Lang Mr Charles Jones-How many tonnes?",75
167,Mr BOURCHIER,TUC RESOLUTION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY,"If the honourable member wants to talk about tonnes, a 1,000 megawatt unit turns out approximately 2.3 cubic feet of waste per year. The world is expected to be producing 400,000 megawatts of energy by means of nuclear power stations when they are ing at full bore and that will result in only cubic feet of waste a year. Let us be practical about it. It wouldfitinside this room and yet honourable members opposite are worrying about whether the world has enough scientific knowledge to ensure that the waste is safe. It about time that the people started to look the boundaries of Australia tofindout what is happening in the nuclear world and what has been happening since 1934. People say to 'What about an alternative source of energy?' That isfine.We already have solar energy. energy research has been going on for some time and it will continue because this Government made a commitment that some of the proceeds much. from the sale of uranium will be channelled solar energy research. Surely that is what the people want. We know and experts in other countries know that the energy produced from uranium will not last forever and alternative sources of energy are being planned now. But for the next 20 to 50 years there will be a heavy requirement for energy and this requirement only be met by nuclear power. This Government is taking a positive step towards ensuring that play our part in the development and functionit, ing of the nuclear world in which we Uve today.",76
168,Mr CHARLES JONES,TUC RESOLUTION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY,I rise to support the Opposition'sadopted amendment and so as not to delay the House I seek leave to have the text of that amendmentI incorporated in Hansard.,76
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TUC RESOLUTION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY,"Is Bourchier). leave granted? There being no objection, leave granted. The amendment read asfollowsThat all words after 'that' be deleted and the words substituted: This House rejects the Government's precipitate cision, without sufficient public debate in Australia negotiation overseas, to renew the mining and uranium by Australia in the absence of: (1) commitments by customer countries to apply effective and verifiable safeguards against the diversion of Australian uranium from peaceful nuclear poses to military nuclear purposes; (2) international safeguards which will ensure expon of Australian the proliferation of nuclear weapons and increasedriskof nuclear war; (3) procedures for the storage and disposal of tive wastes which will eliminate any danger by such wastes to human life and the environment; and (4) adequate measures to safeguard the environment and national parks and protect Aboriginal rights and interests. operat Mr CHARLES JONES-I thank the House 1,000 and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) who is at the table. I want to convey very clearly to honourable members and to those who are prepared to read Hansard that the amendment moved on behalf is of the Opposition by the Leader of the Oppooutsidesition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) was adopted unanimously both in the executive of the Parliamentary Labor Party and in Caucus by those me: members of the Party who were present, and there were more than enough present for there to Solar be a quorum on each occasion.  into Mr CHARLES JONES-It is all right for the honourable member to say that it does not mean much. It means a lot. How many matters are unanimously carried by any poltiical party? Honourable members opposite are all practical politicians and know as well as I know that there are differences of opinion on the Budget already. can The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has been talking about voting we against the Budget or abstaining from voting on so honourable members opposite should not tell me that all political decisions are made unanimously. I am saying that our amendment discussed through the Party ranks was unanimously. come now to the contribution to this debate by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr We gave him approval to incoris porate the British Trades Union Congress resolution. It was adopted by the pommy shop stewards whom the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) is vUifying in this country. It seems following that when pommy shop stewards come up with a resolution with which the Government agrees dethey are gentlemen and scholars but when they and do something with which the Government does expon of not agree they come from a long line of unmarried parents. Let us get the picture clear. The Government puruses whatever it suits the Government to use, and in this case it is using the TUC resolution because that the it suits the Government's argument. However, uranium will not contribute to the what the Government is not taking into consideration is the position in the United Kingdom and radioacthe fact that in the United Kingdom the people posed have to deal with issues which concern them but which do not concern us. The Opposition lieves that the subject under discussion now, Government's policy on the rnining and sale uranium, is being used by the Government stooge in an endeavour to stir up division in country and create the environment for a law and order election which it can pull on at ute's notice. All I hope is that the people taking part in these demonstrations will terminIndustrial ate their activities immediately and realise they do so this Government will be defeated within the next 12 months and uranium mining then will not be a fact of Ufe. On the other if they want to bring about the return of the Liberal-National Country Party Government and continue the mining and export of uranium they should carry on with their demonstrations and with performances such as they put on when{mmigration the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was at a university a couple of Friday nights ago. they are doing is playing into the hands of Fraser, Anthony and the rest of the members of the Government.

",76
170,Mr CHARLES JONES,TUC RESOLUTION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY,"Of course it wtil. The honourable member should not say that it will not happen here because scientists throughout the world are united in their agreement that level radioactive waste is a pollutant for the nextwell quarter of a mUUon years. We should consider just what that represents in terms oftime.When we were young boys going to school we were taught about the Battle of Hastings and how the terrible Normans came over andfiredtheir arrows in the air killing poor King Harold.

When the a min-Australian Labor Party was in office it who areencouraged the Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organisation, the Australian that if National University and the scientists of Australia to get on with developing solar energy. The world's scientists should be looking at ways hand,to overcome the energy problem. Already the electric motor car is a fact of life. AU that is needed is for it to be expanded to meet modern day requirements. The steam driven car is also a imposition. It is allrightfor the Minister for and Ethnic Affairs to shake his head and laugh but I have driven an electric motor car AU in this city and I haveriddenan electricaUy driven motor bike. They are the facts of Ufe and are in many industries today. They are a practical proposition. We should stop playing around with the issue and get on with developing issues, facingalternative of energy which will cut down fossU fuel and overcome the confronts us. In his speech the honourable member for Edensupported the Governwe would be better been discovered. he accepts it as a fact of life. for I come back to the point I made earlier This is using uranium as an issue to gloss facingover its mismanagement of the economy. The is Fraser Government is trying to mislead Ausin regard to the nuclear fuel cycle with half truths and talk of future economic bonanzas. this We all remember what was said on the Friday after the announcement was made in this place. It was said that $25,000m would be the revenue from the sale of uranium and 500,000 jobs would be provided. AU I ask the Government to indicate is where the $25,000m wtil come from. Where and when wtil the 500,000 jobs be prohighvided? Members of the Government know as as I do that the Government is talking about much smallerfiguresfor the future. Let us turn to some of the half truths which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) spoke in his remarks about the disposal of nuclear waste. In his statement in the House on 25 August he said: Government is satisfied that the technology exists for safe management and ultimate disposal of highly radiowithThe Prime Minister said that Australia would in international studies directed to improve standards for waste disposal. This is an admission by the Government that standards of waste disposal are not at present entirely adequate. We have a typical example by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman). He came into the House today and used the Government's numbers to try to ram down the Parliament's neck facts which were not true. When he had to stand up for the issues tonight on the television program This Day Tonight he had to admit that all he had said today was garbage and that in reality there was not one commercial processing plant in the world today. He tried to mislead the Parliament today. Under questioning in the pubUc gaze he had to admit that. The facts are there. The Pariiamentary Labor Party's environmental committee had a representative of the Atomic Energy Commission address it. The representative was Dr C. J. Hardy, the project manager. He talked to us about the problems of uranium and radioactive waste. He gave us six things which have to be done to get rid of the waste. I quickly go through them. To get protection this is what has to be done: The disposal area must be remote from centres of population. A dry, seismicaUy stable area for bunal must be selected. Burial must be 600 metres below ground. There must be guaranteed insolubility of waste glass. Absorption by soU must be assured if any activity is leached out. There must be a sufficient tune delay to allow radioactivity to decay. It is necessary to bury the waste for upwards of thousands of years. The doctor, on the occasion of his visit to the committee, said that the waste would have to be put in secured land with guards over it AU I aslc is: For how long will it be guarded and who will pay the wages of the guards who are protecting the waste to keep it from revolutionary groups who could get it back and use it. Mr Newman-You have it all wrong.",77
171,Mr CHARLES JONES,TUC RESOLUTION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY,"It is possible. The doctor admitted to me today that it was possible to do that. He has since retracted some of the things he said, particularly about the need for the area to be secured. He said that it would not necessarily need to be secured. But he still admitted that it was possible to recover the waste. So the facts of the matter are quite clear. When we try to getridof this stuff there is a problem associated with it. As far as the problem of pollution is concerned, the uncertainty about waste disposal was shared by the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry Commissioners. For instance, on page 110 of thefirstreport they state: High level wastes are at present stored mainly in liquid form, and some constituents will remain dangerously radioactive for several hundreds of thousands of years. There is at present no generally accepted means by which high level waste can be permanently isolated from the environment and remain safe for very long periods. The Ranger report at page 187 in a postscript which was printed after the first report had been prepared refers to the Flowers Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and spells out the facts. What that Commission had to say about the matter is quite clear. Only yesterday morning on the radio program AM there was an interview. I read part ofit. It states: The General Accounting Office is a Congressional watchdog and it has issued a gloomy 73-page repon. The document was made public at a House sub-committee hearing. The reporter goes on further to say that the United States over a period of 30 years had accumulated something like 74 mUlion gallons of the stuff- that is to use his words-whic h had a Ufe of anywhere from 1,000 years to 250,000 years. Honourable members might ask: What is the General Accounting Office? As I have said, that is a Congressional watchdog. It is overseeing the operations of the United States Energy Research and Development Administration which is another United States Government department. So the situation is that two United States Government departments are carrying out the responsibUity of overseeing what the other is doing, and they cannot agree. The General Accounting Office says that the work which is being done by ERDA is not effective and that there is a problem because there are 74 million gallons of the stuff-agai n using its words. The Minister came in here and tried to ram down our necks-h e was misleading the Parliament-that there is a solution. Yet tonight, I repeat, he admitted on This Day Tonight that there was no commercial plant, which is the same fact as appears from the interview on AM. The General Accounting Office is not satisfied with the way things are going. Honourable members opposite talk about scientists supporting the project. We on this side of the House can list the names of hundreds of scientists throughout Australia who are opposed to the proposition. Mr Newman-Nam e them.",78
172,Mr CHARLES JONES,TUC RESOLUTION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY,"If the Minister will give me an extension of time. I shall give the names to him. But of course he will not. There are hundreds of scientists throughout Australia who are totally opposed to the rnining of uranium. Of course, Government supporters can name scientists who support the project. But, the same time, we on this side of the House have our supporters such as prominent church people, prominent businessmen and all those people who are opposed to the proposition because they are interested in the future of the world and protection of the environment.",78

174,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT," I adopt a different Une to that taken by my colleague, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones). I congratulate the Minister for Immigratrial tion and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) on published Press report in connection with the antiquated thoughts of an old judge at the Bailey in England last Friday. Apparently a man named Rossiter, 37 years of age, was convicted of a serious criminal charge. He pleaded with judge to give him a bond and he would emigrate to Australia within 2 months. I think this is an insult to this nation by the judge at the Old BaUey. It is a retrograde step. The situation is reminiscent of the early 1830s when the Toipuddle martyrs were sentenced to 7 years transportation to Australia. Apparently some judges in the United Kingdom look upon Australia as a dumping ground for people system unworthy of continued residence in the United Kingdom. I speak with some degree of authority about our cnminals. We have Australian criminals who will match the best English criminals any day of the week. It is costing the Australian taxpayers a colossal amount trol crime in Australia. It is almost out without Britain, the mother countiy, trying to expon some of her criminals to Australia. very pleased to learn that the Minister had taken a very firm and positive stand. When the Sun newspaper inquired of him about the matter reported as stating: Mr MACKellar told the Sun: 'Australia will make the decisions on who is permitted to enter the countiy-th wilt not be made in Britain.' I congratulate the Minister on that stand. he wtil take other steps to see that this criminal does not come here under a false name. I hopebane at the Minister will get in touch with Scotland Yard and have the criminal's fingerprints and photograph sent out here so that if he does land we wtil deal with him as we dealt with another professional criminal from Britain, Billy HU1. We did the not let him off the boat in Sydney Harbour. We told him to keep going. Mr.Stewart-What about Vincent Teresa?",79
175,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"He was the American mafia man who came here on a visitor's visa. In the few minutes at my disposal I want to refer, with great respect to members of Parliament who are members of the legal profession, to three stupid old judges in Britain. I do not think those words are strong. I spent a full day at the Old Bailey reDam Project centiy watching the processes of a criminal tnal. ",79
176,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"I was not in the dock, but I know some Liberals who could have been in the dock in Australia. Three judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Britain reversed the decision of a judge who had sentenced a man to three a years' imprisonment for attempted rape of a defenceless woman. He broke three of her ribs Old and her jaw and battered her face about. The trial judge sentenced the prisoner to three years' imprisonment. The man appealed to the Coun of the Criminal Appeal and appeared before three judges. A representative of the Army appeared and said that the prisoner was a good soldier and a credit to the nation. The man was put on a bond. This brought widespread demonstrations by the women of Great Britain.

I hope Mr KEVIN CAIRNS (Lilley) (10.32)-My concern is at some recent statements about BrisAirport. As would be very well known to this Government and members of this House, Commonwealth Games are to be held in they Brisbane in 1982. A number of statements have been made about the adequacy of that airport serve the Games. It should be quite clear that airport will not be able to serve the Commonto wealth Games adequately. I merely relate one two facts to make that crystal clear.",79
179,Mr YOUNG,ADJOURNMENT,Shift them to Canbena.,80
180,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ADJOURNMENT,"It would be clear even to the honourable member for The only circumstance under which that airport will be able to serve those Games adequately it operates as a secondary and second-rate muter airport to which international travellers to Australia will commute after having landed places such as Sydney, Melbourne, Darwin the other major airports in Australia. I have recounted the facts about the airport previously, ber Mr but one or two further facts need to be made closely. known. Recently a director of Qantas Airways Ulustrates Ltd, Sir John Egerton, toured with two other directors of Qantas. He had some the dark for thehad interesting things to say about his visit. I quote very unlike the intellectual from the Sunday Sun of 4 September of this place. yean 'Brisbane Airport is about to become an international joke', Sir John said. 'We are extremely concerned. 'The airport is inadequate, and the worse feature is very little prospect of upgrading it in time for Games' . . . It was the first time the delegation three Qantas directors had inspected Brisbane port . . . 'The overseas terminal is functional. It might not be an architect's joy or an aesthete's delight, present the terminal is able to handle the traffic. 'It is the main runway that is the big problem. Airport needs a new runway*. The evidence for that statement is quite overpeople whelming. No substantial international planes can take of fuUy loaded from Brisbane Airport. That is logical, because it has the shortest runway of aU the Australian capital cities and AUce Springs. For Australia's third airport, designed to serve the Commonwealth Games, it is totaUy inadequate. Itilustratethe position. Recently, during the strike by technicians in the United Kingdom, planes of an international carrier- I wiU name it-were delayed around the world. jumbo operated by that carrier operates into Brisbane Airport. That carrier operates into Brisimportant. bane Airport, but only on short hops from Brisbane to Sydney or Brisbane to Darwin. planes were many hours and many days late operator decided to go to Singapore from BrisWhen bane. Planes go quite easUy from Sydney to Sin-one gapore, from Sydney to Manila, from Sydney the Hong Kong and from Sydney to Bangkok, but cannot travel to those places from Brisbane. So this airUne decided to operate from Brisbane to to Singapore. The operator put 400 passengers the on board-60 fewer than its complement. Eight ten tons of cargo had to be off-loaded to or lighten the load of the plane so that it could make the distance. The plane had to operate in the dead of night in the coldest months in winter with a favourable wind. It was able to make the trip from Brisbane to Singapore, but only in Port Adelaide. those circumstances. is if Mr Donald Cameron-It only just made it. com Mr KEVIN CAIRNS-And only just. at Mr Donald Cameron-It had only 20 yards to and spare at the end of the runway. KEVIN CAIRNS-The honourable memfor Griffith has studied those matters very I thank him for his advice. That merely the gravity and tragedy of the probBrisbane Airport lem. The plane to operate in the cold and in flight to be successful. That is processes in this I make it clear that that airport will not only be unable to serve the Games as an international airport but also it cannot serve the area today adthere is equately as an international airport. Those visithe tors who come to the Games thinking they are of coming in economical, fully loaded flights, at a Airminimum fare and with the maximum abUity to but at travel the maximum distance from the airport, which would reduce the cost of travel, will not be Brisbane able to do that from that airport during the Games. That needs to be understood. Certain say that planes are able to use the airport adequately. The planes can do so only if they operate at a substandard level of economic efficiency, off-loading fuel, cargo or passengers. They are certainly not able to operate from such an airport in a sub-tropical city in the months of September and October when the tarmac temperatures will be in the vicinity of at least 30 degrees.",80
181,Mr YOUNG,ADJOURNMENT,"Obviousl y when the honourable memA ber for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) woke this morning he thought that Brisbane Airport was Because Mr Kevin Cairns-It is, is it not? this Mr YOUNG-Undoubtedly it is important. I read the papers this morning I felt that of the most important and most scandalous to features in any of those newspapers was the \ report of the visit of Mr MCKay to the headAmerica J uarters of the Liberal Party of Australia to eal about donations to the Liberal Party for next election if uranium should be an issue. There can be no doubt that in any election in the next quarter of a century uranium will be issue. We have observed the way in which the Uranium Forum has used its money in the past month to convince people that the mining of uranium is in the best interests of this country. Leaving aside the argument about uranium, it surprising that the newspapers could bare their souls in this manner-that they could carry story today about what the Uranium Forum has already told the Liberal Party. Just offhand would judge that if the Forum gave the same amount to the Liberal Party as it has already spent on advertisements throughout Australia probably the Liberal Party will be on the receivit ing end of a donation of $500,000. We have repeatedly raised this question nations to pohtical parties. We have put forward the case-w e will continue to do so-to expose the scandal in which the Liberal and National Country parties are involved. They are receiving donations of this nature to buy their poUcies. There can be not doubt that yesterday was the formal agreement reached after all the tiations that have taken place during the months in which this Government has been in power. If the uranium mining interests say: 'If uranium is an issue we will give you money', then probably sinular undertakings have been made by many other companies which it is comThen mon knowledge give large sums of money to the Liberal and National Country Parties. Whilst many honourable members of this National Uament know very Uttle about it-thos e sitting opposite in the chamber tonight have had nothcattle ing to do with it- a couple of honourable bers of this Parliament who represent the Liberal and National Country Parties indeed are inQueensland volved in raising this massive amount of money. There is no ceiling to the amount of money that can be spent. There is no end to the amount money which companies Uke the uranium composals panies could pour mto the Liberal Party to buy the souls of its members. That is exactly what happened. Honourable members opposite ought to look closely at this practice which has developed Australia and take notice of the fact that in dence given recently before the Australian estic Broadcasting Tribunal it was shown that in countries, national election campaigns in Australia we are now spending more money per head of popuexports. lation than is being spent in the United States on a presidential campaign. We are do a increasing the amounts being spent, whilst the the United States Congress is trying to reduce the amounts, the ceilings or the levels that have been set in the United States. One of these days there an will be a massive blow-up. There wtil be an expose of corruption such as this country has never seen because of deals which are being done by the Liberal and National Country Parties with the uranium forum, the oU companies is and the muting companies to try to make sure that they hold their position of power, to make a sure they are able to give greater exposure to their policies at the election campaigns, both I State and Federal, throughout Australia. This sort of procedure can only have a certain Ufe. It cannot go on for ever. Whilst the Liberal and National Country Parties receive the benefits of at the moment, undoubtedly they wtil receive the blows from it when it isfinallyexposed. of do Mr MCKay from the uranium forum ought to take notice that there are people in this Parliament who are conscious of the reform that is taking place in the democracies throughout the world in elections and political campaigning. Such reforms wtil be invoked in Australia only eventually because most people with common negosense support them. The United Kingdom, 18 France, West Germany, the United States, all the Scandinavian countries-ever y country in the world-is now adopting some procedures to put a Umit on expenditure on poltiical campaigns, and Australia will have to adopt the same procedure. all the scandal and corruption in which the Liberal Party is now involved wtil be completely exposed and it will have to carry the baby. Par Mr MACKENZIE (Calare) (10.43)-Tonight I wish to discuss some features of the Australian industry and its associated beef poUtics. memFew people would deny that the ptight of the industry is serious indeed, particularly in and the Northern Territory, where in many situations it is disastrous for those producers who are totally reliant on beef cattle for of their UveUhood. A plethora of schemes and prohas been put forward to rectify this situation, but many have overlooked the fundamenhas tal causes of the beef industry's problems. Basically these arefivefold.Firstly, the closure of overseas markets, particularly the European in Economic Community, the United States of eviAmerica and Japan, resulting largely from dombeef surpluses in those and other importing has created tremendous difficulties for the industry, which is 60 per cent reliant upon The rapid growth of both cattle numbers of and cattle producers following boom conditions some years ago has been another major conCarige) tributing factor. The industry has been beset dramatic increases in on-farm costs and killing and processing costs in the past three years. level of industrial disputation in the killing, processing and shipment sectors of the industry stated: has cost producers up to $20 or $30 per beast slaughtered. Finally, all export industries, to including the cattle industry, have to carry the to burden of tariff protection granted facturing industries- a burden amounting to It some $230m for the cattle industry alone. This Government will shortly be announcing a number of measures designed to assist both the short term and long term problems of the indushis try. These and other measures have been cussed for a considerable period, in some up to two years, with various producer organisappear ations associated with the industry. The Governfor ment and the organisations have to ensure that these measures give greatest benefit to those ducers in greatest need. They must be effective, both in the short term and in stabilising industry in the longer term and they must ensure national. that Australia is regarded as a reliable and responsible suppUer of beef of a predictable qualcontributions ity to our trading partners. WhUst most of the organisations representing cattle producers have acted in a responsible informed manner, there is one whose activities have been notoriously emotional and senFederation, sational, and which have caused unfortunate divisions and rancour within the industry. I to the Cattlemen's Union of Australia. This organisation has now apparently placed itself above industry organisations, above the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and above the thought elected Government. The National Director of the Cattlemen's Union, in a speech given at his first pubUc meeting as Director, in Goulburn said: And if you are a Minister, an industry organisation, an industry leader or even a Government, and you are serious about the job, or if you the top of you. Mr Thomson-Who do they think they are?",80
182,Mr MACKENZIE,ADJOURNMENT,"No doubt many people of ask the same question as the honourable memat ber for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson), a member who, I might add, has worked continuously for in country people and beef producers in North Queensland, a member who has led many deplays bates on rural issues in this place, as have many industry. of his colleagues, including the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), the honourable member for Capricornia and the honourable member for Wide by Bay (Mr MUlar). But let us see what else this Director had to say. Having criticised the Prime The Minister elsewhere, the Director resorted to a new level of cheap sensationalism when he Every time another cattle man in Eden-Monaro is forced walk off, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro ought take a bag of cow manure and empty it on the carpet of the to our manuPrime Minister's office. is abhorrent to see that this highly paid Director of the Cattlemen's Union has resorted to such petty and threatening outbursts in order to justify his position and in order to further the cause of organisation. One wonders what he will say dison his second public platform. The tactics cases employed by the Cattlemen's Union would to be a desperate attempt to claim credit the forthcoming measures to assist the cattle industry at the expense of the well documented proand researched representations put to government by the long-estabUshed and well-regarded the rural industry organisations, both State and The Prime Minister recognised the valuable made by organisations such as the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, the Australian National Cattlemen's and Council, the Australian Wool Growers' and Graziers' Council and the Australian Farmers' in responding to a question asked in the Parliament this week. The credibUity of the refer Cattlemen's Union is being eroded by its extreme and sensational outbursts. Much of the valuable progress and public awareness that it has achieved is being dissipated. I should have it to be in the interests of the whole cattle industry that the Cattlemen's Union, with its undoubted energies, abilities and funds, be directed to closer collaboration and co-operation with the other industry organisations and the Government to secure a return to economic stability and not security for all sections of the cattle industry. get in the way, we will go over",82
183,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT," I suggest to the honourable member for Calare (Mr Mackenzie) that the formation of the Cattlemen's Union Australia was a spontaneous gesture of protest the way in which the conservative coalition Government has ignored the needs of cattlemen this country.

The 'Although other thing which should be recollected is that guidelines the Cattlemen's Union recognised fully the way suggested in which the National Country Party has sold itself out to the big, foreign controlled mineral interests in this country.

The Company did not apply for a continuation of the grant in respect of the 1976-77financialyear. I understand that Gollin Holdings Limited and related companies are being investigated by Mr John Spender, QC. (2) A condition of a health program grant is that an approved organisation isrequiredto forward to my Department by 31 October, or such later date as is approved, certified audited accounts for the preceding budget period ending 30 June, which show the operation receipts and payments for the activities of the organisation which nave attracted a health program grant. My Department requested audited accounts in respect of the 1975-76 financial year. However, the Personnel Manager of Gollin Holdings Ltd, advised my Depanment that the medical practitioner was retrenched on 30 June 1976 due to thefinancialposition of the Company and that it was not possible for Gollin Holdings Ltd to supply audited statements in respect of the 1975-76financialyear because the provisional liquidators would not approve the cost involved to undertake such an audit. He also advised my Depanment that the health program grant approved was used exclusively to offset the medical practitioner's salary and expenses. $000 Mr H. W.
