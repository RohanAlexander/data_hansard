0,NA,Unknown,". JHouse oE ISeprcsentattUES. Friday, 18 October, 1012. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. PERSONAL EXPLANATION. MATERNITY ALLOWANCE.",14
1,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. When the Maternity Allowance Bill was at the second reading stage, on behalf of the Opposition, I moved an amendment affirming the undcsirableness of dealing piecemeal with the big question of social insurance, and favouring the introducing of a comprehensive scheme. I supported the amendment with a statement that it represented on broad lines the policy of the last Government. That statement was subsequently challenged by the honourable member for Cook, and the Minister of Trade and Customs declared that only one report on the subject had been foundin his Department, that of Mr Taylor.",14
2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It dealt with unemployment insurance.,14
3,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I understand that the other records referred to by me have not been found, but I only heard of my statement having been doubted a few days ago. Fortunately, I have in my possession papers which place the correctness of what I said beyond doubt, and I shall read a letter addressed by Mr Knibbs to myself and dated 24th January, 1910, which sets forth what took place between us, and covers a preliminary report of even dateAt the Tequest of yourself, the Prime Minister, and the Attorney-General I have looked pretty thoroughly into the question of workmen's insurance in various countries in Europe. It is clear to me that the full"" benefits from the stand-point of social economics require^ that, If possible, it should cover (a) old age, (b) invalidity, (c) sickness, (d) accident, («). death of breadwinner, (/) non-employment. No solution has yet been found for (c) and (/), though the matter has been very carefully considered in various quarters. I have all the necessary literature, and came in contact with some of the men in Europe who are personally dealing with these problems, and have in my mind the lines on which a report should he prepared. He then goes on to deal with the advancement of this matter in Germany and other European countries. I had made the suggestion that as it was of such importance lie should devote, for a time at least, the whole of his attention to it.",14
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is now going beyond a personal explanation. I do not wish to interfere, but I ask whether he intends to read all the documents he has in his hand ?",15
5,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I am going to read one letter only. Mr Knibbs continuedIt would, be a great pleasure to me to devote my whole time to the matter, but I am. unable to do so through the great pressure.of current duty. The literature to be looked up and verified is extensive, and it is in foreign languages. So great is the importance of the matter for theproper guidance of the Government, especially if legislation be contemplated, that it would bewell if I were, authorized to employ some capable man with a thorough knowledge of at least French and German, and a reading knowledge of Italian. He could, uncier my guidance, and in a form to be determined by me, complete a comprehensive report on the social experiments, experience, and legislation in regard to workmen, and in respect of the features mentioned. Probably such a person could be had for r?s. to £ 1 per day. I would draft the report, direct the research, chc:k results, and make myself responsible Ior the whole thing. I transmit herewith a General. Apercu: on German Workmen's Insurance from the standpoint of social economics, and up to 1904. This is obtained, from authoritative sources, and w i ll advise you as to the movement in the direction indicated. I have sent copies .also to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, and I may be able to send more information at a later date, say,, in fourteen days, but. this is doubtful.. In. pursuance of the request madeto Mr. Knibbs, the valuablt general report which was laid on the table in September last, was prepared by him, and presented. I suggest that this preliminary report: also should be laid on the table.",15
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must now confine himself wholly to a personal explanation. Mr TUDOR:-As k a question on the subject.,15
7,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I listened to the honourable member for Kooyong movinghis amendment, and later asking the Minister a question as to a report prepared with, regard to a scheme of social insurance, and it was found that there was no scheme prepared.",15
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order. !,15
9,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"What the honourable gentleman refers to now is a report, and there is a vast difference between a report and a scheme.",15
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order 1,15
11,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Has the Minister any objection to the letter and the report I referred to being laid upon the table and printed ?,15
12,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I presume that it is an official document in the possession, of the Trade and Customs or Home Affairs Department. If the honourable gentleman will let me see the letter and the report, I shall consider his request, because I am always anxious to do a fair thing by every member of the House.",15
13,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister whether the papers referred to - contain any reference to the question of maternity insurance, endowment, or assistance ? "" Mr TUDOR - No . I do not know that that has ever been claimed by the Opposition, but if it has been claimed, I do not think that it is a correct claim.",15
14,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,It never has been claimed-. NA STATE ELECTORATES.,15
15,Sir JOHN FORREST,BOUNDARIES OF FEDERAL AND,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Whether he proposes to arrange the subdivisions of the Federal electoral divisions which return members to this House, so as to make the boundaries of such subdivisions conform as nearly as possible to the boundaries of the State electorates included, in such Federal division, and to have the electors distributed accordingly ? 2. Whether failure to do this will not be most inconvenient, such for instance in the Swan division in Western Australia', in the case of Katanning, which formerly included Wagin, in the case of Williams, which included Narrogin, and' in the case of Beverley, which, included Pingelly, and many more similar cases?",15
16,Mr KING OMALLEY,BOUNDARIES OF FEDERAL AND,"The answers' to the questions arer. It has been the. policy of the Commonwealth Electoral Office to make, as far as. possible, the boundaries of subdivisions of Federal electorates coincide with the boundaries of State, electorates ; but unfortunately in the State of Western Australia a redistribution of the State electorates disturbed in some instances, the co-terminous boundaries, and it is understood that a further redistribution by the State is contemplated. When, however, the redistribution of the Federal electorates in Western Australia has been, approved, the question of making theboundaries of the subdivisions of such electorates conform to State electorate boundaries will receive consideration. 2. If it should be found' impracticable to arrange the boundaries of the Commonwealth subdivisions so as to agree with the State electorate boundaries, no very great inconvenience will result, as separate Rolls are provided for Commonwealth and State purposes. cases have occurred throughout the Commonwealth, and have not proved unduly troublesome. NA STEAMERS.",15
17,Mr FOWLER,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"the Postmaster General, upon noticeJ. Is he aware that recently a mail steamer (the Orsova) lay off Fremantle for some thirty hours before entering the harbour and delivering the mails, thereby causing great inconvenience and disarrangement to the Postal Department and the general public ? 2. Does the Minister consider the plea is sustainable that the weather was too rough to allow this steamer to enter the river, in view of the fact that the German mail-boat came in during the time that the Orsova lay at anchor outside? 3. W i ll the Minister call the attention of the Mail Steam-ship Company concerned to the necessity for carrying out their contract with the utmost possible efficiency, consistent with reasonable precaution against accident? 4. W i ll the Minister give instructions that, in the event of the recurrence of such cases as that here referred to, the Postal authorities shall arrange for the prompt transference of the mails to a tender or other means of communication with the shore?",16
18,Mr FRAZER,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. The RMS. Orsova reached Gage Roads at 6.25 a.m. on the 3rd ultimo, and attempted to enter harbour, but was forced to return to anchorage in the Roads. She eventually berthed at the wharf at 11.35 - - a m o n idem. 2. The Harbor authorities were consulted regarding the possibility of landing mails by launch on the 3rd, and again early on the 4th, and they advised that it was impossible to do so; a W.N.W. to W.S.W. gale blowing with a velocity of 40 to 50 miles per hour, and witli much increased force at intervals. The G.A.S.S. Bochum berthed in the harbour at 6.15 p.m. on the 3rd, but this vessel carries no top hamper, therefore whilst the mail steamer was subject to the full force of the gale, the German boat was more or less protected in the river, and more easily navigated. 3. The necessity for expedition in landing the mails at all times has been impressed on the company. 4. The Department's officers are fully alive to the importance of the expeditious handling of the mails, but in such cases as that referred to they must be guided by the expert opinion of The Harbor authorities. NAVIGATION BILL. /« Committee (Consideration resumed from 17th October, vide page 4409). Amendment (by Mr TUDOR) agreed toThat the following new clause be inserted :202 -(1. ) A Surveyor or any person from the question authorized by the Minister to inspect or survey [163]- 2 ship may, in the execution of his duties, go on board any ship at all reasonable times and inspect the same or any part thereof, including Similar her boilers, machinery, and equipment, and the certificates of the master and officers of the ship, but shall not in .such inspection unnecessarily detain or delay the ship from proceeding on her voyage. (2.) The Minister may, on the report of the surveyor or person inspecting the ship, if he considers it necessary so to do, require the ship to be taken into dock or to be so dealt with that he may be able to inspect her hull, boiler -,, machinery, or equipment. (3.) No person shall obstruct or hinder any surveyor or authorized person from going on board any ship or shall otherwise impede him in the execution of his duties under this Act. Penalty : One hundred pounds. Amendment (by Mr TUDOR) proposed - That the following new clause be inserted :""212 -(1 ) Every person who sends any ship to sea in an unseaworthy state, so that £he l i fe of any person is likely to be thereby endangered, shall, unless he proves that he used all reasonable means to insure the seaworthiness of the ship, be guilty of an indictable offence. (2.) Every master who knowingly takes a ship to sea in an unseaworthy state, so that the l if e of any person is likely to be thereby endangered, shall be guilty of an indictable offence. (3.) A prosecution under this section shall not be instituted except by the consent of the Attorney-General. (4.) Nothing in this section shall subject the owner or master of a ship to any liability, by reason of the ship being sent or taken to sea in an unseaworthy state, where, owing to special circumstances, the sending of the ship to sea in 'he 4 * that state was reasonable and justifiable'.""",16
19,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Angas) [10.44]--This is one of the clauses which were originally omitted from the Bill, and which are contamed in the Merchant .Shipping Act. I have looked through them. On the whole, they seem to be copies of the provisions in the Merchant Shipping Act, but in one or two of them amendments have been introduced. In new clause 202, for instance, there is an amendment. It provides that where a ship is sent to sea in an unseaworthy state, so that life is liable to be endangered, the person sending the ship is guilty of an indictable offence unless he proves that he used all reasonable means to insure her seaworthiness. In section 457 of the Merchant Shipping Act there is an additional ground of defence, and that is that the sending of the ship in the circumstances was reasonable and justifiable. It will be recognised that there may be special circumstances justifying the sending of a vessel to sea apart altogether of whether; her a seaworthiness has been ascertained or not. I do not know why this additional ground of defence has been left out of the new clause. I think it is much better, unless there is substantial reason for varying the terms of the Imperial section, to adhere to the text, because then we shall have the advantage of any decision which may be given. There is no doubt that the additional ground of defence given in England is a very substantial one. The captain or the owner-this refers to the owner, I think, as well as to the captainmay not be able to test on a particular occasion the seaworthiness of a ship. An' emergency may have arisen, and it may be necessary to take a risk. If it can be shown that the risk was justified in a case, that defence is open in England, but it will not be open in the Commonwealth. But whether this provision is in the Bill or not, the persons affected by a vessel being sent to sea in an unseaworthy condition have, I think, a right of action for damages. The sailors would certainly have a right of action for damages.",16
20,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Do you mean the persons sent to sea on an unseaworthy ship or the persons who are unjustly or improperly brought to book under the provision?,17
21,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I think that any one who was affected by unseaworthiness amounting to negligence would have a right of action - I speak, of course, subject to any qualification which may be necessary by a fuller consideration of the provision.",17
22,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Do you mean that any person taken to sea in an unseaworthy ship within the meaning of the Act would have fi right of action?,17
23,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I do not say that absolutely, but the common law and a special provision of the Bill give a right of action.",17
24,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Do you mean to say that when the law imposes a duty, failure to perform that duty on the part of a public body or person gives a right of action to a person who has suffered because of that failure?",17
25,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Generally that is the case, but I would not say it absolutely. There are distinctions drawn between nonfeasance and malfeasance in connection with public bodies, which prevent one generally accepting the statement impliedly made by the Attorney-General.",17
26,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,In clause 57 there is the obligation.,17
27,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I knew that there was a provision somewhere in the Bill. that in clause 57 there is an implication that the vessel shall be seaworthy. I know that that is required by the common law apart altogether from the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act which we have copied. I merely mention that to show that, even apart from this new clause, there is some protection given to the persons affected, and, therefore, there is no reason that I can see why we should not add the additional ground of defence. It appears, however, to be shifted to another place. I hope that, as far as possible, unless there is some ground for altering the text of the Merchant Shipping Act, when we do adopt any provisions of that Act we shall maintain them in their fulness. Proposed new clause agreed to.",17
28,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.50] - I move That the following new clause be inserted :"" 212A. If a British ship is unseaworthy a seaman or apprentice belonging to her shall not be deemed to have committed a breach of his agreement by reason of his having refused to sail in her while she is unseaworthy; and anv seaman ot apprentice"" so refusing may claim hGs discharge unless the ship is made seaworthy within a reasonable time."" Section 462 of the Merchant Shipping Act, I understand, gives power to detain unseaworthy ships even though they are foreign ships. This matter has been considered, and it has been held that we have no power to interfere with contracts between the master and seamen of foreign ships in these cases. I am not sure that we have the power.",17
29,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Is not this provision intended to cover a case such as the Olympic case ?,17
30,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"The crew refused to take the Olympic to sea, and most of the firemen deserted.",17
31,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,I think it is intended to cover that case.,17
32,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,That or a similar case.,17
33,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,It is a very big power to take.,17
34,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I do not remember the number of the clause at present, but it is provided in the Bill that a ship is unseaworthy if she does not, for instance, carry sufficient rockets, or her medicine chest is not properly equipped.",17
35,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Clause 211 says that a ship shall not be deemed seaworthy unless she is in a fit state.,17
36,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Yes , as regards her fitI see ness to encounter ordinary perils of the deep. The equipment is held to include a lot of minor things.",17
37,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,It includes life-saving appliances.,18
38,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Yes . In the Bill we have provided that the men cannot have their discharges if a defect be remedied within a certain time. A reasonable opportunity must be given to the owners to make the ship seaworthy. It may be found that there are a few rockets short, or an insufficient number of lifebelts. They may have been left on the wharf. While these things are not on the ship the whole of the seamen can go ashore and hold her up. We provide that if a ship is made seaworthy within a reasonable time the men cannot claim their discharges. Proposed new clause agreed to.",18
39,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.54] - I move That the following new clause he inserted :""236 -(1. ) Except as prescribed, every foreign-going ship, Australian-trade ship, or - ship engaged in the coasting trade, carrying fifty or more persons, including passengers and crew, shall before going to sea from any port in Australia be equipped with an efficient apparatus for wireless communication in good working order in charge of one or more persons holding prescribed certificates of skill in the use of such apparatus. (2.) For the purposes of this section. apparatus for wireless communication shall not be deemed 4o be efficient unless(a) it is capable of transmitting and receiving messages over a distance of at least one hundred miles, day or night; (i) the person controlling the operator undertakes in writing to the Minister to exchange, and does, in fact, exchange, as far as may be physically practicable (of which the master shall be the judge), messages with shore or ship stations using similar or other systems of wireless communication; and (c) there is provided, in connection with the apparatus, and ready for use whenever from any cause the ordinary supply of electrical power is not available, a battery of accumulators of such capacity as to insure for a of at least six hours communication of the efficiency prescribed in paragraph (a) of this sub-section. (3.) The master of a ship required by this section, to be so equipped shall not take her to sea, and the owner of a ship required to be so equipped shall not permit her to go to sea, unless the requirements of this section have been complied with. Penalty : One thousand pounds. (4.) The Kegulations may prescribe the times and hours during which an operator shall be in attendance on the apparatus, ready to receive or transmit messages. (5.) Except as otherwise prescribed, the provisions of this section shall not apply to ships plying exclusively between ports in Australia less than two hundred miles apart."" The question of wireless telegraphy was slightly discussed when' I asked the Committee to omit a certain clause. We have decided to deal with the matter of exemptionby regulation rather than by a provision in the Act, so that the power to exempt any ships will exist. On account of wireless telegraphy being a system' which is continually altered, we think that it should be dealt with by regulation, and not by a special provision. I think that sufficient power is taken in the new clause. In the previous discussion the honourable member for Fremantle said that there should be some auxiliary appliance or accumulators provided for the purpose of keeping the batteries going. In paragraph c of subclause 2 we make that provision.",18
40,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,He referred to. a deficiency of accumulators. He was afraid that if anything went wrong with the accumulators there would be nothing on the boat to generate an electric current.,18
41,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"A vessel which did not get enough energy to supply the accumulators would 'be in a very bad way indeed. I think it is safe to say that nine-tenths of the steam-ships-al l steamships over 2,000 tons-ar e lit up by electricity, and carry out various operations with electric power. If there is not sufficient electric power on a boat to keep the, wireless communication going it means about the end of that boat. We have adopted the limit which was fixed upby. the International Convention which sat about the time when this Bill was read a second time. Of course, if the limit is found to be insufficient it will require to be altered, but I am informed that at present it will cover practically all cases that may arise. It will be a very extraordinary case which it will not cover. We have period taken sufficient power by regulations to do everything which may be necessary.",18
42,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,It covers limited trade ships.,18
43,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"It might. Proposed new clause agreed to. Amendments (by Mr TUDOR) agreed toThat the following new clauses be inserted :"" 263A -(1. ) Where, by fault of two or more vessels, damage or loss is caused to one or more vessels, to their cargoes or freight, or to any property on board, the liability to make good the damage or loss shall be in proportion to the degree in which each vessel was in f a u l t : Provided that, - if, having regard 'to all the cumstances of the case, it is not possible to establish different degrees of fault,' the liability shall be apportioned equally. (a.) Nothing ih this section shall operate so as to render any vessel liable for any loss or damage to which her fault has not contributed. (3.) Nothing in this section shall affect bility of any person under a contract of carriage or any contract or shall be construed as imposing any - liability upon any person from which he is exempted by any contract or by any provision of law or as affecting the right of ariy person to limit his liability in manner provided by law. {4.) For the purposes of this section, the expression "" freight"" includes passage money and hire, and references to damage or loss caused by the fault of a vessel shall be construed as including references to any salvage or other expenses consequent upon that fault, recoverable at law by way of damages. 263B -(1. ) Where loss of life or personal injuries are suffered by any - person on board a vessel owing to the fault of that vessel and of - any other vessel or vessels, the - liability of the owners of the vessels shall be joint and several. (2.) Nothing in this section shall be construed as depriving any person of any right of defence - on which, independently of this section, he might have relied in an action brought against him by the person injured or any person or persons entitled to sue in respect of such loss of life, or shall affect the right of any person to limit .his liability in cases to which this section relates in the manner provided by law. 263c -(1. ) Where loss of life or personal injuries are suffered by any person on board a vessel owing to the fault of that vessel and any other vessel or vessels, and a proportion of the damages is recovered against the owner of one of the vessels which exceeds the proportion in which she was in fault.; he may recover by way of contribution the ambunt of the 'excess from the owners of the other vessels to the extent to which those vessels were respectively in fault : Provided that no amount shall be so recovered which could not, by reason of any statutory or contractual limitation of, or 'exemption from, liability, or which could not, for any other reason, have been recovered in the first instance - as damages by the persons entitled 'to sue there for. (2.) In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the persons entitled to any contribution as provided by sub-section (1) of this section shall, for the purpose of recovering the contribution, have, subject to the provisions of this Act, the same rights and powers as the persons entitled to sue for damages in the first instance 263D - Any enactment which confers on any - Court Admiralty jurisdiction damage shall have effect as though references to such damage . included references to damages for loss of life or personal injury, and accordingly proceedings in respect of such damages may be brought in rem or in personam. 264. Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (4) of section four hundred and nineMr Tudor. teen of the Merchant Shipping Act, in case of a collision a vessel shall not be deemed to be in fault solely by reason of the fact that the cir. vessel has - infringed any of - the regulations for the prevention of collisions at sea. Amendment (by Mr TUDOR) proposed - That the following new clause be inserted 265 -(1 ) In every case of collision between two vessels it shall be the duty of the person in charge of each vessel, if and so far as he can the liado so without danger to his own vessel, crew, and passengers (if any)(a) to render to the other vessel, her master, crew, and passengers (if any) such assistance as is practicable and necessary in order to save them from danger caused by the collision; and (b) to stay by the other vessel until he has ascertained that she has no need of . further assistance. (2.) If the master of any vessel fails without reasonable cause to comply with this section, he shall be guilty of an indictable offence. (3.) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2) of section four hundred and twenty-two of the Merchant Shipping Act, in case of a collision between two vessels, the collision shall not be deemed to have been caused by the wrongful act, neglect, or default of the master or person in charge of the vessel, who failed to comply with the provisions of that section, solely by reason of the fast that he has not complied with the provisions of that section.""",18
44,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Angas) [10.58] - I think that sub-clause 3 of this provision presumesto vary one of the sections of the Merchant Shipping Act by saying that it shall not apply. I think that that section does not. occur in the Part of the Act which we may modify under the terms of section 735. The sub-clause readsNotwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2) of section four hundred and twenty-two - of the Merchant Shipping Act,19
45,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"That , has been modified by section 4 of the Merchant Shipping Act of last vear in accordance with the decision of the Maritime Convention.",19
46,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I am not talking about the policy, but about the power. Under section 735 of the Merchant Shipping Act this Parliament has power toRepeal, wholly or in part, any provisions of this Act (other than those of the Third Part thereof which relate to emigrant ships), relating to ships registered in that possession. The part to which the new clause will bein respect of long applies, I think, to all British ships. - It may be that the power which we have under the Merchant Shipping Act will b'eexceeded.",19

48,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"That is in relation to vessels registered here, but I think the part of the Bill in which this clause is to be inserted relates to British ships. Proposed new clause agreed to.

Penalty (on master, owner, or agent) : Five .hundred pounds. (2.) Any payment for services bond fide rendered in the carriage of mails, passengers, or goods, at rates based solely on the actual commercial value of these services, shall not be taken to be a subsidy within the meaning of this section."" I Mr Glynn (Angas) [11.3] - I do not know why it is provided in this new clause that a vessel that has been at any time during the preceding twelve months receiving a subsidy shall be disqualified from engaging in the coasting trade. I never could see why this limitation should be put in. It is restrictive, and will apply to vessels which are no longer receiving subsidies as long as they have been receiving, them during the preceding twelve months.",20
49,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,I think the clause is perfectly fair. It is not retrospective.,20
50,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Darling Downs) [11.4] The new clause is, in effect, retrospective, because it says that "" a ship shall not engage in the coasting trade which is receiving, or which, under any arrangement, is to receive, or which in the immediately preceding twelve months has been receiving"" a subsidy. Suppose this measure were to come into force on ist January next year. A vessel may have been in receipt of subsidies for the whole of the present year. When she received them' this clause was not in contemplation. But the Bill will operate so as to exclude her from engaging in the coastal trade. What is the reason for it? The desire is, generally speaking, of course to exclude vessels which are in receipt of subsidies from engaging in the coasting trade. We have agreed to that. But under this clause the Government are harking back twelve months before the Bill comes into force. If the measure were not to come into force for a period of twelve months, there might be some reason for it, but I presume that the Government will bring it into force as soon as they can. The clause seems to me to act unjustly in that respect, because it will involve a prohibition of vessels engaging in the coasting trade which are not in receipt of subsidies at the time, although they did receive subsidies twelve months before. The clause appears tome to go further than is needed. We only wish to keep out vessels actually in receipt of subsidies. The mere fact that a vessel received a subsidy twelve months before need not prevent her engaging in the trade. Will the Minister explain the reason for this clause?",20
51,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [11.7] - The object of this clause is to prevent unfair competition, which may be brought about in various ways. It has to be remembered that the British mercantile marine is an established and persistent fact. The mercantile marine of other countries has to fight for a share of trade. Other countries pay subsidies to their mercantile marine because it is comparatively small. But it is impossible for the British mercantile marine to be subsidized correspondingly. The honourable member for Angas takes exception to the fact that we are bringing under the prohibition vessels that have been receiving subsidies. I think that is very necessary. Take a case. Suppose a subsidy is paid for any twelve months at the rate of one penny per ton, or per running mile, according to the French practice, or in a lump sum. All that would have to be done to avoid this clause would be to pay double the subsidy for one year, and the subsidized ship would have the. free run of our coast for a year, at any rate. Other arrangements might be made for the next year, calculated to destroy the purpose of the clause. If the prohibition is necessary at all, it is necessary to be put in this form. Proposed new clause agreed to. Amendments (by Mr TUDOR) agreed toThat the following new clauses be inserted :"" 32SA. Where any dispute arises as to the apportionment of any amount of salvage amongst the owners, master, pilot, crew, and other persons in the service of any foreign vessel, the amount shall be apportioned by the Court or person making the apportionment in accordance with the law of the country to which the vessel belongs.""

(2.) No action shall be maintainable under this Act to enforce any contribution in respect of an over-paid proportion of any damages for loss of l if e or personal injuries unless proceedings therein are commenced within one year from the date of payment. (3.) Any Court having jurisdiction to deal with an action to which this section relates may, in accordance with the rules of court extend any period mentioned in this section to such an extent and on such conditions as it thinks fit, and shall, if satisfied that there has not during such period been any reasonable opportunity of arresting the defendant vessel within the jurisdiction of the Court, or within the territorial waters of the country to which the plaintiff's vessel belongs OT in which the plaintiff resides or has his principal place of business, extend any such period to an extent sufficient to give such reasonable opportunity. (4.)

The Commonwealth shall not be liable for any damage or loss occasioned by the neglect or want of skill of any pilot.""",21
52,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Angas) [n.10] - I move That the following new clause be inserted :416A -(1. ) The agents in Australia of any ship not registered therein shall be deemed to be the legal representatives of the master ancl owner of the ship after the departure of the ship from the port at which she was discharging for the purpose of receiving and paying claims for short delivery or pillage of cargo, and the amount of any such claim may be recovered from such, agents in any Federal or State Court of competent jurisdiction. (2.) Provided that it shall be lawful for such agents, by notice in writing delivered to the collector not later thari twenty-four hours before the departure of any ship, to decline to accept any responsibility under this section in respect of that ship, in which case the master shall, before the ship is allowed her clearance, give security to the satisfaction of the Minister for the payment of any sum which, together with costs, may be recovered against the agents of such ship. (3.) No proceedings for the recovery of any claim under this section shall be taken unless notice thereof is given to the agents not later than seven days after the delivery of the cargo in respect of which the claim is made. Some merchants have drawn attention to the fact that a clause ought to be inserted to meet the case of ships clearing out of Australian ports without discharging obligations incurred here. That particularly applies to tramp ships. I am aware that some honourable members on the Ministerial side think the matter ought to be considered by the Government. The honourable member for Melbourne spoke to me about it yesterday, and the honourable member for Hindmarsh has also mentioned the subject. Under the circumstances, I thought it better to draft and circulate a clause to meet the object in view. It is intended to make the agent of a ship responsible for the obligations of the - owner, giving the agent power to disclaim any liability by giving twenty-four hours' notice before the vessel clears out. That would afford persons having claims against a vessel to take proceedings to stop her if the agent disclaimed liability. The clause as drafted is practically the same as one which appeared in the Bill of 1904. I have tried to find out the reason why it was excised then. I think the reason is that the whole of the clauses dealing with bills of lading ancl cognate matters were omitted. .Some may be covered by the Sale of Goods Act. But, in omitting the whole of the - clauses to which I have referred, the Senate dropped a provision which is necessary to be inserted in this Bill. There is some anxiety in connection with the matter. The Adelaide Chamber of Commerce have sent - me a letter on the subject, and I have also nad letters from merchants.",21
53,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"West Sydney-Attorney - General) [n.14] - This clause is no doubt intended to deal with an unsatisfactory condition of affairs. I understand that merchants are frequently placed at a disadvantage owing to there being no responsible person from whom they can recover. But I am bound to say, after a perusal of the - clause, that it appears to me to create room for complication and uncertainty. the honourable member for Angas would be satisfied with an assurance that the subject shall be looked into, I shall be glad. If it is found necessary to protect the merchant in this way, a provision can be inserted hereafter.",22
54,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,The Bill can be recommitted.,22
55,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"If the honourable member will consent to the postponement of the proposed new clause, I shall consult with Mr Garran, whom I expect to be here in a moment or two. - Mr TUDOR (Yarra-Minister of Trade arid Customs) [n.15] - I should like to know, Mr Chairman, whether it is permissible, after the schedules have been considered, to propose a new clause.",22
56,The CHAIRMAN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,It can be done on the recommittal of the Bill.,22
57,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"The question of pillaging has been under consideration by the Comptroller-General, with whom I have had several consultations with a view to comprehensive legislation. I think, however, that a Navigation Bill is not the place for such a provision, its only connection with navigation being that the Collector of Customs may refuse a ship permission to leave. I have no objection to the clause, because, after all, it is only carrying out a proper principle. I point out, however, that the goods which are mostly stolen are those in every-day use, quite a different class from those carried by tramp steamers.",22
58,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Beer , I suppose, is often stolen ?",22
59,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"We do not count that as pillage, but, rather, as has just been suggested to me, as leakage. I suggest that the consideration of the clause be postponed.",22
60,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I confess I do not know where this provision ought to be made, but it ought to be made somewhere. Proposed new clause postponed.",22
61,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,".Hindmarsh) [11.19]. - I move That the following new clause be inserted"" Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act or the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1902, no pilot shall be compulsorily retired before the age at which he would have been retired had he remained in the service of his State."" some The principle underlying the proposed new If clause is very simple. Under this Bill, a number of pilots throughout the Commonwealth will be transferred to the Federal Service. I do not know what are the conditions of employment in the .other .States, but in South Australia the pilots are Government servants at the present time, and I am sure none of us desire to see a repetition of the misunderstanding and trouble that were experienced in connection with the transferred postal officials. Under the Public Service Act of the Commonwealth - the retiring age is sixty-five, whereas in South Australia, under the State Act, pilots, who, of course, are competent, may continue their work until the age of seventy. appears to me only fair that, if these men are taken over under this Bill, they should retain all the rights they now enjoy under the State law. Of course, in regard to pilots engaged in the future, the retiring may be fixed at any point we desire-it is all a matter of the contract. In the case of the transferred pilots, however, we are practically making a new agreement; and, unless a clause of this kind is passed, they will practically have no rights at all, just as the transferred postal officers have, unfortunately, found out. The new clause cannot entail any great expenditure, and I can see no objection to it. It is not suggested that inefficient or incapable pilots should be kept on until they are seventy, or whatever may be the retiring age in the several States at the present time. The seafaring life, we know, is a hard one, and, doubtless, all the weak men are weeded out in their young days; at any rate, we know that the shipmasters and pilots, who have been navigating our coasts for the last thirty or forty years, are a robust and hardy lot. Navigation is a matter of experience, of knowledge and nerve, and nerve most of all. The difference between two navigators is much the same as that between two generals ; one, who has all the book learning possible, does nothing but lose battles, the other, with not half the learning, is gifted with nerve and dash and sound judgment, and always wins. We ought to have men of nerve and knowledge as our pilots, and they should be retained as long as they are capable of doing their duty. Mr HUGHES /West Sydney-At - their own fitness. torney-General) [n.25] - I hope the honourable member will not on this amendment. Whether the principle of compulsory .retirement at the age of sixty-five is a sound one in all cases, I should not like to say; in some cases, I think it is not. It is clear, however, that we must have uniformity. I am free to admit that there are men of sixty-five who are as well able as men of twenty-five to perform the duties of a pilot; and while an age limit is general, the principle may have to be reviewed and modified in view of our improved hygienic conditions and consequent prolongation of life. I have known men in the Public Service retired at sixty-five who were as competent to It perform their duties as they ever had been. But it would be anomalous if in New South Wales, for instance, the pilots were retired at that age, while those in South Australia could continue their work age until they were seventy. If there is to be any compulsory retirement it should apply equally throughout the Commonwealth. To abolish compulsory retirement at a certain age, would throw the onus on some person or persons of saying that a public servant might go on indefinitely; and in a large and growing service like that of the Commonwealth, this would lead to a condition of things worse than that caused by retiring, in a few cases, public servants who were physically and mentally capable of continuing their duty. Generally a pilot, when he has reached the age of sixty-five, finds his sight, hearing, and general capacity not so good as formerly; and, beyond those faculties which are capable of test, there is that tendency to break down, which, of course, becomes more accentuated as a man grows older. Since, then, there must be, I think, a retiring age, that retiring age should be uniform. A similar argument to that used by the honourable member for Hindmarsh was used in the case of the postal officials. Seventy may not be a great age for some pilots, but it is a great age for pilots in general; and, therefore, while we are not while by any means circumscribed by the Public Service Act in this connection, there ought, to be uniformity.",22
62,Mr WEST,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Is there a retiring age for Judges ?,23
63,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Judge s are judges of,23
64,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Yarra-Minister of Trade insist and Customs) [11.29] - In four of the States sixty-five is the retiring age for pilots. In Victoria, after the Australia disaster, the retiring age was fixed at sixty, and practically, I believe, by the pilots themselves. We know that ih Victoria the pilots are really a private corporation; and I ithink that, if they, in their own interests, - fixed the age at sixty, we should not go beyond sixty-five.",23
65,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"At the time of Australia disaster, it was shown that - the Victorian pilots had not been medically examined for ten years.",24
66,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Some had not, but, in any case, there has been a reform in that connection. In view of the fact that steamers are getting larger, and that the pilots, whose responsibilities are becoming greater, are exempt from all responsibility for damage, I hope the amendment will not be pressed. There may be hardship in one Every British ship registered in Australia or trade or river and bay ship of less than fifteen - duly certificated master, and, in addition, with following scale:Net Registered Tonnage o(Ship and Length ol Voyage.

No doubt many of us think that we are just as fit today as we were-ten or twenty years ago, the but we may at any moment be suddenly shocked to find that we are not.

69,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"So far as the scale for deck officers is concerned, I do not think there is any very great alteration. be seen, however, that in the case of river and bay ships, provision is made in the schedule to the Bill for a mate, without any statement as to classification, while we propose now to provide that the holder of a second mate's foreign-going certificate may ship as first mate of a limited coast trade ship, or as a mate of a river and bay ship. We are proposing to liberalize the schedule.",26
70,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,The Minister does not mean by that an increase in the numbers provided for?,26
71,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"No j what I mean is that under the schedule we propose to substitute for that in the Bil l men who do not hold the higher certificates will be allowed to take charge of what may be called the lower class of boats, such as river ancl bay boats. With regard to the second part of the schedule, covering the scale of engineroom officers and greasers, the honourable member for Darling Downs, as a member of the Navigation Commission, will remember that the scale proposed was the subject of much controversy. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Marine Engine Drivers Society, and third-class engineers are aU interested, and with other persons vitally affected by the schedule they put their views before the Commission. Under the schedule in the Bill a third-class coast engineer could take charge of a river ancl bay boat under 55 nominal horse-power with a run of under 20 miles. It is proposed to liberalize that provision, and to provide that the holder of a thirdclass coast engineer's certificate may take charge of a river and bay boat under 85 nominal horse-power with a run from the place of departure not specified. in the case of the limited coast trade there was only one step provided for such a man. It is now proposed to make arrangements which will enable such a man to go from third to second, and from that lirst-class coast engineer, and providing he passes the necessary examination he will be able to secure the Board of Trade certificate for a class engineer. In framing the proposed new schedule we have consulted the marine engine-drivers and the third-class engineers, and the schedule as proposed will enable men, provided they pass the necessary examination, to work their way up into the higher grades.",26
72,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,I suppose the Minister It will will require proper tests of efficiency throughout.,26
73,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Certainly . There are a good many men who hold third-class engineer's certificates, and under the schedule of the Bill no provision was made except in one instance to enable them to work their way up. Under the new schedule proposed many more opportunities will be afforded them provided they are efficient and pass the necessary examination to progress in their profession. I am sure it is not the desire of any member of the Committee to prevent an efficient man, who shows a desire to equip himself for some better position, from working his way up. I understand that some honourable members desire to move an amendment in a particular section of the proposed schedule.",26
74,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,I think that in the scale for deck officers in the proposed new schedule where a reference is made to a coast trade or river and bay ship of less than 15 tons gross tonnage the tonnage should 'be fixed at 100 tons.,26
75,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Throughou t the Bill we have altered the 15 tons to 50 tons.,26
76,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Not in this connection, but I shall look into that matter and see whether it is necessary to make the alteration. I prefer, if honourable members will allow me, to continue dealing with the scale of engineers and greasers. I have said that the new schedule we propose will afford opportunities of promotion that are not afforded by the schedule of the Bill. In clause 21 we have provided that all uncancelled and unexpired certificates of competency for masters or ship officers, which include engineers, issued under any State Act shall continue Except as if issued under this Bill, but shall be valid only for the purposes and to the extent to which they would have been valid under the State Act under which they were issued. to Mr GROOM - That is to say, that the holder of a New South Wales certificate will be protected in his grade for that State, but it will not be good for the Commonsecond- wealth unless he complies with the provisions of our.law.",26
77,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"That is so. But though we give him an opportunity to transfer his certincate, he may not be able to get a job. It must be remembered that the third-class engineer's certificates which have been issued by the different States are not of the same relative value. Thoseissued by some States are of a higher class than those issued by others, since they involve the passing of a higher examination. In some cases, a man had only to be a deck hand and a fireman for a little time to secure a third-class gineer's certificate upon the passing of a very simple examination. Such a man should only receive a third-class coast neer's certificate, which would be good only on river and bay boats, and should not take charge of. a boat going outside a harbour. The thirdclass engineer's certificate issued by some of the States requires much qualification. It may be necessary for the Marine Council we have provided for to grade these certificates according to their value. We have tried to arrange the proposed new schedule in such a way as to deal fairly with all men holding certificates at the present time, as well as those who will follow this calling in the future, giving them every opportunity, if they pass the necessary examination, to progress from one grade to another.",26
78,Mr CHARLTON,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Are we to understand that the holders of a third-class engineer's certificate will not be competent to take a vessel outside a river or bay ?,27
79,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Everythin g will depend upon the value of the certificate he holds. Some are allowed to go outside now with vessels of a certain nominal horse-power. We have tried to unify the different systems of the six States. After the adjournment on last Friday, the Attorney-General and myself stayed here until tea-time discussing the matter with the representatives of the bodies to whom I have referred, and, as a result, I think a schedule has been framed which, though it will not give either of these bodies all that they desire, will be more just than any schedule which has previously been framed. Holders of existing certificates will be able to do what they have done before.",27
80,Mr WATKINS,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,No ; some third-class engineers can go outside the harbors now.,27
81,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Some will lose their tickets.,27
82,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Perhaps the honourable member will be able to show me how that can be.,27
83,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Darling Downs) [11.49]. - I wish to say a word or two before the Committee negatives the existing schedule. The question to be considered is one of considerable difficulty. When the schedules were originally inserted in the Bill, the idea was that provision would be made for an expert committee, to whom the technical questions involved would be referred. I do not see why we should not adhere to the schedules originally proposed. We are en- now dealing with a part of the Bill which is of a highly technical character,, and. so far we have had no opportunity of checkengi- ing it with a view to seeing exactly what it means. In regard to the position of engineers, my own view, as a member of the Navigation Commission-afte r having heard the opinions expressed by all parties who are interested in the measure-is that we should recognise and preserve to every man in the different States the rights and privileges which he possesses at present. We ought not to insert in the Bill any provision which will prevent him from earning his livelihood in the way that he has earned it hitherto. We ought also to afford him an opportunity to qualify for a higher position if he chooses to do so. At the same time, the standard of efficiency which has been heretofore observed, ought not to be lowered in any way. When we come to deal with that class of engineers who do not hold Board of Trade certificates, we ought not to put them in the same position as we do engineers who are in a higher grade. But we ought to afford them an opportunity of qualifying for those higher grades, provided that they comply with the conditions which we lay down. The schedule in the Bill is a technical one, and in a matter of this kind we must rely absolutely upon expert advice and assistance. It seems to me that it would have been safer to retain the schedules which are set out in the Bill, and to allow an expert committee to deal with them.",27
84,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,We cannot let the experts do everything.,27
85,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"The schedule in the Bill has been there for years. It has passed the Senate, and it has been discussed both by ship-owners and men. At the very last moment it is proposed to substitute an entirely new schedule. Either we ought to adhere to the schedules which are set out in the Bill, or we ought to postpone consideration of the proposed new schedules until next week, in order that we may be afforded an opportunity of looking into them more closely. I should like to know from the Minister what effect the proposed new schedule will have upon the scale of officers which the original schedule prescribes in the case of limited coast-trade ships. I should also like to know the extent to which the proposed new schedule will alter the original schedule to .the Bill in regard to the persons employed on river and bay boats. The Bill of 1907 did not contain any provision for the creation ot a Marine Council. It contemplated the appointment of an expert committee to deal with each technical subject. Clause 423 providesThe Minister may . . . for the purpose of advice upon any such questions, appoint committees including persons representative of the interests principally affected or having special knowledge of the subject-matter.",27
86,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Instea d of appointing such Committees we have decided to create a Marine Council.,28
87,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"The Government have taken to themselves both powers. Will the fixing of a scale, such as is proposed in the new schedule, be referred to a special select committee of those persons interested in the matter, or will it be referred to the Marine Council? To what extent will the adoption of Part II . of the proposed new schedule increase the number of men employed on the river and bay boats, the limited coast-trade vessels, and the Inter-State vessels?",28
88,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [11.52] - I do not think that the proposed new schedule will increase the number of men employed upon the vessels mentioned. It will merely vary the certificate which engineers will be required to hold as compared with the certificate for which the original schedule in the Bill provided. We propose that in the limited coastal trade it shall not be necessary for vessels to carry a greaser. That is to say, that in a vessel between 100 and 200 horse-power we have decreased the number of men who may be employed, because in some cases it may not be necessary to carry a greaser. The new schedule will not increase the number of engineers who will be carried. Previously a third class engineer could be employed only on river and bay vessels of less than 55 horsepower, but in the proposed new schedule he will be at liberty to engage on any such vessel up to 85 horse-power. In short, the proposed new schedule has been framed with a view to meeting the varying conditions which obtain in the different ports of Australia. I think it is infinitely better than the old schedule, and that it will give greater satisfaction to all parties interested in this matter. The schedule in the Bill would not have given satisfaction to the interests affected.",28
89,Mr CHARLTON,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Hunter) [11.54] - I think thai the proposed new schedule is a big improvement upon that which is contained in the Bill. But there is one point upon which I am not quite clear. To-day in New South Wales third class engineers may engage, not only on river and bay boats, but also on vessels employed in the limited coastal trade. By virtue of the certificates which they hold they are able to travel for a distance of 10c miles along the coast. I am not sure whether under the proposed new schedule they will not be debarred from doing that. I admit that clause 21 of the Bill protects all existing rights.",28
90,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Third class engineers go out now in vessels of less than 55 horsepower.,28
91,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,In boats of what size?,28
92,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,In boats of 55 horsepower.,28
93,Mr HOWE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,The proposed new schedule increases the size of the vessel in which those engineers may engage.,28
94,Mr CHARLTON,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"It does not matter whether it increases the size of vessels by 100 horse-power if it debars these men from travelling along our coast as they do now. If the new schedule will preserve their existing rights I am satisfied. But it appears to me that by omitting them from the schedule, so far as the limited ""coastal trade is concerned, we shall prevent them from going out in vessels which travel 100 miles from port. The men who have third class engineers' certificates today are entitled to continue running along our coast for a distance of 100 miles. 1 understand that the Minister wishes to preserve existing rights, and thinks that he has done so in clause 21. But seeing that this particular class of officers is not specifically mentioned in the schedule, I am inclined to think that some mistake may arise.",28
95,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Hindmarsh) [11.58]. - This is one of the most important portions of the Bill. If the schedule contained in the measure will not give satisfaction to those who have to earn their living under it, it is idle for us to retain it. When we seek to bring about an altered condition of things by means of legislation, it is usual to recognise the claims of those who have been earning their living in a particular way up to that time. Take as an illustration the case of the master mariners. Many years ago, when the States were legislating upon navigation matters, they recognised that the examination which master mariners should be required to undergo ought to be the examination of the British Board of Trade. They were, however, faced with the difficulty that quite a number of old shipmasters and engineers could not pass that examination. But the shipowners were satisfied to commit the safety of their vessels into the hands of these men. Accordingly Parliament was approached, with the result that the difficulty was overcome by granting old shipmasters and engineers servitude certificates. It does not matter whether we like it or not, the fact remains that our past legislation is a jumble. At the present time, the law of one State is different from that of another. place we are. now to have a uniform law. In Great Britain they have very wisely recognised only the British Board of Trade tickets. So far as the small fry are concerned, the authorities have said, "" From Cape Finisterre to the Elbe you can do what you like. If people are prepared to employ you, let them do so; we shall not bother our heads about you."" We have not clone that here. The third-class engineer's tickets issued by the Statesare not recognised by the Board of Trade. As a matter of fact, they are not recognised here, and very properly so. The Board of Trade certificates must be recognised for the security of our own lads. It will never do for them to go to the Old Country with a ticket which is not equal to one that they can obtain from the Board of Trade in any English port. All that I am urging, so far as this schedule is concerned, is that we ought not to take away the existing rights of these men. I am putting before the Committee, as I promised to do, the claims of the third-class engineers, to the best of my ability, and I shall leave honourable members to decide, after hearing the facts, what course ought to be adopted. nothing about the younger men who hold third-class certificates. If they can pass the examination, let them do so; but, surely, middle-aged men, who for many years have been earning their living on our rivers and harbors as holders of third-class engineer's certificates, should not suddenly be deprived of this means of earning a livelihood. am sure that we should all be very sorry Mr Archibald. if any action on our part had that result. The position is that New South Wales issues a third-class engineer's certificate which entitles the holder to take a vessel of 50 nominal horse-power to any part of the New South Wales coast. The holder of a third-class engineer's certificate is allowed to take a vessel of any nominal horse-power in rivers and bays. Tasmania issues a port engineer's certificate, allowing the holder to take charge of a vessel of any nominal horse-power within any of the port limits of Tasmania. That is a more restricted ticket. Then, again, Victoria issues a marine engine-driver's certificate, which entitles the holder to take charge of engines under 100 nominal horse-power, and which is applicable to all ports and harbors in Victoria. Queensland issues a third-class engineer's certificate, which entitles the holder to take a vessel In their with engines up to 50 nominal horsepower to any part of the Queensland coast. There, again, we have a more extended certificate. Then I find that South Australia issues a third-class engineer's certificate, which allows the holder to take charge of steamers of unlimited nominal horse-power on the inland waters, and up to 50 nominal horse-power on the coast. These certificates are recognised by the authorities as being practically of equal value, and holders have been allowed to work on them in any of the States, thus making them interchangeable by usage. Under this schedule, however, the holders of these certificates will have a restriction placed upon their rights. I should not object to an age limit; I am really anxious to protect the middle-aged men who hold these third-class tickets. Their certificates, I think, ought to be recognised. They should be allowed to exchange them for a second-class coast ticket, which would enable them practically to take charge of a vessel on a voyage round the Australian coast. Unless we are prepared to do that, we shall certainly restrict the value qf these third-class tickets. I suggest to the MinI say ister that, with the assistance of the Attorney-General, he should draft a clause providing that any man, say, over the age of forty years, shall be allowed to exchange his third-class engineer's ticket for a secondclass coasting ticket.",28
96,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"We could not do that, beI cause some of those third-class tickets are not equal to a second-class coasting ticket. I said distinctly that they would have to be graded because the examination was higher in some States than in others.",29
97,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"In dealing with legislation of this character, examinations do not count.",30
98,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,We propose to give'these men a ticket equal to those which they hold now.,30
99,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,That is not the position under this schedule.,30
100,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"It is, under clause 21, and the men are satisfied. They told me that they were.",30
101,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,They are not satisfied.,30
102,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Every right they now enjoy they will continue to enjoy. Nothing that they now have is taken from them by this Bill.,30
103,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,And we are giving them a better schedule than they have ever had.,30
104,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,If the Attorney General will show that these men will continue to enjoy what they now have I shall be satisfied.,30
105,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,They know that they will.,30
106,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,They do not.,30
107,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Whateve r rights the holders of third-class engineer's certificates now enjoy they will continue to enjoy.,30
108,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"That may be so under the clause to which reference has been made, but it is not the position under this schedule.",30
109,Mr MASSYGREENE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Richmond) [12.8] - I desire to be quite sure that under this schedule the men will have exactly the same rights that they enjoy by reason of the certificates they now hold. I wish to be sure that by adopting this schedule we shall not take away from these men their means of livelihood.,30
110,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Look at clause 21.,30
111,Mr MASSYGREENE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I think it covers the point, but I do not know for what period these certificates are issued.",30
112,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Holder s of tickets tbiat have been issued for all time will receive one for all time in exchange.,30
113,Mr MASSYGREENE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"But if they were issued, say, for only three years",30
114,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,They are not.,30
115,Mr HOWE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,They are certificates of competency for all time.,30
116,Mr MASSYGREENE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"They operate for all time, or during good behaviour, and we are to understand that the certificates issued under the new schedule will carry all the privileges conferred by the existing certificates held by these men?",30
117,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,That is so.,30
118,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [12.11] - The position in regard to the third-class engineers has been very exhaustively discussed at different times by the Senate and the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill, and has also been the subject of very earnest consideration by the Government and by the representatives of the societies concerned. Every effort has been made to obtain information straight from the fountain head of each interest affected, and this procedure is obviously sound. It is not pretended for one moment that a member of Parliament can know as much about every industry as do those who follow them. We have therefore gone in each case direct to the ship-owners, the Masters and Officers, the Australasian Institute of Marine Engineers, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the third-class engineers, the seamen, and others. It is not said that we have agreed to everything put forward, but the conflicting interests by conference and by mutual concession have been so adjusted that the schedule as a whole is now as acceptable to the various parties as seems possible, having due regard to public interests. At the latest conference dealing with this schedule there were present the general secretary of the Marine, Institute and the general secretary of the Federated Masters' and Engineers' Association of Australia. After a lengthy discussion, certain points were brought out by the secretary of the Masters and Engineers Association, and were adjusted to his satisfaction and to that of the general secretary of the association. The principle that we desire to attain is first of all that no man's position will be made worse by this Bill. Clause 2 absolutely safeguards that. That is to say, whatever a third class engineer can do now he will be able to do when this Bill comes into operation. No one will be any worse off by the passing of this Bill than he is now. If a man can take a boat of 65 horse-power anywhere at present, he will be able to do so under this Bill. If he can take a vessel of any horse-power to any part of the New South Wales coast, he will continue to be able to do so. Whatever he can do now he will continue to be able to do. In addition, he will have something that he had never any hope of getting before, and that is the means of obtaining a first-class Board certificate without shop experience. This will place in the hands of every greaser, marine engine-driver, or third-class engine-driver, the means of becoming a first-class engineer. Just as a private carries a marshal's baton in his knapsack, so these men will carry with them, under this Bill, the chance of becoming first-class engineers. schedule has been amended to remove the last objection. Trie man who now holds a third class coast engineer's certificate may take service with such a boat as will enable him to qualify for a second-class coast certificate, then for a first-class coast certificate, and in turn for a second-class Board of Trade certificate. Tbese men will be asked to undergo, not a literary, but a practical, examination. We cannot set it forth in the Bill, but the joint committee of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and the Australian Institute of Marine Engineers have drawn up what they regard as a fair, practical test of a man's acquaintance with marine engines. This is what they recommend as the practical test to be required from candidates for examination for first or second class Commonwealth or coastal certificates under the Bill : ist. Mark off and chip and file out a keyway less than 6 inches by i inch in pulley, shaft, or boss, and properly fit key thereto. 2nd. Bore a 2-in. hole in a i - in. plate; and file it out a true hexagon, then fittfi round bar not less tlian 6 inches long into it. 3rd. Properly bed, lit, and groove a brass on shaft or crank pin. 4th. Correctly mark off, cut the seat, fit the feather, and adjust an eccentric sheave on shaft, also fit on the strap. 5th. Chip and file up two cast-iron flat surfaces at least 12 inches square as representing a valve and cylinder face. 6th. Mark off a check valve or other boiler mounting, drill and tap the holes, put in the studs, and make a high-pressure steam joint. 7th. Turning : Bore out and bush a gland, true up and cut the thread on a bottom end bolt; bore out a pair of brasses; turn up a pin for any part of the surface. 8th. Smithing: Make a pair of hollow bit tongs; make a flat, round nose, and cross-cut chisel; a 12-in. drill to fit a ratchet brace; weld together two i^-in. round or square bars. Without committing myself to that, I put it forward as typical of an examination of a wholly practical kind. It has nothing to do with asking men questions of a highly technical nature, over which a third class engineer, perhaps not being a scholar, might find himself in difficulties. It is a practical Mr Hughes. examination, and is the only thing that stands between a third class coast engineer and a first class Board of Trade certincate. I say to the third class engineers of Australia that their interests are amply safeguarded. What they have now 'they hold, and the intention of the Government is that they shall hold it. That is plain English, and there is no ambiguity about it. Not The only that, but the schedule aims at giving them the means of qualifying successively through the various grades that separate the third class coast engineer under the Bill from a first class engineer holding a Board of Trade certificate.",30
119,Mr HOWE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Dalley) [12.17] - I propose to ask the Committee to accept the schedule as put forward by the Minister. The Institute of Marine Engineers-m y own society-and the Masters' and Drivers' Association, or, as they call themselves, the Federated Masters' and Engineers' Association, met a few days ago. This has been a question of great dispute amongst the contending organizations, and it has also been a matter of the utmost interest to the employers themselves. I can safely say that today there is some unanimity among us, but we are not agreed upon every possible point. We have attained a fair line of compromise, as expressed in the amended schedule that the Minister has put before the Committee. I think that in some aspects the Masters' and Engineers' Assochip ciation are seeking for more than they are entitled to, and the Committee will have to be very careful in determining the nature of the tests that third class men must go through. The Attorney-General expressed himself in favour of what he is pleased to term a practical test, and that test is undoubtedly desirable. It must be passed in the interests of the life and property of the people of Australia, as a guarantee of the efficiency of any man who steps out of a river and bay ship on to a .coastal vessel, and I take it that it will be placed in the regulations. But something more is wanted. There will have to be embodied in the requirements for any certificate that these men get some technical training and knowledge. It is not simply a matter of getting practical experience in a workshop or at a technical school. Practical knowledge is not enough to create efficiency such as is requisite in a second or first class engineer. Let these men get that technical knowledge or information, I do not care how. I raise no objection, because I believe every man has a right to climb to the height of his ambition, but his efficiency must be proved. No doubt many members have had placed in their hands a circular from the Federated Masters' and Engineers' Association. I desire to point out certain misrepresentations in it, although I do not say that they were wilfully made. Under the heading of "" unlimited nominal horse-power in rivers and bays,"" the following statement appears :In the State of New South Wales we have had the privilege for nil time, and we think that the examination the third-class engineer has to undergo entitles him to retain the same. Ninety per cent, of the ferries running in Port Jackson are manned by third-class engineers in charge of engines, and have given every satisfaction lo the different companies, who prefer this class of man (holder of a third-class certincate), as being the most suitable for their class of'iwork It is not a question of preferring this class of man; it is a question of not getting the abler man for the same money. I admit that a very large percentage of those vessels is manned by them, but only for the reason that the other engineers will not serve at the rates offered on those boats. It is stated furtherAt the present time there are six vessels being built for the Sydney Ferries Limited, all of which are over 55 n.h.p., which means that if the Bill as passed by the Senate becomes law, the future third class engineer will be debarred from acting as engineer on any of these steamersIt would not be so. These are harbour vessels, and those men would not be debarred, apart from the fact that preference would be given to the more skilled men.",31
120,Mr CANN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,That circular referred to the old schedule.,32
121,Mr HOWE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I was not aware of it, but these statements may have some influence upon the minds of honourable members. They say furtherWhereas at the present time a number of our members are employed in some of the largest ferry steamers in Port Jackson. (The Manly steamer Brighton is 232 n.h.p.) Let me point out how misleading a statement of that sort is. These people have not one individual in the Manly Ferries Company's service. All the engineers in that service are members of the Institute - of Marine Engineers or of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and the company will not accept any others. The largest vessels of the Sydney Ferries Company Limited are not maimed by these gentlemen, so that in that regard there is a gross misrepresentation in the circular, misleading to the House, and most undesirable from the stand-point of the public well-being. I believe the amended schedule proposed by the Minister is the best line of compromise that we can get, and I think it will give to the members of this organization all the opportunity that they desire. If they have ability they can utilize it to go as high as they please. A ll that we ask in the interests of our own trade, and. of the public well-being, is that they should not be permitted to take any step forward unless they can show such competency as will justify it.",32
122,Mr CHARLTON,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Hunter) [12.25] With other honourable members, I am pleased that the Minister has endeavoured to meet the difficulty in regard to the employment of third class engineers. The honourable member for Dalley stated that certain information supplied to honourable members is not in accordance with facts so far as the Brighton is concerned. If any society is guilty of supplying honourable members with misleading information of this kind, it is doing a very wrong thing, because members cannot be expected to be in touch with all"" the technical details of professional occupations; and must be guided by ths information supplied to them. I have no proof beyond the information supplied to me that the Association has members employed on the boats referred to, but I am told that it has five members employed on the Brighton, the Kuringgai, and the Narrabeen. Notwithstanding the opinion expressed by the Attorney-General, which, of course, carries weight with every honourable member, I am not yet clear in my mind that the Bill meets the case in the way he states. Clause 21 providesA l l uncancelled and unexpired certificates of competency for masters or ship's officers issued under any State Act shall continue as if issued under this Act, but shall be valid only for the purposes for which, and to the extent to which, they would have been valid in accordance with the provisions of the State Act under which they were issued. It is claimed that that includes ""engineer ship officers."" I do not deny that that is the true interpretation to place upon it, and therefore we may say that it makes those holding third class engineer's positions at present safe. But the schedule-and I do not know how we can have two conflicting statements in an Act of Parliamentprovides thatEvery British steam-ship registered in Australia or engaged in the coasting 'trade (other than a limited coast trade or river and bay ship of less than fifteen tons gross registered tonnage), shall be provided with duly certificated engine-room omcers and with greasers according to the following scaleand then sets out a scale which, amongst other things, provides that, in New South Wales, river and bay steam-ships under eighty-five nominal horse-power can carry one third class engineer, while on ships of over eighty-five horse-power no third class engineer can be carried. How can that be said to preserve the existing rights of third class engineers? To-day, in the harbors and rivers of New South Wales no nominal horsepower is specified with regard to the employment of third class engineers. According to the schedule the third class engineer will disappear from all the boats over eighty-five nominal horse-power.",32
123,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,What is the actual practice?,33
124,Mr CHARLTON,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Thir d class engineers can be employed in any river or harbour in New South Wales, irrespective of the vessel's horse-power. So far as I can see, if clauses io and 21 preserve these men's rights, the schedule conflicts with them, and fakes those rights away. to the schedule, a vessel of bver 85 horsepower would not be able to carry a third class engineer on any river or harbour; and under the New South Wales law vessels of only 50 horse-power can be taken anywhere along the coast by a third class engineer. Under the schedule, limited coast-trade vessels will be prevented from carrying third class engineers, and this will lead to the dismissal of men holding third class certificates who are now employed on such vessels. It is useless to say that by clause 21 the existing rights of the engineers are preserved, if you enact in the schedule that third class engineers shall be excluded from the employment in which they are now engaged. My opinion is that under the schedule many of the men to whom I refer will lose their positions, and I want the Minister to make sure that they shall be fully protected. The Attorney General tells us that the existing rights are protected, but to my mind they are not sure of their position, in view of the requirements of the schedule. "" I am told that in Victoria a third class engineer can be employed on a steamer of roo horsepower. But as the schedule prohibits the employment of an engineer of that class on any vessel exceeding 85 horse-power, it will mean the loss of a job to several engineers. No doubt the Minister wishes to meet the position, but I think that he should see that it is not being met. It is useless to say to the engineers, "" Your rights are preserved,"" and to the owners of certain vessels, "" You must not employ third class engineers."" With such a conflict of law the result must be that certain third class engineers now in employment will be dismissed. Men who are working on vessels trading along the coast will have to seek employment on harbour and river steamers. This being the effect of the Bill, it cannot be said that their existing rights are preserved. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [12.35]. - I find some difficulty regarding the position of engineers. The question appears to be, not whether the certificates of third class engineers will remain in force, but whether, although possessing those certificates, the men may not in some cases be deprived of their jobs because of the requirements of the schedule. Clause 21 says that all uncancelled and unexpired certificates of competency for masters and ships' officers issued under State Acts shall continue to be issued under Commonwealth According law. In effect, we tell the holders of cer(tificates that they may still retain them for what they are worth. But if we impose on the owners of ships prohibitions in regard to the employment of the holders of certificates of a certain class,, the result will be that we shall deprive some of the holders of such certificates of their jobs, although they stiir possess their certificates. A limited coasttrade steamer of 200 horse-power and over will be compelled to carry as a minimum one first class engineer and one second classengineer. Possibly such a vessel is now carrying only one first class and one third class engineer.",33
125,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"A vessel of the power referred to must carry a first class and a second class engineer and one other man, who may be an uncertificated man, or a man undergoing training. Such vessels would not now carry one first class and one third class engineer.",33
126,Mr WH IRVINE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Well , river and. bay steamers of 200 horse-power and over must carry at least one second class engineer. Such vessels may now in some instances be carrying third class engineers.",33
127,Mr CHARLTON,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,In New South Walesthird class engineers are being employed.,33
128,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Not on vessels of 200 horse-power.,34
129,Mr WH IRVINE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"The point to which I wish to direct attention is that, although a third class engineer's rights are to be preserved, such men in many cases may lose their present jobs when the Act becomes law. I have no practical knowledge of this subject, but it does not seem to me that clause 21 will maintain men in their present jobs. We are requiring the employment of engineers of higher attainments than are now employed on some steamers, and the result must be that some of those now employed must be dismissed.",34
130,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,I have intimated that I will accept an amendment.,34
131,Mr WH IRVINE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"An amendment seems to be required. Clause 11 imposes on all steam-ship owners the absolute obligation to comply with the schedule in the manning of their vessels, and the requirements of the schedule may result in some third class engineers being deprived of their present positions, although their certificates still hold good. Some amendment will, I think, be necessary.",34
132,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [12.45] - This is a most important matter, as it affects the rights of a great number of persons, and I want to make perfectly sure that I have clearly caught the point put by the honourable member for Flinders. I understood him to say that the effect of clause 21, read with the schedules and the enacting clauses, is that while the rights of the persons mentioned in clause 21 are conserved, their position and opportunities for employment are or may be affected.",34
133,Mr WH IRVINE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Yes .,34
134,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Ver y well. I wish to state now the intention of the Government. The intention of the clause is that not only should the rights of these persons be conserved in a technical sense, but that, included in their rights, opportunities for employment in the same capacity and to the same extent as they now enjoy should not be affected by anything in the Bill so far as a certincate of competency and status is concerned. I am of the opinion that the clause does that. It says(1.) All uncancelled and unexpired certificates of competency for masters or ship's officers issued under any State Act shall continue as if issued under this Act, but shall be valid only for the purposes for which, and to the extent to which, they would have been valid in accordance with the provisions of the State Act under which they were issued. If a certificate is issued under this Bill and has the same effect as it would have had",34
135,Mr WH IRVINE,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,If it is issued under this Bill it would still have been issued as a third class certificate.,34
136,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Yes ; but it will be issued under the Bill subject to the qualification that if it was a certificate under a State Act it is to have the same validity as if issued under this Bill for the purposes and to the extent that it would have been valid if issued under a State Act. The whole question is : To what extent is a certificate of competency issued under a State Act now valid ? Because, to whatever extent it is now valid it will be valid under the clause. I do not think that we can serve any useful purpose by discussing the matter any more, because we are all trying to do the one thing. The Government are trying to safeguard the rights of these men. If upon inquiry of the Law Officers I find that the opinion which I hold, and about which the honourable and learned member has some doubt, is not upheld, we shall strengthen the clause so as to make the intention perfectly clear.",34
137,Mr FINLAYSON,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Brisbane) [12.48]. - I think that°in their contention the honourable members for Hunter and Flinders overlooked one essential and most important particular. We are faced with a difficulty which is on all-fours with a difficulty which we experienced in dealing with branches of the Commonwealth Service. We have to unify and apply generally six differing State conditions. It seems to me that honourable members have overlooked the fact that this Bill must not only absolutely safeguard existing rights, but also provide for future contingencies.",34
138,Mr CHARLTON,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,The trouble is that it does not.,34
139,Mr FINLAYSON,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I think that clause 21 not only guarantees that existing certificates shall be valid under the Federal' Act, but specifically enables the holder of any such certificate to surrender it for a certificate of a similar or corresponding grade under the Federal Act. The existing certificates, as well as the existing rights and* privileges, are guaranteed in this measure specifically and categorically, and any new arrangement in regard to qualifying for certificates or introducing new men into the service will be made under the schedule. Seeing that an existing certificate can be surrendered for a similar or correspondingcertificate under the Federal Act, it seems to me that not only are existing certificates absolutely protected, but the admission of new qualifying candidates under the schedule is absolutely secured, too.",34
140,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"The terms which the honourable member uses are not applicable to this clause. He referred, for instance, to a ""corresponding"" certificate. In regard to three certificates, there is no corresponding existing certificate. At present there are three classes of certificates, namely, first class Board of Trade and second class Board of Trade. Then there are three classes of engineers, marine engine-drivers, and so on. It is proposed to substitute for these three new classes of engineers-firs t class coast engineer, second class coast engineer, and third class coast engineer; while for petrol marine engines there will be marine engine-drivers.",35
141,Mr FINLAYSON,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I overlooked that fact. I should have said corresponding grade. Mr HUGHES,-It is not a question of grade; it is one of rights.",35
142,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Darling Downs) [12.51] The position of marine engine-drivers in Victoria has again been brought under my notice. I understand that ""their qualification is just as high as, if not higher, than the qualification of third class coast engineer.",35

144,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Can the Minister give the Committee some assurance regarding the position of those who hold that certificate, - that their right to get a certificate under this Bill will give them a grade or right corresponding to that which they possess at present ?",35
145,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [12.52] - Clause 21 assures to a man all the rights which he now has. As the Attorney-General interjected rather lengthily, the Bill provides for three classes of coast engineers. There is no such system at present. As I said before, it is quite possible-in fact, very probable-that , directly the Bill is brought into operation, it may be necessary to grade the existing certificates, because the conditions under which they have been issued in the States have varied. It may be held that some of the third class certificates existing today are equal to the first class coast certificate to be issued under this Bill. Probably others - of them will be found equal to a second class coast engineer's certificate. Where it has been very easy to obtain a certificatethat is, where there has been no difficult examination to pass--the certificate will pro-' bably be held to be equal to a third class coast engineer's certificate.",35

151,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Darling Downs) [12.55]:According to information which has been supplied to me, the new schedule which is to be substituted for this schedule will make important changes, and greatly increase the scale. I shall give an illustration in connection with passenger steamers. Take the ordinary seamen and the boys that will be introduced under the Bill. At the present time Inter-State passenger boats carry eighty-one, but under the Bill the number will be 104, showing an increase of twentythree. The amendment introduced by the Minister today will increase the number to 187, being an increase of 106 over the present conditions. I have a number of cases here. The illustrations regarding different ships show a great: increase. In the scale of the crew on passenger steamships under the Bill as brought here there will be an increase of four, and under the amendment an increase of nine. Take, for instance, the Kyarra, with a gross tonnage °f 6>9S3 tons. At present she carries fifteen able seamen, two ordinary seamentotal, seventeen. Under the Bill there would be nineteen able seamen, two ordinary men, bringing the total up to twenty-one. Under the amended schedule there are to nineteen able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and six apprentices, making a total of to be increased? twenty-six. Under the Bill, therefore, there is to 'be an increase of four, and - under the amendment an increase of nine. That increase runs right through the whole 50 tons. scale of the boats. I ask the Minister if he cannot see his way to reconsider the schedule. I do not think that it is his tention to unduly burden the ship-owners in this connection. I should like to know why the schedule has been altered at all.",35

159,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"My attention has been drawn to the schedule as it originally stood of in the Bill.

In South Australia vessels under 50 tons are not obliged to carry a mate. I have a in the memorandum before me from a man who Ausowns several of these ships, in which he says that the present system in South Australia is not to require a mate for vessels under 100 tons trading within the State. to Has the Minister any information as to how these South Australian vessels will be in affected?

161,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Then I think that the schedule as it is to be amended will cover these cases. Otherwise it will be very unfair to compel such vessels to carry a mate.,36

163,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,If that be so the anxiety of some of the South Australian owners,36
164,Dr MALONEY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Melbourne) [2.37]- I have circulated an amendment to insert after the word "" officers "" the words "" including a duly qualified medical practitioner as prescribed."" The object ofmy amendment is to make the first paragraph of the schedule readEvery ship shall be provided with duly certificated officers, including a duly certificated medical practitioner as prescribed. Subsequently I desire to move the insertion of similar words under the heading "" Steam-ships."" Perhaps honourable members are not aware that on many ships coming to Australia the medical man is paid only is. per month. I desire to do away with that sort of thing. I think that every vessel of upwards of 1,000 tons, registered for carrying passengers, should carry a duly-qualified medical practitioner, who should be properly remunerated. Inasmuch as a new schedule has been brought forward, I hardly know where my amendment would come in ; but by courtesy of the Minister I am speaking now in order to explain my intention. It must be within the knowledge of every one that persons travelling by sea are not only liable to nearly every illness which may occur on land, but, in addition, to illnesses and accidents that are peculiar to the sea. It is the height of absurdity to expect trained men to look after the welfare of human beings at the munificent remuneration of is. per month and found. The China Navigation Company, to its nonour, was the first shipping company to recognise Australian-born officers, from the captain downwards. This company pays a fair sum to its medical officers, equal to about the pay of a first mate. The Eastern line of steamers also pays its medical officers fair salaries. The Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Companies used to pay a nominal salary, and the medical officer was supposed to receive tips. Speaking personally, I have been medical officer on four steamers, and am glad to say that the indignity of a tip was never offered to me. Therefore, I never had the opportunity of refusing one. This is a monumental Bill, which we hope will confer advantages on our officers and seamen. I desire to make it mandatory on shipping companies to carry trained medical men on their vessels. I am informed that under Japanese law, if even a collier makes a - return journey of over 1,000 miles, she must carry a duly-qualified medical officer. I believe that many valuable lives would have been saved if there had been a medical man on board some of the ships, making even so short a journey as from Australia to New Zealand. One instance stands out in my recollection. I refer to the case of that great Englishman, Mr. Seddon, whose death might have been avoided if there had been a doctor on board the ship on which he was travelling from Sydney to New Zealand. A medical man would probably have observed the premonitory symptoms, would have prescribed complete rest, and then the small artery in the brain, the bursting of which caused Mr Seddon's death, might not have given way. I trust that the Minister will give consideration to my proposal and that the Committee will determine that ships of over 1,000 tons shall not be permitted to undertake voyages without carrying a qualified medical practitioner on board. If the amendment in the schedule be agreed to, it will involve the recommittal and amendment of clause 4, giving the Governor General power to make regulations for "" the fixing of the remuneration to be paid to the medical practitioner.""",37
165,Mr KELLY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Wentworth) [2.45] - I am in cordial sympathy with the ideas expressed by the honourable member for Melbourne, and I think the Minister might take into consideration something which is, at any rate, as important as the carrying of a medical man. There ought to be provision made on vessels for proper surgical treatment should occasion arise. For instance, appendicitis can be treated with almost absolute safety in a modern hospital; but on a ship, where there is no possibility of aseptic treatment, it is, I am told, most? dangerous to touch a patient with the surgeon's knife. It would not cost very much to provide for surgical operations, and there is no doubt that something of the kind is necessary. A relative of my own, who was travelling from England some years ago, developed appendicitis in the Red.Sea, and, though it was in the month of August, had to travel all the way to Australia before the necessary surgical relief could be safely given.",37
166,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [2.47] - Clause 133 provides that a foreign-going ship, or an Australiantrade ship, having 100 persons and upwards on board, or travelling the prescribed distance, must carry a duly qualified practitioner. The honourable member for Melbourne will see that this clause refers only to vessels leaving Australia, whereas he spoke of boats coming here with immigrants.",37
167,Dr MALONEY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,I merely cited them as an example.,38
168,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"What we are considering now is the position of deck officers, and I think we could hardly so describe a medical practitioner. It is only between Adelaide and Fremantle that passengers are quite beyond medical aid if anything serious should occur. This is the first time that we have provided for medical officers on Australian ships, and I suggest that we should not overburden the Bill.",38
169,Dr MALONEY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"It is the first time, I think, that there has been such a provision made in the British world.",38
170,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I would not be sure as to that. The amendment suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne, referring as it does to vessels of 1,000 tons and upwards, would apply to most of the cargo boats trading round Australia, and I am not sure that it would be a wise provision to insert. If the honourable member desires to carry his amendment, perhaps the better course would be for him to move the recommittal of clause 133, and have it there made. My own opinion is that we had better try the Bill as it is; though, no doubt, the time will come when doctors will have to be carried in other vessels than those prescribed.",38
171,Mr KELLY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Wentworth) [2.50] - My . suggestion is that there should be reasonable hospital accommodation, because it is useless to carry a surgeon .unless he is provided with a place in which he can, with reasonable safety, conduct operations. I do not think that operations are ever performed on a ship, for the simple reason that there is practically certainty of death.",38
172,Sir JOHN FORREST,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Is there not usually a surgery on board ship?,38
173,Mr KELLY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"There is what is called a "" surgery,"" but it is merely a small cabin for the storage of medicines, and the furniture and fittings would excite laughter in a modern hospital. I have been told by medical men that they would not dream of performing a serious operation on board ship. The danger does not appear to arise from the movements of the vessel, but from the absence of facilities for aseptic treatment.",38
174,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [2.53] - Clause 271 gives tion Court awards. power to make regulations in connection with the carriage of passengers generally, and particularly in regard to equipment medical staff and attendants. Under that clause the provision of hospital accommodation could be made compulsory. The question, however, is not dealt with in the schedule under consideration.",38
175,Dr MALONEY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Melbourne) [2.54] As surgeon at is. a month I twice brought immigrants out to Australia, and I may say that the medicines authorized by the B'oard of Trade were of the crudest, while the instruments prescribed by .the same body were so old that I had to go to the museum of St. Mary's Hospital and borrow instruments in order to comply with the regulations. I do not think I could give a more absurd example, though I must say that since then there has been an improvement so far as the Board of Trade is concerned. If , however, a person were to develop typhoid in Ceylon on any ship other than one of the big shipping companies which trade to Australia, he would have to be doctored by the captain, who may or may not be lucky enough to hit upon the right medicine. The life of a sailorman is just as valuable to his family as is the life of any other man; and the accommodation provided for him in the past has been so terrible that, but for the fresh air on deck, his average length of life would have been much shorter on account of the lack of proper ventilation in his quarters. Even the forecastle on an up-to-date steamer is not all that could be desired, and there has been much agitation on the subject from the time of Plimsoll. I contend that a sailorman should have as much care taken of him as has an ordinary passenger. There is hardly a medical man of any large practice in Australia but who knows of cases on board ship, which, for lack of proper treatment, have resulted in permanent injury ; and I think something should be done to remedy the present state of affairs, for the sake of common humanity. The whole of the four vessels of the China Navigation Company are registered under 750 tons, so that it will be seen that a vessel of 1,000 tons is much above the average. Whether the doctor be regarded as a deck hand or an engine-room hand is scarcely worth discussing j but I understand that the salaries from the captain downward are fixed by the shipping companies themselves.",38
176,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,There are some Arbitra,38
177,Dr MALONEY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Then if the doctors desire to. have the salary fixed they will and have to go to the Arbitration Court?,38
178,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Possibly .,39
179,Dr MALONEY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"The Dutch Packet Company affords an excellent example, inasmuch as they give the highest pay for white officers of all the ships' that visit port, not even excepting the great mail steamers. Dutch Packet Company captains are allowed to retire at the age of forty-five on a pension of £200, and they draw as high as- ^1,000 a year in salary. I do not suggest such high salaries as that; but I say that a doctor ought to be rated with the first officer, for no one will deny that the education of a medical man equals, at all events, that of a ship's captain. Shipping companies would then not select men who merely desired to save the expense of a voyage, but would, as some of the greater companies do, engage a doctor for a year or three years. This would result in a better class of men being employed, and the passengers and crew would, have the advantage of modern medical science.",39
180,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Angas) [3.0] - Some time ago I mentioned the matter of the tonnage of river and bay ships required to carry a certificated master. As the new schedule stands, every vessel of over 15 tons gross registered tonnage must carry a certificated master, and a river and bay ship of over 50 tons, and running more than 20 miles, must also carry a mate. It is suggested from South Australia that the tonnage should be fixed at 100 tons. There are a number of vessels in South Australia of about that tonnage that, under the State law, do not carry a master and a mate. Recently, under an Arbitration Court's award, the - obligations of the owners have been very much increased by a considerable addition to the wages paid, the number of holidays allowed, and other concessions. If they are under this Bill to carry on their vessels a greater complement of officers at the higher rates, the measure will largely increase their existing burdens. the vessels trading in the two South Australian gulfs are over 100 tons register. A letter sent to the honourable member for Boothby, and handed to me, suggests that the limit ought to be 100 tons for river and bay ships, required to carry one certificated officer. I mention the matter because it is proposed also to increase the manning of engineers. There is a complaint made in another communication which has been received that the manning of engineers proposed by the schedule is excessive, that no distinction is made between river and bay ships, and thatthree steamers that are mentioned will be required to carry two engineers, although they make only a few hours' run on each our trip. The limitation of 15 tons to require the carrying of a certificated master is retained in the new schedule, and it is proposed that vessels of over 50 tons must carry a mate in addition to a master. I am informed that the South Australian vessels fo which I have referred are very much sought after by engineers because of their short run, and the fact that they are in port every night. It is said, also,, that if the proposed schedule is carried there will be one engineer on each' of these vessels who will have nothing to do, but who will have to be paid all the same. From Queensland also there is a communication in which it is stated that several of the Inter-State companies have small vessels trading in the Queensland rivers as lighters. They are over 50 tons register, and have only a few hours' run, and it is ridiculous that such vessels should have to carry a mate in addition to a master. I should like to know from the Minister whether there is any substantial objection to altering the 15 tons to 100 tons to meet the case of some hundreds of vessels in the Commonwealth. Mr - TUDOR - It was fixed at 15 tons when the Bill passed the Senate, and we have increased the tonnage to 50 tons. _ Mr Glynn - That is in the case of river and bay ships, and as regards the necessity for carrying a mate in addition to a master. I should like to know wtiat the Minister has to say on the question.",39
181,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.4]--Unde r the New South Wales law every seagoing vessel, no matter of what tonnage, is required to carry a certificated master. Some of these little boats of less than 50 tons go from here to Tasmania. I can mention one, the Mary Some of Burgess, that is used in connection with the fishing industry. The men in charge of these vessels have masters' certificates. We have agreed to increase the tonnage, in regard tocertain matters, from 15 tons to 50 tons, but it must not be forgotten that the schedule as it stands in the Bill, providing only for 15 tons, was agreed to in the Senate, and any alterations we propose in the schedule are in the direction of reducing the obligations on ship-owners.",39

I wish point out that we are overlooking a very ' necessary precaution in the public interest. There are in Sydney Harbor a number of ferry boats, many of them large vessels, velling public. which carry from 1,000 to 1,500 passengers on a trip, but do not - run a distance of twenty miles from place to place.

We should adopt every precaution possible to secure the safety of the travelling public, and we shall not do so if we permit this schedule to go through, and require the boats to which I have referred to carry only a master, while much smaller boats, with a run of over 20 miles, be usually carrying very few passengers, and cerearning considerably less, are required to that carry a mate as well as a master.

I know of very few ships today which are equipped with proper surgical accommodation.

I am rather inclined to support the contention of the honourable member for Hunter that every vessel carrying a certain number of passengers should be obliged to carry an officer in addition to the captain. I think that in section 3 of the schedule we should insert a provision that all ships licensed to carry passengers should be compelled to carry one extra officer. After all, the care of human life on board ship is of primary importance. To commit the safety of passengers into the hands of one man who is subject to the physical infirmities to which we are all subject is not wise.

If the Attorney-General is correct in his contention that under clause 21 their rights are preserved, well and good; but if , on the other hand, the schedule directs who is to be employed, then their rights will not be preserved, since we are reducing the nominal horse-power from 50 tons to 40 tons.

212,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Darling Downs) [3.36] Are we to understand that the Minister does not intend to alter other parts of the schedule relating to apprentices? If that is the position, then this schedule raises a very serious question regarding the increase of the manning scale. The Minister has withdrawn the old schedule and is adding to the number of seamen and apprentices that must be carried. That part of the schedule which deals with apprentices was not in the Bill as passed by the Senate, and it seems to me that, by means 'of this proposal the Government are going to increase very considerably the. manning scale. Let me point out what will be the effect of this new schedule. For instance, the Inter-State passenger steamers now carry eighty-one ordinary seamen and boys; under the Bill as it stands they would have to carry 104, or an increase of twenty-three; whereas under the new schedule they will have to carry, including apprentices, 187, or a total increase of 106 on the existing scale. When we consider that, in respect of each of these to n s P er hands, 140 cubic feet of accommodation has to be provided, we must recognise that this increase in the manning scale must mean a very considerable encroachment upon the boat space.",44
213,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Is it suggested that the opposition of the companies to this proposal 1 would cease if we allowed them to accommodate their men as they pleased?,44
214,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"No ; I am simply pointing out what will be the effect of this proposal, and I wish to know why it has been made? The Bill has been before the public for some years, and the old schedule was adopted by the Senate. It satisfied honourable members of another place, and we have provided under the Bill for what may be described as an anomalies committee to make adjustments from time to time. The Government, however, not content with this, are suddenly increasing the manning scale",45
215,Mr HUGHES,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,This matter could be referred to the anomalies committee.,45
216,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"The Government are asking this House to do what that Committee ought really to do. In order to illustrate what the effect of this new schedule will be upon the Inter-State companies, let me point out that at present the Kyarra, 6,953 gross tons, carries 15 A.B.'s and 2 O.S., or a total of 17. Under the Bill as passed by another place, she would have to carry 19 A.B.'s and 2 O.S., or a. total of 21; whereas under this amendment she will have to carry 19 A.B.'s, 1 O.S., and 6 apprentices, or a total of 26.

Under the Bill she would carry 19 A.B.'s, and 2 O.S.; whereas under this amended schedule she will have to carry 19 A.B.'s, 1 O.S., and 6 apprentices.

The Vlimaroa, 5,777 gross tons, carries 13 A.B.'s and 3 O.S. Under the Bill as passed by another place, she would have to carry 17 A.B.'s and 2 O.S.; whereas under this provision she will have to carry 17 A.B.'s, 1 O.S., and 5 apprentices, or an increase of 7.

217,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Does the honourable member think that the Kyarra and Kanowna, for instance, at present carry sufficient hands to man their boats if it were necessary to do so?",45
218,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I am not in a position to answer that question; but I presume the schedule provided in the original Bill was adequate to meet that situation. Has this new scale been framed with the object of meeting such a contingency ? As a matter of fact, the Government are simply proposing to make an increase in the number of apprentices to be carried. Has this amendment been proposed on expert advice?",45

I do not regard the honourable member and the honourable member for Angas as members of the Opposition; they are really on the wrong side of the table.",46
229,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"This question has to be considered on its merits. I should like to know why the increase in the manning scale has been proposed, seeing that the old schedule was passed by another place, and appeared to be satisfactory. Mir. HUGHES (West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [3.44]--The Government are asked to explainwhy they have made an teration in the schedule with regard to apprentices and boys. In view of the attitude of the Board of Trade and the shipping companies of Great Britain, I do not think that' such a question need have been put. The condition of things that was tolerated by the Board of Trade for twenty years is one that finds no apologists in the United Kingdom today. By general consent it is now admitted that vessels, so far as the safety of passengers was concerned, were undermanned. This Bill gives certain very real advantages to the Australian shipping companies. All that they are asked to do in return is to employ Australian seamen, and pay them a decent wage. Take the Kyarra as a typical boat. She will carry six boys. At the present time, apparently, she carries none, but I do not think that can be true. If she does not, it is about time that she started, because we want our mercantile marine to be a nursery for the production of sailors. The great shipping companies of Great Britain have recognised that sacrifices must be made in order that seamen may be trained. I say emphatically that irr> view of the fact that we have to defend what we have got first by a ring of naval defence, we ought to do everything in our power to encourage men to go to sea, and provide opportunities for them to do so. We ask that in a great boat like the Kyarra six apprentices or six boys shall be carried. It is not imperative for them to take apprentices; they can take apprentices or boys. I frankly admit that I would rather have confined them to apprentices, but an uproar has been made because of the accommodation for apprentices. It seems, for some I-164] mysterious reason, that an apprentice must be lodged and fed better than a boy, although I am totally unable to say why. Although there is a difference of names, there is no difference in the thing. We are asking them to carry six boys or apprentices, and they object. Why? I ask any honourable member who desires to build up an Australian mercantile marine that may be useful as a nursery for seamen, and as a means of continually replacing our marine as it dies off by men who have been trained to the sea, what possible exception can be taken to this provision? I do not deny that it would mean a little extra expense, but that cannot be much. In a memorandum issued this year by the President of the Board al- of Trade, reference is made to the safety of life at sea in connection with merchant shipping. The following passage regarding the manning of boats shows how completely views have changed during the past few months in regard to what is sufficient on board shipIt is evident that the large addition made by the new rules to the number of lifeboats required to be carried by certain classes of vessels must raise at once the question of the sufficiency of the crew, and their efficiency to handle and manage the boats. The Board of Trade have no power to make a statutory life-saving rule prescribing a scale of manning for various classes of vessels. They have, however, power, under section 305 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, to require emigrant ships to be manned with an efficient crew to the satisfaction of the emigration officer; and under the Merchant Shipping Act 1897 t y can detain as unseaworthy a vesQ e sel which, by reason of under-manning, is unfit to proceed to sea without serious danger to human life. Under each of these widely differing powers the Board of Trade have in the past given instructions to their officers as to the minimum number of deck hands to be carried by emigrant and passenger and cargo ships respectively of various sizes. These instructions are being revised so as to secure a suflicient complement of efficient boat hands to deal with the total number of boats which will now be required to be carried, and to be manned in an emergency. It is proposed that, in foreign going passenger steamers, within certain limits, the boat hands must be efficient deck hands, while outside those limits seamen of other ratings may be drawn to make up the complement, provided that they satisfy the Board of Trade by certincate or otherwise of their competence as boat hands. There is, therefore, ample ground for our changing and enlarging the provisions, so far as the manning scale is concerned. As I emphatically desire to see every conceivable opportunity given for increasing and strengthening the - personnel of the Australian Navy, I hope the schedule will go through.",46
230,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Angas) [3.51] - Whateve r force there may be in the reply of the Attorney-General in regard to the employment of apprentices, I think he cannot for the same reason object to my suggestion that the proportion of firemen or trimmers to tons of coal turned out ought to be fixed at one in five. I interjected that suggestion when the Minister was speaking. In 1896, according to the report of the Navigation Commission, the Board of Trade fixed a proportion of one to three, but the Imperial Conference of 1907 thought that they could not equitably fix any proportion, and that either the matter ought to be left to a Committee, or that a provision should be put in the Navigation Bill that the ship must be seaworthy in respect of the complement of crew, which would include all hands. matter of fact, we have that provision in our Bill. We have adopted what the Imperial Conference recommended, but we are going beyond that by putting in a provision, which is objected to by a good many, - that a certain number of trimmers and firemen must be carried in proportion to the output of coal, the proportion being fixed at one to three and a half. To some extent that is modified by the fact that the Minister may submit the matter to a Marine Council or a Committee, who may recommend an alteration dependent on the circumstances of the particular vessel; but as we are fixing a scale now we ought to fix the scale that has been accepted, I understand, by both the Seamen's Unions and the Federated Ship-owners Association. The average of the agreements is more nearly one to five. I know that in the case of one vessel it is one to 4.8. By altering the proportion, which is at present in practice before any committee has met, we are really upsetting the terms of some of the agreements already entered into.",47
231,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"The seamen asked that it should be one to three, not one to three and a half. - Mr Glynn - I have seen the records of agreements entered into for some of the vessels, in which the figures show an average of about one to five. The complement will be increased from about twenty-three to thirty-three in the case of some of the ships.",47
232,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,Steamer s vary.,47
233,Mr GLYNN,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"The provision allowing the Minister to alter the proportion on the recommendation of the Marine Council or Committee is a good one, but when fixing the proportion of firemen or trimmers to the output of coal the Government should have stuck to the figures of the agreements arrived at on the Australian coast.",47
234,Mr KELLY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Wentworth) [3.55] - The Attorney-General's statement was very interesting, and I found myself in sympathy, with him, not only when he supported the schedule as introduced, and not as proposed to be amended, but also when he resented the ingratitude of the coastal shipping companies in daring to go to anybody else with their case when they had been treated with such extraordinary handsomeness by the honourable gentleman himself. - He said, in the first place, that we must endeavour to build up an Australian mercantile marine. This means As a more than building up our Australian commercial enterprises. It means an establishment of flesh and blood to man our Australian ships. Why, then, are - the Government taking out the stipulation that apprentices must be carried, and allowing the ships to carry either apprentices or boys? Is this another concession to the already well-treated shipping ring?",47
235,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"It is not. The honourable member will see that "" apprentice or boy "" appears all the way down.",47
236,Mr KELLY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,The Government are knocking out apprentices altogether.,47
237,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,No . The schedule as it came down did not provide for apprentices at all.,47
238,Mr KELLY,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"I am glad to see apprentices provided for, and want to see them retained. Why should they be taken out and a ship allowed to carry any casual boy, who may be used for all jobs for one voyage, and fired off at the end of it? The Attorney-General said that the ships had to treat apprentices better than boys. That is an extraordinary argument to urge in favour of abolishing apprentices. Are we in favour of worse treatment for boys on ships? Is that why the change from apprentices to boys has been made ? Another astonishing argument from the Attorney-General, endorsed by interjection by the Minister of Trade and Customs, was that it was necessary to pass this schedule in order to man the boats. Will honourable members examine the schedule, and see what an absurd pretence that is, or, if not, what a hollow fraud the second part of the schedule is? The first part deals with passenger steam-ships carrying not more than ten passengers, and cargo steamships. A vessel of that class, of between 1,500 and 2,000 tons net register, has to carry nine able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and one apprentice, or eleven hands in all. If now we turn to passenger steam-ships of the same size, we find that a vessel that can carry any number of passengers that she can get on board, must carry just one extra apprentice, so that there is to be one extra boy to do all the manning of all the boats for all the hundreds of passengers that the ship carries! The thing is a farce! What is the use of insulting the Committee with such an argument? There must be some reasonable basis for providing this scale. I would prefer it in the original form, providing for apprentices, and not for "" apprentices or boys."" If , as the honourable member for Darling Downs was told, it is a case of insuring the safety of those on the ship, the schedule dealing with passenger steam-ships should provide for twice as many hands as on cargo steam-ships. What is the use cf trying to humbug us in this way? I hope that when the Bill goes to another place its closing hours will not be defaced by such an appeal to prejudice and sentiment as we have heard-a n appeal not borne out by the actual wording of the measure itself. If any one will help me to divide the Committee on this question, I shall be happy to do so. (I trust that all those who are in favour of good conditions, which the Attorney General says are necessary for apprentices, but are not necessary for boys, will vote with me, in order to secure the building up of that Australian mercantile marine upon which the Attorney-General laid such great stress when asking us to abolish apprentices, so far as this schedule is concerned.",47
239,Mr MATHEWS,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Melbourne Ports) think [4.0] - Whil e I admit the importance building up a mercantile marine, I cannot see that apprentices can be trained on board colliers or coastal steamers. ing vessels that boys learn to become seamen. A boy on a steamer gets no knowledge of seamanship. Like a certain "" ruler of the Queen's Navee,"" his business is chiefly to polish up the the handle and brasswork generally. Seenew ing that the manning scale provided is fairly good, there seems to be no reason for the amendment. I know that seamen are of opinion that there is nothing [164]- 2 for apprentices to learn on board steamers. There are not very many young Australians on our coasting steamers and colliers, the crews being composed chiefly of men who years ago learned their business on sailing vessels. - Mr TUDOR - We provide an alternative; either an apprentice or a boy may be carried.",48
240,Mr MATHEWS,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"-There are a good many boys in my electorate who have been on coastal vessels, but they do not stay longer than two or three voyages, because the work does not appeal to them. I do not think it would be possible to get any parent to apprentice a boy on board a coasting vessel or a collier, because there is nothing to be learnt.",48
241,Mr GROOM,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Darling Downs) [4.3] It is a new thing to hear that the amendment has been proposed to provide for the manning of boats. No one wishes to weaken the efficiency of steamer crews, but an ample manning scale had already been fixed after the most searching inquiry. The Kyarra has about ten boats, but there are so many persons employed on board her that it would be easy to man them. ,It is extraordinary that this increase should be sprung on us at this stage. The Senate saw no need for it .",48
242,Mr FOWLER,DELIVERY OF MAILS BY MAIL,"Will the boys be under any agreement providing for their training as sailors ? If not, the object of the provision is likely to be defeated.",48

What is the apprentice to be taught? In my opinion, these provisions are very loosely framed, and it difficult to understand what is intended. What are boys going to do on board these vessels? They will surely learn something about the working of the vessels on which lost. they are employed. Why, then distinguish between a boy and an apprentice? What work will a boy do that an not do?' Is it not necessary to have a definition embracing every youth of a given age employed on a vessel, terming him an apprentice ?
