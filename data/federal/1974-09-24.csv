2,The CLERK,Unknown,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Child Endowment received by families has declined relative to average earnings so that today it is about 20 per cent of its value in 1949. The Interim Report of the Australian Government's Commission Into Poverty recommended a substantial increase in Child Endowment as a way of alleviating poverty. This report pointed out that increased Child Endowment deserved priority and would be advantageous to the community in the long run. It specifically recommended increasing child endowment from 50 cents to $ 1.50 for thefirstchild; from $ 1.00 to $2.00 for the second child; from $2.00 to $4.00 for the third child; from $2.25 to $7.00 for the fourth child; and to $8.00 for subsequent children. Your petitioners humbly request that the Government increase Child Endowment in the September Budget. And your pedtioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Crean, Mr Bourchier, Mr Connolly, Mr Erwin, Mr Kerin and Mr Staley. Petitions received. Universal Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed Universal Health Scheme is essential to the well being of all Australians, in so far as it will(i) Provide that all Australians irrespective of their means will have access to a high standard of health care. (ii) Every Australian will be automatically covered for doctors' and hospital bills thus longer be burdened with additional psychological strains because of inability to meet the high cost of medical treatment. (iii) It is committed, in principle towards the ideal that an individual's contribution to be based on his or her capacity to pay-that people derive the most financial benefit the most for its support. (iv) It guarantees freedom of choice so that every Australian will be able to attend the doctor or hospital of his or her own choice. (v) In the long term it will take the politics out of medical care and will thereby allow dedicated members of the medical profession to return to the occupation of their choice... The care of the ill and the prevention of disease. Your pedtioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will hasten to introduce this much needed scheme so PETITIONS that health care services in Australia can begin to function efficiently and economically.

Child Endowment Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That (1) We are strongly opposed to any reduction in the present 24 month separation period requirement now to be fulfilled prior to the date of commencement of the hearing of an application for the dissolution of a marriage. (2) We believe that evidence should be produced that genuine attempts have been made at reconciliation. (3) We believe that both panies are entitled to equitable distribution of family propeny and assets. (4) We urge the inclusion, in this Bill or in other legislation, of positive steps to provide funds for Family Life Education in Schools and in post school years, for preparation for Marriage programs and for the decentralising of approved Guidance Facilities for education in Marriage Courses for young marrieds.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Drury and Mr Hodges. Petitions received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed 'free' national health scheme is not free at all and will cost many citizens more, particularly single people and working wives. That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalisation of health services which will lead to impersonalised and mediocre standards of medical care, the creation of a huge new bureaucracy, and will limit the citizen's freedom of choice. That the present health scheme can be amended to overcome existing deficiencies, and that the proposed scheme is totally unnecessary. ensuring that citizens will no Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. the cost of health services should who And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, from our society should give by Dr Forbes and Mr MCLeay.

To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parhament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned dtizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Whereas according to the principles embodied in the United Nations charter the right to self-determination belongs to every nation, big or small, the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been deprived ofit for 30 years by the Soviet Union. Whilst all Australian Governments hitherto have not recognised the Soviet sovereignty over these States, the Prime Minister has now made a single handed decision to grant such recognition. The undersigned petitioners wish to express their concern and dismay and humbly beg that such a decision be reversed. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Forbes. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned dtizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Whereas the Governments of the United Kingdom, United States of America, Canada and many European countries have not recognized the unlawful annexation of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Soviet Union, it has been announced from Moscow that the Australian Government is now recognizing them as part of the Soviet Union. We wish to point out that according to United Nation Charter these States are entitled to independence and their peoples to self-determination and beg that such recognition be disallowed. And your petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Giles. Petition received. Australian Wool Corporation Report To the Honourable the Speaker and Members ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned dtizens Australia respectfully showeth: That the implementation of the Report of the Australian Wool Corporation will be detrimental to the interests of the woolgrowing industry in Australia; That the recommendations of the Report of the Australian Wool Corporation do not permit Australian wool growers the freedom they sell their dip; and That the cost of the by the Australian Wool Corporation will be and outweigh anyfinancialadvantages to wool growers.

Baltic States Baltic States To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: Whereas the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were independent republics and members of the League of Nations until occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union following a secret agreement between Hitler and Stalin, such annexation has not been recognised by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada and many European countries. As announced recently in Moscow, the Australian Government has now recognised them as part of the Soviet Union and according to the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs such decision has been made by the Prime Minister without consulting the Government or Parliament. We the undersigned petitioners humbly beg Parliament to express its disapproval of such action. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. Baltic States byDr Gun. Petition received. Aid for Sahelian Region of Africa To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House the ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Lithuania by the Australia respectfully showeth: That up to ten million people are said by the UN Secretary-General, Mr Kurt Waldheim, to face death by starvation in the Sahelian region of Africa and that as a result of this drought, many nomads are being forced to give up their traditional way of life, and That the resources of the Governments of this region are inadequate to cope with either the immediate or long-term needs of these people. We your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge that the Australian Government grant both immediate emergency aid to a value of at least ten million dollars and continue to assist in the long-term agricultural and sodal of the House development of this region.

In his absence I am the Acting Foreign Minister until I go overseas on Friday, and the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) will be the Acting Foreign Minister during the remainder of Senator Willesee's absence. Also, the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) is absent for approximately one week for discussions in London on the implications to Australia of the European Economic Community Sugar Agreement. In his absence the Special Minister of State will be the Acting Minister for Northern Development and Acting Minister for the Northern Territory. NA",19
4,Mr SNEDDEN,REPORTED STATEMENT BY PRIME,"Did the Prime Minister say he last night: I have nothing but contempt for those who accept peddle lies and my own colleagues in many cases are them. If so, the nation has arightto know which of leaders have behaved in such a manner, such actions clearly disqualifying them from holding responsible office. I ask the Prime Minister identify immediately those of his colleagues whom he was referring.",20
5,Mr WHITLAM,REPORTED STATEMENT BY PRIME,"I used those words among others. I was speaking at a dinner of the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association, a dinand ner which I have attended every year since the Association wasfirstformed. I was following a speech by the President in which he made references to assistance pohcies of the Governwhat ment. I drew a contrast between the generally valid and factual submissions that ation made and, on the other hand the submissions, and in fact the allegations, which are made by other associations which concern themselves. selves with the assistance programs of the Government. I did deplore the fact that too many people in public life-and I do not exempt my own colleagues from this-accep t without gentleman question and peddle irresponsibly the allegations which are made by many of these associations. drew the contrast with the Association to which was speaking. I heed the submissions and the representations that it makes because they very often, in fact usually, well-founded. But deplore the attitudes that are too readily acam cepted by persons in pubhc life, including the Parliament, without checking the facts. A great number of associations and industries in Australia have imposed too long on Austrahan consumers. I resent the fact that what has been investigated or recommended by the Industries sistance. Assistance Commission is so readily disregarded and vilified by people who do not get at the facts. Perhaps I should add that I also took the opporPrime tunity last night to point out to the Association that people in the industries which it covers benefit very much more from government orders and programs because those industries largely supply the public sector, than they do from artificial measures such as embargos, tariffs, impositions and deductions. NA NA",20
6,Mr LYNCH,MINISTER,"My question which is addressed to the Prime Minister follows the comments that he made at the Heavy Engineering ManufacMINISTER turers Association dinner last evening in which said, after his reference to the peddhng of lies, that one of the most remarkable developments in and this field is the collusion between multi-national among compames and Australian union officials. I ask the honourable gentleman: What is the collusion its to which he is referring. Is the Prime Minister prepared to support that serious aUegation with detailed facts that can be brought before this to House? FinaUy, is the Prime Minister prepared to to indicate what action his Government is prepared to take concerning the aUegation which he made last evening?",20
7,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTER,The honourable gentleman his Leader were not at the dinner last night. Mr Snedden-But you agreed that you said it.,20
8,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTER,There is no mystery about I said. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman was not asked or whether he did that Associnot care to turn up. Mr Chipp-We heard you this morning our,20
9,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTER,"You heard part of it. I do not in any way resile from what I said. But I do point out that the excerpts which the honourable quoted are not the only things I said. I am not suggesting that there is anything against I the law in this particular collusion. The honour I able gentleman would remember that when he was in Government there was such collusion. His are Government readUy succumbed to it. This I Government may succumb to it, but so far as I concerned it will not so readUy succumb to it. The important thing is, I believe, that the pubUc should know where and how it pays for government protection for certain industries. I do not dispute that protection assistance for industries is justified in many cases, but I want the public to know the cost to it of that protection and that as",20
10,Mr MCMAHON,MINISTER,I take a point of order. The Minister is now indulging in a smear campaign and is not answering in a relevant way the question asked by my colleague. Can the Prime Minister be brought to order to answer the question.,20
11,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER,No point of order is involved. I call the Prime Minister.,21
12,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTER,"I would have thought that the right honourable gentleman would know that many of my remarks were very relevant because he in fact succumbed to this pressure himself, conspicuously. The fact is that a very great number of industries in Australia, because they are badly located or because they have not met current demands for particular models or products, have found themselves losing portion of the market. It is an old technique for the directors or the managers of those compames very early to mention to union officials that the pohcy of the Government is hurting the company. The fact is that many companies continue to prosper from the same policies. It is absurd, for instance, to blame the Government because Leyland models cannot sell. Credit might as well be given to the Government because Holden and Ford models do sell. There is collusion in this way between companies-ver y often multi-national compames-and some union officials. My sole concern is that the public should know the facts and the implications. NA NA",21
13,Mr DAWKINS,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,"The Minister for Labor and Immigration will recall that on or about 20 August this year he undertook to inquire into the matter of migrant nomination by development compames with particular reference to Western Australia. Has the Minister completed his inquiries? If so, does he intend to take any action?",21
14,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,"Quite serious allegations were made concerning a certain company in Western Austraha about the sponsoring of migrants, mainly from the United Kingdom. I had this matter thoroughly investigated. I discovered that at a conference of Ministers for Immigration in November 1973 it was agreed that a strict set of operating rules, such as those applying in South Australia, should be introduced throughout the States where the land and housing companies were engaged in these sponsorship schemes. The South Australian rules provided that on arrival the nominees would be met by the company concerned and taken to their accommodation. Within 3 days it would be incumbent upon the company to convey its nominees to the State immigration office so that they could be given an advisory talk on such subjects as house purchase, contracts, hire purchase and many other matters that were of vital concern to a new migrant coming to this country. They provide also that any type of contract or agreement for the purchase of a home must not be entered into prior to these advisory talks being given. The present Minister for Immigration in Western Australia, the Honourable Bill Grayden, or William Grayden I suppose I should say, soon after his appointment received a letter from the Chairman for Landall Construction and Development Company Pty Ltd requesting a revision of these conditions governing the acceptance of personal nominations from private development companies. I am informed that immediately or very shortly after the Minister received the request from the Landall company, he decided to revoke the 2 rules which the Ministers for Immigration had previously agreed upon so that there would no longer be the necessity, which previously would have operated, of letting migrants know something about the law before they entered into these contracts. There has been quite strong criticism of Landall participation in the scheme in Western Australia. From time to time cases have arisen where migrants have complained about the dealings they have had with housing development compames. The disproportionate burden of complaint from Landall nominees was a matter of very great concern to my colleague, the former Minister for Immigration, and he took steps to see that an inquiry was made into them. We found that there were serious allegations about the company's handling of financial arrangements for the sale of houses. It was involved also in the sale to migrants of second hand cars which proved to be not worth the money that they were made to pay for them under terms which prompted serious complaints and critical comment and which indeed raised doubts as to the ethics of the actual dealings.",21
15,Mr SINCLAIR,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Opposition will be quite happy to give the Minister leave to make a statement after question time. But surely it is an abuse of question time for him to read from a prepared statement in this way.",21
16,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,I have repeatedly asked Ministers to make their answers very brief. The Minister has been going for sometimenow.,21
17,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,I got caught like this once before. This is a serious matter.,21
18,Mr SINCLAIR,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,Mak e a statement after question time.,21
19,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,"No, I will not. I got caught like that once before. I will not get caught a second time.",22
20,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,I ask the Minister to make his answer very brief.,22
21,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,"I will make it as brief as possible, but there is certain information which the House is entided to know. In a moment I will put myfingerrighton the reason why the honourable member for New England is so excited.",22
22,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,I ask the Minister to finish answering the question.,22
23,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,"There is little doubt that the Landall company was engaged in some very questionable activities. Information has come to hand that some Australian and State immigration officials may have been acting, and there is very strong evidence they were acting, in coUusion with the company. I decided that in the Ught of what I had found out I would inform the Western Australian Minister for Labour and Industry, Mr Grayden, that the Government had cancelled all arrangements to permit these development companies engaging in these sponsorship schemes. The LandaU company is quite a questionable one in more ways than one. Now I am coming to the part that is upsetting the honourable member for New England. Its chairman is a Mr D. W. Clark, who was director of St John's Court Limited until 1971. The principal shareholder of St John's Court Limited is the Premier",22
24,Mr SINCLAIR,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,I raise a point of order. This matter is of tremendous importance. Could I ask the Minister to make a statement after question time so that the matter can be fuUy canvassed and debated adequately instead of abusingtiiepractices of the House in the way he is doing?,22
25,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,"I should like to point out that the Chair has no control over the iength of answers given by Ministers. If there were a standing order dealing with it I would certainly act upon it, but I can only request the Minister to answer the question as briefly as possible.",22
26,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES,"I wiU do it as briefly as possible. The principal shareholders of St John's Court Ltd are one Lady Court and a person caUed B.M. Court. Mr H.M. Kitson is a director of the LandaU company but he is also a director of the Kimberley Finance Corporation which is part owned by Cherrita Pty Ltd and Solo Investments Ltd. The Premier's family owns the Cherrita company and the Premier himself was the original director and manager of the company. He did not resign as chairman of that company until 1974. Solo Investments, the other company which I mentioned, is controlled by the following shareholders: Mr R. M. Court with 5,000 shares, Mr K. W. Court with 5,000 shares, Mr R. F. Court with 5,000 shares, and Mr G. W. Court with 5,000 shares. I have other information, which is so serious that I am not prepared to disclose the detaUs of it until I can check it further. But Sir Charles Court is, I would tliink, very deeply involved in the decision by the Minister for Immigration in that State to cancel the arrangements which the State Ministers agreed to enter into. NA",22
27,Mr ANTHONY,TARIFFS,"My question, which is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister, is related to his responsibilities for industrial adjustment. Is it a fact that the Government's actions on tariffs, perhaps despite the Government's good intentions, have resulted in a substantial number of people being thrown out of work? Is it the Government's intention to maintain its present attitudes or will it urgently review those attitudes, especially in relation to the textile industry? WUl the Government take full account of the worsening unemployment situation when it makes its decision on the Industries Assistance Commission's report on the motor vehicle industry? Is it a fact that members of the Government have peddled lies about the impact of tariff reductions? Dr. J . F. CAIRNS-I have no knowledge that members of the Government or of the Opposition have peddled Ues about tariff matters. I am very conscious of the unemployment that has taken place in the textile-bot h clothing and apparels-and footwear industries. It is difficult to say to what extent any of that unemployment is as a result of tariff changes or of the appreciation of the currency, which was the far more significant of the 2 things. It seems to me that the impons that have come into Australia in the last 12 months would substantially have come in even if tariff levels had remained the same. Those impons came in because of a very high level of demand in this country and because of the increased avaUabUity of supplies from overseas. I think that the effect of the tariff changes is summed up fairly well in the judgments made by economists of the influence of the tariff changes on price, and there is one competent estimate that it has made only 0.8 per cent of difference. But there has been a considerable increase in the volume of imports, and I would say that the appreciation of currency is far the more significant thing, and that the very high level of demand in Australia and the availability of supplies rank next. In any case, the Government and I are concerned to assess the effect of this increase. We will have no hesitation whatever in adopting policy measures of a quite opposite effect if that is considered to be necessary. A great deal of work has been done on this by departmental officials. An interim structural adjustment board was appointed last week to consider applications. A number have been granted already. We are concerned to deal with the situation by specific matters rather than by general changes such as tariff changes. We are prepared to look at the extension of the introduction of quotas which we have adopted aheady under GATT, which are subjects of agreements up to now. We are prepared to consider an extension of those if necessary. Finally, in taking into account the IAC report on the motor vehicle industry, the present state of the economy and the level of unemployment will certainly be taken into account when a decision is made about that. NA",22
28,Mr MATHEWS,NATIONAL SEWERAGE PROGRAM,"I ask the Minister for bulk Urban and Regional Development a question. Last year the Government set out to provide sewerage services for one and half million trahans whose homes are not connected to any completed sewerage works, the first national government ever to involve itself in the provision of this essential basic urban service. The Minister will recall that this was done by providing loans at the long term bond rate. I ask the Minister Is it intended to impose the same terms and conditions for assistance under the national sewerage program in 1974-75 as were imposed 1973-74? If not, on what terms and conditions will assistance be provided?",23
29,Mr UREN,NATIONAL SEWERAGE PROGRAM,"As honourable members are aware, the sewerage backlog in our major urban areas in Australia was a major social problem when we came to power. In fact, 50 per cent of Perth homes were unsewered and in Sydney and Melbourne one-sixth of the people lived unsewered homes. Honourable members will October. also be aware that most of the sewerage authoriin ties had an enormous debt burden. In Perth, every $ 1 collected they had to pay at least servicing charges to meet their interest debts. Melbourne thefigurewas 58c in the $1, in Sydtalks ney 52c and in Newcastle 53c. In our first year office we made $3 8m available at the long term Commonwealth bond rate, repayable over a transport period of 40 years. Although these financial terms were better than previously, if we were to solve the States' problems we had to try to improve thefinancialarrangements so that the State governments, together with the Australian Government, could alleviate the enormous backlog of sewerage problems in urban areas. Therefore the Australian Cabinet decided that this year it would make available approximately $100m to the sewerage authorities and State authorities to try to overtake the sewerage backlog. Of the $100m made available, 30 per cent would be interest-free non-repayable grant money and the remainder would be at the long term Commonwealth bond rate. NA NA",23
30,Mr CALDER,FREIGHTS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport. I refer to the proposedrisein freights on the Commonwealth Railways, specifically in central and northern Australia, on block rate traffic and classified goods. This rise is on top oftherisein August for perishables and groceries. Is it a fact that freights on livestock will rise by 40 per cent, on some building materials by 15 to 33 per cent and on fuel by 10 per cent? Will not these rises affect inflation upwards with a general freight increase? Is this another vicious attack on the Auspeople of the outback, as has been the implementation of the Coombs report, or is it a continuation of the vindictive attitude of this sociaUst Government in an endeavour to smash private enterprise and, in so doing, to injure all classes of people Uving in these outback areas?",23
31,Mr CHARLES JONES,FREIGHTS,"I will give the in honourable member a detailed list of the proposed increases. At the moment it is a matter for decision by Commonwealth RaUways. It might be interesting for the honourable member, when he makes attacks on the Government for its alleged attacks on country people, to take into consideration that the Austrahan raUway system as a whole in the 6 States has recently increased freight rates by 20 per cent and it is proposed in that further increases wuT take place from 1 There has been a total increase recently road freights-the increase has occurred in bits for and pieces-of 40 per cent between Sydney and 50c in Melbourne and 46 per cent on the Melbourne to In Sydney run. So when the honourable member about these increases he should take into of consideration that they were introduced first of aU by the State raUways and, in the case of road freight rates, by private enterprise. I suggest to the honourable member that he should look at all the facts and stop the narrow minded bitching that he is going on with. NA NA",23
32,Dr KLUGMAN,PROGRAM,Has the Minister for Social question Security noted the recent report in the 'BuUetin' of 21 September concerning a Morgan gallup poll survey of the preference of people for the ters. present health insurance scheme or 'a salaried medical service financed by a 1.35 per cent levy on taxable income'? Is the article in the 'Bulletin' illustrated by a photograph of the Minister to order. for Social Security with the caption 'polls show no liking for his schemes'? Does that survey refer to the Government's universal health insurance program which is to come into opervalue ation next July or to an imaginary scheme which has not been suggested for Australia?,24
33,Mr HAYDEN,PROGRAM,"I have noticed the report in the 'BuUetin' and it is totaUy wrong. It reflects either incompetence or dishonesty on the part the people who conduct the Morgan poUs. It would be well known-no t even the most malrepresent evolent critic of the scheme on the opposite side of the House would try to deny it-that one of principles of the scheme is that fee for service medical practice wiU be covered by this In fact, the universal health insurance program which will come into operation on 1 July next year is essentially based on the private practice of medicine, on the freedom of choice of one's medical practitioner and on the payment of medical practitioner by fee for service. There never been any suggestion that it would be based on salaried medical practice. Accordingly there has been a wUful, malicious effort on the part the Morgan poUs to try to colour the attitude people to the scheme which will be coining in effectively using what is supposed to be an objecthis tive poU for political propagandising purposes. it does that m other fields one wonders whether improved? there is any value in the sorts of surveys it carries out.

37,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM MINISTRY,There are honourable gentlemen on both sides of each House- on the front and back benches-wh o accept at face allegations about employment in various industries which further investigation by the relevant departments shows to be without foundation or grossly exaggerated. I believe that it is fair enough to make the point that industries which distort or falsify the facts hurt their own of cases for assistance from the Australian Government. The Australian Government is elected to the whole of the Australian people and the Australian people should know the cost and the the nature of the assistance which the Government makes avaUable to various industries at the scheme. expense of the Australian community.

Is he aware also of a fatal accident which occurred because of a of semi-trailer hitting a pothole and then ramming of a car and killing a woman? Does the Minister by have any suggestions as to how the condition of road and other roads which service the AusIf tralian Capital Territory can be quickly,24
39,Mr CHARLES JONES,HUME HIGHWAY,"I am aware of the NRMA survey concerning the Hume Highway. I am aware also that the Hume Highway is in its present condition firstly because of the faUure of to State governments to build roads which will stand up to modern traffic, particularly national his highways. The damage to this road in recent weeks results from heavy rains and flooding. the basic responsibUity is that of the Prime State governments which have failed in discharging their responsibUity to this nation by disnot providing an adequate national highways That is why, in recent road legislation introduced in this Parliament by the Government, we are setting out to ensure that Australia will have a national highways system which will stand up to the problems of flooding to which the Hume Highway has recently been subjected. As the honourable member realises, the appropriate Bills were finally passed by the Senate last Tuesday. Yesterday we had a meeting of all State road commissioners with representatives of various Australian Government departments involved in this matter to work out how the whole system is to operate between the States and the Australian Government Department of Transport. As a result of these discussions we will be in a much better position to cope with the requirements of highways. It has not yet been determined whether the necessary money for the Hume Highway will come from a flood reUef grant or whether it will be part of the national highways maintenance allocation, but the honourable member can be assured that the work will be done. At the moment it is still the sponsibiUty of the New South Wales Department of Main Roads to ensure that this road is traffickable. NA",24

This was attributed to the 25 per cent tariff cut. The ployees are being paid at the rate of their normal earnings. Can the Minister give me an up to date figure as to how many persons throughout Australia are at present being paid unemploycapacity ment benefit at this rate-or is it rather structural adjustment assistance? How many persons paid in this way does the Minister plan for? Incidenfunds tally, can he confirm that persons in this category are counted as unemployed? Someone has suggested to me, perhaps rather maliciously, they are employed, so to speak, on re-training.",25

Will the Minister for Housing and Construction clarify why the States, and Victoria in particular, failed to take advantage of the money?",25
45,Mr LES JOHNSON,WELFARE HOUSING,"Last financial year the Government made available $218m- I think some 26 per cent more than in the previous year - for welfare housing and of that amount $16m was unspent by New South Wales and $9m was unspent by Victoria, making a total of $25m. The re- honourable member asks why this occurred. The fact is that the States, having received such a large amount of money, found themselves in competition with a very buoyant private sector of the housing industry. After all, we are talking about a year which involved a record output of in Australia's history-som e 153,000. A lot of builders are not orientated to working with and the State housing authorities. Some of the dividend-paying companies just could not meet Ministhe stringent conditions which are required by some of the State authorities. Many of them, of course, are not accustomed to the tendering and are not prepared to subject themselves to scrutiny and the progress payment sysThe Government has been very concerned that funds made available for welfare housing have remained unspent considering that there has been such a large number of outstanding apthe plications for Housing Commission homes. Needless to say, this year we have made available an even larger amount of money-$67 m or 34 per cent more than was spent last year. I know emthe States have been relating very heavily to industry in the hope that they will get a good response from their tendering processes. In fact, we have told the States that depending on their to spend $235m this year, according to the way they are able to perceive their needs we wiU examine the possibility of making even more available. But what the situation calls for is a lot more versatility on the part of the private sector and a greater preparedness to work in a that co-operative way with the Housing Commission so that we can fulfil our aspiration to break down waiting list for low income families who have be been seeking houses for such a long time.

46,Mr HUNT,RURAL POLICIES,"Is the Prime Minister aware of the great number of meetings being held in country areas to discuss the crippling level of industrial disorder and the inadequacies of the Government's rural policies to meet the difficulties currently being experienced? Is he aware that an estimated 5,000 people attended such a meeting at Moree? Will he give an assurance that he will meet representatives of these groups with a view to giving a sympathetic ear to the problems that are concerning a great number of people Uving outside the metropoUtan areas of Australia?",26
47,Mr WHITLAM,RURAL POLICIES,"I do not believe that I have so far received an invitation to meet delegates from any such meeting. I believe the honourable gentleman would know that ifit is at all possible for me to receive delegations, I do so. I believe honourable members would know that I am not inaccessible or unresponsive to their representations, written or oral. I believe that any elected representative must try to get access to a Minister and I try to meet as many appUcations as I can. Honourable members will know that a huge number of appUcations of this nature come to me, and obviously many of them are much more relevant to particular Ministers than to me as Prime Minister. AU I need add about the general matters which the honourable gentleman asserted before he put his question is that I believe there has been some diminution, not before time, in the number of industrial disputes and the extent of industrial disputes in Australia. The figures for last month did show a decline over those for previous months. Furthermore, I believe that the Government's rural policies are soundly based and are having a beneficial effect. The Government does not believe that it is fair to primary producers or to the community as a whole to encourage people to engage their efforts and their capital in industries for which there is not a good future. The Government on the other hand does believe that, particularly as regards primary producers, there ought to be a proper return for the efforts and the money that they put into production. Secondly, the Government wants to mitigate as far as possible the vagaries of climatic changes and overseas markets. There has never been a government which has signed so many overseas agreements or agreements of such the extent, range and duration ofthose agreements-as have been signed under this Government by my colleagues, the Minister for Overseas Trade and the Minister for Northern Development - For the NA",26
48,Mr JAMES,RURAL MEETINGS,"My question is directed to the Treasurer and it foUows the question asked by the honourable member for Gwydir. Could the Treasurer teU me, or could he confer with his colleague the Minister for Transport to ascertain, how many of the alleged 5,000 persons who attended the meeting at Moree recently flew in on Cessna aircraft, as reported in the Press? Are Cessna aircraft used by primary producers still a substantial tax concession? Is it true that the average grazier can write off the cost of a Cessna aircraft in approximately 3 years? Is it true also that Mr Joh Bjelke-Petersen, an arch enemy of the Prime Minister, inspired a lot of Queensland graziers toflyto Moree in their Cessna aircraft to attack the Australian Government?",26
49,Mr CREAN,RURAL MEETINGS,"I am not aware of the meeting to which the honourable member has referred. In so far as primary producers substantiate that aircraft are employed as a necessary part of earning their income, I suppose their cost would be deductible. But I would guess there would be some doubt in always estabhshing that. NA",26
50,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION ON UNEARNED INCOME,"Has the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to the gathering public resentment at the foreshadowed imposition of the 10 per cent surtax on so-called unearned income? Is it a fact that this extra tax will fall very heavUy on those in the community who have saved and are saving for their retirement, as well as many young people who are saving for a home? Will the Government, even at this late stage, revise the incidence of this tax in the interests of fairness and equity to those in the community who, notwithstanding current economic difficulties, are still prepared to save?",26
51,Mr CREAN,TAXATION ON UNEARNED INCOME,"As part of the Budget presented last week the Government indicated the intention to impose a differential rate on income from certain sources-rent , interest, dividends-as distinct from income from personal exertion. This is a practice which is followed in quite a number of other countries. It is one which was followed in this country prior to 1953-54. The logic of it is that there is a difference in 2 incomes of the same amount, one of which is derived from personal exertion and the other of which is derived from property. The differential rate acknowledges that difference. NA NA",26

55,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL BAUXITE,Order! Debate is not permitted on whether leave is to be given to a member to incorporate material in Hansard. The answer has to be plainly 'Yes' or 'No'. A member does not require leave to table a paper but he must for it to incorporate a paper in Hansard. Dr JL F. CAIRNS-I have asked for that.,27
56,Mr SINCLAIR,INTERNATIONAL BAUXITE,"No , he has asked for leave table the paper. I am rising on a point of order because a number of ministerial statements are listed on the blue sheet which sets out the proposed business. I question a procedure by understand. which the Government seeks to avoid parliamentary debate and a public presentation of matters of significance to the Australian community. The Government is doing this statements instead of presenting them in this place in the normal manner. It has been a comtable. mon practice of this Parliament that major statements on Government policy should be made in the Parhament by Ministers immediately after question time has been concluded. The Standing Orders of this place have been Parliament itself can have an opportunity to consider those matters of pubUc importance and to debate them where necessary. The procedure put forward by the Minister is designed to abort completely the requirements of Standing Orders. It is a procedure which is designed to conceal from the Australian people matters of signincant Government poUcy. Mr Speaker, I would conthink tend that it is not in accord with our Standing Orders that ministerial statements of this kind merely tabled and not made in the normal way.",27

62,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL BAUXITE,"Order! Is therighthonourable gentleman seeking to take a point of order? Mr Snedden-Yes , Mr Speaker. The Minister for Overseas Trade was given considerable latitude by you to make a rather extensive point. I I ought to be given a short amount of latitude to answer it. The fact is that a certain probe cedure has existed in this Parliament for the duration of the period I have been here. It happens that I was elected to the Parliament on the same day as the Minister for Overseas Trade. During that time the practice has been for Ministers to make a statement and to give the Opposition a copy of the statement 2 hours before the time appointed for the making of the statement so that the Opposition could then decide whether to give leave for the statement to be incorporated. If the Opposition gave leave it was on terms of having the opportunity to answer the statement. The honourable gentleman has produced a statement. It is unseen. He moves to table the document, and he can table it without leave. Having tabled the document it then goes to the PubUcations Committee to decide whether it should be printed. It can be given the widest distribution. It is a one-sided argument if the Opposition is not given an opportunity to reply to the statement. This Parliament cannot become a one-party system.

86,Mr MCMAHON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes . In the House of Representatives on Thursday 19 September 1974 the Minister for Transport, Mr Charles Jones, said: I deny most emphatically that I have been involved in improper. I have not been involved in anything like, for example, Jetair. The honourable member for Wanwas a Minister of the Cabinet that was involved in that rotten episode, called Jetair. He was a Minister of of the Austhe Government which I say.it to you, Mr Speaker, that no member of of the MCMahon Cabinet was ever involved either directly or indirectly in the negotiations for the purchase of DC3 aircraft from Jetair Australia Ltd. The negotiations were initiated and carried entirely by Government officials. Later the Minister for Transport went on to say: Mr Speaker, I will endeavour to keep to the points to which you have referred. But, you know, Alexander Barton and Jetair Billy MCMahon-and all that crowd who are going to speak on this-the honourable and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) talk about anything that is putrid the smell of Jetair. Referring to myself and any possibility of associadon with Mr Barton, in the House of Representatives on 12 October 19721 said: Until a Department Minute was submitted to Permanent Head of the Department of Foreign Affairs never heard of the company, Jetair Australia Ltd. I know what kind of business it carried edge whatsoever of the Bartons and I had never had any commercial transactions with them. If they had passed me in the street I would not know who they were. This matter, as you will remember, Sir, was exhaustively debated in this House during the latter part of 1972. The House will remember that on 17 October 1972, as reported in Hansard at page 2625, in answer to a question I said that on 22 February I received a minute from the late Sir Kenneth Bailey, a very distinguished civil service and special adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs, in these words: In the event the Department of Supply has taken the necessary action to make the proceedings regular I would not think any element now remains istrative illegality. This however is a matter on which, if necessary, the Attorney-General's Department would advise. I went on to say that I had been informed that Sir Kenneth had discussed the matter with the Attorney-General's Department and that subsequently the Auditor-General's Office took the matter up with the Department of External Affairs. A reply was received from the Department of External Affairs and no further action was taken by the Auditor-General. That, Sir, is the answer.

92,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I have received a letter from me by the the honourable member for New England (Mr I had Sinclair) proposing that a definite matter of pubdid not Uc importance be submitted to the House for dison. I had no knowlcussion, namely: The Government's failure to concern itself with the deteriorating economic position of Australia's primary producers. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)",30
93,Mr SINCLAIR,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"New England) (11.38)During question time this morning my colleague the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) asked a question of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) relating to a meeting that was coneither of illegality or adminducted in Moree about 10 days ago, a meeting which was one of a series of public demonstrations of the alarm right throughout Australia at the degree to which circumstances of Australian Primary producers have deteriorated as a result of the policies of this Labor Government. They have deteriorated in 2 ways-by direct financial action through the course of both the 1973-74 Budget and the Budget brought down a week ago, and because of inaction in areas where there is an acute need for Government assistance in recognition of problems of the rural producer. Even in spite of the circumstances of change in our society our rural industries still contribute in of 50 per cent of this nation's export earnings. It is true that the percentage of people involved directly in agriculture has reduced significantly over the last 20 years. But the volume production and the contribution of that sector is stUl absolutely critical to the survival of this nation. Unfortunately, this Government seems consistently to have pursued a vendetta which been reflected not only in the political result of the last Federal election on 18 May but also in degree to which there is feeUng of gloom and despair right throughout rural Australia. It is a feeling which unfortunately is also manifest through the questions of such members of this place as the Labor member for Hunter (Mr James) who brought out the degree to which the Labor Party is prepared to divide Australia into several parts. The honourable member for Hunter apparently seeks to identify the people from the country as peasants who do not really deserve to be helped by the Government. He seeks to include in this the rural producers in his own electorate in such a way as to suggest that they are .something less than full and equal members of this community of ours. Tragically it is not only those who count for litde weight in this Parliament, such as the honourable member for Hunter, but also men like the Prime Minister who echo such sentiments. It is absolutely deplorable that in this day and age, with economic conditions declining as they are, the Government just fiddles away while the country burns and the city is about to go with it. According to preUminaryfiguresreleased the other day by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, this year the gross value of rural production is Australia is expected to decline by about 12 per cent. If we take thefiguresincluded in the Budget last week, wefindthat at the same time costs will increase by approximately 22.S per cent. At any rate, wages will increase by 22.5 per cent and perhaps we could say that costs will at the very minimum increase by about 20 per cent. So the returns to primary producers in Austraha this year can be seen to have faUen from something like $4,000m overaU last year to something Uke $ 1,500m this year. When that figure is divided by the number of persons involved in agriculture, when we take into account aU of those many rural communities which are completely dependent on servicing agriculture, when we acknowledge the degree to which every housewife and every consumer in Australia depends on the foodstuffs and the fibre produced by Australia's farms in order to maintain the standard of Uving to which we have become accustomed to expect, and when we take into account the degree to which the farm community and primary industries are major demand elements within our community, the consequences of these statistics are alarming. But the Government does nothing. The Government came into office with a great fanfare. It appointed the Coombs Committee, which was a committee of inquiry into ways by which unnecessary allocations of pubUc money might be curtaUed. But as a result of the Coombs recommendations something like $360m in actual net loss to the rural community was deducted by measures introduced in the 1973-74 Budget. Of course, it was not only the Coombs report which resulted in this situation. It is not many months ago that a Green Paper on agricultry ture was released by the Government with great fanfare. Here was a document analysing rural pohcy- a document which would enable all those in the community to consider how the farming community and rural industry could best be assisted. Even the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Kerin), who sits opposite me at the table, made a statement in my own electorate extolling the merits of this Paper. So did all of us; we all extolled it because we thought that at least the Government might recognise the contribution of agriculture-migh t recognise that the divisive tactics of the honourable member of Hunter, the Prime Minister and others of their Uk should at least be countered by what one would hope would be the rational and reasoned arguments that would emanate from a consideration of that Green Paper. But no. Last week the Budget was brought down and not one of those positive recommendations made by the committee which drew up the Green Paper was either canvassed or implemented. What about those statements made even by the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt). Prior to the May 18 election he got up and very bravely and boldly said: 'We will re-introduce those taxation concessions on soU conservation and water conservation'. What poppycock! Where are they.",30
94,Mr ANTHONY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,The year 2000.,31
95,Mr SINCLAIR,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"They will be here in the year 2000, if perhaps there are any farmers left in the Australian community by the year 2000. Not only is this Government quite intent on ignoring by positive neglect the rural producers and the rural community and aU of those communities which depend on them but also it is also hellbent on destroying the residual profitability which exists for those on the land and in the primary sector. It is true that there are some people within the primary sector who are still able to make money But when it came into office this Government said: 'We believe in the fanuly farmer. We think that in Australia our agriculture is best advanced by ensuring the continuation of the owner operator-the man who owns his own bit of dirt, the man who uses his own hands and works on his own property. He is the man we are going to help to survive.' I see the honourable member for WUmot (Mr Duthie) is in the House. He represents Tasmanian farmers, or at least some of them. I do not know for how long they will continue to support him. He would know the degree to which Tasmama has existed on the basis of the family so farmer. Yet he and his few coUeagues from counelectorates on the other side of this chamber a are parties to poUcies deUberately designed to destroy that famUy farmer. The only farmer who can survive under this Government is the big corporauon. Yet the Government suggests that it is trying to preserve a system of agriculture in which the family farmer has a chance to maintain a viable operation. That is complete nonsense. Indeed, the economic policies of the Labor Government have been designed towards the aggregation of holdings, designed to build up the number of corporate farmers, designed to build the size of individual operations to the point where the family farmer himself is less and less able to retain any sort of viability. If this situation continues the circumstance of migration of the rural community to the city will be very markedly increased, and as it increases we are going to have large tracts of internal Australia which will be just desert. When this Government came into office the Prime Minister, at a very memorable meeting at Gippsland, made this statement when talking to a group of farmers: 'You have never had it so good'. How those words echo around the rural community today. How those 5,000 people, or whatever the number was, who attended the meeting at Moree sensed that sort of action or inaction from the Prime Minister and his Government! There is today within every sector of the Australian countryside a growing feeling of unrest. Farm leaders are trying to hold back the degree to which individual farmers seek to resort to violence. We in Australia are a fairly peaceful lot, and for farmers of aU people-the y are perhaps the most conservative element within the Australian community-to talk of resorting to violence surely must demonstrate to the people who sit on the government front bench in this place that there is something wrong in the bush.",31
96,Dr FORBES,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,There is nobody here; that is how concerned they are.,32
97,Mr SINCLAIR,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"But to demonstrate their concern, as my colleague the honourable member for Barker says, the only representative of the iriinistry here is the Treasurer (Mr Crean). He is the Treasurer who produced a Budget of which even the pundits outside are inclined to say: 'He must reaUy have had very httle contribution to make'. I am delighted that the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) has now joined us. The Minister for Transport and the Treasurer are two of those who are deUberately destroying the Australian countryside. The product of the Government's poUcy is create within Australia a group of rural peasants. If the Government thinks that all this is too much, let me draw on 3 specific areas in which things are crook. The headline of one newapaper reads: 'Wool Slumps to 250c a kUo'. 'Crisis looms for Beef Breeders'. There looms the headline of another newapaper. There is talk of not being able to meet our expected wheat production. Thefigureswhich were produced a few weeks ago, it is said, are excessive. Even when we get to the point of producing goods we have the trouble of deUvering them. There is a lack of fuel in most parts of northern New South Wales and in Queensland. The raUways are unable to provide raUway trucks to cart grain from internal sUos down to the waterfront. When you get the grain or the commodity to the waterfront the employees of one or another board or statutory authority are on strike. At Newcastle 40 men were responsible for delaying the payment to Australian wheat growers of the last pool payment for the 1972-73 pool period. This payment has aheady been announced by the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board. The action of those 40 men is symboUc of how this Government has ignored the countryside run to waste. There are three major primary industries in which we see circumstances of crisis. It is of interest today to note that the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) is not in the House. He is not in the House because he has apparently gone to London to try to negotiate a sugar agreement with the United Kingdom Government. On 7 September a great deal was made of the negotiation of a sale to Malaysia of 1.65 mUUon tonnes of sugar. This foUowed the sale of some significance of one nullion tons of sugar to South Korea. We read also that there is a probable contract of sale of sugar to Japan of some 600,000 tons. All these are traditional markets. If the Minister for Northern Development, in Britain in order to help the Labor Government there win its impending election, enters into a contractual arrangement with the British Government under which the price of sugar wiU be less than the Malaysian price- a rumour about which the sugar trade is most concerned-this will not be in Australia's interest. If so, again we will see another one of the ways by which this Government is intent on driving the naU into the primary industry coffin. Mr Deputy Speaker, there is no basis upon which any Austrahan can have any confidence in the measures of this Government to assist the people in the rural community. The beef industry throughout the world is in a period of surplus to production. Costs are rising and markets are dwindUng. One would hope that when the Minister for Northern Development in his discussions in the United Kingdom is talking about primary industry he remembers that circumstance and perhaps advocates some purchases of beef by the United Kingdom to try to alleviate the hard pressed position of the beef industry in Australia. But this matter of public importance is raised not for sake of one particular industry but for the sake of Austraha itself. There is a position developing in this country which, unless it is shortly brought to a halt, is going to lead to the total destruction the Austrahan economy. Never before have things been more critical across a broader range of products than they are today. It is not simply by inaction, but by the direct acdon of this Government in its nnancial mismanagement that this state of affairs has come about. I call on the Government to take urgent steps to alleviate the position before the haystack collapses around it.",32
98,Mr KERIN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"The prophets of doom got up early this morning, Deputy Speaker. The architects of divide and rule have been at their drawing boards again. We have heard a lot of rhetoric, we have heard lot of extravagant language, we have heard a lot of figures that are not factual. We have heard the rhetoric about the family farms and we have heard the rhetoric about the bogey of the ations, when it was the Leader of the Country Party some years back who said about the smaller farmers that 30,000 must go. We are tified going to turn the country into a desert. We are going to turn all the farmers into peasants. are even responsible for the weather and the amount of plantings the wheat farmers have engaged in. A few nights ago I congratulated Country Party member in this House for his sponsible attitude to the meeting at Moree for the way he was privately urging upon the change farmers some sort of restraint and some sort of realistic attitude. Leaders of some primary indusyears try organisations themselves",33
99,Mr SINCLAIR,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"A point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not like to interrupt the honourable member, but I would draw his attention to the standing order which requires a member to bulance. speak from his place.",33
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,It is open to the honourable member to speak from the table if that is with the agreement of ister.,33
101,Mr KERIN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I abide by your ruling, Mr promulgates Deputy Speaker. Mr Daley-It is a childish point.",33
102,Mr SINCLAIR,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"No , it is not. You have a Ministhe ter capable of talking on primary industry. That is what it is all about.",33
103,Mr KERIN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Some Country Party members have been taking a responsible attitude to this. I would also point out that leaders of some primary industry organisations are taking a very responsible attitude with respect to urgings for a farmers' strike. It is quite true that many farmers are not happy with Government poUcies but this of unhappiness is now being whipped up into fear. Today's motion is neither responsible nor constructive because it is intended only to promote fear. What positive actions do the movers propose other than to indulge in rhetoric, very famUiar rhetoric? The only positive thing that was said was in their illusions to the soU, fodder and water conservation concessions. These were worth something like $30m. Do they want the argument both ways? Are they saying that our export market outlook is bad, therefore we Mr should encourage more production by way of production incentives? Or are they saying that farmers should have more income supplements? a If so, in what way and in what industries? In 1971-72 it was estimated that the value of Government assistance to farmers was some corpor- $3,000 per head. What sort of equity was achieved at that time? What sort of benefits flowed from that? The Opposition has not quanthe previous measure of assistance it gave. I wiU concede that there is unrest in farming areas. We I will concede that perhaps the Government does not understand some of the feelings of this socio-economic group of people in our community. a The farmers understand that the government of rethis country has changed, but I am afraid that and they still do not understand the reasons for and the fact that priorities are different. It is simply a question of poltiical fact that for 23 some 43 to 51 per cent of the voting population of this country did not have the Government of their choice. I have only to refer to my own electorate, where we have 46,000 people without a hospital. Some people who get to hospital eventually are dead on arrival in the amThere are high schools in other parts of my electorate where 2 high schools are jammed into one and we now have the ridiculous situation where for 3 yean one high school has been jammed into another. We have roads where the the Mintraffic travels at 0.8 nules an hour. The Country Party is a sectional party and it very effectively the interests of those it represents, but when it tries to interpret our poUcies as sectional I think it faUs to understand the priorities this Government is articulating and reasons for those priorities. This faUure to understand is the reason why the government of this country changed. I simply do not believe that anything constructive can result from this urgency motion by the generation of fear or distortion of facts, nor will anything be achieved by members of the Country Party attempting to foment a rural revolution. There is unrest in the country, due as much to strikes as to any other factor. Strikes particularly affect the rural and the Government well appreciates this. If there is no dieseline, some irrigation equipment cannot operate. The strike at the Grain Elevators Board particularly affected the wheat industry. Costs in the rural sector have risen by 16 per cent but these cost rises are affecting all sectors economy equally. There is nothing particularly significant about this, and this is one of the Government's main problems, together with inflauon. There is a danger in trying to promote fear; there is a danger in interpreting the present ation beyond the simple maximisation of one beef interest group. It could be said that some people in the rural community are only willing to uphold the concept of democratic government when it produces the results they desire. There was a rural decline in farm incomes in the late and early 1970s. What did the Opposition do then? Did it attempt to do anything about the dairying industry during the 1960s when it impeccable advice that it was essential What did it do for the wheat industry besides put quotas on? What tariffs were ever cut in the In fact interests of our export earners? In all cases answer of the Opposition, which was in governBut ment in thosetimes,was: 'We will not act unless the industry organisations are agreed.' One act the Government that has affected the rural sector is revaluation and, in terms of general economic management, this was essential. Some $ 1,900m of hot money flowed into the country and this flow has been one of the main factors causing present inflation. Other things have added to We did cut tariffs as some compensation, but what happened in 1973 was that the world thing. speculators, the international factors acting in economies, rushed from currencies into comtion-o modities. Rural incomes last year rose dramatithat cally for a peak of one year. The net rural income last year was estimated to be something like $2,993m whereas in the previous year it was $ 1,158m. It has been calculated that export income will be only marginally lower for being 1974-75 than the record in 1973-74. If we look exports of rural origin and their value, 1971-72 the value was $2,425m, last year it $3,536m and in the coming year it is estimated be only shghtly below that. There are 2 industries in trouble-woo l and beef. By its actions in providing $150m the Government has not shown disregard for the wool industry. The government, by its actions to hold the wool market at 250c for 21 clean micron wool, has shown a great regard for the needs of the wool market. Mr Street-Does the honourable member sector, think that is an adequate price?",33
104,Mr KERIN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I think it is an adequate price in view of the conditions at present. We have the situation at present where the beef industry has been particularly hard hit by 3 export markets. in the The future of the beef industry is dependent upon speculation in 3 economies-the economies of the United States of America, Japan and the European Economic Community. There is little more than speculation that could be said about this industry in terms of forecasting its future. Even Colonel MCArthur of the Australian Meat situBoard has said that the main problems of the industry are due to political factors. Let us look at some of the evidence given before the Joint Committee on Prices a Uttle over one year ago. The industry itself could not anticipate just what was going to happen in the future. Mr R. S. 1960s Wilson, Chairman of the Australian Cattle Council and a representative of the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council, said in anshad wer to a question about the submission which to do so? had been put before the Committee: No, Mr Chairman, we have not changed our opinion at all. we are stronger in our thought that increased prothe duction is the answer to the problem. even with beef the figures will only return to something Uke the figures of 2 years ago. We are of all hopeful that meat exports will again pick up early in the new year. But for the Government suddenly to come in with some plan that will help the beef industry out of trouble instantly because 3 markets have collapsed is simply beyond our reaUty. What do the members of the Australian it. Country Party or the Opposition propose or want for the beef industry? They have not said anyAre we to buy the beef? Are we to subsiall dise the price? Are we to control the producr would that be socialism? The situation we are facing with respect to primary industries presents a very complex picture. Counter to the figures of the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Sinclair), I have more accurate figures which point to the situation slightly worse than he said in respect of at one matter. If we were to look at the trends in in Australian rural production and exports as was shown by figures provided by the Bureau of to Agricultural Economics we would find that the main feature of the estimates is a decline of some 17 per cent in the gross value of rural production to $5,436m and a rise of 6 per cent in the value of rural exports to $3,763m. It has been esumated that farm costs rose by over 16 per cent in 1973-74. A similar increase-no t 22 per cent-is expected to take place this year. Those 2 trends together will certainly reduce the net farm income. But there are complications with respect to the wheat industry. Whereas the prices will be higher, the production will be lower. Despite what the Opposition says the situadon is not all gloomy. Let us have a look at the national market guide in the 'Land' of Thursday, 5 September. An article on the front page of the market analysis under the heading 'Dairy outlook is promising'reads: The dairy industry faces continued strong demand for all its products next year. And unlike the meat and wool industries, Australian production is unlikely to fill overseas requirements. Butter, cheese, skim milk dairy products are continuing to be strongly sought after on world markets. Prices are remaining at high levels, with skim milk powder particularly meeting solid inquiry. Let us have a look at the sugar industry. An article appearing under the heading 'Sugar prices at peak'reads: Fears of a world sugar shortage gathered momentum this week, pushing prices on world markets to record peaks. In London, the London Daily Sugar Price reached a record of 360 Pounds sterling a long ton under the impact of forecasts of a world shortfall. London sugar dealers forecast to continue well into next yearAnd so it goes on. Let us have a look at the grains situation. Despite what the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party has said the Government is not responsible for the area planted or the weather. Production is expected to go up to 8,100,000 tonnes in 1974-7 5 from the production of 5,380,000 tonnes in the current year. The value for 1974-75 has been estimated at $870m compared with the $550m for the year just passed. If we were to have a look at the coarse grains, sorghum and oilseeds industries we would find that all the market prospects are quite good. As I have said, when industries have been in trouble the Government has shown an interest and also a willingness to act. The Government is determined to act where possible not in an ad hoc way but in a most rational manner. As a member of the Australian Labor Party whose electorate is partially rural I must emphasise that what I have to say in Dapto, where I receive 75 per cent of the vote, also has to be heard 20 miles away in Kangaroo Valley, where I receive 23 per cent of the vote. There is a need for the people of Australia to ensure that the protection does not result from poltiical deals or pure poltiical lobbying and pork barrelling. I believe that the resources of the leaders of farm organisations and the Country Party would be more usefully employed in promoting a higher level of economic Uteracy among the farming community than in blowing against the winds of political and economic reality or in propagandising for the return of a certain and golden age which never did exist. The Whitlam Government is opposed to ad hockery and wishes to act justly with respect to the rural sector and to accord it no special favours over any other sector of the economy. Those are the reasons why it set up the Industries Assistance Commission to give assistance and measures of protection to all industries, primary and secondary, on some rational basis. That is the reason why the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt), who is a member of another place, set up the Rural Forum and the powder, and the whole range of National Rural Advisory Council. That is the reason why the Government has brought in a Green Paper, which wiU be the first step towards the getting of some overall national rural policy. Despite what the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party has said, the Green Paper was not a series of recommendations but a series of guideUnes. The contents of the Green Paper will not be a series of recommendations until they become a White Paper. that the shonages are likely Our approach has been based on the interests of the whole rural sector and not just the people who live on farms. Perhaps the Government needs to state again and again that it does appreciate the role of primary industry, which provides 10 per cent of the total product of the country and in excess of 50 per cent of the export income with its 7 per cent of the population. In turn-if we need to state this again and again to give assurance-primar y industry needs to realise what the national economic goals are. By and large they have been set for a long time. They are economic growth and industrialisation, the main purpose of which is to get away from excessive dependence on agriculture, and to promote full employment. Those goals have been set for a longtime.They are not goals that were set by this Government. In facing this reality of national goals and in facing some true appreciation of their role in the whole approach of national policy formation, the rural sector, the rural organisations and their party representatives have, I believe, 3 options. They can change the long standing goals that governments of their own political persuasion upheld; they can accept the goals but attempt to attach some special virtue to one particular form of production; or they can accept the goals and the economic reality and take what comes in the Ught of the posiuon in the market place but ensure at aU times that the farming community gets economic justice. That is what the Government is about and that is why I reject the modon.",34
105,Mr STREET,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"It is no reflection upon the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Kerin) or the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan), who I understand is to foUow me in this debate, to say that it is a disgrace that the Government has not been able to find a Minister who is able or willing to speak on this matter of pubUc importance. It is very signincant that today we have seen a spectacle which I have never seen before in this House. We have seen the spectacle of a back bench member of Parliament leading for the Government on a matter of pubhc importance because there just is not a Minister who is competent to defend the Government. In fact, as far as I know neither of the honourable members who will speak for the Government in this debate has ever even earned his Uving off the land. The words of this motion are most important because they demonstrate at the same time the Government's ignorance and its incompetence. It is almost unbeUevable that a motion Uke this should need to be moved in an Australian Parliament. Australia as a nation is more dependent than most on export earnings. The Australian domestic economy is more dependent than most on primary industry. The fact that the Government has failed to appreciate this situation shows that it is quite out of touch with reaUty. Let us look firstly at the export earnings situation. Never has a government been as fortunate as the present Labor Government was when it came to power. Australia's balance of payments were in a sound position. The wool and meat industries were heading for bumper years. Wheat prices were at record levels. AU those factors enabled the Labor Governwhich ment to engage in huge increases in Government spending. But it forgot-o r more Ukely it never realised-that the years 1972 and 1973 were a breathing space for most primary producers and country businessmen. VirtuaUy every part Australia was seriously affected by drought tween 1965 and 1971-som e parts by the worse drought in the history of settlement. Wool growers were experiencing the lowest prices since the great depression. In 1972-73 farmers were just starting to make some impression on the crippling nnancial burden that they incurred during those earlier years and country businessmen were just starting to pick up after the financial drought caused by the weather drought and the rural recession. This was the situation when Labor came to power. But then what happened? Displaying a frightening ignorance of the problems and realities of primary industry the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), in his famous quote, asserted that farmers 'had never had it so good'. He and his Government then deUberately set about making absolutely sure that the primary producer would pay the price for having had a couple of good years. The honourable member for Macarthur said that the Government was opposed to ad hocery. I rernind him that his Government, without any inquiry by the very body which it established for the purpose-the Industries Assistance Commission-destroye d just about every incentive the farmer had to increase his production and just about every measure designed to take account of the pecuUar difficulties under which farmers have to operate. Worse than that, because of its total inabUity to understand primary industry the Government has put at risk Australia's abUity to withstand drought and national disaster and years of work by farmers on soU conservation. How can any government, every a Labor government, have been so plainly stupid? This is the crux of the situation today-the reason why the Opposition has introduced this matter of pubUc importance. The Government plainly has faUed to concern itself with the economic position of our primary producers, but the day of reckoning must come and for the Government it may not be far away. Wool prices are no longer at high levels. In fact, taking into account the astronomicalrisesin costs since this Government came to power, it is doubtful whether the price guaranteed today is any better than the disastrously low prices of a few years ago. As someone has just said, it is possibly lower. Meat has fallen by over 50 per cent. Net farm income-this is the onlyfigurein the farmer is interested-wU l probably be down by 50 per cent this year compared with last year. Yet the Prime Minister says that farmers just have 'never had it so good'. How many honourable members opposite, how many Ministers, of would like to suffer a 50 per cent reduction in betheir purchasing power in one year? How many wage and salary earners would accept such a situation? The President of the Australian Labor Party and President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and Ministers of this Government are asking unions for restraint in exorbitant wage had demands. One does not have to ask farmers whether they favour restraints in their income. They have restraints without asking for them and restraints to an extent which no other secuon of the community has had to suffer. There is an apt quotation which applies to the present position. I hope every supporter of the Government will take note ofit. It is: Realities are boring but they have a habit of catching with politicians. As a result of this Government's incompetence and its total failure to concern itself with the deteriorating position of Australia's primary producers, our international reserves are going down the drain-and going down fast. Whether Government supporters like it or not-thei r previous track record suggests that they do not like it-this Government will have to face reality. The reahty is that the Government's policies are not only sending Australian farmers broke, they are also sending Australia broke. The greatest contribution that any government can make to Austrahan industry is to provide competent and responsiblefinancialmanagement of the national economy, yet this Government has given up any attempt to tackle inflation. What else can be said about a government which brings in a Budget which assumes a rate of inflation of over 20 per cent? Which increases Government spending by 32 per cent when every sensible person in the community knows that restraint in Government spending is a must if we are to get ourselves out of the mess we are now in? Having managed to reduce a healthy prosperMacarthur, ous economy to chaos in less than 2 years, this Government is unwilling or unable-probabl y both-to take the necessary measures to get sanity back into the economy. Guess who is being called upon to bear the main burden of this incompetence? There are no prizes for guessing right, not even any prizes for getting it right time. The answer, of course, is the people who have 'never had it so good', the people at the of the line, the people who cannot pass on rises costs and who have to sell their produce at the world is prepared to pay for it-in other words, the exporter, particularly the exporter of primary products who still suppUes more than half our overseas earnings. If there had been any last hope that the Government wouldfinallycome to its senses and show some appreciation of the role of primary industry in the national economy, that hope was shattered by the Budget. It contained nothing about a farm income reserve scheme long advocated, I remind the House, by the Opposition and, in fact, supported by the Government's own committee in its Green Paper on rural poucy. It contains nothing about a long term credit facUity specifically geared to the problems of primary production, again a plank in the Opposition's rural policy. But there is something in the Budget- a capital gains tax to be levied on top of probate and estate duties. To farmers beset by sky-rocketting costs and falling up prices for their products that may be the last straw. This incompetent Government has given up any pretence at trying to overcome the economic chaos it has created. This capital gains tax finally demonstrates that the Government is determined to put so heavy a burden on the private operator that he will give up the unequal struggle and get out. That is the Government's objective because the independent operator, working for himself and his family, is the greatest obstacle this Government faces in achieving its sociaUst objectives. This is why a sturdtiy independent Australian electorate wiU throw the Government out at the next election.",36
106,Mr WHAN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"First there is one myth that needs to be laid. It was mentioned by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street). The actual situation is that both the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Kerin) and I have worked on farms, not that this really matters. I probably enjoyed more moments of concentration under a cow than the honourable member for Corangamite has ever done. As for the honourable member for he was a practising farmer until 4 years ago. The fact remains that we have both had practical experience. Herein Ues the great some difficulty under which members of the Opposition labour. Practical experience must be blended with a sensible and rational approach to the problems of the rural community. It is no first longer good enough to know the geography of the 4 teats of a cow and come here to represent end the dairying industry. One needs a Uttle more in profound knowledge than this particular piece of what information. However let us not dwell on the shortcomings so manifest in the Opposition; rather let us consider the record that this Government has established in the shorttimeit has been in office. We have had the fearmongers in the Australian Country Party tramping around the countryside generating great opposition to a government which has given more to the rural community in terms of money than any previous government. Let us examine the facts of life. Outlays on rural industries, without the major social advancements this Government is making in the present Budget for 1974-75, total $487.6m compared with $329.5m in the last Budget the previous Government brought down. In other words this Government is giving more than $150m more or half as much again as was spent by the previous Government on the agricultural sector. The net assistance, after we receive the taxes that are paid by the agricultural sector, is $309.2m compared with $283.9m in the previous Government's last Budget. After taking into account oudays and receipts this represents an increase of $ 15.4m. Mr Hewson-That is not a true figure.",37
107,Mr WHAN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"We hear the words ""That is not a Ushed true figure' from people who are more familiar with the udder of a cow than with the facts of the situation. All the honourable member needs do to confirm what I have said is to extract the relevantfiguresfrom the Budget and make his own comparisons. The Government proposes pay $ 15.4m more to the agricultural industries Australia in this Budget than the previous Government. Government did in its last Budget. Let us examine some of the other things the Government has neglect done for the agricultural sector. For thefirsttime we have placed a floor price plan in the wool market. What has the industry said about this? Mr Von Bibra, announcing the fact that the industry had reached agreement with the Government, said that this agreement $1 represented a milestone in the history of the wool industry. He added: After very many years of dissension and debate within industry and with governments we now have a commercially viable marketing proposal which can uncertainty that has been evident market. What was the attitude of the Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony) when this proposal was put earUer? On 15 November 1970 he said: I repeat what I have said is not utended to force or defy the wool market, but and to get the best and most realistic price the market pay. I am afraid those growers who believe forced-in this day of ready perhaps inferior textile substitutes-to pay a certain wool are not facing up to the realities of the situation. With those words he dismissed the proposition that we should have a fixed reserve price in wool industry. We heard the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) quoting a newspaper headline condemning the Government. ment. It was to the effect that the price of wool had slumped to 250c a kilo. It would have slumped way below that if this Government had not put a support in the market. What I am saying really grating on honourable members opposite. We have done something for the agricultural industry, and we are starting to reveal the facade of Ues that honourable members opposite are putting up before the agricultural sector. Let us look at some more steps taken by the Government. It has provided for a first advance payment to wheat growers. We dealt with this matter recently. It has also provided for an increase in credit faciUties for the Australian Wheat Board so that it can now make advances even on the second payment. The Government has introduced a dairy adjustment scheme involving the expenditure of $28m. It has estaban animal health laboratory, which the previous Government rejected. An amount of $5 6m will be spent on this laboratory to protect the Uvestock industry of this country from exotic to diseases such as foot and mouth disease. The Government has set aside $ 11.6m for an isolated chUdren's aUowance. Here comes the real rub. If to ever a government has done anything for the of rural communities in social terms, it is this It has acted after years of complete by the previous Government. Honourable members opposite are laughing. They are the people who would not give an isolated children's grant. They are more concerned about being farmers than they are about being fathers. Out of the $21m given to local government in New South Wales by the Grants Commission, lm or over 50 per cent went to the rural communities. Of the increased grant of $1,120m for roads, 58 per cent will be spent in rural areas, the compared with 49 per cent provided by the previous Government under the Commonwealth overcome the crippling aid roads scheme. in recent times in the wool",38

They are not even peanuts, because peanuts have a market price. Grants of up to $2 5 m are to the be made for unemployment relief. Most of this money will go to the rural sector.",38
110,Mr LUSHER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,That is because of unemploy,38
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Mr Berinson)Order! The honourable member for Hume has is been continually interjecting. He will cease. Mr Hewson-He is being provoked.,38
112,Mr WHAN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"He is being provoked by the facts. The point is that honourable members opposite cannot stand the truth. The Government has provided a nadonal disaster relief fund of $44.7m, and funds for the national estate. An incredible amount of money is being spend on education in the rural sectors. This was demonstrated for the benefit of the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) in my own electorate in Bega recently where he had complaints that the New South Wales Department of Education was wasting the money that the Government had given it for education. Education is certainly a matter of primary concern in rural areas and it has been given a completely new boost by this Government. In this Budget, technical education, which is of such profound importance for the rural sector of the community, will be getting the biggest injection of funds it has ever had. I turn now to one of the great and difficult problems in the country-poverty . What government has ever really faced up to this crucial and terrible problem of poverty in the country? When we took office, poverty in the rural areas was higher than it had ever been and cenainiy higher than in any other sector of our society. We now have various measures that are necessary to alleviate this poverty to some extent. The Government is providing aged people's homes and higher pensions which the Government promised will be raised to 25 per cent of average weekly income. We hear the honourable member for New England complaining about a lack of railway trucks. What hypocrisy this is. Why are the States short of railway trucks? It is because the previous Government did nothing in regard to the matter. What have we done? In the Budget we have made allowance for 500 railway trucks to be leased to the States this year and for 800 railway trucks to be leased to the States next year. Such an allowance is a tangible demonstration of our concern for what was a serious shortage of railway rolling stock when we took office. But honourable members opposite say that we are doing nothing for the country. The Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) is in the United Kingdom to protect the sugar industry. Where was the Leader of the Country Party when the crucial European economic negotiations were taking place? Australia should have been represented. What about the statement made by the Leader of the Country Party in 1971 at a symposium on national rural policy? He said: From what some people teU me, they woulcl see this as a mythical topicThat is, rural policybecause they say we haven't got a national rural policy. I suppose I could state some kind of generalised policy, but it wouldn't mean much unless we looked at it in the context of particular rural industries. We heard the honourable member for New England condemning us for the Green Paper. Time has caught up with the honourable member for New England because during the elections he caUed it an act of vandalism which was being suppressed until after the election. That is when he condemned it; now he shouts its glory. What contradictions we see in these people who do not really bother to sit down and consider in a rational way the problems of the people they are supposed to represent in the rural countryside.",39

114,Mr LES JOHNSON,ECONOMIC POSITION OF," I move: That in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969-1974, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on PubUc Works for investigation and report: Construction of a rehabilitation centre at Townsville, Queensland.

The centre will provide the following facUities: administration, amenities, medical centre, occupational therapy, vocational counselling, physiotherapy, central change block, residential patients, residential staff quarters, services area, and an open recreation area. Construction will use steel portal frames on reinforced concrete slabs, with steel stud framed waUs. External lining will be asbestos cement sheeting to walls and steel deck roofing. The buUdings wiU be partly air conditioned and partly mechanically ventilated. Windows will be aluminium framed with timber shutters for cyclone protection. Internal finishes will suit the requirements of the particular areas. Car parking will be provided and the site wiU be landscaped to suit the surrounding environment. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $2.3m at June 1974 prices. I table plans for the proposed work. Question resolved in the affirmative. LIQUEFIED GAS (ROAD VEHICLE USE) Debate resumed from 17 September (vide page 1426), on motion by Dr JF CAIRNS: That the Bill be now read a second time.",39
115,Mr DALY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate on this Bill and the Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax Collection Bill as they are related measures. Separate questions will ofcourse be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate.",40
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate of this nature? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",40
117,Mr ADERMANN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"We are deaUng today with 2 BiUs relating to Uquid petroleum gas. One is a tax BUT and the other is a tax coUection Bill. On 17 September the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) pointed out that the legislation imposes a tax on liquefied gas for the propeUing of road vehicles. This tax was foreshadowed in the Budget Speech deUvered earUer that night. The excise does not affect in any way the bulk of Uquefied petroleum gas used by the community for domestic and industrial heating, cooking and various other purposesalthough I believe that the use of this product for that purpose is something which belongs in history as it is totaUy unprocurable at this time. There is an extreme shortage in the supply of that type of Uquefied petroleum gas. This gas usually comes in the form of propane or butane, or a mixture of both. It is Uquefied compression. It is usuaUy a by-product of one 2 processes. When the Treasurer (Mr Crean) spoke last Tuesday of the way in which the tax was to be graded he referred to the costliness the distribution of Uquefied petroleum gas. As the Treasurer rightly pointed out, the cost of this product is incurred in its storage and distribution. It is a by-product of the refining process of crude oU. It is also a by-product of the process of refiin ning natural gas. The cost factors which the Treasurer and the Minister for Overseas Trade mentioned last Tuesday night are related to tribution. The high cost of estabhshing supply and distribution facUities were referred to. This why the rate of tax payable with respect to TAX BILL 1974 Uquefied gas will be increased by only SO per Second Reading cent of any future increase that may occur in the excise on petrol. One of the cost factors is the cost of transport. We know that transport costs are absolutely soaring and that this is the result largely of 2 proposals. The first is the increased excise on petrol products. Whenever any additional excise revenue is required in the form ofan indirect tax, one of the favourite targets for such a measure is petroleum products as well as tobacco, among other things. Since the Labor Government was elected in 1972 the excise on petroleum products has been increased twice. The other factor-and one on which we have protested very bitterly-is the removal of the equaUsation subsidy scheme, introduced by a Liberal-Country Party government, which kept down the price of petrol, particularly in country areas, by relating that price to city prices. It foUowed the reasonable principle that petrol prices in the country should be within 5c a gaUon of the price at ports. I believe- I repeat my earUer assertion-that the removal of the subsidy was a retrograde step. We are seeing the effects of that action in western Queensland where petrol is selUng at $1 a gallon. Such action results in transport costs becoming fearsomery high. No matter what excise is imposed on these products, transport costs are added. By the time the petroleum products leave the ports and the refineries in our capital cities, quite alarming costs are carried to purchasers in our more distant areas. At the moment, Uquid petroleum gas does enjoy a price advantage over all other forms of petroleum in Australia. Reports on this aspect conflict, but I do believe that Uquid petroleum gas is regarded as at least as efficient as petrol and other products used at present. This gas is being increasingly used in many other countries. I believe that in Australia the Commonwealth by Government has a number of cars in its car pool of in Melbourne which are run on Uquid petroleum gas and that the performance, efficiency and cost of this move is being assessed. So, this is a prodof uct in which Australia is most interested indeed. One big advantage of Uquid petroleum gas is that it causes very little, if any, air pollution. This is an important factor. One of the major worries about the level of pollution, which is increasing Australia as it is in every other country, is the pollutant effect resulting from the use of motor vehicles. As our highways and our cities become dismore and more crowded with motor vehicles, the acuteness of this problem will increase. The use is of Uquid petroleum gas has the advantage that it is non-pollutant; it does not contribute to this pollution which is an increasing worry. Therefore, the wisdom of discouraging too gready the use of liquid petroleum gas for propelling motor vehicles comes into question. The problem is a vexing one because of the advantage of and the contribution made by the use of liquid petroleum gas for this purpose. Perhaps we ought to watch what level of discouragement of the use of this gas results from the new excise charge. I hope also that the introduction of this excise on petroleum gas does not introduce a whole rosy new field by which revenue may be raised. am dehghted that the recent Budget did not include yet another increase in the excise on petrol. Such acdon would have just about pled a number of country industries and country areas, if that has not already been done. Another way of raising excise duty-that is, through Uquefied petroleum gas-ha s been discovered. I hope that this new avenue will not mean that this bution. excise will be used in future as a revenue producer in the taxadon field. I trust that thefigureswhich I read in the 1973 report of the Bureau of Transport Economics are somewhere near the mark when they state that Australia's reserves of liquid petroleum gas as October 1973 were 1,133 miUion barrels. Most those reserves came from gas reservoirs but were also from reserviors. The 2 mainfieldsare the Dampier sub-basin and off-shore Gippsland. Thosefiguresrepresent the gas direcdy recoverestic able from oil and gas reserves discovered up to that dme. At usage then assessed and at the rate is added. of extraction then assessed, the comment is made that this represented approximately 80 years supply. At present, the level of market demands for major petroleum products determines the voltrucks ume of natural gas production and the compopoUutant sition of refinery output. The quantity of Uquid petroleum gas produced as a bi-product of the operations of which I have spoken is variable. is not subject, therefore, to direct control. have had export surpluses. If it cannot be exported and it cannot be held imagine that the only alternative would be to pump the excess back into the natural reservoirs. A cost of recovery would be involved, and it would be passed on to the consumer. Motor vehicles can be adapted to use liquid petroleum gas. Indeed, Uquid petroleum gas can replace both super and standard grades of petrol, possibly with comparable efficiency, as said. The Minister for Overseas Trade may comBefore ment on this aspect: I beheve that the report from which I quoted stated that the cost of conversion of a vehicle to liquefied petroleum gas operation ranges from $400 to $600. It reported that the use of liquid petroleum gas has another advantage; it gives a very long engine life. The report spoke of 20 years. EarUer this year- I mention these figures for a purpose which I will develop later-the retail price of Uquefied petroleum gas a gallon was reported in one journal as being approximately 2 lc in Melbourne, 22c in Adelaide and 31c in Sydney. The transport costs in deuvering this prodI uct, as I noted before, add appreciably to its retaU cost. We know that the special bulk tanks which are required for storage of this gas are excriptremely expensive. This was stated rather indirectly in the speech by the Minister for Overseas Trade in introducing this measure. I think that is what he had in mind when he talked about the cost of establishing supply and distriThe cost advantage which is held by liquid petroleum gas over motor spirit and diesel fuel results almost entirely from the absence of excise duty on the sale of liquefied petroleum gas. Now an excise duty is to apply to this gas. A compariat son of wholesale prices in 1973 shows that liquid of petroleum gas, before excise, was actually marsome ginally more expensive than premium grade petrol and substantially dearer than standard grade petrol and distillate. Perhaps greater domconsumption might assist to reduce the price of Uquid petroleum gas, at least before the excise We have been advised that about 14 per cent of motor vehicles in Australia conceivably could be converted to use liquid petroleum gas. I do not know how efficient this type of propulsion is. But and transports seem to be very heavUy vehicles and if the efficiency of liquid petroleum gas is nearly comparable to that of the present fuels some encouragement or assistance It could be given to the conversion of these vehicles We to run on liquid petroleum gas. In this way we could strike a very good blow for anti-pollution in bulk storage, I in Australia. I am worried about that section of the Bill which deals with the liabuiry for and collection of tax. I am very concerned because I think that what is set out in the Bill in this respect is totally impractical and clumsy. I cannot see how on earth the proposal contained in the Bill can work without making every person who wants to use I liquid petroleum gas in his vehicle a form filler. coming to this place I was practising as a pubUc accountant and I know about the forms that had to be filled out by people on the land. I am not blaming this Government for all of them. I am not saying that the forms are unnecessary. But the number of forms required to be filled out are mounting and mounting. Much of my work as a public accountant was concerned with people who had to fill out periodic forms and returns. In many respects this was a sickening process. Therefore I am very alarmed about the way in which the Bill proposes to collect the tax. Clause 6 of the Bill states: Tax payable in respect of the use of Uquefied gas used for the purpose of propelUng a road vehicle is payable by the person who was the owner of the Uquefied gas immediately before it was so used. I take the clause to mean that the person who puts the Uquefied gas in his car and uses it is the person Uable to pay the tax. Clause 7 states: (1) Where, in any month, pose of propelling a road vehicle, the person who is liable to pay the tax m respect of the use of that liquefied gasAnd that seems to be the motoristshall, within 28 days after the close of the month or within such further period as the Comptroller, in special circumstances, allows, furnish to a Collector, in accordance with a form, and in a manner, determined by the Comptroller, a return relating to that use of the liquefied gas. (2) A person shall not furnish a return that is false leading in material particular. Penalty: $1,000. To me the proposal is absolutely clumsy and impractical. As I have said, I am alarmed at this section of the Bill. I do not think that what the Bill proposes in this respect will encourage people to convert their cars to the use of liquid petroleum gas. I know that this will be a difficult tax to coUect. I concede that. I have thought about the coUection of the tax and I think that responsibUity for paying the tax should be in the hands of the distributor. I think that the distributor should be required to make the necessary returns. Mention can be made of the tax on distillate. When primary producers purchased distillate from a suppUer they filled in a form on which they stated their exemption number and specified that the fuel was to be used for primary production purposes and they received an exemption from the tax. The procedure in this case is somewhat reversed. The bulk of Uquid petroleum gas in common use-onc e again, if one can get it-is contained in bottles for domestic use and does not come within the ambit of this legislation. Therefore we are talking about a smaU proportion of Uquid petroleum gas which will be affected by the Bill. I do not think many motorists will be happy or enthusiastic about having to sit down every 28 days to make out their returns, especiaUy when they know that if they do not fill in a return or if the return is false or misleading-intentionaU y or otherwise-the y wiU be confronted with what is quite a massive penalty of $ 1,000.1 think that this sort of penalty could be appUed to compames and distributors. But it seems to me to be a pretty vicious tax to impose on a motorist. I know that this is a Budget Bill. Therefore we on the Opposition side have to look at it responsibly in considering what amendments we might want to make. I have tried to point out that the legislation before us is a stupid and clumsy way of doing things. I think that the onus is on the wrong person and in the wrong place. The Opposition is accused of obstruction whenever it points out the deficiencies. The Bill before us is Uquefied gas is used for the puranother example of what has happened so often in the Ufe of this Government where ill thought out legislation, such as this, has been introduced into the House. On occasions we have even had examples of sloppy drafting. Often a good Bill has been the result of Opposition amendments which have finally been accepted by the Government. I do not think that we ought to write the BUls for the Government. So I hope that the Minor misister will give us some assurance that he will have a look at the matters to which I have drawn attention and that he will devise some other way of collecting this levy and not make the motorist or the user responsible. I think that those people who are competent, and have the staff and can understand these things, should be the people whose responsibUity it is to pay the levy and furnish the forms. As I have pointed out, I think that this section of the Bill is clumsy and inequitable. I think that this fault should be looked at. I think that Uquid petroleum gas should be used to a greater extent for the propulsion of motor vehicles from the point of view not only of reducing pollution but also as an alternative fuel to petrol which has become so dear and which has been hamstrung with transport cost difficulties. In vast areas of Queensland, particularly in areas in which primary producers are trying to harvest or plant their crops, petrol and distillate is not avaUable. Many areas do not have the fuel to run school buses. Some industry has been brought to a standstill because of the complete lack of fuel in Queensland and in northern New South Wales. This matter was covered very effectively and properly the other day. It is not the Opposition's intention to spend a great deal of time delaying, obstructing or opposing this Bill. I think that I have made the point that I wanted to put forward. I am glad to see that the Government has shown some resshift traint in the Bill in regard to the rate at which tax on liquid petroleum gas will rise. It has dehere cided that the rate of tax payable on Uquefied gasverted. used in motor vehicles will be increased by SO per cent of any increases of petrol excise may occur in that period. Might I express the vent hope that any increase in petrol excise in any period will be minimal or non-existent. I again appeal to the Minister to have a look at Part II of the Bill which deals with UabiUty for and coUection of tax. Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9 covered in this section of the Bill. I ask the Minis-have ter to have a look at the clumsiness of the cedure by which the tax is to be collected see whether something which is more just, fair and equitable can be worked out. This section the Bill alarms me. I criticise it very strongly firmly. But in other respects we will not offer opposition or obstruct the Bill in any way.",40
118,Mr WENTWORTH,ECONOMIC POSITION OF," I think that this is a bad Utde Bill. It is it wiU have the effect of preventing the sion of road vehicles to Uquefied petroleum gas. think also that it is not a Bill of tremendous nificance, although it may have more sigthink nificance than would appear atfirstsight. are 2 reasons why we should see that progressinterested ively road vehicles are converted from petrol Uquefied petroleum gas, particularly in the capithe tal cities. Thefirst,a minor reason perhaps, is that by so doing we would reduce our present dependence upon imported fuel. I think that minor reason because there are other uses any LPG which we produce, most of which being exported mainly to Japan. The major reason is that the Bill is a blow against the antiIt poUution campaign. It is an outrage on the environment. This is particularly true of the tal cities. One of the great troubles about the use of motors in capital cities, in large congregations population, is the possible smog and poUution that they cause. This can be devastating as it been, for example, in Los Angeles on the Califor-price nian coast of the United States. It could be Sydney and I think in Melbourne also. Perhaps poUution has not yet reached devastating proand portions, but it is something which gives concernis and which inevitably is associated with the inter-lution. nal combustion engine. In the future I hope that more and more of our transport in the cities be performed by something other than the pritables vate car powered by an internal combusuon engine. Perhaps a greater shift to public transport would be desirable. A greater shift towards electric vehicles would be desirable. towards electric vehicles is not, in practical the terms, avaUable at present. The technology is for some, but not for all, vehicles to be cononly If we convert from petrol to LPG we can use thatour existing vehicles. The conversion is a comfer-paratively minor matter with perhaps something of the order of $400 being required. But the existing vehicle can be used and the existing type of vehicle can be used. There are small penalties. In particular there is the loss in a car of some of the are boot space by reason of the larger tanks that to be instaUed, although I think that probproably with good design we can get over at least and tosome or aU of that trouble. of Mr JAMES - What country is leading in this? and Mr WENTWORTH- I am unable to answer my honourable friend. Perhaps he will tell us later in the debate.",43
119,Mr JAMES,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I was not being rude. I was asking bad becausewhat country is leading in this. conver Mr WENTWORTH-Frankl y I do not know. II only know the way in which we should go. I am sig-glad the honourable member is interested. I it is constructive to take an interest in what There is going on elsewhere, but I am primarily in what we should do in Australia. to What we should do in Australia is to encourage conversion of city used vehicles particularly, because it is in the cities that the control of pollution is important. We should encourage the is aconversion of petrol driven vehicles to use for Uquefied petroleum gas. This Bill discourages is that. That is why it is a bad Uttle Bill. is said, perhaps, that the revenue is needed. The existing revenue is not needed because the capiexisting use of LPG for vehicles is minimal and not enough to affect the position. If we are talking of future revenue through the expansion of the use of LPG in vehicles the Bill is bad because of it is reducing the possibUity of that conversion. I think this is a serious matter. If we have to forego hasrevenue that is a proper price-it is a very small in terms of dollars-to pay for the bad inimprovement of the environment and for the improvement of Uving conditions in our cities centres of population where the car exhaust the main contributor towards atmospheric polI think aU honourable members will be famiUar with the material that was put out by our willown Bureau of Transport Economics last April, 7, 8 and 9 of which set out exhaust emissions. One can see the tremendous decrease in exhaust pollution if LPG rather than petrol is used. Perhaps I am unfair in selecting this examThe ple from the Bureau's ownfigures,but a Chevrolet using petrol will produce an index figure of 39.6 for carbon monoxide. That figure falls to 2.9 when LPG is used- a most significant decrease. I admit that I have chosen from the table a rather dramaticfigure,but in general one can say that by using LPG we can probably reduce atmospheric pollution by a factor of two or three, and that is important.",43
120,Mr JAMES,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Coul d it be used in aircraft?,44
121,Mr WENTWORTH,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I am not in a position to say. I do not think so, but I am not in a position to turn my mind to that. Aircraft are not terribly important for the cities. They travel over larger areas and longer distances. What we want to get at is the car which is polluting in the city itself. is polluting down at ground level where the emission is most likely to affect human beings. If we are serious about improving the environment we should be thinking in terms of encouraging in every way the conversion to LPG of petrol driven vehicles, particularly in the capital cities. I think the Government has been a Utde weak, perhaps, in giving way here to Treasury advice. I remember that when I was a Minister in a previous government the Treasury brought forward a proposal for the Budget that we should introduce similar measures. The Liberal-Country Party Government rejected that proposal, as it should have. It would have given more revenue but we really beUeved in preserving the environment. Consequendy we acted in the way we did and did not adopt the Treasury proposal for this rather regressive and undesirable tax. One of the worse features of this Bill is that referred to by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Adermann)-the method of collection. In the Committee stage I shall move an amendment which is directed to curing that particular defect in the Bill. The amendment has been circulated and I think it is now on the table of the House for people to see.",44
122,Unknown,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.1S p.m.,44
123,Mr WENTWORTH,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Before the luncheon recess I was pointing out that it was entirely desirable that we should encourage the conversion of city motor cars to the use of LPG for the purpose of avoiding or minimising pollution. Of course this is particularly important for vehicles like taxis which do a large mileage in the cities. These Bills that are before lis discourage that conversion and as such they are a blow at all the aspirations of the environmentalists and those who believe that the conditions of Ufe in the cities should be improved. The amount of money to be raised by these BUls is not in itself so important. The tax to be imposed is 2 cents per litre. As honourable members will remember there are AVi Utres to one gaUon. The tax itself is not big. But what is a real deterrent to conversion is the method of collection. I draw the attention of the House particularly to the provisions of clauses 6 and 7 of the Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax CoUection Bill. Under these clauses-it is almost incredible-the Government is proposing that every owner of a vehicle which uses LPG should have to put in a monthly return of the amount that he has used. Now I ask you, what would a car owner whose car runs on petrol think if he had to put into the Government a monthly return every month of how much petrol he had It used during that month? He would have to take a dipping of his tank at the start of the month and a dipping ofhis tank at the end of the month and tot up how much he bought at every garage. The thing is incredible. But this is what the Government is asking the man who has converted to LPG to do. Just look at the provisions of clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill. If he does not do this, if he furnishes 'a return that is false or misleading in any material particular', he is Uable to a fine of $ 1,000. This is not something to be sneezed at. Perhaps the Government has inserted this provision in the Bill inadvertently or by mistake. I am wUling to give the Government the credit of beUeving that it has acted not through malice but simply through incompetence. Embedded in this legislation is a clause which makes it almost impossible for the ordinary man who owns a vehicle in the city to convert to LPG. I do not know whether this is the purpose of the Bill. I do not think it is. I do not think the Government knew what it was doing. It has simply included in the Bill this quite unworkable provision. I ask anybody who is thinking of converting to LPG whether it is worth going to this trouble in order to avoid this proposed penalty of $1,000. Really, one would have thought that the Government, which professes to be environmentally minded, would have avoided putting this kind of thing into a Bill. There is an alternative. I shall propose an amendment to the House which will get over this bad feature of the Bill. This is a matter which will be dealt with in Committee and I shall speak to it in detaU in Committee. My proposal is in essence this: That in place of paying this tax on the LPG used motorists should have the option, if they want to, of paying annually an amount of, say $30 tax in advance for the vehicle for the year. This amount is based on the average use of a vehicle of 5,000 or 6,000 mUes a year. If you calculate the LPG required, remembering that there are approximately 4Vi litres to the gallon and theestablishing tax on a litre is to be 2c, the tax comes to a little under $30. So this provides for the average vereflects hicle to pay an amount that is just about a line ball; it neither reduces nor increases the tax ility. But it will be said, with some justice: Whatcost about the people who use their vehicles a lot? Will they not get out of the tax? Yes, I hope theyin will. It is the owners who use their vehicles a the city whom one wants to help, particularly drivers. One would hope that taxis, which are one of the main polluters in the city, would able to convert to LPG andfindit economical toperspective. do so under this kind of arrangement. If a taxi converts to LPG it will lose some of its boot space. I am afraid this might be inevitable. I hope it will not be, but I am afraid that the tank will take up a fair bit of the boot. I hope we will have a look at that problem. But one shouldwhich encourage people like taxi drivers in the city to convert to the use of LPG and one should give financial incentive to do so. The Government is spending large amounts of money on the environment, and rightly so. We approve this; we applaud it. But the dollar lost forgoing a little revenue on LPG which a taxi might use would be very much more productivewill in terms of improving on the environment than the average dollar that the Government ing under this heading. As I have said, when we get to the Committee stage I shall move my amendment. I hope it will commend itself to Government. It is something which will not really much affect revenue one way or the otherdrew but I think that it will remove from the Bill obnoxious effect of clauses 6 and 7 which in present form virtually make it impracticable most people to convert their vehicles from petrolfor to LPG. Again, from the point of view of the environmentalist this is what we want to encour-very age in the centre of the cities where the motor exhaust emissions are one of the main sources atmospheric pollution.",44
124,Dr JF CAIRNS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"in reply-The Liquefied Gas nobody of (Road Vehicle Use) Tax Bill and the Liquefied would be. Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax Collection Bill are for Fisher that not difficult Bills so it has not bate them. There are one or two points that have to be made at the conclusion bate. The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Adermann) suggested that the Government twice increased petrol excise. This is not Government increased petrol excise once-in August 1973 Budget. He referred also to the Government being aware of the high cost of see supply and distribution faculties for liquefied gas. The cost of transport of LPG mainly the cost of the pressure vehicles that have to be used in the transport of LPG. liab-That is the main cost problem at present. The of converting a car which uses petrol to a car which uses LPG is the other main cost standing the way of a shift to the use of LPG. They are very considerable costs. lot in The formula relationship between the tax on taxipetrol and the tax on LPG, which is present in this legislation, is a ratio which the Government be dunks puts the 2 products in their proper The tax on petrol is 22.3c and the tax on LPG is 9.09c. Whether one is concerned with the prevention of pollution, the conservation of resources, or any other matter of this kind, some LPGkind of relationship between the two has to be estabUshed. It is not necessarily a relationship in the tax on petrol goes up and up while there is no tax at all on LPG. It is as desirable to aconserve the resources from which petrol comes as it is desirable to preserve LPG. The important thing is the ratio between the 2 products, and a nil ratio to arisingpetrol tax is not necessarily the best position, particularly when a very high proinportion of fuel for the greater number of motor vehicles in the country comes from petrol, and it have to come from petrol for a long time ahead because of the cost of transport of LPG is spend-and the cost of conversion to LPG. The important thing here is that everybody the knows that a tax on LPG is likely. This was proposed by a previous government and it withfrom that position. I am not sure why it did the so. The industry knew that a tax on LPG was theirUkely and the industry wanted to know what the for future would be. So in order to aUow planning the future in what is a very expensive industry-it wiU remain a very expensive industry for a longtime-the Government has said that carthis tax will be imposed and will not be increased offor 5 years. There will therefore be a 5-year period in which the industry can be certain as to amount of tax. While it was zero, and partly because what the previous Government did, could be certain about what the tax I point out to the honourable member for a longtimethe most expantaken long to desion that wiU occur I think city areas because ofintransport the use of LPG will be in costs and other of this de-costs of this kind. had The honourable member for MackeUar (Mr so. TheWentworth) suggested that the Government the should promote the use of LPG in city cars in order to reduce pollution. We would all Uke to less poUution, but I think there is a practical view to be taken here. I have said that according to the advice we have the use of LPG will increase slowly because of the cost of transport and the cost of conversion. Motorists will not readily convert to LPG provided they can get petrol at a cost which is comparable with the present cost. We recognise that emissions from petrol consuming motor vehicles will be reduced at a fairly rapid rate. A program has been undertaken in this regard which will bring down the level of motor vehicle emissions fairly significantly. They will be brought down fairly significantly at what is beheved to be a relatively lower cost than the cost of converting to LPG a private motor vehicle fleet in the city, either as exists or in new cars. The alternative is to convert cars at a cost of $300 to $ 1,000 per car and hundreds of garages with pressure facdities to sell gas. This would be a very costly and long term process. Do not imagine that we should say: 'Let us move into this area in order to deal with pollution'. The more practical thing to say is: 'Let us deal with motor cars that will be using petrol for a long time if we want to deal with pollution'. I think the idea put forward by the honourable member for Mackellar looks logical enough, provided one does not appreciate the significance of the cost factors in moving to LPG and the time that it is likely to take. The amendment to be moved by the honourable member for Mackellar is not acceptable to the Government. The Opposition has suggested that the method of the collection of the tax is clumsy. This conclusion, no doubt, comes from a comparison with the way in which the tax on petrol is collected. But do not forget that petrol comes from supphers that are relatively few in number and is sold to consumers that are very large in number, whereas in the case of LPG only about 5 per cent that is used is used by private car owners; 90 per cent of it or more is used by fleet owners. There will be relatively few users of LPG, and it is these people who will be taxed. To apply the same system of tax collection as is applied to the motorists using petrol would be clumsy and unmanageable. Opposition speakers have decided that the proposed system of tax collection is clumsy because they have not recognised the circumstances of the distribution and use of LPG as compared with the circumstances of the distribution and use of petrol. It is a fact that there will be real savings for those users who have converted because of the distances that they are able to travel. Conversion of motor vehicles to LPG will be much more feasible for the commercial user than for the private motorist because he will be able to spread the $300 or $1,000 which is the cost of conversion. So it is likely that there will be much more development of commercial use than of private use in the cities. The amendment circulated would limit tax liability to 1,500 litres of gas per vehicle. That volume of gas would get a delivery truck less than 5,000 miles in the city, and such a truck would travel as much as 60,000 miles a year. So if we adopt the amendment we would be taxing people on 5,000 miles out of the 60,000 miles that they might happen to travel. Again this seems quite an unrealistic approach to what is actually happening. If it is the Opposition's intention not to penalise private motorists by requiring them to send monthly cheques for it small amounts, then I do not think they give the Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator install Murphy) and the Comptroller-General of Customs and Excise much credit. The honourable member for Mackellar knows that the Minister does not work out the details of these things and the way in which they are applied. They are worked out by officials who have a practical knowledge of these matters. When the honourable member says something about the Government not knowing the facts, what he is really saying is that the officials do not know the facts. I think the honourable member knows that because he has been a Minister himself and he knows how the system works. On a lighter note, when the honourable member said that this is a bad little Bill I thought he may have been talking about himself. But, no, I do not think it is bad when the practical factors involved are considered. I do not intend to delay the House any longer. I think that the points made by Opposition speakers should be taken into account, particularly as they are related to the future use of both petrol and LPG in relation to the conservation of resources and in relation to pollution. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Dr JF CAIRNS) read a third time. LIQUEFIED GAS (ROAD VEHICLE USE) TAX COLLECTION BILL 1974 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 17 September (vide page 1426), on motion by Dr JF CAIRNS: That the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Clauses 1 to 5-by leave-take n together, agreed to. Clause 6 (Persons liable to pay tax).",45
125,Mr WENTWORTH,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I owner want to take this opportunity of pointing out to the Committee the impact of clause 6 so that what I say on clause 7 and on my proposed new is clause 7A wiU be understandable. Clause Tax payable in respect of the use of liquefied gas used for the purpose of propelling a road vehicle is payable by the person who was the owner of the liquefied gas immediately before it was so used. That clause means that the person who is the that owner of the gas in the tank of the vehicle which cernedupwith uses it is Uable for the tax. That is what the clausecerned with what says, and the impact of it wiU become more apMinister to hide behind parent when we speak on clause 7 in just wanted to draw the attention of the Comdoing a moment ago. Forget not mittee to the impact and meaning of clause 6. Clause agreed to. Clause 7 (Returns).",47
126,Mr WENTWORTH,ECONOMIC POSITION OF," down Clause 7 reads: 7. (1) Where, in any month, liquefied gas is used purpose of propelling aroadvehicle, the person who to pay the tax in respect of the use of that liquefied is, the person in whose tank the close of the month or within such further period Comptroller, in special circumstances, allows, furnish Collector, in accordance with a form, and in a manner, mined by the Comptroller, a return relating to that use liquefied gas. (2) A person shall not furnish a return that is false leading in a material particular. Penalty: $1,000. Clause 7 is a clumsy clause which I think developed. invaUdates aU the purposes of the Government in bringing this Bill down. I must agree with Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) that it would not be possible to apply to Uquefied gas the same manner of excise collection as is pUed in relation to petrol. I have never said that was possible, and I tliink the Minister was rather raising up a bogey in order to knock it down when he made the suggestion that any such thought was in my mind or indeed in the mind of any member of the Opposition. The Opposition does not believe that it is possible to collect excise on Uquefied gas for road use in the same way one coUects excise on petrol, but it does not low that because this is so we should adopt this rather clumsy expedient which the Government has put forward. What the Government is sayterms ing, in point of fact-and there is reaUy no cretion with the collector in this regard because special circumstances are not the same as a In Committee general amnesty-is that the collector has to have and a monthly return. The monthly return has to be in accordance with a form and the form has to specify how much Uquefied gas was used on the road during that time.There is no way for the who is doing this on a monthly basis to find this out except by keeping a detaUed account of what he has put into his tank, looking at what in his tank at the start of the month and what is 6 reads:in his tank at the end of the month. So what the Government is providing in this Bill in so many words is administratively ridiculous. It is no good for the Minister to say I am simply saying that the officials who drew the Bill are inefficient. I am not conwho drew up the Bill; I am conis in the Bill. It is no use for the his officials in this way a moment. land say it is their fault and his, as he was who drew up this Bill. The Government is responsible for it and the Government has brought it into the Parliament, and I say it is adminstratively ridiculous. The effect of this is going to be to stop or slow the conversion to LPG. The Minister was perfectly right a moment ago when he said that it for the would be only a slow conversion, that there were is liable costs involved. Of course there are costs ingas-that volved, and ofcourse it will be a slow conversion, it is-shall , within 28 days after as the but that is a reason for endeavouring to speed it to a up, not a reason for endeavouring to slow it deterdown. I think he does the Opposition a little less of the credit when he faUs to appreciate that it was we who said at the start that it was the city that was or misimportant as far a pollution was concerned. It is really only in the city that these deUvery points for Uquefied petroleum gas are likely to be the The Minister is quite right when he says the transport costs are big, but he is quite wrong when he says that there have to be hundreds of apdeUvery points in the city. For example, with a it taxifleet-and the taxifleetswould be the ones to be looked at particularly-ther e would have to be only a few distribution points. Because the owner of a vehicle is dependent on distribution points he will not convert to LPG if there is not a distribution point handy. That means that the conversion is going to be confined more or less to as the city, for thetimebeing at any rate. I regard folthe matter of conversion to LPG as a transition stage only. I hope that in 20 or 30 years, perhaps less, we will be talking, at least for the cities, in of electric vehicles which are entirely poldislution free. But thattimeis not yet, and for the present we have got to rely on the conversion in the cities, for those cars which use the centre of the city so much, to a form of propulsion which does not give the same amount of pollution as the petrol engine does now. With existing technology-and I believe this is only a transitional phase-that means going to LPG. If we were to provide only that taxis and buses were to convert to LPG we would be reducing significantly the poUution occurring in the centres of the cities. UnhappUy, we are not going to do away entirely with the pollution caused by automobile exhausts in the centre of our cities. But at least we should take sensible measures to reduce it. I think that the Minister for Overseas lost the point entirely when he said: 'This help the vehicles used on long distance runs pay something less than they would have to pay if the fuU excise applied'. That is true enough. But is it not a smaU price to pay for improving the about. environment and for reducing atmospheric pollution in the cities? Of course it is. The Government quite rightly- I praise the Government for it-is saying that it is spending money on reducin ing poUution and improving the environment. am aU for that. But the amount of revenue it would forgo by letting a vehicle refrain from paying the amount it otherwise would have to pay in excise above the $30 I have suggested would be more than made up by the saving in the amount it is spending on measures to improve the environment. The Government is being quite stupid in this regard. I have said how I worked out thefigureof $30. Thatfigurein itself is not sacrosanct; it is the principle that is sacrosanct. there has to be a method of collection it should here. be one which does not impose on the motorist who converts to LPG the same kind of penalty as is involved in the Bill. If the Government wants to up the amount to $50 that is me, but for heaven's sake it should not let the Bill go through the Parliament in its present form becase. cause if that were to happen it would be the death kneU to conversion to LPG. Surely not want that to happen as atmospheric poUution from automobUe exhausts is a real problem in our inner cities and our great concentrations of populations.",47
127,Mr ADERMANN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I am wonpresent dering whether the Minister for Overseas Trade would be prepared to answer one question when he is replying to the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth). If he were to do so would save time. In speaking to clause 7 the ister may have missed the point that I did recogthe nise that there was a difference between petrol, distillate and LPG in relation to the small user group. The Minister said that there was some cretion or that the way in which the officers adniinistered the legislation was going to be important. I gathered the impression that he meant that perhaps we might get away from the system of lodging monthly returns. The question I would like to ask of him relates to clause 7 and the reference to what is to happen 28 days after the close of a month. The only variation is to be 'in special circumstances'. Respectfully I ask: Does that give any discretion to the ComptroUer-to the Department of Customs and Excise-to aUow any leeway in that respect? Does it not lay down that there is something mandatory about the returns being submitted Trade every 28 days? Can we get away from the will requirement to submit monthly returns? The to Minister understood the point that was made that this was something we wanted to avoid and that this was something that we were concerned",48
128,Dr JF CAIRNS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,There are 2 discretions-on e clause 7 and one in clause 8. The first one is in I relation to the Comptroller who is required to collect the tax on a monthly return basis. I have pointed out that this is the standard practice throughout the community in relation to sales tax. There are many thousands of payers of sales tax who have to furnish monthly returns. It has been accepted as being a desirable practice over many years that these things not be allowed to run on and that the period for which the return is made should be relatively short. That has been If the long standing practice. There is a discretion,48
129,Mr GRAHAM,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"It is the businessman who puts in such a return, but in this case it is the purfair enough with chaser, is it not?",48
130,Dr JF CAIRNS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,It is the purchaser in this,48
131,Mr GRAHAM,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,But not in the other case to we do which the Minister referred.,48
132,Dr JF CAIRNS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"No. But a businessman has no less trouble in that respect. In fact, he might have a good deal more. I do not know whether the honourable member for North Sydney was in the chamber when I pointed out that the users of 95 per cent of the LPG used are small in number and that they use a great deal. The economics of the situation are such that only it long run commercial users can afford to spread Minthe overheads of the conversion. That is where situation is at the moment. So we are dealing predominantly with a relatively small number of people. I should think that the special circumdisstances would be reasonably applied and that where normal use is going on monthly returns would be required. But if there is any departure from that normality I should think that the Comptroller would apply the legislation quite liberally. It is the intention of the collection that it be maintained on a monthly basis. Clause 8 reads: A person liable to pay tax in respect of the use of gas shall pay the tax within the period within which he is required under section 7 to that use or within such further period as the Comptroller, in special circumstances, allows. Mr Adermann-It was not the tax actually.",48
133,Dr JF CAIRNS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,There is a discretion in both cases. Where normal use of the gas is the case the monthly period will be expected to be apphed. But where there is something that is not normal I am quite sure that the legislation will be apphed with reasonable uberahty. I think that what the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has just said in relation to the amendment was covered in his remarks in the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I do not think there is anything further that I should add at this stage.,49
134,Mr WENTWORTH,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I thank the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Cairns) for his remarks, but I do not think that he has helped the argument terribly much. I wish firstly to look at the detaUs of clause 7 and of clause 8, which has not yet been before us for consideration but which the Minister mentioned. There are, as he said, 2 discretions given to the ComptroUer.",49
135,The CHAIRMAN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Order! I suggest to the honourable member for Mackellar that he deal only with clause 7 and that he wait until the Committee is considering clause 8 before he deals with it.,49
136,Mr WENTWORTH,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I simply say that the Minister mentioned clause 8 earUer and that I am taking up only what he said and answering him. According to clause 7 the ComptroUer has a discretion, but only to extend the period within which the monthly return must be furnished. Let us have a look at it. Clause 7 begins with the words 'Where, in any month'. It is in respect of any use within that month that within 28 days or within some further period as the ComptroUer, in special circumstances, aUows that a return has to be furnished. So under the drafting of clause 7 of the BUT which we are now considering-n o regulations can be made which do not conform with the drafting of the Bill-the ComptroUer has a discretion only to extend the period within which the monthly return has to be furnished. He has no discretion to dispense with the furnishing of a monthly return. That is a part of the bad drafting of the Bill. I do not think it is what the Minister intended because it was not what was implied in the Minister's speech. He does not seem to have read carefuUy thefineprint in his own Bill. The Minister is perfectlyrightwhen he talks liquefied about monthly returns with respect to sales tax but my friend the honourable member for North furnish a return with respect to Sydney (Mr Graham) wasrighton the point in his interjection when he said that sales tax was paid by a businessman and not by a private owner. There is another point: Sales tax is compulsorily payable but conversion from the use of petrol to Uquefied petroleum gas is not compulsory. The businessman has no option about whether he wiU pay sales tax but the owner of a vehicle which is run on petrol has an option as to whether he wiU convert to the use of LPG. We want him to exercise that option. We want to encourage him to do so. This clause, as it has been drawn, does not encourage him to do so; it discourages him because he will say to himself: ' If l make this conversion I will have to fill in all these damn forms every month and I will be up for aU sorts of paper work so the game is not worth the candle'. I appreciate that one cannot apply the petrol excise principles. If there were no other solution perhaps the Government's solution would have to be accepted, but there is another solution-the solution I put forward in my proposed amendment. I have not yet formally moved my amendment. WUl you advise me, Mr Chairman, whether I should formally move it now or wait until we have disposed of this clause?",49
137,The CHAIRMAN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,The honourable member should move his amendment after we have disposed of this clause.,49
138,Mr WENTWORTH,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,I will do so. Clause agreed to. Proposed new clause 7A.,49
139,Mr WENTWORTH,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I move: That the following new clause be inserted in the Bill: 7A. when any person who is Uable to pay tax under this Act has paid an amount of 30 doUars by way of tax in advance and has nominated a vehicle in respect of such payment, then, for the remainder of the financial year during which such advance payment has been made, he shaU be exempt from obUgation for funher tax or return in relation to the use of Uquefied gas in such vehicle. This is a carefuUy drawn clause which confines the concession always to one vehicle. It is not suggested that under this clause the owner of a fleet of vehicles should get away with the payment of $30 for his wholefleet.However, in my view, $30 a vehicle is a fair thing. If the Government does not think $30 is a fair thing let it suggest $50 or some other sum it considers desirable. It will be no skin off my nose if it wishes to do that, but for heaven's sake let us have some amendment which does not erect, as this Bill erects, a formidable administradve barrier to discourage people from converting their vehicles from petrol to liquid petroleum gas. I suggest that this is of particular import when one considers the owners of vehicles which travel large mileages in central city areas. These are the people we should encourage to convert their vehicles to the use of LPG because it is in the city centres where there is a heavy vehicle population with a heavy population of people breathing vehicles emissions. It is in city areas that we want to convert to the use of LPG. We should encourage such conversion in this decade or so as a transitional period to the future use of electric driven vehicles, which, I am sure, will eventually come but which will not take over a major role as yet. I beheve that even with present technology our inner city buses should be electric but one cannot hope with present technology to get a major conversion to electric private vehicles or even to electric taxis. For this reason I suggest a flat rate of payment, whether it be $30, $40, $50 or whatever figure the Government suggests to satisfy the insatiable requirements of the Treasury. Let the Government suggest a figure it considers fair and which allows for some administrative simplicity. Under the Bill as drawn by the Government, the owner of every vehicle-it might be even worse than that because the user of every vehicle is the person who is liable to pay the tax if owns the gas in its tank at the time-ha s to make a return. No discretion at all resides with the comptroller which will save a person from makeach ing that monthly return. The Comptroller only extend the time in which a person can subtogether, mit the return. As the Minister said, under clause 8- 1 make this passing reference to clause 8 in the same way as the Minister did-al l that the Comptroller can do is to extend thetimefor payment. He cannot waive the payment or do anything like that because such provision is not made in the Bill and it would be contrary to Bill if he were to do so. I suggest that the Governitself ment swallow its pride for once and accept a reasonable amendment which does not strike at revenue; it really leaves the total revenue tually unaffected. It may even increase it, but it only a few dollars one way or the other. But this is not a question of dollars; it is a question administrative impediments in this Bill. Whether the Government means it- I give it the credit of not meaning it-thes e administrative impediments will seriously retard the already slow conversion of inner city vehicles from petrol drive to LPG drive. The Government has pretentions about being environmentally minded. No real money is involved in this amendment. No inequity is involved. Why cannot the Government swallow its pride for once and accept a reasonable amendment? If it wants to put up the ante from the $30 I suggest-this has been worked out on what the average vehicle owner would pay under the Government's proposal-let it do so, but whatever it does do not let us have the Bill in its present form. An alternative is available. Why does the Government not avail itself ofit instead of doing what it is doing now-presentin g us with a Bill which by its administrative complexity is effectively retarding what we should all want, namely, the quicker conversion of petrol-driven vehicles in the inner city areas to LPG. I give the Government credit for not meaning what it has done.",49
140,Dr JF CAIRNS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) often speaks in this place with a condescending self righteousness that I find is never of assistance to him in getting his point across. The discretion about which he has been talking with respect to clause 7 is a discretion that the Comptroller-General will exercise wisely. The Comptroller-General is a responsible public servant who is accustomed to exercising discretions of this sort, especially in the collection of taxes Uke the diesel taxes. The he worth)honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentmisreads the discretion altogether. The Comptroller-General must receive a return for month's usage, but he has a discretion to can ask, for example, that returns be lodged say, only twice or four times a year. Returns for January, February and March may be lodged simultaneously in April and so on for the next quarter. Perhaps the honourable member for Mackellar does not know it, but that is a common practice. The words 'special circumstances' are the specially directed at smaU users. Small use in would be a special circumstance. If the few very motorists who are using Uquefied petroleum gas at present are using small quantities each month, virthat situation would constitute special circumis stances to allow the period for lodging returns to be extended. 1 point out that the discretion can of the be appUed in 2 ways. Returns for a number of months may be submitted together at one time or the period in which small users shall submit a return may be extended. That is how 'special drcumstances' would be interpreted in practice. The last point about the honourable member's amendment is the one I mentioned in referring to his amendment. If there is to be a tax on LPG we cannot accept an amendment which cuts down the number of rniles on which tax may be levied for the LPG used by the average commercial user from 60,000 miles to about 5,000 miles. In other words, the honourable member wants us to tax about 8 per cent of the average use of LPG. That would make a farce of the legislation. You either have the tax or you do not have it.",50
141,Mr WENTWORTH,ECONOMIC POSITION OF," I hesitate to correct the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) on points of law, but really what he has said to the Committee today is not only misleading, but is also, I am afraid, totally wrong. I am quite aware of the practice of the Comptroller-General in certain circumstances to have monthly returns deferred and submitted in a bunch of three or four or six. But this does not get away from the difficulty that they have to be monthly returns. The Minister is absolutely wrong when he says that 'special circumstances' might be interpreted so as to enable the small user to put in one return every 6 months or so, if I correctly recall what he said. This is not so under the drafting of the Bill. Under the Bill as drafted, the Comptroller has no such discretion. If this is what the Minister means, the Bill is wrongly drafted and the drafting should be corrected while we have time to do it. I refer to clause 7 (1). I think the Minister perhaps a httle out of order in rehashing a clause which we have already passed, but I will answer him only in relation to the matters which he himusing self has brought up. Clause 7 (1 ) states that where, in any month, the tax falls due there shall be a form submitted within 28 days after close of that month or within such further period quickly. as the Comptroller, in special circumstances, allows. Under the Bui as drafted, the Comptroller has no discretion to dispense with monthly forms. He can, it is true, in special circumstances say that monthly forms can be submitted in block, but he has no discretion-the Minister quite wrong in law-to say a small user need put in one return every 6 months or so. I differ little from the Minister in respect of the meaning of the phase 'in special circumstances'. Most the users will be small users. The Minister reckoned that special circumstances apply to perhaps 75 per cent or 80 per cent of the payers and that ordinary circumstances apply the other 20 per cent also. That is not my way of reading an Act of Parliament. The Minister should really be more precise in matters of law. He probably had not hadtimeto read the fine print of this Bill until he came into the House. I know he is busy; he has many other concerns in and out of this Parliament. I do not blame him for not having had time to read the fine print but I blame him for standing up in this Parliament and saying things which are, in point of fact, untrue. His interpretation of the law in respect of the small user-Hansar d will show what he said-is wrong. That is all that can be said about the Minister's interpretation. He is just plain wrong. I have to repeat what I said earUer because the Minister has repeated himself in this regard. I do not object to the fact that the big user in the town will get a Uttle bit of extra concession for converting to LPG because it is the big user in the town who, if he is using petrol, is the big polluter. What we should be concerned with now above eveiything else is doing something effective which will as quickly as possible reduce atmospheric pollution in our main city streets. I have seen readings referring to George Street, Castlereagh Street and Pitt Street in Sydney, and I have no doubt that similar readings could be taken in Little Collins Street in Melbourne, which show that the atmospheric pollution between the high rise buUdings due to the exhaust emissions of motor cars-particularl y carbon monoxide-is rising to danger levels. Every person who uses the centre of the city, whether he be a business man, a shopper or a passer throughthis means aU the people of Sydney from time to was time- has to be concerned with the use of LPG in place of petrol. With the use of LPG, the amount of carbon monoxide emitted by a vehicle those streets may be divided by a factor up to ten. If some extra concession is given to the heavy users of these streets to convert to LPG, the we will get so much more reUef so much more Let the Government drop some of its pretence about being so environmentally minded. When something practical can be done about a matter a which affects the environment, aU the Governis ment does is wring its hands and say: 'Look, we only might be losing a few doUars to the Treasury'. a Now count up the dollars, how much is the loss going to be? It is negligible. I ask the Governof ment just to do its sums, do a litde bit of arithmetic and it will see that the loss to the Treasury about which it is talking will be quite miniscule taxcompared with the money it is spending, and into many cases spending very rightly, on improving the environment. Here is something on which the good faith of the Government on the environmentalist issue is in question. Will ment agree with the amendment, or will it stick to its really restrictive administradve arrangements which are in this Bill and which, if implemented, will infernally slow down the conversion of inner city vehicles using petrol to the use of LPG. I know we are not going to get every vehicle converted overnight. I know that what the Federal Government can do is strictly limited. But because it is stricdy Umited is all the more reason for doing what can be done and doing it quickly. The good faith of the Governamount ment on the issue of the environment is now question. Or is its pride and its vanity, in trying push everything and by steamrolling this measure through this House, greater than its cern for the environment? WeU, the Government wiU decide this matter and the Government teU the country one way or the other in a ment. Proposed new clause negatived. Remainder of Bill-by leave-take n as a whole.",51
142,Mr ADERMANN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"The Minties ister may not be able to answer this question this stage. I point out that the cost of tax deduction item for business purposes. The price paid at the bowser for petrol is die price of that petrol for taxation deduction purposes. cost of the petrol plus the excise on it is the one transaction. If the use of Uquefied petroleum gas was a tax deduction for business purposes the price for the product would be at the distribution point while the excise be paid to the ComptroUer of Customs. I assume that the 2 payments would be lumped together as the total cost of that business tax deduction item. The payment is made in respect of the cost of the product and the separate tax on that prodsise uct, as is the case with petrol. I hope that different principle would not be use of this fuel. Dr Jf. F. CAIRNS (Lalor-Minister for recently Overseas Trade) (3.17)-No, the answer is the principle would not be different. The tax deduction would be the cost of the gas plus excise charge paid. The 2 payments would treated in the same way as the purchase of petrol is regarded. Remainder of Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.

SEWERAGE AGREEMENTS BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 September (vide page 1273), on motion by Mr Uren: That the Bill be now read a second time.",52
143,Mr HODGES,ECONOMIC POSITION OF," I rise to support this Bill, but I do so with certain reservations. This Bill provides a total of $7.95m. This is supplementary to what was provided in in the Sewerage Agreements Act 1973. Followto ing the passage of this Bill, the total amount provided through this legislation will be $37.9Sm. conQueensland sought $2m through this legislation. Victoria asked for $3.95m. Western Australia wiU sought $3m. As I see it, the Bill has 3 main moaspects, each of which is most important. The first is the health of our nation. I think everyone will agree that the provision of sewerage services is extremely important today. The second aspect is the pollution of the environment. This pollution is continuing in some areas in varying degrees. The third feature concerns local authoriwhich must carry out these sewerage works at and the methods that are adopted in funding petrol is a those works to be carried out. I wish to direct my comments mainly to the The position in Queensland. The Queensland paid in Government over many years has provided a subsidy of 40 per cent for all sewerage undertakings. Some 8 years or 10 years ago this subsidy paid was 50 per cent, but it was reduced to 40 per would cent. The $l m provided in this Bill for Queensland will go towards the cost of the Brisbane City Council treatment works at Luggage Point. In common with the $3.1 m provided in the 1973 legislation, this sum is not a grant. I emphathis point. The money is repayable over 40 a years at the long term bond rate which, I underappUed to the stand, is 8.5 per cent. The Queensland Government has been much criticised and maUgned by this Government. As as a few days ago it was so criticised and that maUgned by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) as it has been by a number of other ministers. the The Queensland Government has provided this be 40 per cent non-repayable subsidy to local authorities for many years. This meant that only 60 per cent of funds received had to be re-paid over 40 years. One might well ask how well off are local authorities in Queensland which accept these repayable sums of money. The word 'grant' should always be quaUfied when it is used by this Government. It should state whether a grant is non-repayable or repayable as the latter is almost invariably the case with this Government. The Australian people have been hoodwinked long enough by the term 'grant'. When local authorities are worse off-the y are in this casebecause no subsidy is applicable the people are worse off too because the rates which they must pay reflect the fact that no subsidy is involved in financing these works and that the whole of the money is to be repaid. In Queensland in handling this special Federal money for sewerage purposes, the proportion of the total costs of the works to be met by taxpayers with the loss of the subsidy of 40 per cent is almost doubled. This charge can go on almost ad infinitum as the life of a sewerage scheme is considered to be about 40 years. If we take into consideration that there are operating costs involved as well, we find that the ratepayer is paying for the cost of these services ad infinitum to local authorities. Do not let us run away with the idea that the Labor Government is playing Santa Claus in the terms of this agreement. Let me make it abundantly clear that this scheme will cost the taxpayer-in this case the ratepayers-mor e money. One might ask: Is Queensland being penalised? Queensland sought $2m; it is to ceive $lm only. We have heard the Minister Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) say that Queensland asked for $2m but is to reuncertain ceive Sim only. I did not hear from the Minister any explanation of this matter. Perhaps he will enlighten us a Uttle later. Is Queensland in actual fact being penalised? There has of talk in recent times that Queensland is to get a raw deal because it is not co-operating with this Federal Government and because our Premier, grants Mr Bjelke-Petersen, quite rightly resists the embark intrusions of this socialist Government into the program State sphere.

144,Mr HODGES,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"WeU, this is correct. If this of Government is going to be vindictive towards the State of Queensland, there will be a backlash, not only from Queensland but from aU of the Australian people. Mr Lamb-That is garbage, not sewerage.",53
145,Mr HODGES,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"WeU, you know aU about sewerage on that side of the House. Let me remind honourable members on the Governter-h ment side that Queenslanders are made of good stuff. They have a lot of intestinal fortitude they do not give up their rights and privUeges easily. Why should they?",53
146,Mr BRYANT,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,How do they come to vote for Joh then?,53
147,Mr HODGES,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Well , the results show the facts in Queensland. We have a good Premier and Deputy Premier of probably the best State Government in Australia. The point was proved in the election on 18 May when the Australian Labor Party was overwhelmed in that State. So, why should Queensland be disadvantaged in respect of this legislation? The Commonwealth Government is in my opinion only a collecting house for the States. Is Queensland not entitled to receive a fair go? We had an impassioned call by the Prime Minister in the course of the election held on 18 May: 'Give me a fair go'. That is what he said to the people. Of more recent times he said: 'Give us a fair go; we have to control inflation'. I say to the Government, if Queensland is in any way disadvantaged the people of South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria will also say: 'We want a fair go for Queensland'. Who knows, it might be one of those other States which needs assistance in the future. I believe that a lot of favouritism has been shown to the suburban areas of New South Wales and Victoria, particularly Sydney and reMelbourne. But in the local government elecfor tions last Saturday the people of New South Wales showed their disapproval of Labor in no terms. In spite of the favouritism that the Government has shown towards these areas in its giant vote catching action, the people have rejected it. The Prime Minister in his 1972 policy been a great deal speech stated: A Labor Government would immediately ask the principal water and sewerage authorities what Commonwealth in the present iinancial year would enable them to promptly and economically on an uninterrupted in 1978. to provide services to all the premises in their areas For subsequent financial years, the Commonwealth Grants Commission will investigate and recommend the size Commonwealth grants required to see the program through. These promises have been dishonoured because once again the Prime Minister of this country has misled the people. He has misled the State governments and local government because these are not non-repayable grants. I remember only too well the Prime Minise was then the Leader of the Oppositioncoming into my electorate in the city of Redcliffe and prior to the 1972 election, and he had done his homework, I might assure members of the House. Mr MCVeigh-He will not come back now that you are the member.",53
148,Mr HODGES,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"No , he would not be game to come back now. But on that occasion he knew all the phrases. He had them all off pat. He had done his homework. He is a good salesman. But I can tell honourable members and the people of Australia that like any salesman he will sell you something once and he might get away with it a second time. But I ask them to have a look at his personal ratings in recent times and also the ratings of his Government. Let him go back to the people and just see what they will do to him next time. The Prime Minister said that local government would get a new deal. He said that there would be no fear about this. He said that Commonwealth grants would be made to local government. He had that wonderful air of persuasion about him. His silver tongue deceived thousands in local government as it has deceived hundreds of thousands in Austraha generally. Local government is still waiting for these massive non-repayable grants. All we are getting are loans.",54
149,Mr BRYANT,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,What about the $56m provided cost by the Grants Commission?,54
150,Mr HODGES,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"We will talk about the Grants Commission. I concede to you that for the first time since 1933 the Grants Commission conJones, sidered local government. But $56.3m is a drop in the bucket compared with the thousands millions of dollars that local government of the requires. If we divide this amount by the 900 local authorities in Australia we find that an average they would receive $55,000 each. Only about 92 per cent of them were paid somebe thing anyway. The City of the Gold Coast, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson)-d o not ask me whether this situation has arisen for pohtical other reasons-ha s received nothing. The oxygen Redland Shire Council which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Bowman (Mr coast. Keogh)Mr Lamb-WeU , read the report.",54
151,Mr HODGES,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Do not worry, I have read the report. I have read it in more detaU than you have, my friend. So we find that many of these local authorities have missed out. How do members on the Government side explain this? works. Is it their wish that we all be brought to the one level? Is that the answer which they will give to me? I want to get back to the subject of the Bill say that it puzzles me why the long term bond rate is applying? We are just taking money the people. We are taking further money off the ratepayers of the community who in many instances cannot afford to pay this level of rates. Let us look at the sewerage backlog in Queensland. The Brisbane statistical district is approximately 5 per cent unsewered. The City of Townsville is approximately 5 per cent unsewered. The City of the Gold Coast is 73 per cent unsewered. Thefiguresthat I am giving of course relate to cities which have a population in excess of 60,000. Let us not be disUlusioned by the case of the City of Brisbane which is 95 per cent sewered. It is true that this area has reticulation mains, pumping stations, rising mains and the Uke. But where is the treatment works that serves 450,000 people or 60 per cent of the population? Raw sewage from 450,000 people runs into the mouth of the Brisbane River at Luggage Point. An average daUyflowof almost 20 mUlion gaUons of raw sewage is released at this point. Sewage from only 300,000 people or 40 per cent of the people is treated. The primary treatment plant that will be required by the Brisbane City Council-and I emphasise that it is only a primary treatment plant-wa s estimated in 1972 to $12m. It is now estimated to cost, because of the inflation that this Government has allowed to run rampant, over $ 14m. I believe that some arrangement has been made with Alderman Clem the Lord Mayor of Brisbane-yo u know, the gentleman who was to knock the honourable of member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) out ring and perhaps take a portfolio, perhaps over that of the Minister for Urban and Regional on Development-in this regard. The estimated cost of the fuU treatment works that eventually will provided in Brisbane is about $20m to $25 m. The Queensland Water Quality Control Council requires very high standards, something or Uke 20 parts per milhon of BOD, or bio-chemical demand as it is caUed, for effluent that finds its way into the bays and streams near the In inlandriversand lakes we get down to a level as low as 10 parts per mUUon and in some cases even as low as 5 parts per million of BOD. But the point I want to emphasise is that many existing treatment plants are inadequate. We cannot allow pollution to issue into our streams and bays at its present rate. Therefore we have to augment a number of our existing treatment I would Uke to deal briefly with the city of RedcUffe which is in my electorate. This city and which has a population of 40,000 is 96 per cent sewered. It also has an unsatisfactory BOD rate off at the moment-somethin g like 50 parts per million. However, an augmentation is being carried out at the treatment works costing in the vicinity of $ 1.4m. This will bring the BOD rate down to an acceptable level of 20 parts per million. The situation is different in the Pine Rivers Shire which has a population of 42,000 people and which is an extremely rapidly expanding urban area on the northern boundary of the city of Brisbane. At the moment only 13 per cent of the population is enjoying sewerage. This represents a total of 1,550 tenements out of 12,000. The costs of supplying sewerage have escalated. Footage costs supplied to me recently by the Brisbane City Council indicate that for 6-inch sewers, which is the main dimension laid in quantity, the cost 18 months ago averaged $7 a foot. The cost today is $ 10 a foot which is a 43 per cent increase. The Gold Coast City Council will require about $48.5m to complete its scheme with treatment works on South Stradbroke Island or about $45m if it constructs ocean outfalls along the coast areas. So even at the rate of $3.5m yearly it will take the Gold Coast City Council 12 to 15 years to complete its sewerage scheme. I want to touch briefly on the pollution angle because thousands of our creeks, rivers, inlets and beaches are being polluted to varying degrees. To take a prime example, as I mentioned earher, the Brisbane River averages 20 million gallons flow of raw sewage daily. This outflow pollutes the mouth of the Brisbane River which is like a giant sewer. The surrounding areas of Moreton Bay also suffer. A report in the 'Brisbane Courier Mail' of 19 September was headed: 'Faint Fish Taint From Brisbane River'. The article states: One of the areas where the' kerosene' taint of some mullet emanated was Luggage Point, scientists have found. State Primary Industries Department Animal Research Institute chemist (Mr D. Moy) said yesterday that studies had shown the taint in sea mullet came from the Brisbane River area. He said Luggage Point was the main known area wherefishpicked up kerosene-like hydrocarbons responsible for great losses of mullet A repon in Australian Fisheries, a monthly magazine published by the Australian Agriculture Department's Fisheries Division, said: 'The kerosene-like hydrocarbons isolated from sewage effluent discharging into the Luggage Point area indicate that this is a source of the hydrocarbons in adjacent water and sediments.' Mr Moy said Brisbane City Council efforts to improve the effluent would improve the situation considerably. He said the sewage probably was not the main source of contamination. So we must look to the preservation and improvement of our environment. It must be protected from man-made highly undesirable problems that we create with raw sewage and low grade treated effluent. I return now to the Prime Minister's plan by which he endeavoured to hoodwink the people of this country. He said that by 1978 he hoped that the major areas of this country, the cities, would be sewered. This is less than 4 years from now. This sounded very attractive to the people. Queensland would probably require something like $200m to complete the necessary sewerage works. This would be carried out with the normal programs where the State government and loan funds are used and, of course, the special repayable grants or loans, which is what they are, which we are debating here today. I remind the Government that in 1973-74 $4.1m was provided for Queensland. That rate will have to be increased considerably if this backlog is to be overtaken. The Budget this year contains $105m for expenditure on sewerage works for the whole of Australia and states that the provincial cities in the population range of 20,000 to 60,000 will be covered and considered. In 1973 more than $800m was required for communities of 60,000 people or more. Good heavens, it would be well in excess, I would say, of $ 1,000m if all communities were taken into account. I urge the Government to provide funds - tota l non-repayable grants-to local governments. It is the abUity of the people to repay this money that concerns me greatly. I know many of them are stretched to their Umit now and we want non-repayable grants made in the future. It may be that some consideration could be given to this work which is more important than, perhaps, some areas of social welfare that have been undertaken by this Government.",54
152,Mr MATHEWS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Let me sketch in the parameters of this sewerage problem. The number of houses unsewered at present is 161,000 in New South Wales, 140,000 in Victoria, 102,000 in Western Australia, 74,000 in Queensland, 14,000 in South Australia and 3,000 in Tasmania. Those figures are for the capital cities-and major urban centres-of the States concerned. If we consider the matter in terms of percentages the position is 16.3 per cent in New South Wales, 16.2 per cent in Victoria, 19.2 per cent in Queensland, 5.1 per cent in South Australia, 4.6 per cent in Tasmama and 39.6 per cent in Western Australia. In the past year, 1973-74, the Australian Government set out to do something about this problem by buUding 79 reticulation projects, 35 main, sub-main and carrier sewers, 6 pumping stations and 10 treatment plants. Total payments to the States in that year were $27.9m. We are moving today to step up that allocation even further. The problem of unsewered properties in this country is one which goes back before the Second World War. It was viciously exacerbated in the years following the Second World War and most particularly in the years of Austraha's urban explosion from 1950 through to the present The national program for coping with the deficiencies for which I have given statistics a program which dates back, in fact, only to the early months of 1973. Then the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) acted very promptly, to follow up the election undertaking to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges). He wrote in January to the State Premiers asking them what moneys would be of advantage to them and what moneys would they immediately use on making a start at overtaking the enormous sewerage backlog-the enormous backlog in an essential service. One would have thought from what the honourable member for Petrie had to say to the House this afternoon that this was not the case. One would have thought that the problem had arisen during the last 20 months and the solution had preceded it under wise and far-seeing administration during the 23 years which preceded the election of the present Government. Mr Hodges-We had our priorities.",55
153,Mr MATHEWS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"The honourable gentleman says that he had his priorities. No doubt his Government did have its priorities; sewerage was very clearly not among those priorities. Sewerage and the problems of pollution, over which the honourable member waxed eloquent this afternoon, are still not among the honourable gentleman's priorities. It is a fact-eage r though the honourable gentleman may be to create another impression-that throughout those 23 years the national government contributed not a single cent towards the urban services of this country. The deficiencies in sewerage, the enormous backlog in this service, provided only a single example of the shortcomings, the backlog in all the services upon which the existence of civilised urban communities depends. The same things that can be said for sewerage can be said for water reticulation, road construcmade tion and public transport development. In area on which the maintenance of a proper qualmission. ity of life depends in urban areas the expenditure of the 23 years of Liberal-Country Party administration was deficient. through clearly in the current state of all our capital cities major regional centres. I am not who would advocate or support any section of the Australian community missing out on the advantages which that section of the community requires from the national government and which only the national government can provide. When some honourable members opposite complain-as they do frequently, and most recently this morning-abou t the withdrawal of support to which they have long been accustomed, I cannot help thinking how they sat mute is throughout 23 years while great disadvantaged areas of outer suburbia in this country were growing up. Mr Hodges-The people are paying for it.",56
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Order! I must point out that all interjections are out of order.,56
155,Mr MATHEWS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"The honourable member has a memorable capacity for cUches. The people are indeed paying for it. The question is: Are the people to get value for their money? This Government is determined that the taxes which are paid in State capitals and regional centres will be reflected for thefirsttimein the services provided for those areas. This is a new development. It is a new initiative. In presenting this year's Budget papers, the Government presented among them for the first time as a separate statement a considered urban budget. That signifies the importance that this Government attaches to the welfare of urban areas, not just the urban areas of the State capitals but also those regional centres which are the heart of rural Australia and which support and are supported by the countryside. These areas, too, are receiving our support. For thefirsttimeurban services in those areas are being underwritten by the national Government. Something of the direct burden which has hitherto rested on the shoulders of the ratepayers in those areas is being reUeved. The honourable gentleman made the extraordinary statement that the Prime Minister had dishonoured his promise to provide assistance for local government. Yet I was able to demonstrate to the honourable gentleman-and he at that stage had the grace to admit that I wasright-that $56m had been made avaUable to local government in this country, not repayable grants, but in non-repayable, interest free grants. They had been avaUable by the Australian Government every on the recommendation of the Grants ComMr Hodges-WU l the Prime Minister give us That shows that assurance next time?",56
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Order! I remind one the honourable member for Petrie that I have already asked him not to interject. He has already spoken in this debate. All interjections are out of order.,56
157,Mr MATHEWS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"The honourable gentleman 's colleagues, and I think perhaps the honourable gentleman as well, were before the Grants Commission brought down its report noted to say that the Government would never do anything for local government, that its promises to local government would not be honoured. Now that the promise has been honoured they go on singing the same old song. It is an extraordinary performance. It is a great demonstration of the capacity of the human mind to call black white and white black- a capacity for which the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay), who will follow me in this debate, is well known. Of course the Austrahan Government has not only made non-repayable, interestfree grants available to local government free of strings on the recommendation of the Grants Commission; it will be contributing very heavily to municipalities through the establishment of the Area Improvements Scheme which was announced in the recent Budget. Thirteen areas are to participate in the area improvements scheme and nearly $ 15m is to be allocated to them on a project basis. I commend to the attention of the honourable member for Petrie the urban budget which has been presented by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), the first Minister for Urban and Regional Development ever to serve in an Australian Cabinet. I commend the attention of the honourable member for Petrie to that budget which sets out the way in which this Government is honouring its undertakings to urban areas-the magnificent thrust forward which is being made in the interests of all the people of urban Australia. The honourable gentleman made some play on the use of the word 'grants' in the Prime ister's 1972 election policy speech. You would have thought, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the use of section 96 for the purposes of making the States was a discovery of the present Government. It was not, Sir. You would be well aware, having participated in the debates in this House over many years, of the use that was made of tion 96 in every year from 1963 on and you would be aware too that the grants made under section 96 can be non-repayable and nonconcern interest bearing but that equally they can repayable and bearing interest and that they were made in that form by the honourable gentleman's Party over many years of office Austraha. Let those who criticise come to debate in this House with clean hands. The problem that is presented to our country by the long failure of the national Government to invest adequately in urban affairs is one of truly national proportions. While some of the least desirable by-products of this failure may be aesthetic in their nature, there are 2 areas which are of very real national concern. The honourable gentleman from Petrie, to his credit, touched on the matter of pollution. I can assure the honourable gentleman that pollution arising from deficiencies in the sewerage system are not confined to Brisbane nor, I guess, are they most serious in that city. Our Tasmanian colleagues would be able to tell the honourable gentleman something about the problems in that State. My own electorate is traversed by the River Yarra. It is not safe to drink the water of that river at any point above Warrandyte or to swim in it at any point above Templestowe. Mr Lamb-On e can almost walk on it lower down.",57
158,Mr MATHEWS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"And at lower points in the river, I am rerninded by my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe, one can just about walk on it without any of the divine attributes sometimes claimed by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier). The state of Port Pliillip Bay, carefully monitored by the Victorian Government under constant prompting from conservation organisations, shows the effect of the pollution which characterises every one of the streamsflowinginto that bay. In every one of the streams flowing into Port PhilUp Bay the level of bacterial pollution, the level of E.coli reflecting faecal contamination, exceeds the levels laid down by any and every health organisation the world around. The state of the bay, one of Melbourne's great recreational resources, reflects this fact. The beaches on which I swam as a child and which many honourable members of Minthis House would have visited as children are unfit for the use of the present generation of children because of this problem that was allowed to grants to fester throughout the postwar era. The second aspect of this problem- a related aspect-is the aspect of health. Of course, this secnational Parliament has a responsibility for health in its national manifestations. Successive Ministers for Health cannot but have noted with the rising incidence in urban areas of be those diseases which are primarily associated with faecal contamination, with the failure to provide proper sewerage arrangements. The inin cidence of gastroenteritis and hepatitis has mounted each successive year, and there is a direct correlation between the incidence of disease and the percentage of homes unsewered. The honourable member for Petrie mentioned that it would be 12 to 15 years at the rate of progress established last year by the Government before the Gold Coast Council scheme for sewerage could be completed. But I am interested to see it is clear on returns from the States that without Austrahan Government assistance the backlog of unserviced population in 1982-83 would be 1,426,062 Australians, or 15 per cent of them in all, compared with 1,654,000 or 17 per cent in 1974. That would be the position if the present Government had not come to office. That is the position which we are out to overtake. The honourable gentleman's predecessors in this place, when they sat on this side of the Parliament, regularly ridiculed honourable members of my Party for suggesting that Australia's urban problems could not be overcome until the national Government became involved. I remember when a leading member of this Government, then in Opposition, cited figures of the sort to which I have just referredfigures provided by the statistician and authenphilosophy. ticated by the Treasurer-the then Treasurer, then honourable member for Wentworth, who is of no longer with us, accused him of talking like small-time mayor. It is a sad commentary on the values of that gentleman and those who sniganybody. gered with him at the wit of the remark because, as thefigureswhich I gave a moment ago indiwould cate, there is no capacity on the part of State governments, on the part of their instrumentaUto do that. ties, such as the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works-saddle d as it is with the necessity to pay out more than half of its revenue in debt servicing charges-o r on the part of local government to overtake the enormous sewerage backlog which has been allowed to accumulate. The States themselves acknowledge that it not be done without Australian Government proposes help. Not only did honourable members opposite never in 23 years lift afingerto do anyspeech. thing about the problem, not only did they rubbish members on this side of the House who proposed that they should Uft have not in any subsequent policy speech promised to do anything about the problem. It is true, as the honourable member for Petrie said, that they have forgotten nothing. But Uke the Bourbons, they have leamt nothing.",57
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Order! delay The honourable member's time has expired.,58
160,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"The Sewerage Agreements Bill 1974, according to the second reading speech of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), is designed to provide extra funds for sewerage backlog programs in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. At the outset I would like to say that a word has been left out there. The speech should have read that the Bill is designed to provide extra loan funds, because there is no way in the world that anyone could ever consider that these moneys are by way of grant. The States are to be assisted in a sense, I suppose we could say, by supplementary legislation to the legislation passed last year. The assistance is to be in relatively small amounts. Victoria is to be assisted by the provision of$3.95m, Queensland by $lm- I wonder whether the Minister in his reply might tell us why Queensland's application for $2m has been reduced to $lm , as was pointed out by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges)-and Western Australia by $3m. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation although we express quite serious concern about some aspects ofit and some aspects of its At the outset I would like to ask for the leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard one the agreements set out in the Bill. If the Minisa ter will pay some attention, I would point out that I am in no way seeking to take a rise out of I simply want to have one of these agreements incorporated in Hansard, and I prefer it to be the one dealing with the Queensland Government. I formally seek leave",58
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Is leave granted?,58
162,Mr UREN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"No , leave is not granted. There is a procedure of courtesy under which the honourable member should seek to have things incorcanporated in Hansard. He should show what he to incorporate to the Minister in charge of the legislation prior to commencing hus",58
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"The Minister is quite right. There is a formula for dealing with afinger,but they these things.",58
164,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I reaUse that. I do not think the Minister graduated from his courtesy course with first class honours, anyway. We will have to get by without having the agreement incorporated. Therefore I commence by asking the Minister a few questions. Firstly, why has there been such a between the time that the legislation was canvassed, which I guess would have been back in February or March, and the present time, which is the end of September? This matter appeared on the notice paper during the last sitting of the Parliament in July and should easily have been disposed of by now. What we are concerned about is what appears to be a total lack of consultation with the States and certainly a total lack of consideration for the States. How does the Government expect the States to proceed? Here we have an agreement which we are not allowed to see in Hansard which states that the work must commence by 1 July. It is now 24 September and the agreement has not even been passed because it has to be ratified by this Parhament. So my first question of the Minister concerns the delay and the lack of consideration for the State governments. How does the Federal money Government expect the States to proceed when no agreement has been ratified? What happens, for example, in relation to contractors and people digging trenches? Should the State governments dismiss them? Should they people on wages or should they look for some sort of temporary finance. I think that is our first ment. concern. Also, it is no good the Government saying that it does not wish to direct the States the way in which they shall fact, I was very interested but not impressed to listen to the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews) who said- I think I quote him fairlyment after talking about the 23 years of conservative government and how little we did Mr Mathews-Do you deny it?",58
165,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I will deal with that in a moment. I think the honourable member should sit in his correct place if he is going to help make my speech. He said that taxes gathered in State capitals and regions will now be spent these areas. That is what the honourable member for Casey said in his contribution to the debate, and I think that is part of the philosophy that goes right through all of these negotiations. Mr Bourchier-Is it not terrible? We do not have a Minister at the table.",59
166,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"This is really becoming somehas thing of a habit now. I have not been here all long, but the chamber being left without one Minister in charge and a very insignificant backcussion bencher sitting at the table is something that never saw until the Labor Government came to office. What would happen if l stood on or did a Highland fling or something equally dramatic? Who would take care of the proceedUve ings in the House? It is quite improper that should be no Minister at the table. This is the second time it has happened today.",59
167,Mr JAMES,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,It is your fault; you are clearing the House.,59
168,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I take up that point. The House was cleared by the honourable member for Casey who preceded me in the debate. There are more honourable members here now than before, for which I am grateful. The philosophy of the Federal Government as it is now is to take over all of the powers, or most of them, of the States. That is what the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews) is really saying, that for 23 years the State governments have been running their own business and now the Federal Labor Party is in government it will move in and take over those responsibilities and decide where the will be spent. That is a very strong warning to the people who live in the smaller States. God help them if the federal system collapses. Mr Matthews-The honourable gentleman dismiss does not want the funds allocated.",59
169,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,I will deal with that in a mo,59
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Order! as to The honourable member has already spoken in spend the money. In the debate.,59
171,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"The point is that in this agreethere is evidence-and that is why I wanted the Queensland agreement included in Hansard-that even in this area of sewerage the present Federal Crovernment has taken away the priorities from the Queensland Government and the other governments relating to where they will spend the money on sewerage. In the agreement it states that the money will be spent in Brisbane me to and the Gold Coast. I am not necessarily being critical of where the money is spent, but it is not in the Queensland Government that is deciding where it is spent, it is this Government.",59
172,Mr COHEN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"They had discussions, you know.",59
173,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Discussions ! I take up that interjection too, because that in fact is not so. I have spoken to a member of one of the State governments as recently as yesterday, and there not been a single discussion about the that amounts allocated in the Budget, which we will be debating this week. There was very Uttle disin respect of this and the previous agree I ment. This Government is heU-bent on taking away from the States their right to decide where my head sewerage money will be spent. What the Government is really saying to the people who in the States is that it will decide which of there those people will have sewerage and which of them will not. That is the antithesis of what we believe in. I see we do have a Minister back at the table, and I am very grateful. The second point about which the Opposition is concerned is that arrogant, really almost insulting, way that the Government has treated the States. I mention this because it was brought up by the honourable member for Casey. In his second reading speech, referring on this occasion to Melbourne's problems with stormwater drainage, the Minister said that most metropoUtan streams in Australia record levels of E. CoU which are completely unacceptable to this Government Unfortunately the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) is not here, but perhaps the Minister for the Capital Territory could ask him: Do you think that your Government is the only government that is concerned about poUution levels?",59
174,Mr BRYANT,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"No , we are not the only ones concerned, but we are the only ones who wiU do anything about it.",60
175,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Do you have some monopoly of concern, and no other governments are concerned? This is what you are saying.",60
176,Mr BRYANT,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,The South Australian and Tasmanian Governments.,60
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Order! I ask the honourable member to direct his remarks to the Chair and then we might avoid this crossfire over the table.,60
178,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I would prefer to do that; it is a much more acceptable procedure. In our view, this is unnecessarily insulting to other governments and it is also insulting to the next Federal Government, which I have no doubt will come from this side of the House. It is also insulting the Lord Mayor and members of the Brisbane City Council. That Council has been in office, Labor dominated, since the year dot. So it is not very smart to think that the Government is rabbishing only Liberal and Country Party governments. This sort of remark also rubbishes the Labor governments, one in Tasmama, one in South Australia and, in effect, the Brisbane City Council. Before I leave the Minister's second reading speech-and there is not very much in it to which I want to refer-ther e is one quite serious inaccuracy at the point where he was talking about the national sewerage program-givin g expression to the Government's own private concern, of course-providin g that aU new land subdivisions should be given adequate sewerage treatment faciUties. To bring the Minister up to date, in Victoria at any rate the developers are responsible for aU headworks in all new subdivisions and, as I understand it, have been so responsible since last December.",60
179,Mr UREN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Why do you not use the correct terms in relation to headworks and sewerage?,60
180,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Unfortunately the Minister wishes now to give me a lecture on sematics, for which I have not got time.",60
181,Mr UREN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Why do you not do your homework?,60
182,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,I have done my homework.,60
183,Mr UREN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,No developer pays for headworks. They are done by the sewerage authorities.,60
184,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,You had better go back to Victoria and have a look.,60
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Order! There are too many interjections on both sides of the House.,60
186,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"We should have a look now at how much these State governments have doneand this is not over the last 23 years-becaus e most of what the Minister has done and certainly aU that the member for Casey has done has been to denigrate past State governments, not past Federal governments. We recognise the difference between Commonwealth and State constitutional responsibiUties and honourable members opposite do not. I want to place on record how much the New South Wales Government, for example, has done, and I will quote from the annual report of the MetropoUtan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board for the year ended 30 June 1973. Thefigurefor capital works in New South Wales alone is $569m. This Government, in the Bill we are talking about to now, as well as the amount that is appropriated in the Budget, has decided there will be only $ 132m for the whole lot. In Queensland this year they are spending $50m and I think it is proper for some of us to defend the State governments and their authorities. To quote briefly from the report of the Sydney authority, the declared area of operations totals some 4,000 square miles. It includes not only the whole of the metropolitan area of Sydney but also a number of outlying cities, municipaUties and shires, as well as the South Coast areas embraced by the city of WoUongong and the municipaUties of Shellharbour and Kiama. The Board's 19 separate sewerage systems include over 7,000 miles of sewers. No one can say that it has not done some work since it has been in office. I draw the attention of the House to the amount which the New South Wales State Government will be spending on sewerage works this year, financed from its own resources. This is indicated on page 1 of the report as being $86m. The report makes the point that 5 years ago the annual expenditure was only $26m. If honourable members read through the report they will see that attendon is also drawn to the fact that the New South Wales Government is spending as much this year as it did last year and is actually getting much less work for it, because of inflation. I think we can say that inflation is at least Government induced. There is no time to go through the report of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, but I would point out that at the end of April this year there were 155,000 unsewered houses and vacant lots in the metropolitan area in Melbourne. At the present rate of progress it will take 15 years to catch up on the backlog, even if not one other dwelling is connected. The area serviced by the Board in Melbourne covers 187,500 hectares and some 600,000 homes. In this financial year it will have spent $60m from its own resources. Probably the most significant aspect of the report appears on page 19. The report says: And the Board is forced into the position of being borrower. A measure of the money it must raise can be gauged from the fact that in the 1973-74 financial capital works expenditure exceeded $114m, an increase some $28m over the previous year. This is the important point, and I trust the ter will respond. The report continues: In spite of this increase, the rate of inflation Board is, in fact, now paying more money for no more than it carried out in 1972-73, a prime tion eats into the value of avaUable funds. So, no matter what pious thoughts the honourable member for Casey and other honourable members on the other side of the House have, the sewerage problem will become greater until the Government reduces the rate of inflation and puts some value back into the dollar. In its report the Victorian authority makes the point also that it will require $ 1,000m to catch up the backlog The Minister made the same point in answering a question asked of him by one of my colleagues oh 18 September, except that he said that $ 1,000m would be required for all the urban areas. I beheve that that is a quite serious miscalculation. Talking of broken promises, which is something to which we are becoming conditioned in this country, I would like to make reference also to the pre-election speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam). There is a serious broken promise in it in respect of sewerage. The Prime Minister said: A Labor Government will immediately ask the principal water and sewerage authorities what Commonwealth grants in the present financial year would enable them to embark promptly and economically . . . There is no doubt that in the minds of the Austrahan people- I think this point was made by one of my colleagues-the Prime Minister was holding out to them the promise that a Labor Government would actually make grants available to the States free of interest to assist them to overcome the backlog. We all know from the Bill currently before us that the States will in fact be paying the long term bond rate and that this will mean an increase in the State debt. The money has cost the Commonwealth virtually nothing but it is lending it back to the States at the long term bond rate. In doing so it is increasing the State debts. I think that the State debt in Victoria is 58c in every dollar. That is the interest Victoria has to pay back before it spends any money. I could be quoting from the Minister's second reading speech in saying that, but that is a fact anyway. It means that more than half of every dollar raised goes back to the Federal Government by way of interest. That represents a high cost to the consumer. I would like to have had the time to quote what is said in certain reports about the increased cost to the consumers, who are the ratepayers. If rates are increased sharply it adds a big to inflation and everybody is penalised. The penyear its alty imposed- I object very much to the exof pression used to describe them-upo n the person who receives unearned income is particularly Minisharsh. Such a person, who probably cost the country nothing during his working life, because means that the he was thrifty during his working life and work invested a few dollars has to pay an extra tax on example of how inflatop ofhis income. Mr Ruddock-Thrif t is a dirty word.",60
187,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Yes, thrift is a dirty word. Mr Hodges-So is profit.",61
188,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Profi t has always been a dirty word with this socialist party, but to impose a penalty on thrift is in my view completely unforgiveable and is something for which the Government has no mandate. The Government talks about having a mandate. We believe that the Government should advance the money interestfree or at least advance it at a very low rate of interest, as is done in Queensland. Being a Queenslander you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the State Government in Queensland advances 40 per cent of the capital expenditure to the local councils and that they raise the rest by way of loan. I noticed today that in reply to a well prepared Dorothy Dix question the Minister for Urban and Regional Development indicated that something along those lines would be the formula for the grants which will be coming up for debate in the next few weeks. We of the Opposition will applaud anything which will reduce the State debt. We make the point that sewerage is not a business undenaking and that it can be treated almost in isolation. It is not like the provision of electricity and gas. There is no sale of the end product.",61
189,Mr COHEN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,What did you do about sewerage when you were in Government?,62
190,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"If the honourable member for Robenson had been in the chamber earUer and had listened to what was said he would know what the Opposition's views are about the subject. We take the view that the Government is substituting itself as a lending authority. It misrepresents itself as being a great benefactor. It has won a lot of votes for itself in this way. say that the Government is not delivering goods it promised to deUver. All it is doing ing unto itself more and more power because it has control of the purse. I wish to deal now with a point made by the honourable member for Casey, who apparently has become suddenly disinterested. We take the view that the governments of the larger and wealthier States- I come from one of the smaller States-shoul d not be blamed constantly for the conditions that are caused largely by the disadvantages that they suffer under the federal system. If, for example, the States of New South Wales and Victoria were able to spend all the money that they raised within their boundaries they would have the best roads, the best sewers and the best hospitals in the world. But the federal system does not operate in that way. In fact, in a sense it could be said that those States are subsidising the smaller States. It is quite significant that within 12 months of a Labor administration taking over in South Australia, which is the State from which I come, it became a mendicant State. It has been very badly managed. If the philosophy put forward by the honourable member for Casey and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development were carried through it would be a mendicant State permanently because what they are really saying is that the smaller States will spend the money that they can raise and nothing else within their own boundaries. Ifit had not been for the federal system, which gives advantages to people who Uve in the State from which I come and the other smaUer States, we would be still travelling around in horse drawn vehicles on unmade din roads and we would be still Uving in two-room bluestone cottages with wooden plank privies down at the bottom of the garden. That I think highlights more than anything else the difference between us in philosophy. The smaUer States, especiaUy the 2 smaU Labor governed States, should beware if this phUosophy is carried right through in aU areas. For that reason I would like to record very briefly what the Opposition's phUosophy is as set out in a pubUcation called 'The Way Ahead', which was produced just before the last election, which sets out Liberal Country Party poUcies which will be expanded and improved astimegoes on and which will be put to the people when an opportunity occurs before the next election. Mr Martin-When is that?",62
191,Mr MCLEAY,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"That will depend upon Caucus We fights and the actions of the Prime Minister. The the Liberal-Country Party's platform on urban is takimprovement and regional development reads: The Liberal and Country Parties do not believe there can be uniform or nationally imposed solutions to urban and regional problems. That is the difference between us. The Government thinks there can be. Sir, you would know that most of the houses where you live are made of wood and that most of the houses where I live are made of brick. The whole of Australia cannot be treated as being the same sort of country. The platform continues: For this reason, we will uphold the clearly different roles of the Federal, State and Local Governments in the development of our urban policies. We believe that the present approach concentrates scarce skills in Canberra. We believe it duplicates functions which properly belong at the State and local levels. Our support will take the form of co-operation, not competition, with the States. As we have seen in the debate on this legislation today, there is confrontation with the States. The key role of the State Governments in identifying urban problems, setting urban priorities and establishing urban amenities needs to be recognised. The States are the proper level of Government to co-ordinate intra-state transport, land release, regional planning and to plan regional facilities. These functions already fall within the responsibility of the State governments. What we are saying is that the Federal Government should be supporting the States, not trying to take powers away from them. We support this legislation just as we would support any legislation to improve conditions in the cities but we make the point .that it is no good lending money at high interest rates to the States. They can borrow money themselves anyway. The only way to help them is by making money avaUable by way of grants. The Government promised to do this but it has broken its promise. Despite these factors, we support this legislation.",62
192,Mr BENNETT,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I rise to speak on the Sewerage Agreements Bill 1974 which will appropriate additional funds for sewerage backlog works in Victoria, Queensland and, more importantly to me, in Western Australia. provides for Western Australia a addition to the $3.8m already granted under principal agreement for works commenced by 1 July 1974. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay), made and incredible allegations about the discussions the States. In fact the Australian Government has accepted the States' recommendations on this matter and has given the States all they asked for; so it is incredible that the previous speaker should not be aware of this fact. He probably aware that in his own electorate of Boothby $450,000 was provided under the last agreement. I mention this fact in case he was not aware. The honourable member referred to the total inabihty of the States to finance sewerage possibUity schemes without national government assistance. removed. In that respect I agree with him. For the constituents of my electorate of Swan the sewerage work undertaken initially by the then Tonkin State Labor Government with funds provided by the Australian Labor Government represented something more than connection to a sewer tem. It meant freedom from pollution of the often high water table in the region, particularly in the Canning area. The ability to undertake proposals to develop an area, although only miles from the heart of Perth, was affected cause of building restrictions which prevented such development to its full potential. The lack sewerage faculties was the main barrier. It is to say that this neglect had been perpetuated State and Federal governments over many years until the coming of a Labor Administration in 1972 when State and Federal governments help began to work together. I hasten to add that is in no way a reflection on local government which recognised the need for sewerage. This matter has been the subject of constant public debate. There have been many calls action which have been ignored. Is it any wonder that $3m was required to be spent on sewerage works in the Swan electorate in 1972-73? I am most grateful for such expenditure. I hope the program initially undertaken by the State Labor Administration will be continued by existing State Government whose leaders have, on occasion, expressed a desire not to allocate funds in this area. In fact, they are on record indicating a preference for developers to be able to use package treatment plants and not to compelled to have mainline sewers provided. is hoped that the proper overall plan already undertaken will be continued despite the expresIt sed reluctance of leaders of the present Western further $3m in Austrahan Government. the Sewerage works are labour intensive and will assist to provide employment for workers in the industry, for suppUers of material to the industry for workers in other supply areas. The extra with $3m wiU provide for local employment opportunities and for a better standard of Uving for local residents. It will offer redevelopment have opportunities in high water table areas thus doing away with the horrors of septic tank use is which is causing poUution to underground water in the porous sandstone below the Perth area. It should be remembered that underground water already provides a significant portion of Perth's water supply and is Ukely to become a more significant source of drinking water for that city in the future. It is therefore imperative that the of poUution to this water by sewage be In the suburb of Koongamia in my electorate, because of the hills and the composition of the clay base soU, State Housing Commission homes are not as yet connected to a sewerage system sysalthough pipe headworks are avaUable. Household reticulation has not taken place. The result was that during last winter there was an overflow of septic tanks and leach drains into the storm 6 water system and into the fresh water upper bereaches of the Helena and Swan rivers. This was a disgraceful state of affairs. In fact, the State of member for the area, Mr Jack Skidmore, drew sad my attention to one family whose carport and by general area was flooded by refuse and who had to suffer the resultant stench. It is to be hoped that his approaches to the State authority will hasten the overcoming of this problem. For this the firsttimemoney for the necessary environmental works has been provided to the Western Australian authorities by a national government. The completion date for aU sewerage works in the metropoUtan areas is 1982-83. for Western Australians have commented to me that they are amazed at critical statements of the national Government by those in Opposition-by those who had taken no steps to offer a solution that to the problems themselves. Today Opposition supporters speak only critically, which amazes the me. People have made the point that when the proposed program reaches such areas as Geraldton and Kalgoorlie and other regional towns as with populations exceeding 20,000 in Western Australia, the existing State Government will not be indicate from whom the funds and planning will It come. This is one of the major reasons why I think the State Government needs to be directed where to spend the funds. The Austrahan Labor Government planned these reticulation schemes initially and it will fund these initial projects but the Western Australian Government will continue to denigrate that effort. I am forced to agree with my constituents views on this aspect. In 1973-74 some $27.9m was paid out in repayable advances to all States. This sum contributed to the provision of some 79 reticulation projects, to 35 main, sub-main and carrier sewers, to 6 pumping stations and to 10 treatment plants. It must have been a record year but, quite frankly, who knows about it? Where has this been reported in the Press? Further expansion has been Umited because of manpower availabiUty and the need not to cause inflationary pressures by creating excess demands in the material supply field. Obviously there has been lack of forward planning for the production of supplies in some States. Although they can perhaps be excused for a lack of forward planning, it is unusual to see such consistent planning for the future by a national government with such a massive availabiUty of funds for a specific purpose. This Bill ensures that existing programs wiU be maintained at peak level. It ensures that in my area the Perth MetropoUtan Water Board able immediately to undertake mainline works in the Cannington, Queens Park and other areas. In fact, without this assistance it would have to back its works program with a consequent reduchave tion in contract staff because I have been given understand that the State does not have the funds to finance these works. The proposed expenditure will enable a reduction of the 102,000 unsewered homes in Western Australia. Another important aspect is that it will help overcome continuing poUution of our water reserves and waterways, including the Helena, Canning and Swanrivers.Astimeprogresses we hope to see a better co-ordinated national proach to Australia's water resources so that can be utilised in the most effective way. This Bill is only part of a new and more sponsible approach to urban affairs. It represents an appreciation of the need to provide a better environment for urban dwellers. We must bear in mind that this has been achieved only December 1972, a year and a half ago. If one looks to the possibUities for the future in respect of what can be achieved in the urban environproblem. ment by a national government under a responsolutions sible Minister, such as we now have, and one bears in mind the assistance given to local government through the Grants Commission and through the many other subsidy schemes lem. now operating, and one sees other programs take shape and come to fruition eUminating problems associated with urban Ufe-program s related to transport, health and social amenities-on e realises the delays which have adversely affected progress in these matters. I refer to the delay of legislation in another place. We hope that this legislation will not be blocked in that House, because no doubt we have suffered some delays due to the double dissolution. It is hoped that these benefits will not be denied to the States due to any delay in what should be the States' House. All the 3 States that will benefit specially under the legislation have commenced work. Any delay would be a tragedy. It should be noted that in 1974-75 $95m will be made available to the States-$88 m for the larger cities, $5m for smaUer centres and $2m for support activities. The amount being provided for 1974-75 sewerage works wiU be a mixture of non-repayable grants and loans at the long term bond rate. In numerical terms the sewerage backlog can be expressed at 537,300 dwellings or 17 per cent of the total number of houses in towns of 20,000 persons or over. So one can see the need for the urgency of having this Bill put to the other House and carried. I only hope that this will be happens. I support the Bill.",62
193,Mr RUDDOCK,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I rise to cut restore, I hope, some sanity to this debate. We heard some comments from the honourable to member for Swan (Mr Bennett) and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews), both of whom have said that members of the Opposition are not reaUy concerned about matters relating to the environment, meeting the problems of to urban communities and solving the problems related to sewering metropolitan areas, regional areas and so on. I beg to say that there would not be anybody within the precincts of this Parliaapment who would not be concerned about sewerthey age and the needs for homes to be sewered, the health of the community and all the other matreters that have been raised by each of the members from the Government side who have spoken before me. I would hasten to say that, even reading the speech of the Minister for since Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), one would find Uttle to disagree with in terms of the statements he makes about the nature of the But what one disagrees with are the that are offered by the Government, the approach that the Government takes to deal with the problem which we all acknowledge exists, and the methods it uses to deal with that probI am an unavowed federalist. I would have thought that members of the Government might well have thought of returning to that posidon themselves after last Saturday. I am sure the Minister read the 'Canberra Times' this morning, and I should not have to draw his attention that the local government elections took place in New South Wales last weekend. It may well be that with a change of council in Parramatta I will know more of what is going on in the Minister's Department than I have known in the past. The problem is-it has been demonstrated in Parramatta and in other areas around Sydney-that the sins of one political party in office are often visited upon other parties in office. The Government blurs distinctions between local government, State governments and the Federal Government and the responsibilties that each of them has. Labor representatives in Sydney have been visited with die mistakes of this Government, which has obviously failed to deal with the important problems that are facing us today. We no longer talk about defence and foreign affairs in this place. We no longer think about the problems of the economy. In many ways we are becoming bogged down in deahng with problems of the nature of that which we are discussing now. I am not trying to say that these things are unimportant, because they are important. They are important to the people. In my community, I am familiar with the areas that are not sewered, the pollution of the Parramatta River and so on. I can talk as glibly as others about the problems that are quite evident in my areas, but clearly what is needed is funds. We are talking about the terms on which those funds are made available. I believe that this Government should absolve itself of responsibihty for how funds are spent and say to the State government or the local government authorities that have the constitional responsibilities for these problems: 'Here is the money. You spend it'. There may well be- I will refer to this matter a Uttle later-particula r areas in which a national government can assume a direct responsibiUty in limited way. I believe that the Government has failed to deal with the real problems that are facing the nation. We are deaUng with many other matters which ought to be put into their right perspective. But as we have to discuss them on an occasion Uke this, I would Uke to make a number of observations particularly on the comments of the honourable member for Casey because he impUed that some areas in communities Uke Sydney and Melbourne were not sewered because of the shortcomings of past Federal administrations of a different poltiical persuasion. Clearly if one looks at the solutions now being offered by this Government one can see the same sort of shortcomings emerging. If one looks at inflation as an issue in relation to the cost of the authorities that have to build sewerage works it is quite clear that their costs are rising. They are not able as efficiently or as well to build the works with the amount of funds avaUable to them in the past. That situation exists simply because the Government has faUed to control inflation. There is an ancUlary effect to this. Because of the high cost of raising money today, an authority like the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board in Sydney, which would previously have expected to raise some $100m to enable it to carry out its own program of sewerage in Sydney,findsthat it will probably have a substantial shortfall this year in the money that it expects to raise. If there is a shortfall in loan moneys because of the high cost of obtaining money on our community today, have we an undertaking from the Minister to underwrite the loans that are normally raised by such organisations as the MetropoUtan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works themselves? If there are shortfalls of $30m or $40m because of the high cost of raising money to enable these efficient organisations to meet their own programs, will this Government step in and underwrite loans that the organisations would have raised themselves were it not for the parlous economic state which we are in? I ask him whether he will, when he has an opportunity to reply later, give some attention to that because amounts being allocated under this Bill will seem pretty small if the major constructing authorities are not able themselves to raise the money that they need to meet the programs to which they are already committed. It is not much good transferring the obUgation from one authority to this Government and saying 'Look, we are good feUows; we are giving you X mUlions of dollars, as we are doing in this Bill, or $30m as we have given you before', if the authorities do not have the funds avaUable to them which they had in the past. We as members of the Opposition, are supporting this Bill and the aUocation of funds, not because we believe it is the best way, but simply because it is the solution that the Government is offering. We believe there are better ways of solving the problem and I put it to the Government that the best way of doing so is to make avaUable the money to the States and the local authorities, and to aUow them to set their own priorities and to spend the money as they see it should be spent. They are the people who are best able to judge how it ought to be spent. Even though we say there is a better way to do this, it does not stop us from looking at the performance of the Government in relation to the promises which it has made. I draw the attention of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development once more, as I did on the last occasion when I spoke on this legislation in December of last year, to the promise that the Labor Parry made in its 1972 pohcy speech on the matter of sewerage. The policy speech states: A Labor government will immediately ask the principal water and sewerage authorities what Commonwealth grants in the present financial year would enable them to promptly and economically on an uninterrupted program provide services to all the We are well on the way to that time. This was promise on which the Government inally elected. Yet, in answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Berinson), the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ran away from that promise when he said: We will try to meet the target Minister but the State authorities have agreedI think he might have asked them whether it would be possible for them to do it when he made such a promise: . . . that probably it will take until 1980 or 1980s to achieve our aim because of pressure on resources, both men and material. I am not saying that is not a real problem; I knowledge that it is. Yet this Government came to office on the promise that it would achieve what it proposed by 1978. It ran away from promise almost immediately it came to office. The Minister for Urban and Regional Developother ment, who is sitting at the table, was the one announced that it would not be possible to meet that undertaking. In the principal Act and in this Bill it is made clear that although the Commonwealth is lendemployment. ing the money to the States under this agree is ment, it is not borrowing that money and paying high rates of interest for it. I draw the attention honourable members to clause 6 of the Bill we are considering. This clause states that the asGovemment is entitled to appropriate that money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Clause 9 provides: . . . the Treasurer may authorise the payment Fund, out of the Loan Fund . . . The Bill provides that in fact the money can be raised by loan. But the Government can swap procedure around if it wants to; it seeks that of flexibility. So, this money will be coming from taxpayers' funds. Yet the State authorities must pay interest to the Commonwealth for it. In answer to a question asked in this place today the Minister for Urban and Regional Development told us of the magnitude of the debts that these authorities responsible for the provision of sewerage services have already. He told us that some $70m would be made available next year, again as loans. But to deal with criticisms of the type that I have made today and out of a grudging respect, I suppose, for the points which we have made in debates such as this about the need to make the grants as originally promised, he said that there will be a token grant embark of 30 per cent which is less than half of what to local authorities are required to borrow by way premises in their areas by 1978. of loan funds, even next year. This great program a we heard announced in answer to a Dorothy Dix was origquestion this morning. New South Wales receives no money under this agreement. I interpret the reason to be that the New South Wales Government, the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board date of 1978 set by the Prime and the Hunter District Drainage Board each budgeted correctly, set out a program, and kept within the obligation that each assumed to spend the moneys that were available. The Minister, I note, indicates in his second reading speech that the Government had carefully assessed the the early impact of these programs on manpower and material resources and that most of the work had already been completed and therefore would inacvolve no significant pressure on resources. Quite clearly from the speech it becomes apparent that the moneys that are being made available are to that make up the excess of expenditure over and above the grants originally made to each of the States. So, we are not seeing any additional who moneys in fact being made avaUable to provide additional sewerage works through these grants proposed by the legislation. We hear a great deal at the moment about unI understand that the Government suffering some anguish about this matter although I do not know, if l raise this issue, how of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) would treat that me or whether my comments might be seen",64
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"If the honourable member raises the issue too much, to that the Deputy Speaker can bring him to order as this debate is restricted to the ambit of the Bill.",66
195,Mr RUDDOCK,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"I will restrict my remarks to the the Bill. Honourable members no doubt will apsort preciate the point I was making. Employment is important. Yet it is quite clear that, in this very important area where a great deal of work could be done and made available for the purpose of employing people, no additional moneys are being provided through this method of funding to employ the additional persons who are out of work in New South Wales or in any of the other States that have been mentioned. I put it to honourable members that the Government could well consider funding additional sewerage works and other expenditures in this area as a method of employing many of the people who are out of work in various places throughout Australia. My speech must progress fairly quickly, as my time is rather limited, to a question that I placed on the notice paper. I think it is a very important question. The Minister may care to give attention to it in considering the comments made during the debate. I put this question on notice on 16 July this year. It is the same as a question which was on the notice paper prior to the dissolution of the Parliament earlier this year. I have asked the Minister for Urban and Regional Development: 1. What is the total sum allocated to each State pursuant to the Sewerage Agreements Act 1973? 2. What are the names of the relevant authorities within each State that have received grants, and what part of the grant mentioned in answer to part 1 was received by these authorities? 3. Have the moneys allocated been collected by the relevant authorities and spent? 4. If so, what works have been completed or subsequendy commenced by the authorities detailed in answer to part 2 and, in particular, what sums have been allocated to each project and spent, and in what Federal Electoral Divisions were these works out or commenced? I make the observation that it appears that some of the information that I have been seeking for some months from the Minister appears to have been made available to at least one honourable member who participated in this debate earlier today. I refer to the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews) who was able to allude in some detail to the manner in which moneys made available through the previous agreement were spent. I regard this as a most serious matter and one to which the Minister ought to address himself when he replies later in this debate. As I understand it, the Gold Coast City Council was offered moneys under the previous agreement-the amount was $750,000-o n the same basis as other authorities had accepted funds. That City Council accepted some $200,000 on those terms. It needs approximately $48.5m to complete its proposed sewerage scheme. A need certainly exists for these moneys. Yet this responsible authority beUeves that it would not be responsible if, for its part, it were to accept money made avaUable on these terms. I think this is a matter which ought to be considered and it would be worthwhile for honourable members to know and to have received by answer, as I should have to a question on notice, particulars of those authorities which have had money offered to them but which have not accepted it because of the nature of the unreasonable terms which the Government has sought to impose. I want to deal with one other matter. When I spoke previously on the principal Bill I drew attention to the importance of a proposed scheme to pump sewage from Sydney over the mountains. Under this scheme sewage would be pumped from those suburbs that have been developed very close to the mountains. This would eUminate the need to pump the sewage from these areas to the seaside and there is a prospect of its being used for farming and agricultural purposes. I observe from an article in the 'National Times' that a gentleman by the name of Sutton has a similar program in mind for the Gosford and Wyong districts. I believe that if this Government wants to embark upon any sort of national program it ought to be looking at the area of fundamental research as it has done in relation to urban road research planning and urban transport research planning. There is a need for fundamental research in this area that the responsible authorities have been unable to undertake.",66
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,Mr M a r t in carried Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,67
197,Mr LAMB,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"In a recent publication issued by the Melbourne and MetropoUtan Board of Works there was a brief description of Melbourne's urgent need for a comprehensive and all-covering sewerage system. It went to great lengths to describe the large stagnant cesspools, stinking mud and a foulsmellingriver.That was an historic piece which described a period 120 years ago when Melbourne was barely a decade old. Those cesspools, that foul-smelling river and stinking mud were in the central business district as we know it now. The problems are no less serious now but I excuse the Board of Works for perhaps being charged with tending to hyperbole with that description today. StUl we have polluted creeks andriversand still we have foul-smelling subsoU in areas where sott trying to cope with septic tank effluent is unable to cope. In 1892 the Board of Works was finally formed and the first sod turned for its project to get work under way. That Board has carried out fine work over many years but it has never caught up with the backunsohcited log, and that is what this Government ing to do with this Bill and its national sewerage program. This Government has a commitment to consequent change that picture-to change the picture from stagnant pools to sweet-smelling creeks, from stagnant program to a program carried out with celerity. We are committed to reverse the trend resulting from decades of neglect. We acted soon as we entered Government in 1972. We buUt have acted since then in full co-operation with State governments. The Sewerage Agreements Bill 1974 appropriates additional funds for sewerage backlog works in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia that were commenced during 1974. This is no centralist, sociaUst plot. is no centralist, sociaUst plan as the honourable members for Petrie (Mr Hodges) and Boothby (Mr MCLeay) would have us believe. at the facts. Let us look at the recent history. As with most initiatives in his portfoUo, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) has sought and obtained full coand operation in most areas which he has developed in regard to the improvement of quaUty of Ufe outer urban areas and growth areas. We have cepted, for instance, those areas identified by States themselves-thos e areas with the greatest need to obtain sewerage for their populations. These areas have been selected on the basis need. They are the areas which have the greatest number of unserviced properties. They are made up mainly of fringe areas and growth centres. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) talked loosely about the results of recent local government elections in New South Wales. However, what he said had Uttle interest. relevance to the debate today. Let me turn to some rather more relevant and more appropriate information for his interest. Whenever I confer with local government bodies in my area most common compUment and observation from the representatives of 6 municipaUties in an covering over 1,000 square miles is that they have seldom been met before by a representative of the Federal Parliament. They are thankful for present the increased funds that flow for area per improvement programs, for regionalisation and community programs and for the host of tury increased funds that come through the Minister's Department, but they are even more impressed the decade. by the increased relationships and conference that they are now able to obtain with their Federal members. This attitude has resulted from change in government. These comments come and, I might add, from conservative is attemptdominated councils. It is certain that the States have been unable to cope with the increase in population and the demands that outstrip facUities, particularly sewerage facUities which are the subject a of this Bill. One and half nullion people who live in houses andflatsin major cities are not connected to adequate sewerage reticulation seras vices. These houses andflatshave been mostly during the last 20 years. A total of 100,000 people are without any sewerage at all in smaller cities of between 20,000 and 60,000 people. The the Government is to supply more money and more funds to those areas covered by the Melbourne and MetropoUtan Board of Works and to the It fringe areas under the control of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. What this Bill does in effect is to get under way quickly the Let us look national sewerage program. In 1973-74 $30m was allocated to the States, as I said, on a needs basis or what might be called an urgency basis. Victoria, Queensland Western Australia gained extrafinancialassistance during the year. This Bill seeks the apin proval for that total backlog sum of $3 8m. Soon acwe will see a change in the terms of the grants. the The Opposition tried to make great capital out of its semantic argument about what is meant by grants. I do not wish to persevere with the arguof ment or delay the business of the House on that score but I want to point out that $95m will be avaUable in 1974-75. This amount is made up of $88m for the larger cities, $5m for smaller centres and $2m for support activities to which some speakers have referred. The grants will be the a mixture; the mix will be of non-repayable grants and loans at the long term bond rate of Without a national sewerage program we could never overcome this backlog. Without this financial assistance and without the initiatives of the the Australian Government, the States alone cannot cope. Already 17 per cent of the popuarea lation are without sewerage services. The estimation of the State authorities is that given their faculties and funding, the population without sewerage in 1982-83 would still be 15 cent. At this rate of a 2 per cent increase in every decade we will be well into the 21st cenbefore we catch up with the backlog. We are committed to overcoming that backlog within A national sewerage program is needed to a overcome the deficiencies of the lack of sewerage. The main emphasis in the national sewerage program in overcoming the backlog through Australian Government assistance will be for the upgrading of trunk mains, head works and treatment works. The main objective here obviously is to protect the environment at outfall points. I think that most honourable members are aware of the deficiencies in sewerage provision. They know that these deficiencies contribute not only to pollution but also to many other urban problems. I want to concentrate mainly on the integration of sewerage services with other urban services. We have heard honourable members speak of the biological survey counts and the sampling that has been done in various waterways. The Environment Protection Authority of Victoria, for instance, found that there were E.coli counts exceeding 200 milligrams to 100 millilitres in the bathing beaches of Port Phillip Bay. Anyone, like myself, who has lived under conditions of the 'nightsoil' approach will be well aware of the problems that that system brings. I mention also the difficulties that are tered in such mountainous areas as the Blue Mountains, the Lofty Ranges and, in my own electorate, the Dandenongs. There, through the lack of adequate sewerage and unsuitable soils for the treatment of septic effluent, we find that the creeks and waterways are extremely polluted. The River Yarra is jeopardising the health of those who live downstream because of the amount of pollution that is carried from waste products and sullage. I understand that the Department of Urban and Regional Development is continuing surveys in this important area and is estimating the relative incidence of disease and other complaints in sewered and unsewered areas. Sewerage services must be provided in a comprehensive and co-ordinated way. The Department quite rightly has placed emphasis on the integration of sewerage provision with city development strategies. Obviously the sewerage facilities should be provided ahead of population in growth areas. Many States are now grappling with the problem. Victoria is to pass legislation that will require all new subdivisions and all new developments to provide sewerage. It should be imperative that in water catchment areas no further development takes place until sewerage is provided. Let me detail to the House the problems providing sewerage in the Dandenong Ranges. It will illustrate well how the provision of sewerage cannot be seen in isolation, but only as part overall urban and regional development plan. Honourable members will be well aware that Dandenong Ranges are about 30 kilometres to the east of Melbourne and cover a large area. It is now undergoing extreme pressures of urbanisation. With an almost exponential rate of growth we find that in the area of the Dandenong Ranges the population during the decade 1961 to 1971 has grown from 31,000 to 51,000. It is estimated that there will be a population of 70,000 people by 1976. It is not only people who will be moving into the Dandenong Ranges; there will be also the services which have to be provided for the people. The pollution of creeks in the Dandenongs is due almost entirely to effluent from septic tanks. This promotes the growth of algae and can change a once clear stream into one with slime and obnoxious odours. A study by the Environment Protection Authority shows that the major cause of pollution is the discharge from houses. The area under survey was polluted by the discharge of sullage and septic tank effluent from domestic properties. The western part of the Dandenongs forms part encoun- of the catchment of the polluted Dandenong Creek. This also includes unsewered residential areas, such as the Upper Ferntree Gully to Belgrave area and the northern slopes of the ranges. Urbanisation causes another important change in the natural condition of creeks. This is the change in peak flow and total run-off of water which creeks must handle. With every extra house that is built an extra area of ground is also covered.This means that the water collected on roofs, footpaths and driveways is channelled into the main drains. The total run-off in urban areas has increased up to tenfold because of this. In a typical Melbourne suburb with one-fifth acre blocks the average percentage of impervious area-roofs , roads and paving which I mentioned-is roughly 40 per cent of the total area, while with half acre blocks the impervious area is reduced to about 20 per cent of the total area. I mention this because we cannot separate the provision of sewerage services from the overall question of urban planning, including the size of blocks in areas which are hard to provide with sewerage services. These services must be seen as an integrated whole. The situation in the Dandenongs is grave enough already, but current town planning schemes allow a large increase in the number of of houses in the Dandenongs. If the trends continue, in less than 20 years the number of houses in the Dandenongs will have trebled and imposof an sible demand will be placed upon natural waterways. These trends cannot be allowed to conthe tinue. One solution would be to provide trunk sewerage faculties. This is many years away. But what can we do to overcome the backlog in towns like Monbulk which have populations of 2,500 to 3,000 so that we can stop immediately the pollution of the waterways and later, perhaps, connect them to the trunk sewerage? Another more feasible solution is the provision of local treatment. The Melbourne and MetropoUtan Board of Works has drawn up plans for several package treatment works for the main residential area of Monbulk, certain areas in Ferntree GuUy and for densely populated areas of the other municipaUty of Knox. The LUlydale Sewerage Authority has drawn up plans for a package plant to service 2,500 people in the township of Monbulk. As I said, the population will be 5,000 within 20 years. The cost of this scheme will be just under $600,000 and will involve a house connection cost of $625. The treatment will be extended to aeration of the effluent, foUowed by sedimentation and chlorination. I should Uke to see those programs included in the backlog program. If we can provide sewerage to the settled areas we can later on connect them to the main trunk sewerage system. But we have a paradox here. If we provide services in the Dandenongs and if we provide sewerage facUities of a full scale nature, it is only natural that the people who are seeking the full services of the quaUty of urban Ufe will gravitate to the Dandenongs and we will see overurbanisation to the consequent damage of the unique character of that area. I cannot stress too much the need to see the national sewerage program as part of an overaU development for urban and regional development. I should like to see as part of every sewerage program which involves Commonwealth Government money an environmental impact statement. It is part of our poUcy that any program financed partly or in whole by Australian Government funds should provide such an impact statement. I believe, for instance, that in the Dandenong Ranges an overaU development plan should be adopted. We should sewer the main towns and then we should demand that adequate septic systems be provided elsewhere. We should limit further residential development. As well as the Government's requiring environmental impact statements as a condition of funding sewerage programs, I should Uke to see innovative investigations carried out by the Department of Urban and Regional Development or the sewerage authorities on other aspects. Older cultures than ours are disgusted at our habit of clearing our noses and carrying the discharge around in our pockets wrapped up carefuUy in a handkerchief. Their poUcy is to eliminate the discharge and to dispose of it immediately. These same advanced cultures see the system of the disposal of sewage that we have adopted as a waste of a valuable resource. I must compliment the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) for raising the possibUity of using this valuable resource for fertilisation. He suggested that perhaps it could be piped over the Blue Mountains. I do not, in commending him for his suggestion, substantiate the feasibUity of the engineering projects. The older cultures of this world certainly show us a thing or two when they employ their sewage resources as a fertiliser. Some of their farms produce excellent crops, assisted only by treated sewage as a fertiliser. I should also Uke to see the innovation of the use of package or modular treatment plants. Where large estates and large developments have taken place there could be a great advance in overcoming the backlog if the national sewerage program could convince the sewerage authorities that they should supply on a rotating rental basis large treatment plants to municipalities. The estates then could be sewered and later joined up to the trunk sewers. The plants could be removed and turned back to the rental centre for another development. Another area for investigation which would be prontable would be to discover why there is a great difference in the charges by the Board of Works and perhaps a sewerage authority for providing sewerage to a municipaUty. I draw as an example information I received that showed that, to sewer a large site on different sides of a street dividing a municipality, the Springvale Sewerage Authority was able to provide comparable sewerage faciUties for half the cost of that requested by the Metropolitan Board of Works. Once again I excuse myself for not being an expert on engineering matters, but it is hard to imagine that differences in soUs, rocks, trenching and the size of pipes would be sufficient to explain the doubling of a quotation for the provision of services by the Board of Works. It is incredible that the other side of the House has decided to support this Bill while it has constantly decried the efforts of the Minister and the achievements of his Department. Honourable members opposite talk much about inflation. The only thing inflated has been their full blown speeches and their bloated words. ProcrastiUve nation and interruption are the greatest infla500,000; tionary factors in raising the cost of overcoming the sewerage backlog. It must be a smooth and continuous program carried out urgently and quickly. I commend the Bill to the House.",67
198,Mr MCVEIGH,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"The in our support Australian Country Party supports the speakers notice from the Liberal Party-the honourable member Development for Boothby (Mr MCLeay), the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges), and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Rudthat dock)-in their acceptance of this legislation behalf of the Opposition. We believe it is a acceptable concept provided justice is done sections of the community. But in supporting the legislation we reserve our right to offer a few comments in an endeavour to update the cess, to clarify the thinking and in some instances to ask for an explanation. I want to comment on the rather startling sense. statement made by the previous speaker, the low quaUty of planning honourable member for La Trobe (Mr at the end of what we might describe in a benevment's faUure in the various for olent mood as a series of diatribes when he said: issues. 'It is incredible that the Opposition is going to support this particular Bill.' It iU behoves any member of the national Parliament to come here with a closed mind and an open mouth when we are debating BiUs of such serious national tance. We on this side of the House cannot will not accept the proposition that the vast reserknowledge voir of knowledgereposesin the people who on the other side of the House - temporaril my friend the honourable member for Boothby said in his enhghtenedremarks-and that nothstand ing whatsoever was done about a national sewerWales age scheme prior to 2 December 1972. This mass monotone of self righteousness, to many of leaves nothing but a sour odour. I think it remarkable to Usten to the speeches of the Government as compared with the speeches from the Opposition, to note that the Governtraining. ment supporters approached this question as an individual Ufe belt to save their sinking electoral appeal in the large cities whereas the honourable members from this side of the House approached it more or less on the basis of a coUective thought of the people who Uve in the isolated areas of the Commonwealth and in areas other than the large cities. I think it is rather pertinent at this have recorded in Hansard to support the arguoutUned ments by the honourable members for Petrie, Parramatta and Boothby that 57.92 per cent the Australian people Uve in urban centres populations of more than 500,000; 6.58 per cent in centres with populations of from 75,000 to 2.52 per cent Uve in centres with populations of from 50,000 to 75,000; 4.9 per cent live in centres with populations of from 20,000 to 50,000; and 4.21 per cent Uve in centres with populations of from 10,000 to 20,000. Therefore, of the Bill we want to bring to the of the Minister for Urban and Regional to seek his (Mr Uren) certain viewpoints and explanation. The Government made great play of the fact this is a national sewerage scheme. I submit on on behalf of the Country Party that when the most Government supporters spoke their promises to aU were flicked back and fourth and sounded as hoUow as a ping pong ball. A problem identified is not a problem solved. There are specific econproomic and social problems that need to be outlined. But without the national framework any poUcy is only directionalist in the strategic basis Any national framework must have as its co-ordination and organisation. In fact, the and organisation can be Lamb), identified as one of the reasons the Governenvironmental Problems have to be identified, explicated and treated as critical issues. There is need, we submit, for a total systems approach in the matter of imporplanning for a national sewerage scheme. We and must view this against the background of the that it has been estimated in a report sit by the Department of Urban and Regional y as Development that the overaU program will involve a sum of the order of $ 1,000m. I underthat 38 separate programs in New South have reached the stage of ministerial examination; 25 in Victoria; 12 in Queensland; us, 14 in South Australia; 19 in Western Australia; was and 10 in Tasmania. Obviously with a scheme of this scope there is a great need for planning, research, operator training and programmer Very Uttle emphasis has been given in the Minister's second reading speech and in the Bill itself-and certainly no emphasis whatever was raft and made in the speeches from Government supporters, although the speakers from the Opposition touched on it-to the very important associated issues of water supply and flood mitigation works. I cannot visualise how any national stage to sewerage scheme can be programmed and without adequate attention being paid to the avaUabUity of water supply and also of adequate flood mitigation works. Both of these with elements surely must be part and parcel of an overall scheme. It was disturbing, particularly to honourable members who have practical experience, to realise that these very important and associated factors were not included in the nauonai sewerage scheme as it has been delivered to us. In the twentieth century one of the great things that will concern man and society is the problem of pollution. It is good to note that one of the reasons why we are having a progam as outlined and one of the reasons why an extra Bill has been brought down to make moneys available to 3 States to help them overcome their particular problem is the matter of pollution. Historically pollution has been tolerated by society where resources have been judged to be too plentiful be greatly damaged or dismantled by it But one of the great causes of pollution, as was comteU mented on by various speakers, is the serious problem which arises from the pumping of sewage from pipes located close to or on our beaches. Not only is sewage in many instances for. untreated but a large proportion of the population of our various metropoUtan cities and towns is not even connected to a sewerage syswas tem. We submit that this stage of affairs is hardly appropriate to this century. It is more akin to turning back of the clock to the middle ages. well as presenting a health threat to swimmers, some of the constituents of sewage are blamed for environmental problems such as the killing vegetation on our sand dunes and our beaches. There is a very great need to set standards any national sewerage scheme because the cost of purification becomes disproportionately high if absolute purity is desired. A laboratory chemiof cal 99 per cent pure might be fourtimesas exincluded pensive as a similar chemical only 95 per cent pure. Thus the cost of poUution prevention as far as sewerage is concerned is very dependent what levels of impurities are acceptable. I submit that the following five approaches might made to the problem of setting standards: These approaches could be based, firstly, on health aspects, which would involve doctors and sciengood, tists; secondly, mental health aspects, which would involve psychologists and social scientists; thirdly, the number of complaints from the comToowoomba munity; fourthly, cost benefits, which would inpoint volve economists; and, fifthly, absolutism, which would involve some environmentalists. As in consumer protection the first consideration should always be the safety of the human and environment. The trouble is that scientists very Uttle about the facts of threshold levels of poisons in the body. So in looking at the problem of a national sewerage scheme, it is very necessposal ary to make sure that we estabUsh our standards and to make these standards acceptable to toleration so that human society is not threatened. The Opposition wants to state how pleased it is that the Budget has aUocated $125m in the next year for sewerage works in an endeavour to improve the quahty of Ufe. We submit that this aUocation is very essential because there are still vast areas of Australia which need to have sewerage connected or septic tanks installed. It has been estimated that 50 per cent of the rural areas of Queensland are not sewered. I compliment the honourable member for Petrie on his very forceful exposition of the position in Queensland. I want to reinforce some of his remarks. I would to Uke the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), who is at the table, to the people of Australia why the Queensland Government's application for a $2m loan was raw turned down and why the Government has granted only half of the amount that was asked The honourable member for Petrie spelt out in very great detaU the break-up of the $3.1m that aUocated under the 1973 legislation. Most of that money- I think he said $ 1.8m-wa s to go to the Brisbane and the rest was to go to the Gold Coast As and the Shires of Albert and Pine. The honourable member pointed out that under the new legislation which we are discussing now the Gold of Coast, which still has a substantial area to be sewered, is not included in the allocation. We want the Minister to teU us why the Queensland in Government is being granted only half of the amount for which it appUed, particularly in view of the fact that a very large and favourable area Australia- I refer to the Gold Coast-is not in the allocation provided by this Bill. The Bill provides for $lm, $400,000 of which is for the construction of a treatment works at Lugon gage Point; and $600,000 of which is for a pumping station at Eagle Farm. We all realise be that there has been tremendous progress in Queensland, and this has been as a result of the favourable cUmate created by many years of sound, stable government. The City of Brisbane is 90 per cent sewered; TownsvUle is 95 per cent sewered; Rockhampton and the city of are fully sewered It is reasonable to out that one of the positive reasons that this has happened has been the encouragement given to the local authorities in Queensland by the Local Government Department, the Treasurer the Government of that State in allocating a know 40 per cent subsidy for sewerage works. We want to know why under this present prono subsidy is being given to encourage other areas to have this very desirable amenity. We want to know why the Australian Governparticipate ment is saying that these areas can have this finance. amount of loan money but is not providing a corresponding subsidy. In effect the Government is forWe saying: 'You can have this money term bond interest rate'. I understand that is 8.9 ment's regional per cent over 40 years. I support the advanced by the honourable member for Petrie nature could provide work project when he asked the Mmister to let us know why unemployed. I ask the Minister for Urban he will not follow the magnificent example of Country-Liberal Government in Queensland providing a subsidy to local government authoriCameron) ties. It is important to realise also that the proposal of this Labor Government under the original legislauon actually referred to money being made available only to cities with a population more than 60,000. We submit that this is a most unreasonable outlook because it denies people who live in rural towns and rural cities access this type offinance.I realise that, following representations made from this side of the Housedebt and from governments which do not share the same political faith as the Government in the control of the national Parhament, the money will be made available to cities with a population of more than 20,000 people. But there are counbeen try towns which do not have size, and we submit that they are also entitled to have this amenity. Additionally it should be pointed out that people who live in the smaller country towns often have to pay for a scheme to to or not have it at all. Certain parts of a city can be sewered and the cost spread over all of the ratepayers. The consequent effect on each of the ratepayers is very marginal. But in a counthe try area such a cost could create great personal hardship when a whole area is sewered. Such scheme cannot be cut off in midstream because usually takes a period of 3 years to complete project once the plans and specifications have been drawn up. I submit that it is veiy essential proposal should be extended to include smaller country towns, particularly when we realise as a means of decentralisation elderly being encouraged to retire to these smaller counsaid, try towns where they are close to their friends, close to the environment into which they have been born and in which they have grown up and to which as members of the community they have contributed. We would prefer them to stay in these rural towns rather than lose their identity Mr as cogs in a machine in the big city areas. One way in which encouragement could be given is allow the smaller countiy towns-that is, towns with a population well under 20,000-t in the distribution of this government submit that a good case could be made out at the long sewerage tocountry those towns which do not have be given a grant under the Governunemployment scheme. This arguments then could be a continuing for and by its very people who are and the Regional Development to take up with the Minof ister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde the fact that some assistance could be given to country towns which do not have sewerage under the regional unemployment grant scheme. We submit that sewerage is an everyday necessity and it should not be the subject of a of cheap political football, as some honourable members have used it in this debate. We want to point out also that unless positive moves are to made to implement the spending of this money as soon as possible there will be an increasing on the local authorities in the years to come, not only because money is too dear but also because of the fact that since December 1972 we have experienced a massive increase in the inflation rate. I understand that the inflation rate has reliably assessed now at an all-time high of populations of this 20 per cent. I want to conclude by correcting a few misstatements of fact which were made by none in other than our leading citizen, the Prime large Minister (Mr Whitlam). One would expect that he at least would check the facts before making a pubhc statement so that he knows he is telling truth. I say this quite honestly because at Townsville last weekend the Prime Minister of a this country, in an endeavour to humiliate and it disparage the greatest Australian and the Queenslander in the person of Mr Joh BjelkePetersen, either resorted to the position of saying something about which he did not know the facts or resorted to the position of deliberately telling that the present untruths. that Mr Lucock-Hi s credibility is in question. people are Mr MCVEIGH-As the member for Lyne his credibility is in question, and I think we appreciate that remark coming from a man ofhis outstanding honesty and integrity. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) said that Townsville was eligible for assistance under the Labor Government's national sewerage program in 1973-74. Bjelke-Petersen would not take the money, the Prime Minister said. I submit that already into his second reading speech the Minister has said those that Queensland applied for $2m but the o Government is going to give them only $lm. Queensland asked for twice as much as it got. Yet the Prime Minister goes up to Townsville and says that Mr Bjelke-Petersen would not take the money. I leave it to the people of the nauon to judge who was right and who was wrong. The Prime Minister said at Townsville: 'The other States are getting on with the job. Why should the people of Queensland put up with unsewered houses because of Mr Bjelke-Petersen's dislike Canberra'. What hypocrisy! The member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) spelt out some facts quite plicitly in relation to Queensland and I complireticulation ment him on the great amount of research he did to let honourable members know the posiuon there. He spelt those things out. I submit that thefinalanalysis if the Prime Minister wants go running around Queensland making statehave ments which are inaccurate and totally off-beam, setting out to humiliate a great man, it should the Prime Minister who carries the can.",71
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POSITION OF, the Order! The honourable member's dme has Bay-Bolton expired.,74
200,Mr MORRIS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF," Mr Deputy Speaker, the provision of sewerage facilities basic health service and it is pleasing to note the Opposition supports the Sewerage Agreesistance ment Bill 1974 which, on receiving royal assent, will provide $3.95m to Victoria, $l m to menced. Queensland and $3m to Western Australia for the further reduction of sewerage backlogs. Previous Opposition speakers have criticised proposition that this money is in the form of term loans. The facts are that it was the Austhe traUan Labor Party which years ago accepted Federal responsibiUty for the provision of basic health service. The Opposition needs reminded that it was during the rapid urbanisamorning tion that occurred throughout 23 years of succonstruction cessive Liberal Party-Country Party administraper tions prior to December 1972 that tion of the present sewerage backlog was built up. During that 23 years there was a deUberate avoidance by Liberal Party-Country Party governments of the responsibiUty to assist sewerage construction authorities of Australia in meeting their works programs. This Australian Labor Government, the Prime Minister (Mr of Whitlam) and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) are to be commended for the speed with which they have moved to implement the promises made prior to the 1972 Federal election. The Sewerage Agreement Act 1973 approprithe ated $30m of loan funds at the long term rate to the States for backlog sewerage works 1973-74. This amount was additional to the normal aUocation of loan money made each year to the States. The addition of $7.95m provided by this Bill makes a total of $37.95m for 1973-74. If there had not been a change to the Australian Labor Government in December 1972 not one cent would have been provided for the purposes covered by this Bill. That is something the Oppoof sition might well note, much as it may grieve honourable members opposite. It is worth noting exalso that the 1973-74 program included 81 projects, 35 main, sub-main and carrier sewer projects, 6 pumping stations and 10 treatment plants. In my electorate of Shortland, in as a result of this Government's assistance to the to Hunter District Water Board in the past year we seen the speeding up of the major sewerage construction scheme at Warners Bay Southbe Eleebana-Valentine, the conduct of preparatory ground water tests at the low lying areas of Blacksmiths-PeUcan, and the commencement of sewerage construction scheme at Fennell Point. These 3 areas abut the foreshores of Lake Macquarie, the most beautiful salt water lake in Australia, a lake into which flow presently 19 surcharge and sewage outlets is a and a lake which was destined to become a that sewage swamp unless urgent measures of as to the Hunter District Water Board, as provided by this Labor Government, had comLong term loan funds amounting to $1.2m the were made avaUable to the Hunter District long Water Board in 1973-74 and I am hopeful that Board will receive a much larger sum in the Budget provisions.

Mr MCLeay-Not good enough.",74
201,Mr MORRIS,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Nothing would be good the enough for you. This Government has repeatedly reaffirmed its pledge to upgrade the quality of our environment, and sewerage is a major part that upgrading process. This Bill is further evidence of our determination to carry out that pledge. EarUer I mentioned Lake Macquarie and the 19 surcharge and sewage outlets that discharge into its waters. The polluted liquids that enter the lake, particularly at times of heavy rain, have a detrimental effect on the waters and on marine Ufe of the lake. It is not reasonable to bond expect the Hunter District Water Board to in shoulder the blame for the present position. It is expending in excess of 50c in the $ 1 of its present revenue to service the existing debt, as is the with most other major sewerage construction authorities in Australia today. The Board is limit ited in the amount it can raise by way of rate revenue from home owners. It needs approxima-one tely $125m now if it is to eliminate the total backlog of works in its region and construct ad-tioned equate treatment facilities. Blacksmiths-Pehcan, which has been settled for over 70 years and is an outer suburb of Newcastle adjacent to the Pacificloans. Highway, is still serviced by a nightcart sanitary pan service, a service of which the residents not proud, a service which lends odours summer nights when the population of the area is increased by the influx of holiday makers, especially when the cans spill over. A few miles from Lake Macquarie on the ocean shores of Nine Mile Beach sewage Belmont and adjacent areas is discharged raw into the sea without any treatment whatsoever, a member. completely unsatisfactory situation. I bring this to the attention of the Minister because I want him in the not too distant future to inspect Nine Mile Beach outlet and the Blacksmithsinclude Pehcan area in general to see the damage beingsidised caused to the area and the harm being caused the environment and to see the conditions which the residents live. I know the Hunter Dis-inflated. trict Water Board wants to construct a treatmentresources. works, but it needs the money and I hope that Minister, once having inspected the existing vices, will want to see a proper treatment works established so that the effluent being dischargedreportinto the sea will be of an acceptable standard. Just a few miles further north up the coast at Burwood Beach is another Hunter District Board sewage outlet into the ocean. There is simple screening process at the outlet which the only process carried out before the effluent discharged into the sea at a rate ranging from million gallons up to 60 milhon gallons daily. Dependent on prevailing currents and winds, effluent moves north to the beaches in the electotally torate of my colleague, the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) or south down coastline of my own electorate. Again, the struction of suitable treatment works will involve expenditure in the region of $8m to $15m, depending on the length of the outward pipe sea. Clearly, projects of this magnitude cannot financed internally by the Hunter District Water Board. The kind of assistance being provided this legislation by the Australian Labor ment to the States of Victoria, Western Austrahayears and Queensland is what is needed by the Huntergovernment District Water Board. Criticism has been levelled at this Government caseby previous Opposition speakers because this Bill provides long term loan money. They claim that all should be by way of a non-repayable grant. And these are the people who would not provide cent over a period of 23 years to sewerage construction authorities. I have already menthe Minister's statement that the funds in the 1974-75 program will be 30 per cent non-repayable grants and 70 per cent long term It must be emphasised that when funds are made available on a non-repayable basis to are develop services consideration should be given to the the fact that unless the charges",74

Without the financial assistance that is being provided by this program of the Government to overcome the sewerage backlog and if the responsible present sewerage authorities were left to the financial resources that existed December 1972, the present backlog would extend well into the twenty-first century. as a result of the programs initiated by this Government in 1973 it is confidently expected that the backlog wiU be eliminated by 1982-83. The deficiency in past sewerage provisions by Liberal-Country Party govermments has concUity. tributed in varying degrees to other urban probexamined lems. A major one has been the pollution of ocean, lake and river waters. The deficiency in the sewerage system of East Melbourne has resulted in the poUution of beaches in nearby Port PhiUip Bay. Water samplings there showing E.coU counts above the maximum permissible ation levels have been consistently recorded. Mr MCLeay-What is E.coU?",75

WhUe much has been said on both sides of chamber about the domestic needs of sewerage services Uttle has been said about the disposal Uquid industrial wastes. The acceptable disposal of Uquid industrial wastes is a most difficult lem that is facing most of our industrialised population centres. For instance in the Hunter Valley region, remembering that Australia's first steelworks were built in Newcastle 59 1915, there is no authorised or satisfactory facUity for the disposal of Uquid industrial waste. Newcastle and the Hunter Valley region-the capital of our nation-d o not have that facUity. Successive State and Federal governments ignored that deficiency for 59 years. The result has been the progressive pollution of ground water, streams and rivers. DaUy deleterious substances are discharged into those waters. As yet there is no firm proposal to establish works to treat Uquid industrial waste so that it may be discharged as an effluent of an acceptable quaUty into the waterways of the region. proper disposal of persistent and hazardous Uquid industrial waste is a problem that plagues industrial cities.

206,Mr UREN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"in reply-I summing up the debate on the motion for the second reading of this Bill I would like to point out that this is the end of the allocation for first year's program. The legislation would been carried through tofinalityifthe double solution had not been brought about. Requests were made by each of the States. Actually if had made available the expenditure that was required to meet our commitments we would have had to make available $83m in the first financial year. The situation is that with the State governments and the sewerage authorities we found out that both men and material were not available. So we had set up fore Cabinet a program for a $50m expenditure and a $30m expenditure. We took the lower figure in the first year because we were congrams. cerned about the problems that were being caused in the construction industry due to the pressure for both men and material. We stated quite clearly to the States that they could carry out programs in excess of figure we would do our best to meet their requests. Consequently in relation to environmental matters in connection with Port Phillip Bay the Premier of Victoria sought a further $3.95m. We agreed to that program. That in clarifies the situation in relation to Victoria. had set up its program in anticipation. Because it was said that unless a further $3m was made available last year-that amount was requested last year by the Minister for Works in the former Labor Government, Mr Jamieson - were anti-Labor unemployment would occur in that sector, the money requested was made available. From Queensland there was a request for $2m. This proposal was discussed and an agreement internal reached with the Queensland authorities. Enorchanged mous pressure had been imposed on men and materials in clearing up the flood problem Queensland. The Australian Government made cent. more than $50m available for work in the ton region. This money enabled works and repairs to be carried out and compensation to paid. Mr Hodges-Were the discussions with Clem Jones?",77
207,Mr UREN,ECONOMIC POSITION OF,"Our discussions in Queensland Inflation were with the Co-ordinator-General's Departcommenced ment. If honourable members were aware of the discussions that took place with the States would realise that in the proposed program in other programs to overcome urban problems there has been a spirit of co-operation and co-ormaterials dination. Sewerage is an enormous problem. spokesman for the Opposition, the honourn able member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay), said it would cost $ 1,000m to catch up with the sewerage backlog in Victoria. The present estimate of the the total cost of a works program to attain the have objective of sewerage of all urban areas of disAustralia is $3,800m at June 1974 prices. The contribution required from the Australian we Government is likely to be about 40 per cent of that amount. The Australian Government will be making available approximately $ 1,500m. I announced this morning that there will be new in discussionsfinancial agreements. Criticism has been made of thefinancialarberangements. I stress that in most cases an antiLabor adrninistration was responsible for the current need for the proposed sewerage proIt was during the 23 years of mismanagement by previous Liberal-Country Party governments in the Federal sphere that the enormous State debt burden was created. I ask honourable members to bear in mind that it will cost if $3,800m on June 1974 prices to catch up with the that urban sewerage backlog in this nation. This morning I explained that for every $ 1 collected by the Perth authority 50c must be paid to service the debt charge. In Sydney the cost is 52c every $1; in Newcastle 53c, and in Melbourne, Perth where there has been a non-Labor administration since 1955, it will cost 58c in every $ 1 to service the debt charge. Since 1955 Victoria has been administered by Liberal-Country Party forces and, until 1972, in the Federal arena there administrations led, firstly, by Sir Robert Menzies, then by Mr Holt, followed by Mr Gorton and Mr MCMahon. In the Federal arena we had a musical chairs government. The debt of the Federal Government hardly between 1950 and 1973 but the debt of semi-government authorities-sewerag e charges in play an important part-increase d by 2,800 per So let Opposition members not criticise the Morepresent Government. It was the Whitlam Government that said it would try to solve the be sewerage problem as part of an overall urban problem. The honourable member for Boothby referred to inflationary pressures. One of the major objectives of this Government is to curb inflation. was created by private enterprise and it in 1971. In the 2 years from 1971 Australia's overall Uquidity increased by some they $2,000m because in that period our exports and exceeded our imports. However some $3,000m of foreign capitalflowedinto Australia. Men and were in short supply in that period. A The further $2,000m was released by the fringe banking institutions without any control by the then Federal Government. On the question of Uquidity I point out that in 1970-71 the private banks Uquidity was $4,500m, in 1971-72 it was $4,900m and in 1972-73, $5,900m. In May 1974 there was $8,900m or an increase of $2,000m between May 1973 and May 1974. One-third of this was triggered off by the Reserve Bank's expression of opinion that we were in for a massive withdrawal of capital after the December and February appreciations of the Australian dollar. If one examines sanely where inflationary pressures were created, one appreciates that when an enormous amount of capital is infused into the economy in such a way that money is chasing too few goods and too few men and materials, one has an understanding of the real situation. We, as a national Government, are trying to solve these problems. It is incredible to think that in 1974 50 per cent of a city of the magnitude of Perth is unsewered. An anti-Labor Adrninistration has the financial resources to sewer Perth much earUer. It is utterly stupid to think that in this day and age when we can put men on the moon one in every 6 famiUes in Sydney and Melbourne are still living in unsewered areas. From an environmental viewpoint we not only want to sewer aU urban areas but also to make sure that there is environmental protection of all areas, such as Port PhilUp Bay. Perth is concerned about its water supply because in the future it might have to rely on subterranean water. We can no longer permit areas to be unsewered. We must take account of the long term consequences if areas are not sewered. In Brisbane at present what is almost raw sewage is being poured into Moreton Bay. All Australians must be sane about these matters. The Australian Government has a national responsibiUty as part of its interconnected poUcy. It beUeves that everything is connected to everything else in urban living and it is takuig upon itself a responsibiUty to work with State and local authorities in providing sewerage works and in ensuring proper environmental standards for our nation. I commend the Bill to honourable members. As I announced this morning, the money to be made available in the first year of the program will be made avaUable at the long term Commonwealth bond rate and will be repayable over 40 years. These are the best financial terms given to any sewerage authority. The sewerage authorities usuaUy have to pay at least one-half per cent to three-quarters per cent more than the long term Commonwealth bond rate, and instead of being able to repay the loan in 40 years they usually have to repay within 15 to 20 years. When my State coUeagues and I entered into an agreement for the 1973-74 financial year only, I said that when we had more facts and details and more information avaUable I would then put a submission to my Cabinet colleagues for a better financial deal for the States. Having done that, I announced this morning that my coUeagues supported the attitude of my Department and I and had made grants avaUable. The money we are making avaUable is all by way of grant, because it is above the normal loan allocation that is made each year at the Australian Loan Council. All this money is being made avaUable by way of grant under section 96 of the Constitution. In future 30 per cent of it will be provided as an interest free non-repayable grant and the remaining 70 per cent will be provided at the long term Commonwealth bond rate. Those terms will assist the sewerage authorities to improve their environmental levels and lower their debt burden, and will assist the States, local sewerage authorities and local government authorities to get on with the job of sewering all our urban communities. I hope that all honourable members will support the principles as set out for the 1973-74 period of our new on-going 3-year program. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

I That all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to insertof ing the following words in place thereof: 'This House is of the opinion that the Budget fails to tackle Australia's economic crisis, in that: Unemployment is permitted to grow and the prospect school leavers is prejudiced. is accelerated. 3. Existing poverty is ignored and new poverty is created. Personal income tax is increased 45 per cent. 5. Living standards will be lowered. the agree6. Private enterprise is stifled. 7. Government power is further centralised. 8. Individual incentive and thrift is penalised. 9. A double tax is levied on estates. If the and because the Government: has made the Budget a socialist vehicle to intensify attack on the States and break down the free enterprise system. believes the absurdity that the Government can without people paying or can build without people producing. has preached private restraint but has threatened its achievement by its own Government extravagance.' This Budget has failed in the most complete I sense. Within 3 hours of its delivery, the President of the Australian Labor Party forecast the need for a mini-Budget. Its foundations are already crumbling, only 7 days after it was revealed. The Treasurer (Mr Crean) has already said that he is willing to reduce taxes if necessary. Why was this not done in the Budget? This Budget will faU those who are already unemployed 3 o'clock p.m. and those who will be unemployed before Christmas. It will faU those who have already suffered most and who can protect themselves least from the brutal impact of worsening inflaSENATE tion. It will faU Australians who want to develop and buUd this nation through their individual energy and initiative, through their investment and risk-taking. In the truest sense it will faU Australia. It will put the brake on personal and nauonai progress. The growth it will stifle will never be recovered. We will come out of the morass some time but meanume what has been lost will remain forever lost. The Budget bears an economic label. But the documents presented by the Treasurer last Tuesday with his Speech are no more than a masquerade. It is a narrow, cynical and thoroughly disreputable attempt to mount a pohtical survival exercise of a discredited Labor Government. It ignores unemployment. It would have us as a nation accept the abhorrent proposition that unemployment is tolerable so long as it does not reach a level of 4 per cent to 5 per cent. And this from the Party claiming to speak for the working man! This from the self proclaimed guardians of social justice and equity! The Budget is built around continued high inflation. We are to have the worse of both worlds. We are promised inflation at 20 per cent and we are guaranteed unemployment of people and resources. It is a prescription for and a description of stagnation. This Government will forever be remembered as the Government which resorted to the highest unemployment for a generation in pursuit of a blind and callous doctrine of attempting a massive transfer of resources to the public sector. In the broadest sense this is a Budget which blatantly assumes a lowering in the living standards of ordinary Australians. At the same time, it fails to ease the burdens of the very poorest Australians. It goes further. It will create an extra dimension of poverty in this country. There is no more certain way to impoverish a man and his family than by taking away his job. Even if a man loses his job for a few months, it is a setback of major proportions. Unemployment rose in 1972-w e are constantly reminded-bu t we moved to correct it. But the number unemployed is many thousands more today than it was then. That is the magnitude of the problem for which this Government has to answer. NA Let there be not the slightest doubt as to the origins of our current economic problems. They are directly attributable to the policies of this paralysed and divided Government and the irresponsible promises of its election campaigns. The Australian public wonders how, in 20 months, this Government could reduce a stable, prosperous economy to its crippled condition today. The story is simple. Government spending exploded during the first half of 1973. This was extremely inflationary. At a time when the economy was aheady under quite obvious demand pressure, the money fed into the economy rose at a rate of 30 per cent in the June quarter of 1973 and 20 per cent in the September quarter. This was directly due to the Labor Government's expansionary spending pohcies. The Government's Budget deficit in the second half of 1973 was an unprecedented $ 1,860m. There has never been anything like that in the history of this country. There were other pieces of economic stupidity which have already set back the job prospects for tens of thousands of Australian families. Most of them are probably trade unionists who thought a Labor goverament would help them keep their jobs. The 25 per cent across the board tariff cut decision was taken over a weekend, without full consultation, and without the faintest conception of the adjustment problems that it would bring, and has now brought, to certain industries and the towns and cities that depend on them. Launceston, Adelaide and many others know this unhappiness. Next came the credit squeeze. The financial tap was suddenly and brutally turned off. Interest rates jumped to unprecedented levels. Housing mortgages, overdraft borrowing and personal loans jumped many per cent. Growth of money available to the economy dropped to less than 5 per cent. Yet, Labor's policies had pushed wage increases above the 15 per cent range, later to go over 20 per cent, and now estimated in this Budget to be 22.5 per cent. It was natural that unemployment would result. Unknowingly-and this must be said with the greatest charity-the Labor Government had already chosen the unemployment option. Yet, when I said on 31 October last year that these measures would result in rising unemployment and a possible recession in 1974, the Government recklessly waved my statement aside. What I warned against has happened. I will restate what I said then because it is relevant now. I said: The likely result of these measures is that the Government sector will continue to expand-bu t there could be a rapid and sudden cutback in the rate of growth of the money supply. If unemployment is to be avoided, the rate of expansion of liquidity, or the monely supply, needs to be gradually reduced. The inflationary Budget of 1973 produced accelerating demand inflation and inflationary expectations which led to the cost pressures that we have today. A brutal credit squeeze with monetary policy being used too harshly and too late, superimposed on the ill-advised tariff cuts, all combined to produce the unemployment and high inflation that we have today. In its desperate search for excuses the Labor Party has grasped at the argument that inflation was imported. That claim is exposed for the myth that it is by figures released recendy by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Canada United States Japan Australia New Zealand France Germany Italy United Kingdom Belgium Luxembourg Denmark Ireland Netherlands OECD TOTAL(b) OECDEUROPE(b) (a) To latest available period.

They show that under the Labor Government the acceleration in inflation has been greater than in any other OECD countiy. That is what we have to be proud of in its performance. NA A budget should have both term consequences. It should be the major platform of a national government aimed at the achievement of the nation's objectives. By that measure, this Budget fails our destiny. Our national objectives are now endangered. Instead of progressing steadily towards them, we supping back. A fundamental priority is the development of our natural resources and couragement of human skills. For this, we must have growth. Not growth by stops and starts, merely measured in depreciating doUars, but steady, progressive growth which Ufts our stangone dards, improves our prosperity, and gives us the means to go on developing.

Fundamental to this is the other major national objective-fu U employment. The Liberal and Country parties in government followed these objectives and achieved a period of prosperity which Ufted Australia into the middle rank of nations and set us on a road to a bright and conshort and long fident future. During the decade of the sixties, wages rose by an average of Vh per cent a year-oh , for those days-bu t prices rose by an average of only 3 per cent-oh , for those days-and we had full are employment-oh , for those days. Those conditions must be restored. In contrast, since the the encommencement of 1973, the average weekly wage earner has actuaUy lost 2 per cent of his or take home pay through the combined effects of high taxation and high inflation. His pay has up by 25 per cent. But prices have gone up by 20 per cent and his tax has gone up by over 60 per cent. We need to return to an Australia where each individual person can succeed so that the whole community can succeed. We need that overall success to make progress with our other vitally important national objectives: The education of Australians; the care of the aged and retired; the complete ehmination of poverty and the assurance that every Australian is given the opportunity for individual success; first class medical care for all; help for the less developed nations; the protection of the environment; the improvement of our cities and towns. There are many more. The tragedy is that our national objectives are under threat. Our national direction has gone astray under the Labor Government. Those are our long term objectives. To ensure that we can achieve them, these are our short term objectives: First, we must stop unemployment rising and turn it down. Next, we must arrest inflation and turn it down. Then we must ensure that all the resources of this society are fully employed in a proper, sustainable balance between the pubhc and private sectors so that we can progress in a stable and ordered way. That is what the Budget ought to have done. NA The Opposition's economic strategy remains valid. It remains the only coherent program to arrest inflation and restore full employment and stability. This is an indictment of the uselessness of this Budget as an economic prescription. Our program has won gathering support from professional economists and other groups, including many ofthose people who did not at first accept it. While he was still on speaking terms with matters economic, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) temporarily adopted parts of our program-the easy parts. We have set out our policies. They are on the record. We have produced printed papers; we have not talked vaguely of an 'ongoing program'. We produced an economic policy statement prior to the election. I have it in my hand. We reviewed it and published a mid-year economic assessment and review in July. I have that in my hand. The Government was so embarrassed that it refused to allow it to be incorporated in Hansard. On 12 September, prior to the Budget, we set out the Budget strategy and its role in an overall policy, which should have been followed, and I have that in my hand. That statement opened with these words: The 1974 Budget will be crucial in determining the omic situation next year. It must be seen as a major towards creating the conditions a declaration in mflation. The major need in this Budget was to restrain government spending-it still is. This restraint is necessary at the present time for 2 principal reasons. Firstly, if demand inflation does take off again next year, it will be from a much higher underlying base rate than the Labor Party inherited at the beginning of 1973. At that time inflation had accelerated from 4A per cent. In 20 l months of Labor government inflation has accelerated to 16 per cent and higher, and is promised to be 20 per cent in this Budget. Secondly, the credit squeeze has already taken its toll in rising unemployment. Figures released in the coming quarters will also show that our growth is faltering and so is investment activity. This has serious longer term implications. In addition, some companies have already failed, and we fear others will. It is therefore necessary to ease the credit squeeze and set in motion the conditions for a reduction in interest rates. The simple fact is that the greater the responsibility of the Budget in terms of restraining the Government's demand for resources, the more the credit squeeze can be responsibly eased. If the figures presented in this Budget confirm anything, it is the need for a tax cut of the proportions which I and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch), who is the shadow Treasurer, advocated on 12 September. Labor's 2 Budgets-las t year's and this-hav e almost doubled the take from personal income taxes on the community. There has been a 95 per cent increase in taxes in 2 Budgets. Given the assumptions underlying this Budget, it would have been possible to reduce income taxes by $ 1,000m and reduce some indirect taxes, and yet still achieve a domestic balance while permitting an increase in spending of about 25 per cent. It is a tragedy that Labor missed the chance to hold a national conference prior to the Budget. In the action program proposed by the Opposition before the May elections, we advocated the calling together of a national conference prior to the Budget so that a framework for achieving wage restraint could be put to the participants. To hold such a conference after the Budget is to rob it of much of its potential effectiveness, even if meaningful tax cuts had been given, which clearly have not been given. Nevertheless, given the seriousness of the situation and the obvious willingness of some unionists to cooperate, we believe that a national conference is vital. It is still not too late to revise the Budget to hold government spending to a 25 per cent econincrease and to agree to significant tax cuts. The step importance of achieving a workable program of for a recovery in activity and wage and price restraint cannot be overstated. The tragedy is that this Budget threatens any hope of an agreement. Restraint, coupled with the monetary-fiscal pohcy mix that we proposed, is the alternative to unemployment. The band-aid economics of this Budget cannot disguise the real situation. As we made clear, the nauonai conference should be backed up in 3 specific ways. Firsdy, the Government should make it clear that monetary growth will not be expanded at a rate beyond that which is adequate to accommodate increases in incomes and prices in accordance with identified guidelines. Second, we have said that we would not shirk from using powers over prices and incomes as a backup measure in conjunction with the States. Third, the Government should restore and strengthen the authority of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and be prepared tq support the Commission in upholding its awards. At the same time, it would be necessary to retain the Prices Justification Tribunal as an integral part of the restraint policy. Even this Government has been fumbling its way towards some form of a national conference through the Moore conference in August and through this week's national union meetings. There was also the Industrial Peace Conference in December 1973. The most important reason why these attempts failed to produce real and genuine resAustralia traint is that this Government failed to provide the necessary leadership through the estabhshWhen ment of conditions which would allow such national conference to succeed. Those necessary conditions are fundamentally linked with basic economic strategy. The most important of them is real restraint in the rate of growth of Government spending to enable real spending and ing of the credit squeeze. Equally, substantial cuts are essential to success so that the unions can anticipate rises in take-home pay which do not who add to costs. The Government must be prepared to state its total economic program-includin g budgetary policy, its monetary pohcy and its tariff and exchange rate policies. The course of monetary pohcy is crucial economic prospects for the conung and ensuing years. To date, under Labor, we have had phases of monetary policies. The first was rapid expansion in the money supply up to late 1973 when the economy was aheady under deinflation. mand pressure. The second was the credit squeeze phase of 1974, with money supply growth rates approaching zero. What we must aim for in the future is a much steadier growth the money supply, gradually reducing to bring inflation under control without the massive unto employment created by Labor. With wages expected to increase by more than 20 per cent next year, it would be continued insanity to maintain this credit squeeze. I come now to responsibility for the Budget, if anybody can be found to be responsible for it. This Budget is devoid of economic strategy. Who must bear the responsibility for it? The Treasurer was not its author. He was not allowed to be its author. He has forfeited the respect which his former integrity earned him in this place. It gives me no pleasure to say these words, but the situation demands that they be said. Continually he has simply given into the political ambitions and doctrinaire empire buildings of his irresponsible colleagues in Cabinet. By his weakness he has allowed this country to plunge into economic difficulties which will scar Australia's future. His responsibility is exceeded only by the Prime Minister's. For the blame must be first with the Prime Minister, despite his self-confessed economic ignorance, despite his abdication of economic leadership and despite hisfixationwith the most trivial trend or event-so long as it takes place outside Austraha. While the economic fires are burning at home, the Prime Minister is looking for a bit part on the world stage. He will be gone again on Friday. In the next 6 months he will be absent from 1 week in four. It is the classic political receipe of substituting movement for action. in doubt, take a trip-the last resort of the a pohtical lame duck. Whether here or there, the people of Australia remember his words. They have to stay here and face problems. This was the man who put his name to a document called 'It's Time for Leadership'. It was his election easspeech in 1972. Let us recall now what he said tax about the economy then. He said: Will you again entrust the nation's economy to the men deliberately, but needlessly, created Australia's worse unemployment for years? Or to the same men who have its presided over the worse inflation for 20 years? There could be no more an exact description of the past 20 months of Labor mismanagement. to Take another quote from that speech: The Australian Labor Pany see inflation control as the 2 Government's responsibility. Not yours. the Those words come from the man who, as Prime Minister, has abdicated all responsibihty for Because of infighting and contradictions between his Ministers, his Government has failed to reach any economic decision at all between the last election day and Budget night, in except for one thing and that was to reduce the variable deposit requirement from 33% per cent 25 per cent to 5 per cent when it did not matter a damn because there were no overseas people wanting to invest in Australia. Take another quote from that 'It's Time' speech: Labor's first priority will be to restore genuine full employment-witnou t qualification, without hedging. The simple fact, without qualification and without hedging, is that the present level of 2.3 per cent unemployed is the highest in 10 years. It will get worse, as the Treasurer said, as the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) said, as the Prime Minister said and as the Minister for Labor and Immigradon (Mr Clyde Cameron) said. In fact there was a veritable rush to plead the Fifth Amendment by the whole lot of them as to how much unemployment there would be. It is the direct result of the decision by this Government to impose the credit squeeze. What increased about the Prime Minister's other window dressments. ing efforts in that 1972 speech? He promised growth rate of 6 to 7 per cent a year. In this Budper get, the Treasury has forecast 2 per cent. I quote again: Labor will trust the people. That is what we were told. Is here? He was not here to listen to the He was teeing up an overseas visit. Have you, the as those on incomes up to $14,000 Prime Minister, told the people that during the was next year you are planning dehberately to lower for pre-school education and child care, their standards of Uving? No, you have not told man who promised that his Budget would them that. Yet that is a fundamental assumption of this Budget. Members of the Labor Party canish not even trust each other-w e are there are Ministers who accept and peddle Ues. They are not identified and they are not because the Prime Minister lacks the honesty declare them and lacks the power to sack them. So much for 1972. Let me catalogue the Perhaps further catastrophes of 1974 which have deson 18 September troyed the Prime Minister's credibUity. He told him say: us on 7 May last, in a prepared written statement, that: Our policies are now beginning to work . . . Price increases are now slowing down as Government policies take full effect. This trend will be confirmed in coming months . . . We are sure that the June quaner will confirm that the inflation trend is downwards. He said this 11 days before the election for the simple reason that he wanted to insinuate himself into office and was not concerned to teU the truth that he must then have known. He told the Premiers Conference a month later; that is, in June this year The public sector is trying to increase its spending than the availablity of resources will permit. This is especially true of capital expenditures . . .We must now slow the rate of increase in Government spending. Some phasing down or deferment of some expenditure plans must occur. They were the words of the Prime Minister at the Premiers Conference in this very chamber. What happened to that one? The States were plunged into a Budget crisis. Their taxes and charges are going up and their works programs are barely being maintained. But when it came to the Federal Budget we saw a massiveriseof one-third in Government spending. Before the election he told David Frost that Government spending would rise by only 20 per cent. That would only match the inflation that the Budget promises. Then there were the Prime Minister's words spoken only 4 days before the last election: I see no reason why taxes, direct or indirect, need to be in order to pay for any of our continuing commita Revenues only go up by a third-mor e than 30 cent! TeU that to the elderly 'capitaUsts' who will pay an extra levy on the earnings they have invested, or to the widow paying capital gains tax as well as estate duty on her decesased husband's the Prime Minister Minister'sduring earnings his Ufe. This foUows the Prime Treasurer. dle income earners,todefined promise cut taxes for low and midin pre-election terms a year. This the man who promised $ 130m in his Budget and the abolthe means test on pensions for those aged betold now that tween 70 and 74 years. Remember the election advertisement: 'Only sacked Whitlam has a program for child care'. to Remember the election advertisements: 'Only Whitlam can reduce inflation by a third'. able if he left it might happen. If any honourmembers were watching 'A Current Affair' 1972 they would have heard There'll be less industrial disputes under us, I'm sure of that. Compare that with 4.2 million man days lost in thefirsthalf of this year. This is the man who has broken his written assurances to the people of the Baltic states, the man who told Australia's rural producers that they had never had it so good, the self styled greatest Foreign Minister of them all. It is not true that he is going Zaire on his next trip. The trinity of blame is completed by the Deputy Prime Minister who is the real perpetrafaster tor of this disaster called a Budget. His commitment to political dogma, his constant self contradictions, his wUlingness to blame the system and convert it into a massive state controlled machine, dominate the Budget outcome. The Deputy Prime Minister's commitments are sufficiently flexible to allow him to be all things to all men. He can destroy the Treasurer's miniBudget with a casual comment on a talk back program 12 hours after its deUvery. He can want wages to go up on Wednesday and to come down on Saturday. He can want to ease the squeeze and get headlines for it, and 2 weeks later to put it on again. With an economic manager of such impressive inconsistency in control is it any wonder that confidence has disappeared and that there is a feeling of fear and worry about the future which is befuddling the future of every Australian? NA This Budget is a document which reveals with brutal clarity how far astray the Labor Party is in understanding the real aspirations of Australians, let alone knowing how to fulful them. It is predicated on the assumption that the union movement will accept this Budget as a sign of good faith and in return begin to exercise the restraint we so desperately require. If we are talking of real and genuine restraint, as opposed to window dressing, it is a gamble at near impossible odds. This is what the Labor Party is saying to the unions-Thes e are my quotes-and one can just hear it being said in those secret conclaves where the unions and the Labor Party come together: 'We give you inflation at 20 per cent. We give you unemployment. We give you the most massive increase in personal taxation in history. Now what are you going to give us in return?' How can you expect restraint on those terms? The proposition only needs to be stated for its absurdity to be clear. It is certainly clear to the President of the Queensland Trades and Labor Council, Mr Egerton, who I understood used to be the Prime Minister's confidant. NA One sentence, on page 3 of the Budget speech, discloses its purpose. Opposition members-Her e comes the great man now.",81
224,Mr SNEDDEN,THE BUDGET AND THE PRIVATE,"We have been exposing Prime Minister's inconsistencies. We have been disclosing the untruths that he has peddled. He under-estimate, might have to declare himself as one colleagues who accept and peddle Ues. At page of the Budget Speech this passage appears: The relatively subdued conditions vate sector provide thefirstreal opportunity we have transfer resources to the public sector. The Budget aggregates disclose the means. Overall spending is up 32.4 per cent; domestic spending is up 33.2 per cent; receipts are up 30.8 per cent; and income taxes are up 45 per cent. Mr Katter-And Australia is up the creek.",85
225,Mr SNEDDEN,THE BUDGET AND THE PRIVATE,"You are not suggesting that was Hiawatha that came in? Let us examine what Labor's 2 budgets have done. In 2 years Government spending will have risen 59 per cent, total receipts wiU have risen 65 per cent and income taxes will have risen 95 per cent. Is it any wonder we are in a mess, with such structural strains imposed on the economy? This is big government out of control, going beyond the Umits of responsibility. The private sector has been squeezed and battered, unemployment has been created, the public sector will claim a rich slice of real resources, and the Labor Party hopes that it can take up unemployment by putting people on the pubUc payroll. That is a dream that has already become a nightmare. But its victims are not the Government; its victims have been the people wanting to buy homes. Its victims have been people aheady thrown out of work and young Australians who will leave school in a few months time to face the biggest job shortage for more than a decade. Its victims are the small businesses which make up the major portion of industrial, manufacturing and commercial strength. Its victims include those people who make up the great rural and mining industries. For all of them, this is a Budget of iUusion and delusion. NA With dispassionate fatalism the Budget accepts an increase in average weekly earnings during thisfinancialyear of 22.5 per cent, which, on the kindest and most charitable view, predicts an inflation rate of 20 per cent. The Treasury, SECTOR however, as distinct from the Treasurer, clearly expects that this may turn out to be a conservative figure. On page 88, in Statement No. 4, the Treasury cautions: In present circumstances this average earnings assumption is even more uncertain that usual. the The Treasury goes on to say: To the extent that the assumption should involve an inflation and the effect of inflation on the of his Budget will be that much greater. 3 We should not forget that this is the Labor Party's second successive Budget which is deUberately inflationary. But let us look at the in prospect in the prihad to one objective it claims will be achieved-the achievement of restraint of wage demands. On the morning after its presentation-and what lot of heavy heads there were on the morning after-the finance editor of the 'Age' wrote: How this can be expected to have any demonstrable in contributing to restraint in wage demands is beyond I wish he were wrong, but an analysis of the facts shows that he is correct. One of the central assumptions of this Budget is that there will deterioration in the standard of living of the average Austrahan, whether he be the family man, the trade unionist, the small businessman or the retired person. Against a wage rise forecast at 22.5 per cent, it suggests price rises at 20 cent. From the 2.5 per cent left over the Budget proposes this unhappy catalogue for the ordinary Austrahan. The Budget will take 46 per cent more from you in personal income tax. For those of you who are lucky enough to homes, the Government will keep your repayments at record high levels by keeping interest rates up. Those of you who do not own your own homes may never be able to afford one. But the Government will ensure that you pay higher rent because of its new taxes on unearned income. Of course, every one of you will have to pay the increased postal charges and the higher charges and taxes imposed by the State governwe ments, because Mr Whitlam thought, for six seven weeks back in June or July, that governshould ments should restrain their spending. Of course, when it came to the Federal Government he had forgotten about it. But you will not have to for radio and television listening any more, the trade off for that is that the next step in on. abolishing the means test will be deferred for a year. Restraint in wages by co-operation by the trade unions must be a prime objective. The President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions is asked to deliver a guarantee of real traint. He may get a nice sounding resolutionset of words proclaiming supportforrestraint or, as Mr Laurie Short said last night, some other euphemism-bu t in the context of the Budget handed down last Tuesday night it could not real. The Prime Minister's words last night were destructive today of any chance of co-operation between the Government and the trade unions. NA Unemployment has been caused by the squeeze. The fundamental measure which is required to restore confidence, and to restore ployment opportunities, is an easing of the credit squeeze. The jobs that have been lost in the vate sector can, and should, be re-absorbed the private sector. Now is the time to stimulate a the private sector and restrain government spending; not the opposite. Yet, by opting for continued heavy reliance on monetary pohcy, effect the Budget will do nothing to achieve an early me. improvement in the availability of jobs, an improvement which is urgently needed before the labour market is subjected to the inflow of school leavers at Christmas. Will Mr Hawke get be a the supplementary Budget which he told me on Budget night he would require from the Government once unemployment reaches 3 per cent or his subsequently lessenedfigureof 140,000? At the present rate of increase in unemployment per that must be only a matter of weeks away. If he does, will it include an easing of the credit squeeze, as he says he wishes to have to provide jobs? It should. It would be right. Yet, at the same time, he wants to increase further the own your own Government's spending. The second part is a recipe for deeper troubles and is not reconcilable with easing the credit squeeze. I ask a question of the House, of the Treasurer, of the Prime Minister, of the Minister for Overseas Trade. If these things are to be done why were they not done in the Budget? Why do have to have increasing inflation and increasor ing unemployment before they are done? It be understood that if the Prime Minister has his way-that is, easier credit plus more government spending-the result will be another pay splurge of demand inflation during next year, and together with even higher unemployment later When are we to see the next mini-Budget? Is this going to be the Budget with the shortest life on record? The arithmetic which showed a domestic surplus has been superseded by later derescisions. The direction of monetary policy will be a of crucial importance to trends in the economy next year. Yet the strategy of the Budget relies on a continuation of the credit squeeze that has already caused so much damage. Both the be Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister repeatedly contradict themselves and one another on the direction of monetary pohcy. Yet on reading through the Budget papers onefinds,for the first time in my memory, that there is no specific statement relating to monetary policy. The Budcredit get assumes that the average number of employed will grow in 1974-75 by only 2 per emcent. Last year the increase was 4.5 per cent. With the potential work force likely to rise by priwell over 2 per cent in 1974-75, this Budget is by assuming a rise in unemployment. It assumes, and accepts, and ignores stagflation. NA Another major aspect of this Budget, the Government would have us beheve, is the so called cuts in taxation. They are both illusory and dishonest They are not meaningful tax cuts at all. Because of the effect of the progressive scales against the background of the Budget prediction of a 22.5 per cent increase in average weekly earnings, the vast majority of Austrahans will be paying record increased taxes. If income tax deductions are to rise 46 per cent, I say to the Government: Please do not try to pretend that the majority of Austrahans will be better off. That will not fool any of the people any of the time. In the week prior to the presentation of this Budget. I set out publicly the clear proposals of the Liberal and Country parties for a responsible overall Budget strategy. Austrahans are now well aware that the Opposition has for many months been advocating substantial and meaningful reductions in personal taxation as a responsible economic measure. The personal income tax situation in Australia today is really quite appalling. In 1972-73 income tax collections amounted to $4,089m. I do wish the Treasurer would write the figures down. Obviously he is unaware of them. In the next year, 1973-74, which concluded on 30 June last, tax collections amounted to $5,490m-ar t increase of $l,400m. In 1974-75-this year-collection s are estimated to reach $7,966m. I stated then, in advance of this Budget, that personal income tax collections must be pruned by at least $900m to produce a cut in income tax averaging more than 10 per cent. This would range from more than 20 per cent at the low income end, tapering off at the higher income level. The imposition of a capital gains tax will to be examined against the detailed legislation. For example, it is not equitable to tax a capital gain which is due solely to the effects of inflation. The Treasurer himself was unable to answer question conceniing the details of this measure asked last week by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) who is certainly precise at all times and was precise in that question. Treasurer fumbled and bumbled. The surcharge on property income is a regressive, damaging and divisive tax. It is a tax on thrift It is a hard work. It is inequitable. It places a tax charge on the elderly person who invested. It will act as a deterrent to savings and investments. It will be passed on to those people who pay rents, including many poor people. NA This Budget should have been directed towards the achievement of real growth, not only because we need growth in Australia to provide the schools, the hospitals, the defence capacity and the resources for our other national objectives, but also because productivity increase can be a major factor in reducing inflation. Yet, far from setting out to increase the productive capacity of the economy this Budget sets out to do precisely the opposite. It imposes a new tax on so-called property income, thus reducing the income to be earned from committing savings to the installation of new physical assets. The continued imposts on the insurance compames strike further at one of the major sources of capital to finance development in this country. Those people who have been paying to insurance pohcies all these years will get yet another rebuff when they see the reduced bonuses this year for every one of their insurance policies. The confused arguments of the Fitzgerald report on the mining industry are reflected in the tax measures taken against most branches of the rnining industry. The Government will regret very greatly this precipitate decision. The Budget leaves the investment climate in disarray. The prospect of rapidly rising costs and the harsh impact of new taxes when combined with the severe monetary restraints cannot help curtail spending on new plant and equipment. But without new plant and equipment the industrial structure will be aging. It will not be incorporating the latest technology. This means a downturn in productivity. It will not expand the supply of resources in the economy, which is the only long term cure for inflation. What does this mean for future employment? The answers are clear. The present ill conceived pohcies work against productivity gains, against increasing the flow of need resources, and against the expansion of employment Does the Government really wish to push the work force, or such ofit as is employed, into partnership with an increasingly old fashioned a stock of industrial machinery and assets? 1973-74, this past year, was declared by Labor Ministers as a boom year, yet the growth of the The non-farm product, that is, the industrial and manufacturing sector of our community, was less at 5.6 per cent than was achieved in the previous tax on 10 years under a Liberal government at 5.63 per surcent. Page 8 of the Budget statements states the has saved and outlook for 1974-75: It is clear that the pace ofeconomic activity in 1974-75 will be much more subdued than it was in 1973-74. . . Over much of the year aggregate demand is expected to tively weak and the level of unemployment is expected increase. What we got from this Labor Government was a downturn in activity, an upturn in unemployment and an escalation in inflation. That is its record of non-achievement. NA NA In 1973 the Government made much of the importance of imports for increasing the flow of resources available to the economy. Imports were to be stimulated through upvaluation of the dollar and reduction of tariffs so as to provide more resources and increase the competitive environment in the economy. This rise in imports came about early this year. What now confronts the economy is a continued acceleration in costs, prices and wages and the flow of imports. Excess demand has gone from much of the economy, costs continue to accelerate in their upward spiral and imports become more and more competitive with local manufacturers. The disturbing feature of the situation is the lack of any comment in the Budget on Australia's international position. There is no mention of how resources are going to be directed, not to the pubUc sector but to restore stabUity in a rapidly worsening external position. Clearly on such a sensitive issue the Treasurer cannot make explicit the policy guideUnes he is working to. But the absence of any comment heightens uncertainty and gives fuel to speculation about the future of the exchange rate of the Australian dollar. Such omissions are an abrogation of responsibiUty. In this area, as in so many others, the Opposition has filled the valuum by stating a pohcy- a poUcy for breaking the Unk with the United States dollar, a pokey for a flexible exchange rate and a policy for the development of an Australian exchange market. NA The other great faUure of this Budget lies in its distortion of priorities. There are massive increases for urban and regional development and for culture and recreation but the Budget largely ignores the interim report of the Henderson inquiry into poverty. Page 9 of that report says more about this Budget than anything in the Budget papers themselves. I quote from it: In spite of the measures taken to increase pensions and benefits in recent years, inflation has prevented much progress being achieved in the reduction of poverty. What then Ues ahead with inflation at 20 per cent? For pensioners the future is clear. It ped out in the Budgetfigures.Pensions are not be relabe reviewed until autumn 1975, the end of the to financial year. By then, the Budget assumes, average weekly earnings will have increased by 22.5 per cent to over $157 a week. By then, the June quarter, in autumn of 1975, the present pension wiU be equal to 19.7 per cent of average weekly earnings. It would require then about $10 a week increase to achieve the poUcy platform on which the Government was elected of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The Budget completely ignores the major recommendation of the Henderson report which concerns child endowment. Let me read this part of the report of the Henderson committee about child endowment: Poverty amongst children is most damaging to the community in the long run. Children in poverty lack opportunities to develop their abilities to benefit from education and to learn skills and may well become poor, unskilled people and inmates of institutions. Thus, measures to reduce poverty amongst large families deserve very high priority. The Opposition believes that this area should have received higher priority in the Budget than almost any other. I stated this before the Budget. There is a complete absence of any housing policy in the Budget. Nothing is more indicative of the Government's failure in housing than its allocation of $25m for an Australian housing corporation. AU we have seen are task forces and committees. Meanwhile, more and more people have been unable to buy homes and interest rates have gone higher and higher. The scheme of income tax deductions for home mortgage interest is a bad scheme. It is inequitable and does nothing for those who do not own their own homes. It will cost $130m which could be better aUocated-for example, towards a general tax cut. This will be smaU compensation to homeowners who have had to find conservatively $300m more in increased interest rates- $ 100m more in annual loan repayment for every increase of one per cent in interest rates. This is a social inequity which is the product of socialism. The second Labor Budget once again neglects Australia's defence needs. There will be a decline in defence spending this year in real terms. This is the Government that promised to spend 3.5 per cent of gross national product on our defence. This year's aUocation of $l,500m will represent no more than 2A per cent of gross l national product in 1974-75. WhUst education spending has been very substantially increased, this has been overtaken by the incredible and inept decision to reduce taxis mapation deductions for education expenses from to $400 to $150. It is a decision that will force a great number of parents to withdraw their children from private schools-no t high income parents, but low and middle income parents. It is a decision which in itself requires the Government to spend more than would otherwise be necessary. We strongly oppose the treatment handed out to the States. The Budget provides for large increases in spending by the Commonwealth. At the same time, the States have been squeezed to the extent that they are raising their taxes and charges in order to maintain essential services and to cover their budgets. The Premiers have been forced into imposing inflationary taxes. At a time when the rural sctor is in revolt inflation. against the Government's neglect this Budget does nothing to restore confidence countryside. The new taxes will hit many in the The country. The Government has already absolished the petroleum products subsidy the superphosphate bounty. The increased postal charges will hit the countryman. Labor has writFor ten off country electorates; it has therefore writbusiness ten off the country. The Labor Government has a divisive attitude. It seeks to promote the the interests of rural and urban Austrahans are in conflict. In fact both sectors are interdependent. employment. The success of one depends on other. NA The only consistent thing about has been the community's reaction to it, a tion which is summarised in the 'Australian' torial of the morning after: The crisis confronting this country is not a matter ing the redistribution of income, riages for commuter rail lines, important as these things are in their way. It is a matter of inflation, and rising ment. Mr Crean's Budget does nothing at all about the one, and will probably tend to accentuate the other . . . The 'Sydney Morning Herald' wrote: Last night's Budget is hardly an economic document at all and can be viewed much more accurately as the vehicle for the Government's political programs . . . We are in for a period of stagflation. The' Daily Telegraph' wrote: The nation looked in vain last night if it sought from the Australian Government.

It also said: The Budget strategy is based on inflation or, worse, on stagflation: On wage increases of 22.5 per cent with an increase in the gross domestic product Could all those people have been wrong? What of the afternoon newspapers? The 'Melbourne Herald'said: The Budget is therefore not a calculation of our economic course in the coming fiscal year, rather it is a statement of political socialist action. And the strong possibility is that it is an unworkable, dangerous gamble. The Sydney' Sun' wrote: Last night's Budget was deceptive to a point only just short of being dishonest . . .

But for this leadership faltering, directionless Government it is never time. It has wilfully and negligently thrown away this chance to guide our national progress. There is no better way in which to express this failure than to quote the words of the Prime Minister when he opened the election campaign on 29 April-jus t 5 months ago. He said: In Australia alone, unemployment and inflauon do not of a paltry 2 per cent. march side by side. That is what he told us. What a travesty has become. They do now. This Budget has masSnedden sively failed the Austrahan people.",85
226,Mr SPEAKER,CONCLUSION,"Order! Is the amendment ments seconded? Mr Lynch- I second it, Mr Speaker.",90
227,Mr RIORDAN,CONCLUSION,"We have just listened to a very dull and dreary speech by pretender to the throne. It was a speech which was irresponsible, capricious and full of absurddid ity. It was a speech which was designed to troy confidence in the Australian was also a speech in which reference was made to the 'crippled economy'. Those were the words used by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr SnedBudget den). Of course, of those who came to Usten him some dozed off and some did not pay attentolerable tion. Attempts by the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) to enliven the debate were rebuffed in verysense. vigorous style. Of course, we have heard everylet thing that the Leader of the Opposition said many times before. In fact it was a rehash of the old stuff that he trotted out in paign earUer this year. As he quoted from Press Every reports perhaps I can qoute from the editorials take on the speeches which he made at thattimeand we will perhaps some of his own comments. On 13 April of this year the 'Sydney Morning Herald' said: To be plain, the Opposition's economic policy expounded does not stand up to economic analysis. We have heard it again tonight. On 1 May the We 'Australian Financial Review'said: Not even the most generous analyst could conclude that Mr Snedden's policy speech last mght provided anything like a credible solution to the problem he himself denned, that of inflation. His anti-inflation policy is not credible. That criticism could not be levelled at him night. No criticism could be levelled at his inflation policy tonight because he did not have one. He stood here as naked of ideas as one possibly imagine-carping , harping criticism as BiUy the wolf huffed and puffed at the door of Prime Minister's Lodge trying to get in, but breath was heard behind the door. Not a single suggestion did he make as to how he would cope with the problems that confront our economy and the problems that confront the economies every nation in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. On 10 May the things 'Australian Financial Review' said: Snedden's proposals have not excited too much tionThat also appUed tonight as half of his supinterest porters went to sleepor serious debate because nobody even marginally involved in politics takes them seriously. that On 6 July the Melbourne 'Age' said: is still trying to convince the electorate that he has soft options which will cure inflation. There aren't any. If there were Mr Whitlam's Government and other Govermthroughout the Western world would have already implemented them and inflation would no longer exist as an international problem. That is what the Press thought of the Opposition's economic poUcy at thetimethe Leader of the the Opposition suggested those solutions. He acted with poltiical cowardice tonight because he not put forward one single suggestion as to deshow the alternative government would come to economy. It grips with this problem. The Leader of the Opposition said that the ignores the unemployment situation. He to claimed that the Government accepts that it is to have 4 per cent to 5 per cent of the work force unemployed. That suggestion is nonIt is not supportable in any way. However, me cite what occurred in 1971 and let me remind the Australian electorate that the words used tonight have a famiUarring.On 15 April the election cam1971 Mr Snedden said: country which has created or permitted unemployment as a weapon against inflation has failed miserably. We full employment as a cardinal act of political faith and not resort to unemployment to achieve our objective. That is almost what he said tonight. But in a speech just 9 months later when he was reviewas so far ing the 1971 Budget and the dismal unemployment figures which appeared at that time he said: have achieved what we set out to do in that we have created an environment in which over award payments are depressed. In other words he had achieved a situation in which the unions-the working man-ha d less bargaining power. Therefore he deliberately tocreated unemployment. Somebody said that the antiunemployment figures are worse now. In fact, they are not. At that time they were standing at could 120,574 persons on a gready reduced work force; so the percentage was significantly higher. the The Leader of the Opposition has claimed that not a some of the decisions made by the Government are wrong. He said that one of those is on the question of interest rates. The Leader of the Opposition has a rather remarkable record on that of subject because he has been known to be slightly contradictory on it. He has advocated many in relation to the question of interest rates. For example he advocated that they should go attenup or said they might go up, they should go down or they might stay as they are. In referring to rates on 1 AprU he said they could go stUl higher. On 10 April he said they would be reduced immediately. On 19 April he said they could not be reduced. On the morning of 1 May he said he could not guarantee that they would not go up. In the afternoon of 1 May he said he believed they probably would rise. Surely a person who makes that sort of contradictory statement is in no position to come into this Parliament tonight and criticise what has been done. He also claimed that the inflation rate in Austraha was greater than in any other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Of course that is not correct. He also failed to say that during the period when those who were born to rule-the category mob-were in control, Australia had the lowest growth rate of any OECD country. I refer to the years between 1967 and 1972. Let us examine the facts of this situation. They do not bear out what the Leader of the Opposition said. For example for the year ended July 1974 retail prices increased in Japan by 25.2 France by 14.4 per cent; in Italy by 18.9 per cent; in the United Kingdom by 17.1 per cent; in Belgium by 13.7 per cent; in Canada by 11.3 per cent with 5.6 per cent unemployment; in the United States of America by 11.7 per cent with 5.3 per cent unemployment; in Denmark by 15.9 per cent; in Portugal by 25.9 per cent-the unions can hardly be blamed for that situation there cause Portugal does not have any unions; in Spain by 15.2 per cent; in Turkey by 25.9 per cent and in Australia by 14.4 per cent. figures are all from the same source-the OECD survey. We have heard an aUegation that the national directions have gone astray. We admit we have changed direction. There is no question about It is quite deUberate and intended. No longer the multi-national corporations rule Austraha. No longer do the rich and powerful friends those in Opposition call the tune. No longer the rnining corporations allowed to dictate tax they will deign to pay. Is there not a reaction to this situation? The developers, the fly-by-night developers and the land speculators are the people who are crying and their allies, their Uttle puppeteers, come in here tonight to cry and whinge on their behalf. The deprived people of Australia, as seen by the Opposition, are the land speculators, the mining corporations and those involved in foreign takeovers which have been prevented. Of course we change direction. Massive sums of money are now avaUable for schools, hospitals and homes. Massive sums are being spent on education, on training the work force and on preparing the work force to the needs of this community. One could go on at great length in talking about what the Leader of the Opposition said tonight, but let us examine some of the basic facts. Inflation has existed in Australia for a very long time. Since the end of World War II economists and political leaders have been decrying inflation. Year by year we have been told that next year there would be ruin. I can clearly recall that when the basic wage was increased by f 1 a week in 1949 the people were told that the economy could never stand it. I also recall at the end of A 1949 a Liberal-Country Party government being elected in Australia on the promise that it would put value back in the pound yet in 1950 Australia experienced the highest rate of price increase ever in its history-a n increase of 23 per cent or about half as much again as the worse that has occurred under the guidance of the Whitlam per cent; in Labor Government. Of course there was demand inflation. What caused that? Let us examine the causes of the demand inflation which was with us until a couple of months ago. First there was a reservoir of debemand buUt up. It was buUt up because of the uncertainties which resulted from the economic policies of the previous Government during 1971 These and 1972. Unemployment was deliberately created by the Liberal Party to put the working man in his place. Secondly there was the faUure of previous governments to provide a manpower and traming poUcy to aUow suflicient skUled manpower to be available to produce the goods it. and services required by the community. The do Chamber of Manufactures and the Bank of New South Wales, two reasonably regarded nonof socialist organisations, conducted a survey are earUer this year with respect to productive cawhat pacity. For the March quarter 1974 the survey illustrated that 42 per cent of the respondents said that they could not keep up to maximum production because of labour shortages and 29 per cent said it was because of material shortages. In June 1974, 35 per cent blamed labour shortages and 28 per cent blamed material shortages. The survey illustrated that 52 per cent of all labour shortages was with respect to skUled tradesmen. There were not suflicient tradesmen because the guUty men, who are now in their place in Opposition, refused to spend a reasonable sum on training. They aUowed in the building industry the introduction of a pernicious meet system which had as its very objective the destruction of skUled tradesmen. It was the most predictable tiling one could imagine when subcontracting was introduced into building construction. It was obvious that there would inevitably be a shortage of skilled tradesmen because of the lack of apprentices. A survey by the Department of Manufacturing Industry showed that in the March quarter of 1974 61 per cent of all manufacturers had less than their maximum productive capacity because of labour shortages. Many factors bring this situation about. One substantial factor is the lack of training which the Opposition when in government was prepared to tolerate and did nothing to correct. However that is not the case with this Government This Government has been quick off the mark to provide for additional training for both young people, with additional technical colleges and improved educational facilities, and adults, with a scheme for their retraining. Our economy is basically sound and no huffing and puffing by the Leader of the Opposition or those who follow him can make it unsound. Unemployment levels at present are higher than the Government is prepared to accept and initiatives are already under way to overcome this problem. Production levels have been booming. No matter where one looks production levels have been running at record rates. For instance last year 30 per cent more houses were built than during the last year of the Liberal-Country Party regime. What is more, $25m allocated for housing to the State governments of Victoria and New South Wales could not be spent- $ 16m in New South Wales and $9m in Victoria. It could not be spent because resources of materials and manpower simply were not available. Tonight I want to deal with one particular aspect of inflation, namely, oil prices. It is pletely unacceptable for the Leader of the Oppodistortion, sition to try to impose the burden of inflation this Government as though inflation operated nowhere else in the world and it was something that had been dreamed up by the Whitlam $ 1500mGovernment after December 1972. The facts are that there has been a massive escalation in the price of oil which is having its effect both in terms of costs and prices and liquidity throughout the whole industrially developed world. An extra US$60,000m will be spent by OECD countries a result of the increase of the price of oil. It very well to try to shrug that fact aside. It means that very substantial sums of money are being taken out of certain economies and placed into others. It means that inevitably money becomes tight and that costs go up. We have felt the brunt ofit here in Australia in both directions. Mr Sullivan-Why?",90
228,Mr RIORDAN,CONCLUSION,"My friend asks why. I am glad he is still awake. I will tell him why, if he does not know it. Australia, because of the nature of its trade, pays freight both ways. Therefore, the cost of freight has risen with the cost of fuel. Australia also needs to import 30 per cent of its fuel, and fuel costs have gone up by some 282 per cent. Australia also needs to import for its basic industries certain chemicals which cannot be produced here, and the cost of these chemicals has gone up by about 80 per cent. We have also had an increase in the cost of tool steels and materials of that kind, on which Australia's secondary industries depend. Inflation is a world problem which is recognised by responsible world leaders. The current acceleration of the rate of inflation is what is causing concern. It is causing so much concern that President Ford and Dr Kissinger of the United States of America sawfitto address the General Assembly of the United Nations on the subject in the last 24 hours. It is quite irresponsible for the person who aspires to the position of Prime Minister of Australia to try to shrug off the matter on the basis that it is somehow the direct responsibility of this Government. I would like to refer briefly to 2 other matters before I conclude my remarks. The Leader of the Opposition refened to comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) which he claims destroyed any chance of Government co-operation with the unions. That was cheap and it showed ignorance of the real situation. The Prime Minister's comments to which the Leader of the Opposition referred can be made difficult if one takes them out of context, as the Leader of the Opposition has done. But he is not fooling comanybody. Nobody is influenced by that sort of by taking tilings out of context. The on Leader of the Opposition referred to the matter of education. He said that the increase this Government has given for education-som e",92
229,Mr REYNOLDS,CONCLUSION,It has trebled.,92
230,Mr RIORDAN,CONCLUSION,"As my friend the honourable member for Barton says, the Government's as expenditure on education has trebled over the is all last 18 months. The Leader of the Opposition said that the benefit of that increase has been overtaken by the decision to reduce the deduction that may be claimed for taxation purposes, from $400 to $150.1I have heard this argument. I am fed up with all the hypocrisy that is inherent in it, irrespective of the source from which the criticism comes. The fact is that in 1972 the previous Liberal Government gave an allowance of $50 per primary school child and $68 per secondary school child in a regional Catholic school. Next year as a result of the Budget the allowance will be increased to $163 for each child in a primary school and $260 for each child in a secondary school. That is an increase of 300 per cent and yet the Leader of the Opposition had the gall to stand here",92
231,Mr SPEAKER,CONCLUSION,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The honourable member for Mitchell now has the call, but I would like to remind the House that he is making his maiden speech and I ask all honourable members to extend the usual courtesy.",93
232,Mr CADMAN,CONCLUSION,"In assuming my seat in this place, I cannot leave unsaid a ute to my predecessors who have made such an outstanding contribution to Austraha, the people of MitcheU, and the Liberal Party. I pay tribute to Mr Roy Wheeler who was the member for MitcheU for 4 terms and who was held in the highest esteem by the many people who knew his kindly good nature. We pay tribute to his service. It is not 2 years since Mr Les Irwin, CBE., left this place after 9 years of dedicated service to the people of MitcheU. It was his boast that he knew each school in the electorate and that he had never been out of the electorate for a hoUday or on parliamentary business, except for the pUgrimage he made with many others to the site of the first landing of the ANZACs at GalUpoU. I suppose that the story that I value most of Les Irwin is one which portrays his forthright and indomitable spirit. It is the story of him walking down the front steps of Parliament House after an all night sitting, and as the sun was rising over Canberra, singing in his powerful voice: 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning'. His friends wiU be pleased to know that he and his charming wife Maudie are both well and are achieving outstanding success in otherfields. Mr Roy Wheeler and Mr Les Irwin have set a tradition in MitcheU which will provide me with goals to which to aspireIt will be my honest endeavour to fill my position as member for MitcheU with the understanding and forceful activity that my predecessors demonstrated. The electorate of MitcheU is the largest in South Wales and the third largest in Australia. is one of the fastest growing areas in New Wales, but as yet this area has not attracted much attention. Constant submissions from local government bodies and individual groups are required so that the needs of such a fast growing area can receive attention for what can only diagnosed as a population explosion. The admirable community traits of civic pride and involvement seem to go unrecognised. When a city expands, great pressures are placed on all services that must be suppUed to the outer fringe, be it water, sewerage-w e have spoken of that matter today-roadways , schools or community centres. The effect of spreading a large city can have unthought of ramifications. The social and physical problems of adding another population centre or a band to the outer fringe of a city attract more comments on the profits of developers than the real problems that foUow the subdivisions. The vital, simple things of living are often overlooked. When houses and roadways are buUt, about one-third of the land's surface is sealed by the trib- houses, concrete footpaths, roads and gutters which are impervious and shed all water. When rain faUs the run-off, once the soU is saturated, increases by 50 per cent. On a normal houseblock one inch of rain is equivalent to 6,500 gaUons of water. Over 2,000 gallons are shed by roofs, pathways and roadways. In Toongabbie, Pendle Hill, Wentworthville, Seven HUls, Prospect, Winston HUls and Baulkham HUls this happens many thousands oftimeover from every block of land. AU the surplus runs into one shallow creek-Toongabbi e Creek. When heavy rain faUs on a catchment of this size, within a couple of hours the waterways are brimming and arefloodinginto houses that were buUt far above flood levels 12 years ago. FamUies are forced out of their houses. There have been fataUties. Yet there has been no interest from any authority. Parramatta City Council cannot be expected to cope with such a problem that extends into at least 4 other local government areas. In mostfloodsearly this year, roads were cut and famUies forced out of their homes 3 times within a few days. If this waterway is cleaned and channelled, the volume of water which would reach the main centre of Parramatta would be such that water would buUd up against Lennox Bridge and the whole business section would beflooded.The Mayfloodswere only 9 inches from doing this. The project is a huge one. New I have heard it said that before results can be It satisfactory, Parramatta River should be South deepened by commencing dredging of rock and sand at Ryde at a rough cost of $200m. Instead of appointing experts, it is time that priorities set by the people and not by someone remote from the place of concern are attended to. If the large be increase in funds that the Department of Urban and Regional Development is to collect is to service people and not the institution, then immediate steps should be taken to appoint a survey team to investigate this problem. It is a huge and growing one. Every additional square foot of road or roof in these western suburbs increases run-off area and brings the centre ofParramatta closer to a major flood. Building of homes cannot be stopped entirely. People Uving with the threat of increasingly serious floods reaUse that there is a very serious drainage crisis to be dealt with. Let me move now to the other end of the MitcheU electorate. This is served by 2 capable and dedicated local government bodies-Wind sor Municipal Council and Colo Shire Council. But here we see people forced to travel 200 miles to work or to receive medical treatment under great difficulties whenever the Hawkesbury River floods. Great hardship is experienced by famiUes with sick chUdren when they have to get UI chUdren medical attention. A total of 9 days schooling has been missed by children in a period of 14 days. The urgent need agreed upon by both councUs and residents was the need for flood-free access. The cost to a community, and continuing cost in terms of State communications to the west of the State, makes the priorities by people and their local representatives top priorities. When priorities other than those set the residents or their representatives take prefinished cedence over needs, even if the scheme is most commendable, waste and distrust set in. Even important projects in the area Uke plantimportant ing trees-ther e would be no local government area in the whole of the country with more trees than the Colo Shire-and even more important projects such as the buUding of civic centres, surely must pale into insignificance when combe pared with the Uves, health and well-being people. If we are to have priorities set, let that done by those who know what they need and not by some remote person. If the Federal funds jobs. already put into the towns of Windsor, Richmond and districts had been appUed to urgent bridgeworks, there would now be no serious disconsiderations ruption or hardship intimesof flood. I am afraid I have another small untruth add to those being told about tariffs and imports. The mushroom industry is at the moment under consideration by the Industries Assistance mission. Protection is being sought for the indusit try against imports of mushrooms from the have broughtRepubUc of China and Taiwan, which have doubled. Over 50 per cent of the production of mushrooms comes from the electorate of Mitchell where 600 people will lose employment within 6 montlis unless there is a recognition that a modern, technologically advanced industry which has pulled itself up by the bootstraps is worth saving. The IAC must be convinced that this industry is worth-saving. The mushroom industry is one of the most advanced industries in the world, with yields matching those of any country. Efficiency is extremely high. Across the board decisions on tariffs and a constant puU of the United States dollar have made it possible for imports to double in quantity and value during the last 12 months. If it is Government policy to change the face of industry, hard working individuals cannot be subjected to instant about face. The Australian Mushroom Growers Association has acted in a most responsible manner to cause this matter to be brought before the Commission. But if the answer is no, no one who works in any industry that can be attacked by imports is safe in his or her job. Surely for the protection of workers and jobs, we need to stop importing unemployment. Last week we heard much of decentralisation. a Many authorities consider that the way to successful decentralisation is the decentraUsation of set industry and provision of jobs in country areas. Part of the problem of establishing new indusby tries is the cost of transporting raw materials and products and the cost of day to day overheads, of which telephone and telex communications are an important part. The decentralisation of Government departments plays an part in providing access to departments without the need to have constant reference to a centralised office, be it in Sydney, Melbourne or Canberra. Jobs for the clerk, computer operator, concretor and the truckie need to provided at all times in a decentralised situof ation. But above aU there must be continuing be growth of employment so that families can stay together when children go out to find their first All parties represented here pay attention to decentralisation in their platforms. This week of special assistance to the textUe industry in country areas are taking place. The town of Riverstone has a small population. It is to about 30 miles from Sydney- a country town based on a meat works and a woollen mill. I point out that 12 months ago the mUl employed Com117 workers. Now it has only 24 employees and is likely to close. Monetary shifts and tariff cuts Mr Snedden-Who was it who accepted a entire Australian level that high?",93
233,Mr CABMAN,CONCLUSION,"I am telling a small untruth at the moment. Monetary and tariff cuts have brought down to slow motion the machines which formerly worked 146 hours a week and are now working 34 hours a week. Why? The answer is a doubling of the importation of knitting material from South Africa-no t from China but from South Africa-and the imports are synthetics. How can proper decentralisation be seriously considered when mills like this one- I am talking about a mill that established a preshrunk system and the set crease system with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation-and those in outer country areas are closing without any chance of replacement, affecting men who have given their whole workmg Uves to learn a skill that cannot be picked up overnight in any retraining scheme? Australians dedicated to the manufacture of Australian products cannot be thoughtlessly left to die on the vine. All that is spoken about the deprived western suburbs is basically true, I suppose. But it is true of many other areas. Australian people cantrue not be categorised. That may be necessary plying statistics so that people how such things as buying trousers and homes are related, but it cannot be done without an understanding of Ufe style and pecuUar lems. Categorisation will continue to divide community and produce frictions that are almost unknown in this country. I object just as strongly to terms Uke 'workers' and 'employers'. Very few people do not work. To categorise and label them wiU produce resentment and spUts. the suburbs of Toongabbie, Winston Hills, Baulkham Hills and Castle HiU, there are the needs that can be found in any western suburb. These include young people with young famiUes, mortgages, interest rate problems and cost of ing stresses. Winston Hills has a total population of 18,000 people. The largest age group is from 0 to 4 years. The average age of a home There is no pubUc hall, no swimming pool, and no pre-school kindergarten. The community uses what is affectionately known as the 'cow shed' because that is what it was until the Winston HUls Progress Association, with voluntary labour, refurnished the old dairy to be used meeting room for district organisations. WUl a budget of 'reform and progress to make contribution.

At a time when responsible family managers are finding it more and more difficult to make ends meet the proposed additional Government expenditure when most people are taking in their belts and starting to reaUse that they have to look after their jobs, the Government has announced that the reply to such a climate is 'More of the same'.

234,Mr HURFORD,CONCLUSION,"It is my pleasure to foUow the normal traditions of this probHouse and to congratulate the honourable the member for MitcheU (Mr Cadman) on his maiden speech. It has been a hurdle well cleared. Although we look forward to further contributions from him I hope, if I may say so, that they to are not made too often because this energetic In Australian Government of ours has a tremendous amount of legislation to pass and the days and the sittings are already very long. It is good to hear that Les Irwin is well. I visited Gallipoli with him in 1971. However, Les Irwin will UvreadUy understand it when I say that I would like to see his quiet and determined successor, Mr Ashley-Brown, back in this Parliament. I am sorry that the honourable member for MitcheU did not pay a well deserved tribute to Mr Ashleyis 8 years. Brown, as I now do. The 1974 Budget debate has commenced tonight with a speech from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden). Already his effort has been demolished in no uncertain way by the as a honourable member for Phillip (Mr Riordan). However, I shall return later to his disappointing At this point I would Uke to put into of perspective the economic situation in which we ourselves. 'Exceptional strains' is the phrase to used by the Treasurer (Mr Crean) in his Budget artispeech. When the Australian Labor Government so took over the reins of office in December 1972 there were 4 factors affecting the economy of the country. The first was that funds were flowing in as they had never flowed in before. We were awash with overseas funds. It was hot money expecting a revaluation of our currency, and the funds of wise investors overseas who realised that our assets were cheap. Why was this so? It was so because of a criminally negligent decision of the Liberal-Country Party Government in allowing our currency to be well below its true value, its market value, from the time of the Smithsonian agreement in December 1971. For one whole year-1972- I use the phrase again, we were awash with funds. The 'filthy lucre', to use a colloquialism, was running out of the bankers'ears. That was not all. In December 1972 Australia was beginning to suffer from the August 1972 Budget. Who was the author of this Budget? Who was mainly responsible for that disastrous document? None other than the Leader of the Opposition who has been preaching to us at his selfrighteousbest tonight. He it was who was the author of an inflationary Budget, a domestic deficit Budget at a time when the corner had been turned, when caution was required. What was the motive for his extravagance for which we are all paying now? It was none other than the need to buy votes or to attempt to buy votes for the inevitable election at the end of 1972. That was the second factor confronting the new Australian Labor Government when it took over in December 1972. The third factor which caused the demand inflation which this country suffered for the next 18 months-w e make no bones about it-until about the middle of this year, all during 1973 and halfway through 1974, can also be laid firmly at the feet of the Liberal-Country Party Opposition. That third factor was the pent up savings of the community just about to be unleashed in a wave of spending with the new aura of confidence which came with the new Labor Government. The wave of spending during 1973 was the result of the stagflation which we had suffered in 1972. Unemployment had risen to over 200,000, over 2 per cent. People were afraid to spend. The election of the Australian Labor Government brought change and new confidence. Citizens began to spend thensavings. The recession caused by the slashing of Government expenditure by the Gorton Government-this is something which was advocated all through this year and last year by the Snedden Opposition and which would have givenriseto a much worse unemployment situation now-and by a recessionary Budget in August 1971, was at an end when the Labor Government took over. People were at last prepared to spend their savings. But we had a price to pay for this additional factor of Liberal-Country Party folly in the demand inflation of 1973. The fourth factor which confronted the Government when it took over in December 1972 was the phenomenon of world inflation. For our size in terms of population, we are one of the great trading nations of the world. We are not self supporting like the United States of America. We cannot build a wall around us. We are very vulnerable to what is going on in the rest of the world. One of the clear and unmistakable characteristics of the recent past has been that the more a trading nation one is the greater is its vulnerability to inflation. Look at Japan. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Pnillip, the report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development shows that Japan had an inflation rate of over 25 per cent. I would like to repeat the figures given by the OECD as at 30 June 1974 which were outlined by the honourable member for Phillip. I believe they are worth repeating. In fact there were 11 countries of the Western world whose rate of inflation was worse than Austraha's rate of 14.4 per cent in that financial year. In addition to Japan which had a rate of inflation of 25 per cent, Italy had a rate of 18.9 per cent, Britain 17.1 per cent, Denmark 15.9 per cent, Ireland 16.2 per cent, Finland 16.2 per cent, Greece 31.8 per cent, Iceland 43.8 per cent, Portugal 25.9 per cent, Spain 15.2 per cent, and Turkey 25.9 per cent. These are only the figures for OECD countries. They do not include countries Uke the PhUippines, Malaysia and ThaUand in our own part of the world, which I have just visited and which also suffered badly from this world phenomenon-w e can even call it a world malaise or a world Ulness. That part of the world, namely the Western world, which runs the capitalist system, the mixed economy and the world trading type system such as our own, has been in the grips of a world boom. The price of commodities has rocketed upwards. One of the main causes of this has been too much Uquidity floating around in the world system. A big reason for this was the deficitfinancingof the United States in order to pay for the disastrous Vietnam war. But exacerbating this, as was also mentioned by the honourable member for Phillip, has been the energy crisis and the deeds of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in pushing up the cost of their scarce commodity-the hydrocarbons, the energy and fuel upon which we have become so dependent. This was the econinflict omic situation inherited by the Australian Labor Government. Four dominant factors bedevil us. I repeat them. The first was the under-valuation of our currency for a whole year due to the folly of our predecessors. The second was the buying votes inflationary Liberal-Country Party Budget in August 1972. The third was that nobody was spending because there was no confidence we took over. This was soon to be converted a spending spree. These 3 factors clearly caused by the Opposition which now preaches us all. The fourth factor was a world influenced harsher. illness, inflation, so much of which was being imported. How has this been tackled? Fifteen days after we took office on 2 December 1972 the Governknown ment acted promptly with the up-valuation of our currency. There were howls from the Oppothe sition against this move. I notice that there is hardly a whimper now. Hardly anybody in this country would suggest that that was a wrong move to take at the time. If they did they would be completely economically ignorant. There was the calling up of the specialreservedeposits. was a method of the central bank to control the amount of bank lending by the trading banks. This was prompdy done after the taking over of government. We nave noticed the opposite hapOpposition pening now as the special reserve deposits are being released. There was the cutting of tariffs 25 per cent across the board- a courageous itical decision-in July 1973. We were over backwards to let down this boom gently, known in the rest of the world as a soft landing. Japan also is trying to experience this. However, this was not enough. There was another upget valuation of the currency in September. This had insufficient effect on businessmen's expecbrought tations. Therefore this had to lead to the further policy to overcome the boom when we were forpast. ced into the November 1973 monetary measures of higher interest rates. - Nobody would suggest that higher interest rates are something that a government would like to impose. But it was necessary in order to mop up the excess liquidity in the community. was necessary, I repeat, to make government bonds more attractive-to siphon off excess liquidity from the community. The alternative was to tax this away from the people. I have heard the Opposition claiming that this is what would have done. So we had the unfortunate effect of a flow-on from the higher interest into the housing sphere. We all know these adabout verse effects. No one in his right mind would this upon the community unless it was vitally necessary, particularly someone who has not a majority in both Houses of the Parliament and cannot govern with security for even the short period of 3 years. Yet, this courageous decision was taken because it was the only decision to take. This perspective is necessary. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) has been living in cloud cuckoo land. One year ago the cry was: before Too much demand; shortages everywhere; intosomething has to be done. It was done. Even were though what was done was with the greatest to gentleness, we were blamed for not being If we had followed the advice that was coming from opposite we would have frozen wages and frozen prices and by now we would really have what unemployment is. Instead of following the advice coming from the opposite side of chamber, gentle policies were taken against a serious situation caused by those opposite in the way I have described to the House tonight. In spite of this, demand was brought into equaUty with supply in about the middle of this year. Because in this capitalist system we are so depenThis dent on the whim of businessmen and their investment decisions, because we do not have a majority in the Senate, because we have a lack of co-operation in many of the States, because the went out onto the hustings less than a year ago and fought a sensible referendum givby ing this Australian Parliament powers that are polpossessed by every other equivalent parUament bending in the world-powe r over prices and incomes-w e had a landing from these boom conditions which now do demand very careful treatment, and very careful treatment they will from a very sensitive government. The result still of this was, as I said, that the demand was into equation with supply earlier this year. In most areas shortages are a thing of the The decision makers are going to the other extreme when it comes to investment. They were on the crest of a wave. Now they are in the depths of despair. There is a world downturn. This, of course, also affects them. But it is all part It of this capitalist system which is supported by those who are in Opposition in this Parliament. Once again the Government found itself relatively naked in this crazy federation, operating not this stupid system without suflicient tools to it counter properly the trends that are befalling us. If we had in our hands powers over investment rates decisions we might be able to do something them, but we have not. They are in private hands and these private hands must be carefully handled. If we had control over capital issues years ago we would have been able to tail off the boom a lot earher and have a soft landing. But we do not have these controls, mainly because conservatives fight every referendum the national government of this country the tools which are so desperately needed and necessary it is to do its job properly. The capitalist economy has always ricocheted from boom to slump and back to boom again. Stop-go has been a feature of this system as as any one of us can remember. We are doing nothing more nor less than suffering the same stop-go phenomenon which this system of ours rises has always suffered. The Austrahan Labor and Government, I repeat, in the face of great critiStates, cism at thetime,has bent over backwards to iron out these bumps, these booms and slumps. We have done better than our opponents, in spite of the noise that is conung from certain parts of benches opposite. We have not in any way that reached the sort of situation of a 2 per cent unof employment figure brought about by the Gorton measures of February 1971 and the Budget of August 1971. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) is interjecting. He is a very recent member to this Parliament and obviously has done no homework at all in recent economic hiswe tory to learn what thetoolsare to control this economy. I do not pretend that what we have done is enough. What I say is that within the limitations of the tools available we have done so. all that can be done. This is the context of this Budget. Demand is more or less in equality with supply at thistime.We have a government whichBudget is flexible and which will act quickly when further trends are clearly visible. Very naturally and understandably the wage determination system is in chaos arising this excess demand situation which we have suffered. We are not denying that wage and salthe ary earners must catch up their incomes after period of inflation. In fact there are many people in the community who deserve to catch up after such a period of demand inflation caused by follies of our predecessors. Indeed, many others have arightto catch up on what has been causedinjury by demand inflation in the recent past. An orderly wage determination system has to be devised. The days of leap-frogging must be put behind us. No wonder we have stoppages, strikes and all the dissatisfaction that is caused in world of labour. Because of this Federal system of ours we have a leap-frogging of State deterchoice. minations vis-a-vis Federal determinations and so on. What hadtobe done was to create 2 right climate for a new wage determination system to be established. Even though the signs are that we will have many disappointments, let us hope that that is something which will arise out and deny of the context of this Budget. if There is rationale behind this Budget, and very good rationale it is. I am very hopeful, because of what I have heard in the last few days, that additional benefits will be given annually to wage and salary earners after we bring in wage longindexation. I am very hopeful that the commendable establishment and development of the Prices Justification Tribunal will mean that price will be less frequent than they are at present at a much lower level. I am hopeful that the even Queensland, will support new initiatives in this area which is so vital for our needs. It is in this context, I repeat, that we must see this Budget. From a deflationary point of view it the is a neutral Budget. I am not going to pretend from my point of view and the point of view those in Adelaide whom I represent it is a perfect Budget. There are a few smaller things I should like to see amended, but negotiations will go on elsewhere about those. We are in the Australian Labor Party not expected to be sheep. In spite of the emotional and meaningless headlines see in the newspapers from time to time about the Caucus rebuffing the Ministry, we will continue to practice participatory democracy and those who are the Ministers will expect us to do The main message is that the strategy of this is correct. A $23m domestic surplus is neither inflationary nor deflationary. The Leader of the Opposition has been grandstanding and sermonising. I repeat that it was not even a theatrical success in this Parliament; still less was from there solid thought applied to the present difficult economic conditions from that side of Parliament. It is the members of the Liberal thisand Country Parties who failed to revalue the currency and created those other follies which I have already mentioned. These were the legacies the taken over by the Australian Labor Party, I repeat, in December 1972. To add insult to the Leader of the Opposition stalked the country opposing the giving of the necessary powers over prices and incomes to the Australian Government less than a year ago. His speech tonight was deceitful. He does not know whether the he is applying himself to inflation or to unemployment and he has not the courage to make the What Austraha needs is constructive criticism from the Opposition. What it is getting is the hollow, theatrical nonsense.",95
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCLUSION,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,99
236,Mr FISHER,CONCLUSION,"First of all, should like to congratulate the honourable effort member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) who made his maiden speech tonight. I am quite sure that this young man will make a very great tion to this Parhament and also to his own electorate. Last week, when the Treasurer (Mr Crean) introduced to the House what was the second Labor Budget in a quarter tury, the immediate media reaction must well have satisfied the socialist philosophies of the with Labor Government. We could well imagine the would Treasurer in his role as Robin Hood, for profits, his desire to strip an individual of the enterprise and initiative that has been the mark of Austraha's development. Of course, was clear even to one not widely versed in the Treasurer fundamentals of economic theory that the 2 major problems confronting the nation would not be checked by the Budget strategy. Inflauon will still rage ahead. But should the Government be concerned about this when it is a. means financing an enormous increase of 32.4 per cent in expenditure? I was amazed at a statement by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) who said that pent up savings were unleashed cause of a new aura of confidence when the Labor Government took office. I should like to suggest to him that the fact is that the people started to spend their savings because it was parent from the ALP policies to be used as a tool of the Government. In fact many Austrahans I beheve correctly interpreted this as an intention by a Labor Government to inflation rip. Should the Government today be concerned about a worsening unemployment situation, a situation in which up to 1,000 people per week are losing their jobs? Where is the reasoning behind a program of social equaUty that equaUty is to be achieved only by payments made through the Department of Social SecurUne ity? Our people want employment, not welfare. Employment depends largely upon the abiUty the private sector to create it. It is simply not good enough for senior Ministhe ters who should be responsible for the managegeneral ment and expansion of our economy to gloat over and to point to the Mainline Corporation Ltd coUapse as an example of private enterprise. Many of our businesses andfirmswhich are well managed and have provided the means of sound employment and have contributed to a thriving national economy are now under intense pressure. Liquidity is tight, and it will remain so. Private investment has been falUng away rapidly and in the long term, particularly now that a tax I has been placed on people who have made an in the past to be thrifty, this will cripple our abiUty as a nation to meet those payments of scale to our welfare programs, our health care contribuprograms and also to education. In his speech to the Liberal-Country Party only Government of August 1970 the present of a cenTreasurer, Mr Crean, asked: What has been done in this Budget or outside it to deal the causes rather than the symptoms of inflation? 1 say that nothing is being done insofar as this major his dislike problem is concerned. It has now become obvious even to those trademembers of the national Press who gave such it rosy reviews of the 1974 Budget that our is still only asking questions; he is still not giving the nation any answers-answer s to questions such as why Australia has increased its inflation rate by up to 9 per cent in the last 22 months and answers to the questions being asked of by our consumers who are being called upon to meet cost of living increases, particularly to retired people and pensioners who arefindingit far beyond their abUity to pay. This Budget does not provide the answers to bethese questions; instead it wiU aggravate the present dangerous situation. There will be a further reduction in personal incentive and productivity. The desirable result of any Budget apsurely will be cut and will be to the detriment of that inflation was the country. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) let and other speakers from the Liberal-Country Party side tonight have adequately expressed the overall effect of this Appropriation Bill. As a representative of a rural electorate I wish to point to specific areas within this Bill that affect my if electorate. In the Budget last year the Government set out to bring the excise on brandy into with that on other spirits and forecast the total removal of the differential that existed. of Together with the huge increase in the miniBudget last month this is now being carried out. Surely this must be thefirsttimein the history of administration of the excise duties that the pubUc has been warned a year in advance ofan increase. This has already had a disastrous effect on brandy sales. Prior to the two latest imposts brandy sales had fallen by 20 per cent, according to thefiguresthat were avaUable before the 1973 Budget. The increase contained in this Budget will effectively increase the cost of a litre of brandy by 40c or, as I believe was accurately stated by the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) last week, by up to 12c a bottle. However, it should be remembered that other costs will automatically follow. These products will now be subject to sales tax at 15 per cent and to a State liquor licensing fee of 6 per cent toria. This could well mean that the real increase per botde could be more likely in the vicinity of 15c. This Government has proved itself to be incompetent in the way it is treating rural industries. Its decisions relating to the brandy industry give an outstanding example of its lack of understanding of a vital and important industry-a n industry in my electorate and in the electorate of Angas that is restricted to specific regions of Australia. The production of brandy faces problems different to those associated with other spirits. It was for those reasons that a differential in duty was warranted. A tonne of grapes produces about 100 litres of brandy. The Government's take through excise and sales tax has increased by 191 per cent in the last 13 months. It is now getting $1,107 for each tonne of grapes used for brandy production, while a grower receives an average of $70 a tonne for his year's work of growing, picking and supplying the grapes. In 1973 the take by the Government was only $420 a tonne. This budgetary measure is just one more example of the vindictive pohcy that is being directed towards rural industry. This will cause a decrease in sales and, it follows, in grape production. One of the most dangerous aspects of this Government's action towards private business, whether urban or rural, is that it is running directly opposite to the direct expressed views that it would support family businesses and farms. The ultimate result of every action that has been taken since Labor came to power in 1972 has resulted in an aggregation of rural holdings and a strengthening and build-up of corporate bodies. The Phosphate Fertiliser Bounty Act expires on 31 December 1974. It is not to be renewed. This will effectively remove $34m from the rural sector in 1974-75. With the huge increases in the cost of rock phosphate, the large anticipated rises in freight charges and, more importantly, a world wide need for increased food production, adequate justification exists not for the removal of the bounty but for an increase in the bounty. Pohcies for primary production should not be considered in isolation or only in relation to the immediate economic worth to the producer or the nation. Of course, the effects of any policy future land use, on marketing and transport requirements or on the wider community and on the environment must be considered. I suggest that the Government has not made any studies in relation to the effects of the removal of the bounty but rather is simply responding to in Vic- recommendations made in the Coombs report-o r should I call it the Australian Labor Party's handbook for the extermination of rural industries? Has the Government considered, for instance, its action in the light of the resultant increase in farm production costs and the reduction in productivity per farm or perhaps the increase in commodity prices? Perhaps the most significant effect of the bounty as provided by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government is that it supported economic production on land that would otherwise have been uneconomic. The effect of the withdrawal of the bounty on the land use of hundreds of thousands of acres of marginal land should not be regarded too Ughtly. When the effects of the withdrawal of the bounty bite, as they will, it will leave the farmer with Uttle alternative but to neglect largely any portion of his land which produces least or which results in a negative income. As this occurs, not only will rural outputs decrease but also the national resources, the quality of water suppUes, public utilities, ports and harbours will be affected also. The purpose of the bounty program when it was introduced in 1963 by a Liberal-Country Party Government was to reduce farm costs, to promote economic production, to facilitate the growth in rural output, and to improve the competitive position of exports. Not one person on the Government benches can deny that this result was achieved. The statistics released last week give an estimate in the gross value of rural production of 1973-74 as $6,513m. As a direct result of Government pohcies-the removal of the bounty, capital gains tax, the surcharge tax on non-earned income, the failure of the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) to reintroduce the essential tax concessions for water and fodder conservation-far m incomes could well fall by up to 50 per cent this year. The removal of the bounty is short sighted in a climate when the outlook for rural industries is the worse since the 1930s. I ask the Government to reconsider its position before 31 December and to reintroduce this assistance before further erosion occurs in the profitabiUty of those rural industries which have as their basis the famuy farm. A Budget proposal that receives my instant suppon, not only because it was a matter of polon icy of the Opposition during the last election campaign but also because it is a necessary national responsibility, is the proposed introduction of a handicapped child's allowance of $10 a week. We could argue as to whether $10 per week is adequate, but this would be unreasonable. The move has been made and it is to be commended. It appears to me that parents or guardians of children who need constant care and attention require assistance to meet circumstances of personal costs and devotion not encountered by parents of a child not afflicted by severe handicaps, irrespective of that child's age. The former Government made no attempts to increase child endowment payments to give encouragement and support to our basic unit-the family. This Government, despite the recommendations contained in the interim report on poverty and the thousands of requests made by organisations, individuals and petitions, has also not responded. Family life today is under challenge. It is not being encouraged by some forms of social legislature introduced and to be introduced by this Government under the guise of reform and social progress. Raising a family today is not easy. The economic and social climates are difficult and incentive and support could well have been provided by substantial endowment payments. Huge expenditure by the Government on child care and pre-school facilities in the future could well prove to have been unnecessary if such incentive was available. The development of growth centres and decentralisation have rightly become major endeavours of our national and State governments. Austraha has an excellent opportunity to avoid, or at least to correct, the severe ills caused by over-urbanisation in many parts of the world. It will be impossible, however, to achieve programs of long term viabUity by artificial means of government support. We have seen successful decentralised industries-larg e employers of rural labour-devastate d and niined by specific government action. Years of achievement, which has never been easy, have been nullified by an across the board tariff decision without reasonable reference to each specific industry, to the efficiency of those industries and to the value of those industries as a component of the total economy. I put it to the Government also that until time as our most essential pubUc utility- I the Post Office-is used as a vehicle to promote balanced development, future gains will also difficult. The removal of televisionh and radio cence charges is welcome. It is something which have been recommending for some time, mainly for the reason that all regions of Australia do have the advantage of an adequate service or reception. Many deficiencies of transmission and quaUty of programs exist. It is hoped that new initiatives now under way within the Postmaster General's Department will correct these deficiencies. It is difficult, however, to reconcile the thinking of the Government on this issue when it says that the cost of a public service which is provided for the community as a whole should be met out of general taxation and then proceeds to make substanual increases in postal and telephone charges. The proposed increases represent a significant cost additive to business and private individuals. There will be cutbacks in mailings, with resultant effects upon employment. There is nothing more sobering than an examination of the increases in postal and telephone costs. An article which appeared in Monday's 'Australian' makes interesting reading. It reads in part: If hyperinflation is your fear, then it must be the Australian Post Office's ideal, because the increases are in the hyperinflation bracket. Telephone connection fee: Up 33 per cent to $80; connection of an additional phone: the same increase to the same amount. If you can't afford the 24 per cent increase in local calls and the increases in trunk calls, you can cancel the service or the APO will take it away from you-the charge for this remains at $15. To add insult to financial injury, if you can't meet the account and the phone is removed, you'll have to pay an extra 33 per cent in future to get it back-the rise is from $60 to $80. The attempt in the July mini-Budget to increase the basic postal rate by 28 per cent enraged the Senate, which threw it out, so now the Government is increasing the rate by 42 per cent, from 7c to 10c a stamp . . . Aerogrammes will henceforth be a better example of flying inflation than first-rate service-they'r e rising by 42 per cent, from 14c to 20c.",99
237,Mr HUNT,CONCLUSION,That does not make any sense at aU.,101
238,Mr FISHER,CONCLUSION,"That isright.The article continues: You could put them in a Concorde or an SR71 and they still wouldn't reach you any faster than 10 years ago, and never on Saturdays, as they used to do. Local mail service and frequency of delivery was good at threepence, a bad joke at 7c and at 10c will bring delight to private courier services. . . . businesses that want fast communication won't pay increased postal charges for a declining service. The future management and poUcy decisions such made within the Postmaster-General's Departrefer to ment will have as direct and important an influence upon inflation and employment as be most other government decisions do. The AusUtraUan Post Office is particularly vital to rural I people. It is not just a convenience, it is an integral part of their business operation. As I not mentioned earlier, it will ultimately determine the success or otherwise of balanced development. In the Treasurer's own words, the expansion in the pubhc sector contained in this Budget designed to take up the slack emerging in vate sector. This is perhaps the statement in the whole Budget Speech. It emphasises that under Labor the Australian being swiftly guided onto a new course. It heralds m an era of big unions, big business government. The importance of the individual having a say in his future and using his and initiadve for the benefit of the whole nadon workers? has gone. I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. It clearly indicates you. to the Austrahan people the different direction that would be taken by a Liberal Party-Country Party government.",101
239,Mr SCHOLES,CONCLUSION,We have you just heard an interesting speech on behalf those who represent the free enterprise system. In the last 20 minutes the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) has told us just how important it is that the free enterprise system be based on a system of government subsidies. Every sentence he spoke was a demand greater pubhc expenditure in order to vate profit. Mr Fisher-If necessary.,102
240,Mr SCHOLES,CONCLUSION,"'If necessary' has never entered into your thinking at all. You have never provided subsidies on the basis of need alone, you have provided subsidies on the basis of need Chair. and greed. The small farmer who had need got exactly the same level of subsidy, and thus a much lower level of assistance, than the large farmer who had no need at all. One remembers well when these gentlemen who make so much takes, noise gave $90,000 in cash to one wool grower one year and gave an average of $3,000 each the hard pressed wool growers who were really in need, and justified it in this Parliament An honourable member interjects that they wish they could get it now. Of course you wish you could get it now. That is what it is all about. represent the large grazing interests in munity and you talk to the small farmers about their problems. You tell them that they have problems, which they know about anyhow. You facts. encourage them into actions which they normally would not take and you mislead them into believing that their needs are quite often they are not. Possibly the member for Mallee tell us about how the Countiy Party encouraged his constituents to put in pear trees, then paid them to pull them out again. They were occupied, of course.",102

Most of them will benefit words. more from the abolition of the radio hcence fee than the Budget will cost them in additional income tax. There will be some who will pay more tax. They will be people who have large incomes or substantial incomes from their investments. It is arguable that this is inequitable.

That is a program of encourageeverywhere ment for the establishment in major centres theatre complexes for the performance of live arts. It is all very well for governments- I say 'governments' collectively as the previous governments never made any efforts at all in this field; it has been an area of State responsibility and still is at this stage-to provide theatre panies with money to keep going, to encourage actors, to encourage artists. If you do not provide adequate facUities where people can perfrom and do not provide facUities in areas other the centres of the major capital cities you do not reads: provide anything at aU; because you must give people the opportunity not only to perform but to perform in front of other people, actor who performs on his own is not an actor at aU; he is only half fulfilling himself.",103

259,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"It is my intention to raise in the House this evening a section of a report presented to the Queensland Central Executive of the Australian to Labor Party on 25 June 1974. The report was I prepared by the Campaign Director, Mr Bart Lourigan. I do so at a time when the GovernI ment Party-the Australian Labor Party-ha s bejust purchased a large holding in television station Channel 7. Stories are floating around that the Party which cries poor is out of to buy its way into so many other areas of the media. I wish to refer to Mr Lourigan's report on talk back programs. It is for everyone's sake that I will read the section which relates to that subject. I do so because the Australian Labor Party, through its activities and through its efforts to comstifle freedom of speech and democracy, is setting out to reduce to nothing more than a farce and a laugh the talk back programs in which people ring radio stations. The extract from Mr than Lourigan's report headed 'Talk Back Programs' At its first meeting, the Central Campaign Committeebecause an Meaning of Queenslandresolved to give attention to talk back programs, and empowered the State Campaign Director to organise an effective means of combating obvious anti-Labor propaganda. That is, of combating statements by others which might be truthful but which are also hurtful. The report continues: A meeting of 20 women under the organisational of Mrs J. A. Vaughan was convened. It was agreed Vaughan work from the QCE office, monitoring all programs and arranging participants in the sessions only the Labor Government but also the trade union ment came under fire. Mr Fred Whitby and other union officials assisted in this counter-attack on our poltiical opponents. This strategy met with success throughout the campaign, to the extent that in the final weeks, former QCE Press Officer, Jack Stanaway, was employed by the National paign Committee to co-ordinate the activity on a basis. The QCE office went one step further and arranged each of the seventeen Ministers who visited ticipate in a talk back program Cabinet Ministers have since extended their congratulations that in this particular activity, Queensland was far other States. One aspect which caused considerable concern in relation to talk back programs was the viciousness of the smear campaign waged by individuals attempting to discredit ALP. and its policies. If only we could have the time over again all listeners would able to recognise that the forecasts of doom that were made at that time as to what would happen to Australia in relation to inflation and unemployment, and what was said about the promises of tax reductions, were correct and not simply smear campaigns by the Opposition. The report continues: I advised Dr Coombs of defamatory aUegations against him on radio station 4BH. Acting on legal advice we forced a public apology and retraction Hancock, the compere. Can honourable members visualise the darling of thousands of Brisbane's listeners Mr Ivor Hancock, being painted by Mr Lourigan as a villain? The report continues: On another occasion, Mick YoungNow the honourable member for Port Adelaidewas called a communist on no fewer than 4 occasions in the one session. It is clear that the Labor movement in general must counter these scurrilous attacks on its credibUity and on the integrity of individuals. I have raised this matter in this chamber tonight to inform the whole nation that the Australian Labor Party is making a complete farce out of the ring-in programs which are conducted from one side of the continent to the other. How ofter have we heard some so-called Mrs Housewife ringing in and saying 'Dear Ivor' or 'Dear Mr Laws, what do you think of the way in which Mr Snedden did this or Mr Snedden did that?' and Mr Hancock or Mr Laws saying: 'It is quite reasonable', only to find some Austrahan Labor Party trained trades hall stooge saying certain things and making suggestions which cloud the issue in an attempt to distract the minds of the Australian people from the real destruction control which is going on within our community today? I that Mrs appeal to the Special Minister of State (Mr when not Lionel Bowen) as the representative in this movechamber of the Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop)- I apologise for not having advised him that I was going to speak on this subject tonight but I notice that he has come into the chamber because of the nature of the accusations that Camhave been made-to intervene in this matter and full time to stop his own Party from manipulating and twisting the media, as this admission by none for other than the Queensland Campaign Director, the State to par Mr Bart Lourigan, indicates. or in a T.V. session. Indeed, I wish now to lay on the table an official comahead of plaint. We are told that television stations and radio stations are to accept all advertising and that pohtical bias is not to be shown. In the 1972 the election campaign, because I am a man who has no particular bias about where he places his advertising, I placed my radio advertising with 4KQ, the Labor controlled radio station in Brisbane. Because I never rose much before a quarter to five in the morning during the 1972 campaign I never heard the advertisement but I heard from some friends who come from electorates represented by members of the Austrahan Country Party that it was played during the hours in which dairy farmers were up looking after their cattle and milking their cows. It was put on so early in the breakfast program that hardly anyfrom both the station and Ivor one except the dairy farmers was awake. But in the last election campaign 4KQ, the Labor controlled radio station, refused to have anything to do with my advertising. I do not know whether it was because of the nature of the advertising. It had imagination and the result of the voting in Griffith at the last election indicates that it had a great deal of appeal. The words of one song, which went to the tune of 'Waltzing Matilda', were as follows: Once a Labor Lord Mayor ran for Federal Parliament, He tried to take Don Cameron's seat; But the electors of Griffith want to change the government, Cameron is Liberal and he won't be beat. And so it went on to the verse of that tune. But the station would not accept that advertisement or any of the others I had. I believe that that was grossly unfair because, on the serious side, licences for radio and television stations are necessarily restricted. There is only so much space on the band and only so many listeners in each city. If we have a situation in which the Labor Party owns the media, I do not believe that it has any right to discriminate between advertisers. A station has to accept all advertisements. The more I think of the comments of my friend the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns), who said that all political parties should get out of the media, the more I realise viously how much sense he made. It is high time the ing Labor Party moved out of the area of propain Sydney, ganda and out of the area of strangling free were present. thought and handed over the running of the media to people who are going to be responsible master-General in their presentations and who will accept the admands, vertisements of all people. This afternoon the that honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) elected referred to the fact that the skies arefilledwith copy aeroplanes leaving Queensland with the farmers' meeting. The people of Queensland have had indications of unfairness and were not at all happy.",103

For that reason I bring forward what tonight. On 19 September, as recorded in Hanter-General sard on page 1S79 and following pages, I was speaking to the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill (No. 2). I had spoken for only a few moments when the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel to read.

In the course of the debate last week I suggested that he name the person. refused to do it. I then said: 'You had better make a declaration as to who told you, because do not believe you'. He said: 'Yes, I will do that'. The honourable member now has a declaration but he says that he cannot name the person. says that he has just been told certain things. issue was the subject of a point of order taken myself last week. I was relying on standing order 76, which states: All imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on Members shall be considered orderly. The imputation was that I had excluded people from the meeting. That was an improper imputanothing tion. It never happened. I exlained the situation the other evening. As have a few minutes available, let me give some background. There had been a lot of difficulties with the mail in Sydney due to what are called area mail centres. The Redfern Mail Exchange employees had difficulty in accepting the view that area mail centres should be conducted in way they were being conducted. There was nothvited ing wrong with them, but the Redfern employees were concerned and there had been meetings about the matter. Mr Milton Stevens, the Director of Postal Services in Sydney, is responsible for the Mail Exchange. He was at the meeting, and so was 1.1 was invited to be there. The meeting was arranged by the employees with the pereven mission of the Postmaster-General's Departonly interest ment. It was a mass meeting of some 2,000 later. He rangheme people. They were there to discuss what they felt he too could attend.after were a set of conditions which ought to apply to minute. He did not mention area mail centres.

I same training courses as the Redfern Mail the Exchange had, and that they would have the same working conditions and amenities. For he some weeks before this meeting Mr Milton Stevens had taken representatives of the union to these mail centres. They had agreed on a set of conditions which the Department would say apply. That was a solution. As it turmatter lasted only tJunk out- I in about March-the solution a shorttime.The area mail centres with the Department.

The He honourable member for Mackellar maUgned them as being Marxist. That was his expression. I He said they were Marxist union officials. That is not true either, but he uses the privilege of the House to talk about people in this fashion, knowHe ing that they cannot defend themselves. The This union officials flew from Melbourne to address by the meeting. I was invited to be there as Postmaster-General to affirm and confirm that a set of arrangements had been made and the Department would adhere to them. Mr Stevens was highly disthere also. The honourable member for MackeUar was anxious to say that there was a set of demands which was an election bait. It had to do with the election at all. What he alleged was a set of demands was a set of conditions to which the Department had agreed. I They were to be on trial for a period of 6 months and subject to review. They were agreed to on the basis that there would be the same staff and the same opportunity for advancement in the mail centres as there were in the Redfern Mail Exchange. When the meeting took place everythe body spoke about this issue and I was then into speak. I might add that all the television cameras of Sydney were there, so there is no misunderstanding as to what took place. Mr Kevin Cairns-How did you go over?",107
271,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,RECOMMENDATION BY STATE EXECUTIVE,"I went over well. I must spoke afterwards. The honourable member have heard that, because that is about the has shown. I will mention that We that and asked whether will talk about that in a that tonight, by the way. I spoke to the people at the meeting and said: 'What the Department has told you is right. emI confirm it. It has been the situation that you have known since March. There is no need to be doubting the word of the Department'. The people at the meeting asked whether I would sign that arrangement. I said: 'Yes, I will sign it, because the Department has agreed to it'. It is completely outrageous to say that I said: ' If you elect us, we will see that this arrangement is implemented'. It had been implemented since March. In fact, the area mail centres had come into being the previous year. The honourable member for Mackellar is maliciously using the fact that somebody told him certain things to mount a smear campaign by the use of unnuendo and slander, which I think is disorderly of any honourable member. In my view honourable members in this Parhament are endded to have some protection.",107

277,Mr SPEAKER,RECOMMENDATION BY STATE EXECUTIVE,Order! That is not a point of order.,108
278,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,RECOMMENDATION BY STATE EXECUTIVE,"The honourable member for Mackellar has accused people in this Parliament of corruption and victimisation. They are his own words. That is what he said, and he is stiU nodding his head tonight. He based his attack on an innuendo by somebody unnamed about something that did not happen. The honourable member knew that it did not happen. What happened at the meeting was public knowledge. At least 3,000 people were at the meeting. Mr MUton Stevens, as I affirm again, was the officer in charge. He was responsible for the Redfern Mail Exchange. By aU means, the honourable member may go and see him in Sydney when he gets back there on Friday. The thing that he did not say in his declaration is that he rang my office and asked whether he could go to the meeting at the Redfern MaU Exchange. I said: 'By all means go'. He asked whether he could take television cameras with him. I said: 'By all means do that'. He did that, and he would have done it in April. It is rather remarkable that he waited until 19 September in the course of a debate on the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill to raise the issue in the fashion in which he did. The point I objected to was not that he said I did something that was not wise in signing an agreement. He is entitled to his view. I objected to the fact that he said I had acted improperly to exclude officials from a meeting and that I had acted corruptly to offer an election bribe. That is outrageously false and everybody in Sydney knows it. Strikes had been taking place since February. The problem underlying the strikes had been solved in March on a temporary basis. The Department can confirm that Mr MUton Stevens had to take the union officials and employees to aU area maU centres and that an agreement had been reached but it broke down because the employees wanted it in writing. They would not just accept the view. I confirmed the Department's view. That is the position. Everybody knows what happened at that meeting. What I am objecting to is a member of Parliament of the standing and seniority of the honourable member for Mackellar, even though he says he is retiring, so often ignoring the fact that it is outrageously wrong to base an attack on another honourable member on something that somebody has told him. I might say to the honourable member for Mackellar that somebody told me that he had found the honourable member asleep once when he was a Minister and so not able to introduce a Bill and some other Minister had to do it. It would be aninuendo.",108
279,Mr WENTWORTH,RECOMMENDATION BY STATE EXECUTIVE,That is not right.,108
280,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,RECOMMENDATION BY STATE EXECUTIVE,"It would not be true, would it? But it does you a lot of damage, does it not? The honourable member knows that he never fell asleep or that his coUeagues could not find him and had to get the then Minister for Repatriation to introduce a Bill in his absence. The honourable member knows that would be false, would he not? I have just laid an accusation against the honourable member. That is all he has done against everybody in this House on occasion. He has used the smear and the innuendo. AU one has to do to be an honourable member of Parliament is to be forthright and full of integrity and to ask an honourable member what happened on a certain occasion. The member will teU you. You can check it and then say: 'Bill Jones said that it did not happen'. I will say: 'Let us look at what Bill Jones says'. The honourable member for Mackellar did not adopt that approach. Mr Kevin Cairns-The honourable member for MackeUar is a superb member of Parliament.",108
281,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,RECOMMENDATION BY STATE EXECUTIVE,"He does not need any help from the honourable member for LUley. There is no need for the honourable member to get excited. The honourable member for Mackellar is a well known performer of the smear, and he is able to get away with it. He is not entided to do it. If he ever does it again I will tionmove for his expulsion from this House, because I do not think that such conduct is befitting of an honourable member. That is all I want to say to him. The honourable member has left the issue in the position that somebody told him but he cannot disclose the name.",108

Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As mentioned by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank in his press statement of 12 June 1974, some have borrowed from the Reserve Bank in order to maintain their LGS ratios above the agreed minimum of 18 per cent. these (2) In accordance with traditional tionships, the terms and conditions ofloans by the Reserve Bank under the terms of the LGS convention public. The Bank may charge ""penal"" rates on such loans if it considers this justified. (3) The trading banks do not borrow from the central bank to meet a shortage of cash but to observe the terms of the LGS convention. Thus they may have to borrow when they have adequate cash but not suflicient LGS assets in total to meet the 18 per cent minimum. The agreement with the Reserve Bank requires inter alia that they try to maintain minimum LGS ratio by means other than borrowing from the Bank. As regards the drain on bank liquidity over recent months, the banks have sought to mitigate it in a variety of ways including issues of certificates of deposit, sales of commercial bills, reduced loans to authorized dealers in the shon term money market, and a sharply reduced rate of new lending. Funds released from Statutory Reserve Deposit Accounts by the Reserve Bank have also provided a partial (Question No. 415) offset to the drain on liquidity. for Transport, (4) See answer to (2).

Public Servants: Leave Without Pay MT Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon the notice: How many public servants are presently on leave without pay for periods of 12 months or more.",137
303,Mr WHITLAM,SHOWING SUBDIVISIONAL ENROLMENTS,"The answer to therighthonour- (3) able member's question is as follows: The Public Service Board has advised me that the inforCommittee mation sought is not kept in consolidated form in its could only be obtained from a special survey of separate records held by depanments. A survey of this kind would need a lot of time and effon. I have been informed that data collection procedures are being reviewed to ensure that kind of consolidated information will be readily available. Public Servants: Statistics Mr Garland asked the Prime Minister, upon preciated notice: What was the (a) number and (b) cost of public servants and other Government employees employed by depanin 1937 ments and Government corporations and instrumentalities as at (i) 2 December 1972, (ii) 1 July 1973. (iii) 1 January 1974 and (iv) 1 July 1974.",137
304,Mr WHITLAM,SHOWING SUBDIVISIONAL ENROLMENTS,"The answer to the honourable (Question No. 323) member's question is as follows: Information of the type sought by the honourable member is published quarterly in the Australian Bureau of Statistics monthly bulletin 'Employment and Unemployment'. The bulletins for December 1972, June 1973, December 1973 and June 1974 contain the statistics that are available for the dates specified in the question. The June 1974 bulletin is in the process of being published. (b) I am advised that information on costs is not readily in the form sought by the honourable member. The Treasury, however, publishes some statistics on average emexpenditure on salaries in respect of each deexcept the Postmaster-General's Department, in Table 16 of the document 'Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure' which is tabled annually with the budget papers. Table 4 of the same document summarizes esumated expenditure on salaries for the current year compared with expenditure during the previous financial year. (Question No. 357) A summary of expenditure on salaries and wages by the Postmaster-General's Depanment for the five years to June is given in 'Table 12: Cash Expenditure' of the Financial and Statistical Supplement of the Annual Report of the Postmaster-General's Department for 1973, tabled in the House on 18 October 1973. I am advised that the Post Annual Report, to be tabled during the Budget sit12 tings, will contain the statistics to June 1974. Electoral Divisions: Quota Variations (Question No. 650) ' Mr Garland asked the Prime Minister, upon he say in his television broadcast to the nation in of the referenda proposals that it was the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in 1959 that a variation of 10 percent above or below the average number of electors in the electoral divisions in a State was sufficient. (Question No. 546) (2) Does he recall, as a member of that Committee, that preponderance of the views of the expert witnesses called, viz. the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer in each State and the Surveyor-General for each of the States, was clearly in favour of retaining the variation at the existing 20 per cent. Is it a fact that the Committee's Repon stated that it would be easier to apply a 20 per cent margin of allowance than a 10 per cent allowance from the quota, although the expressed itself satisfied that the problems of Office. It applying a 10 per cent margin were manageable. (4) Where was the practicality of removing altogether a margin of allowance, proposed by the referendum, which is this contrary to (a) the Committee's recommendation of 10 per cent, (b) the Bill proposed by the Government in 1973 for 10 per cent and (c) the preponderance of opinion of the electoral officers in Australia. (Question No. 649) (5) Does he alsorecallcomment in the Report that, to keep the matter in its proper perspective, it should be apthat, in theredistributionsmade, relatively few seats have departed from the quota by more than one-tenth. (6) Which seats, since the redistribution which took place up to that which took place for the last election, have departed from the quota by more than one-tenth, what was the percentage departure in each case, and how many seats had a smaller quota variation than one-tenth. (7) Will he familiarise himself with the matters set out on page 49 of the Repon from the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review, 1959, so that in making speeches on electoral changes a balanced view is put.",137
305,Mr WHITLAM,SHOWING SUBDIVISIONAL ENROLMENTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (5) and (7) The subject been thoroughly canvassed in the Parliament on 11 occasions last year and this year, three times in the House of Respresentatives, three times in the Senate and once at the joint sitting in debates on the Commonwealth Electoral Bill (No. 2) 1973 and twice in the House and twice in the Senate Wannon in debates on the Constitution Alteration (Democratic ElecWimmera tions) Bill 1974. The honourable member can ascertain my views from my speeches on 8 November 1973,5 March 1974 and 6 August 1974 (Hansard, pp3055-3056, pp44-45 and pp4-6 respectively) and from the many speeches I have made over the years in an effort to have the Menzies, Holt, Gorton and MCMahon governments carry out the unanimous recommendation of the all party Joint Committee on Constitutional Review (1956-59), of which I was a member. (6) There have been three distributions for the expanded House of Representatives, in 1948, 1955 and 1968. The appended tables give the names of the divisions which departed by more than 10% from the quota of electors in each State and the percentage of the deviation in each division at the dme of each distribution and at the ume of the last elections held under that distribution.

It is a fact, though, that despite all practicable safeguards and checks, some errors are unavoidable due to: (1) the human element involved in the many manual processes associated with directory compilation and printing; (ii) the fact that new and cancelled services, and requests for amended entries affect, on average, about cent of directory listings each year; and (iii) the pressure of publishing tories each year within the same production time span. Although many errors relate only to incorrect numbers, initials, etc., the Department is keenly aware that some errors can have a very adverse affect on the subscribers concerned. To help them, various measures wherever practicable; for instance, in some cases calls can be diverted from an incorrectly listed number; in others, the subscribers concerned are supplied with cards to assist them to let their business contacts, friends, etc, know of the correct entry. The Department sees the adoption of computer compilation of telephone directories as the main means of reducing the incidence of errors in directories nificant that the lowest error cities last year was in respect of the Adelaide directory-the only book currently compiled by means of computer. Computer compilation is being extended to the Brisbane alphabetical section of that directory this year and will be extended progressively over the next two or three years. (2) Subscribers wishing to do so may have their telephone directory listings checked by arrangement with their local Telecommunications Sales Oflice if apphcation the time a new issue is in course of production.
