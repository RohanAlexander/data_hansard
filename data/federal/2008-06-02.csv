4,Mr KEENAN,EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Stirling) (12.02 pm)Australians are feeling cheated and conned, and they are feeling like they have been defrauded by this government, defrauded by Labor. At the election Labor said they were offering a government that would be putting downward pressure on inflation. They held themselves out on many different occasions as having fresh ideas. But what have Australians got? They have a government whose very first budget has been to up taxes, to increase spending and to forecast, for the first time in a long while, a rise in unemployment. This is a government that is backward looking, a government that is returning to old Labor, a government that brings in new taxes, increases spending and puts jobs at risk. This is hardly a budget that delivers on the Treasurer's rhetoric that he would deliver a budget that would put downward pressure on inflation. It is not a budget that Governor Stevens at the Reserve Bank would have been hoping for. It is not a budget that puts downward pressure on interest rates. For all the Treasurer's hairy-chested rhetoric, what we actually have is a budget that increases spending, increases taxes and increases unemployment. It is a budget that will-and this is a word that seems to be doing the rounds at the moment-‘whack' all Austrathe lians: pensioners, singles, families and businesses. The decision contained in this bill to impose excise on condensate is another of the inflationary measures that are contained within this budget. Condensate is a form of light crude oil that is associated with gas accumulations. It is a type of crude oil that is produced as a by-product when natural gas is extracted from the earth. Condensate is used for, among other things, making plastics and cosmetics. In 1977 condensate produced in Australia or produced separately from a crude oil stream was made exempt from excise. This action was taken to encourage the exploration of and production from onshore and offshore predominantly gas fields that did not have the same profitability of the mainly crude oil producing Bass Strait. This action was taken to encourage the development of petroleum resources in the mainly gas-producing areas in the Cooper Basin and on the North West Shelf. The North West Shelf partners comprise BHP Billiton, Woodside, BP, Chevron, Shell and a Japanese consortium. This is very important. This was the policy that those partners initially signed up to. This is part of the reason they explored the North West Shelf. The policy of exempting the production of condensate from crude oil excise has remained in place since 1977. It is much more viable to extract gas from a reserve when the reserve also has condensate. The industry argues that the least viable gas reserves have no condensate. Making condensate more expensive will make gas exploration and extraction less viable, and it is also very likely to increase the domestic price of gas. The consumers of this gas include power stations and industry but also mums and dads with gas stoves and gas heaters and motorists using LPG. The cost increases will ultimately spread across the entire economy further feeding inflation, allegedly the main target of this budget. It is another classic example of this government not having a full understanding of the consequences of the decisions that they take. The Excise Tariff Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2008 and the Excise Legislation Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2008 show just how brazenly and shamelessly this government has gone about increasing taxes. These bills are expected to raise a massive $2½ billion over the forward estimates, and they kicked in from midnight on budget night. Despite Labor's I think disingenuous view that this tax impost will not ultimately flow on to consumers, I note that the Sydney Morning Herald has reported that the removal of the excise exemption will cost Woodside Petroleum, one of the joint venture partners, up to five per cent of its annual profits. And we have the Prime Minister calling this measure an exercise in financial integrity. Let us pause for a moment here and look at what the Prime Minister says in this House about this measure in these bills before us. If you recall, last week the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, asked the following question of the Prime Minister: Can the Prime Minister guarantee that his new $2.5 billion tax will not drive up the price of domestic gas and electricity for pensioners, households and businesses in Western Australia? All members will recall that, not surprisingly, the Prime Minister did not answer that question, but I think his response is very instructive. He said: On the condensate arrangement, it was actually instituted back then in order to provide for the industry to start with. That is the first point. He went on: Secondly, that is quite a long time ago, and since that time the industry has not only become profitable and been established; if you look at the return to the industry concerned, its actual profits in recent years have been not just in the hundreds of millions of dollars but in the billions of dollars. What this seeks to do is to actually close a tax loophole which has existed for a long, long time ... It was not a tax loophole that was being closed; it was an agreement the joint venture partners made with the government in the late 1970s about how they could appropriately do business in Australia. The Prime Minister's response seems to imply that, if you are doing business in Australia and you are making a windfall profit, you can expect the government just to come in over the top and slap a new tax on whatever it is you do. This is a pretty serious risk for businesses doing business in Australia. What we have with this measure is the re-emergence of sovereign risk. What we see from the operations of a government that seeks to impose a measure like this without any consultation, without any discussion and without any notice is a government that does not really understand the consequences of what it does. From midnight on budget night the producer became liable for excise. What sort of message does this send to local or foreign investors about their ability to do business in Australia with confidence and in an environment of certainty? How can investors plan in confidence exploration and production projects that can take literally years to come on stream, and cost tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars, when the government can simply at a whim, without talking to them, change the goalposts? Let me describe the reaction of Woodside to the measures in these bills, because I think it is very important. Woodside is an operator of the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas project, Australia's largest liquefied natural gas facility which has a current production capacity of 11.9 million tonnes per annum and produced 24.2 million barrels of condensate in 2007. Woodside managing director and CEO Mr Don Volte said in response to this ill-thought-out measure: Governments have a responsibility to consult with industry on major issues such as this. On this occasion there was no consultation on changes to arrangements that we considered were binding. Mr Volte well understands the history behind the excise treatment of condensate. As I have outlined, this exemption was an incentive to the industry to explore these untapped reserves. It is not a loophole, as the Prime Minister has tried to pretend in this place. This exemption was not some sort of escape clause or some trick for avoiding excise. This is an exemption that was granted by the government of the day for the express purpose of encouraging exploration of these gas deposits. I fully endorse what Mr Volte has said. He has gone on to say: This is not a loophole which is being closed or a free ride that has come to an end. This is a negotiated fiscal arrangement which formed the basis of Australia's largest resource development. To similar effect to the comments from Woodside are the comments of Ms Belinda Robinson, who is the Chief Executive of APPEA, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. They have rightly been concerned about this sudden change in policy and the total and complete absence of any consultation with the industry. She has said: Given the magnitude of the investments involved and the important contribution of this industry to the Australian economy, a strong partnership between industry and government is critical. Investment decisions are made on the basis of certainty that fiscal frameworks agreed with governments will underpin the long term viability of projects. The industry sees the government's lack of consultation as sending very dangerous signals. These signals have the potential to impact across all of the industry. The industry states that the exemption provided an important incentive for the exploration of gas because condensate occurs in association with natural gas. The production of condensate is important in underpinning the economics of many gas projects. This excise hike may lead some energy companies to reduce exploration and extraction because they are afraid that an arbitrary tax on them can be imposed without any warning. There is a second reason why these measures warrant further consideration. It was a reason that was raised with us when Treasury came to brief us on this legislation-an offer that was generously made by the Assistant Treasurer that I was very happy to take up. Treasury were completely and utterly unable to rule out whether these measures will firstly have an impact on gas prices in my home state of Western Australia and ultimately feed into gas prices across the country. I will remind the House of what I said earlier. The Prime Minister was asked in this chamber last week, ‘Will these measures make gas more expensive for consumers in Western Australia?' and he was completely unable to rule that out. We in this House and in this parliament need to look at these bills further to really get an understanding about what these measures may actually do. It is clear the government have no understanding about what these measures might actually do. If they did have an understanding, then maybe they would have been able to say whether or not they are going to put upward pressure on gas prices. It makes sense that these bills get further illumination. I would certainly like the industry to be able to have a chance to comment on these bills, as you would have expected the government would have allowed them to do prior to actually introducing and announcing these measures. That is certainly what the previous government would have done. That is what any sensible government would do: go and talk to the people who operate in the industry, who know about the economics of the industry. They will be able to give you feedback about the consequences of the actions that you are taking. With that in mind, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “while not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House expresses its concern that the Government's decisions reflected in this bill have been made without consultation with business or other interested groups and calls on the Government to support reference of this bill and the Excise Legislation Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2008 to the Senate Economics Committee for inquiry so as to permit consultation with those with practical expertise and responsibility in this vital industry”. This is a $2½ billion tax take. It was announced without consultation with industry, who were shocked, quite frankly, to read about it on budget night. They have been operating since the late 1970s on the understanding that they had some certainty in their taxation arrangements and that they actually had an agreement with the Australian government-a government that actually lives up to its words and its commitments. Now we find that, if you are making windfall profit, apparently the government can just come in over the top of you and reap that back in tax. I think that is something that is extraordinary. Secondly, this is a measure that has the potential to make gas in Australia more expensive. I think it is reasonable that the government rule that out if they have any understanding of what this measure might actually do. It makes sense that the Senate Standing Committee on Economics have the opportunity to look at these bills. I would certainly encourage them to go to Western Australia and talk to some of the joint venture partners on the North West Shelf about what this might do and what this means for their business-and, importantly, talk to them about what it means for gas consumers in Western Australia. Does it mean higher bills? I urge the government to seriously consider joining with the opposition in allowing the Senate economics committee to get an understanding about what these measures might do.",17
5,The SPEAKER,EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Coulton-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,20
6,Mr RIPOLL,EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise with pleasure to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2008, which amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921, because it actually is good news. Contrary to what the shadow minister has been talking about, this bill is good news for consumers and it is good news for the taxpayer because it gives them the opportunity to have a windfall of $2½ billion from what is rightfully their resource and be compensated for private interests reaping rewards from the use of that resource. It actually is a good thing. I will start with the amendment that the opposition moved. It seems to be broken down into three parts. One, they seem to be very concerned about consultation. They ought to be, because in the nearly 12 years they were in government that was the last thing on their minds and the last thing they ever did on absolutely anything at all. But if they never consulted with anyone in particular, let me just say that they never consulted with the taxpayer. They may have consulted with big oil-that they did plenty of-but when it came to consultation with the consumer and the taxpayer, then there was none. It is that one-sided street and one-sided argument you get from this mob, which used to be in government. When they talk about consultation, it was just consultation for the big oil companies, which is what they were interested in. If you listen to the speech made by the honourable member for Stirling, that was all he was talking about. He was talking about a $2.5 billion tax take. I remind him that it is not actually a tax take from the payer; it is actually a tax take from oil companies from a resource which rightfully belongs to the Australian taxpayer and the Australian community. They are the people who should be sharing in that reward. Again, he got that one wrong, and I thought he most disingenuously represented the actual position of this bill and the position of the government. He did raise one other issue, which was that gas or the price of petrol might become more expensive. Again, that was very disingenuous. Having been given a briefing from the Treasury, they would understand that Treasury is not going to rule one way or the other or give a decision; the reality is nobody can do that. The reality also is that there is such a thing as price parity. Everyone in Australia understands, and we have made very clear to people-and certainly the opposition did when they were in government-that we are price takers in Australia. We belong to a global oil market, and we pay the same price that is available on the global market. This so-called imposition of a tax is not actually an imposition of a tax; it is an equalisation of a tax where the industry, since 1977, has actually benefited to the tune of over $1 billion. That is $1 billion of Australian taxpayers' dollars. There was a very good reason that that exemption from the excise was in place and why it dates back to 1977, but the environment and the conditions have changed. The reason I am happy to speak on this bill today is that it is an adjustment, it is an equalisation. It is a bill about fairness for the Australian taxpayer and the use of their resource. This condensate gas and oil does not belong to the oil companies. They certainly are more than welcome to extract it and to make profits from it. We do not have an issue about the profits, but there should be fair compensation to the Australian community, the Australian public and the Australian taxtaxpayer for the use of that resource by that oil company. And that is what this bill does. This bill is about fairness, so I am very pleased to be speaking on it. This bill amends and removes the excise exemption from condensate for crude oil under the crude oil excise regime. This measure was applied from 13 May 2008. Currently, oil excise applies to crude oil that is produced from petroleum fields that are located in the North West Shelf project area off the coast of Western Australia and onshore Australia. By making this amendment, we now equalise what happens with condensate under what was the previous exemption regime. Currently, the excise is levied at a percentage of the value of the crude oil that is produced from the petroleum fields, but the first 30 million barrels of crude oil produced are still exempt under the crude oil excise regime and they will continue to be. In fact, I do not know there should be too much concern or any concern at all from the oil industry. In my view, it is quite a reasonminister able regime, and a regime that was fully supported by the previous government, now in opposition. They are making plenty of noise about how unfair all of this is. This is an Australian resource. I suppose the next thing we will be hearing from the shadow minister is there should not be any excise at all. Again, they are ripping away taxpayers' funds that are coming in from their own resources but not explaining how the money will be replaced. How does the shadow minister and the opposition expect that that taxpayer money, that $2.5 billion, be replaced? The reality is there will be zero excise annual production of 500 megalitres or less; 10 per cent for annual production between 501 and 600 megalitres, which is about 3.8 million barrels; 15 per cent for annual production for up to 4.4 million barrels; 20 per cent for up to five million barrels; and 30 cent for annual production that is over 800 megalitres or five million barrels. That brings into line condensate. There is no reason today, in today's environment, for condensate to be treated differently to any other resource-be it oil, gas or any other. Why should it be that there is a special exclusion, an exemption, on this one particular product in today's environment, in 2008, with global pressure on our resources and record profits being made-welcome record profits by the oil company? I certainly do not begrudge the profits they make, but by the same token they should not begrudge paying a fair share of those profits to the Australian community. That is who the money is going to. It is not going to the government; it is going to the Australian taxpayers, back to them. I am a bit bewildered by why the opposition would come in here and argue against that. Why would they argue against an Australian community resource not being properly taxed and excised so that the community can reap the benefit? Perhaps, when the shadow has another opportunity, he can explain where else he would get $2.5 billion to add to the budget to help all Australians if he believes this discount, which has existed since 1977, should continue. The reality is this is good fiscal discipline. This is exactly what we were elected to do as a government. We were elected to run a strong economy, a responsible budget position, and to be responsible in making sure that oil companies and resource companies are properly taxed on the Australian resources so that all Australians can share in that benefit. I think that is more than fair and for more than amply done by this very good amendment bill. The amendment that was moved by the opposition-I do not have a copy, as I said earlier-seemed to cover three areas: consultation, the amount of tax that will be of benefit and reaped for Australian per taxpayers, and cost. I was curious to hear that the opposition, who complain every day about inquiries, task forces and so forth, are calling for another one themselves. Now they want the Senate Standing Committee on Economics to have another inquiry. Which way is it going to be? The shadow minister, the member for Groom, is at the table and he is shaking his head. I would too! I have no idea what you guys want to do. Every day of the week you come in here and make plenty of bluster and noise about inquiries, but here you are in the House asking for another inquiry. There is no need to have an inquiry, because this is a really good measure. This is a good measure for the Australian taxpayer because this $2.5 billion is going to them. We are not taking it from them; we are giving it to them. This is an Australian community resource that needs to be properly and equally treated, and this is exactly what is taking place with this bill and in this House today. This bill, as I said, is a good bill and I commend it to the House.",20
7,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT," Mr Speaker, I listened withMr Ripoll-Be kind to me, Macca!",23
8,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"As the member for Oxley leaves the chamber he asks me to be kind to him. After that speech, it would be difficult to be anything else out of sheer sympathy for his lack of understanding of what goes on in this chamber, in the Senate chamber or in fact anywhere in the business community in Australia. While he did say on a number of occasions during his speech how delighted he was to be able to speak on the measure, it is my understanding that he is the only one on that side of the House to do so-an indication of perhaps just how uncomfortable some on that side are about this legislation. I am surprised, I have to say, because I believe in being what you are and that what you have been is what you are. I think it is unusual, to say the least, that someone who would know a lot about this bill and how it may affect those companies involved in the North West Shelf has not put his name up to speak on this bill. The member for Brand, with his background, would understand all the issues that I am about to raise in regard to how important are investment certainty and a consistent approach by government, and how the risks that resource companies take, both in exploring and developing resources, work. Yet all we heard from the member for Oxley was a rambling five-minute speech with a beg for mercy at its end. There was really no explanation of what the thinking was from the government behind this. We have, of course, heard the normal words: ‘This is a windfall profit that needs to be taxed. It is a loophole that needs to be taxed. These are big oil companies.' Any time you are in trouble, roll out the words ‘big oil'. ‘They are naturally evil, evil companies': that is understood by those on the other side of the House. The fact that some of these companies have Australian shareholders-some of whom are self-funded retirees saving the public purse the need for support-and the fact that these shareholders' incomes will be affected by this decision are of no consequence to those on the other side of the House. They would no doubt categorise those self-funded retirees, and those working families who receive a dividend from these companies, as ‘undeserving rich' or something similar. The thing that worries me most is this continual refusal by those who sit opposite to give a categorical assurance to gas consumers. I know the member for Oxley got a little confused as to what that issue was about, but for his benefit, and for the benefit of those on that side of the House who do not understand the issue, the North West Shelf supplies all the gas in Western Australia for both domestic consumers and industry. It is a key source of Western Australia's economic growth and neither the member for Oxley nor the Prime Minister when he was asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition nor Treasury apparently, now that they have been drawn into the debate, are able to give an answer as to whether or not this measure will increase the price of gas in the Western Australian domestic market. I do not have an answer for that, but I am damned concern about it because, at a time when energy prices are increasing around the world, those people in Western Australia who see the company they buy their gas from suddenly facing this inordinately large tax bill would quite rightly want an answer to that question. So let us hear it. Let us hear it from the minister who has introduced this legislation or let us hear it from the resources minister or from the finance minister. Let us get an answer to that, because I think that it is an issue that needs an answer: is this measure, that has been introduced out of the blue and without consultation, going to increase the price of gas to industry consumers, to households in Western Australia and to the users of electricity in Western Australia, bearing in mind that most of the electricity in Western Australia is, of course, produced from gas? There is absolutely no justification for saying that this is a fairness issue. The member for Oxley displayed an absolutely breathtaking lack of understanding of what it takes to get a resource project up and an absolutely breathtaking lack of understanding of what the conditions were back in 1975 when the then Whitlam government introduced excise. In 1977 when this measure was introduced there was a climate where the sorts of dollars involved in getting these projects off the ground and the risk that the company and its shareholders would have had to take would have meant that this gas would most likely still be lying in the ground on the North West Shelf. The tremendous growth that it has brought to not only Western Australia but also the nation as a whole would never have occurred. This measure was introduced solely as an incentive, an inducement, almost a bribe, to get the companies to take the risks that had to be taken to get this gas and its associated condensate and oil out of the ground, into the industry and into the export ships. We have heard a lot from the Minister for Resources and Energy lately on a whole range of topics, all of which are very interesting. More pertinently, however, we hear his suggestion that in this day and age, with our low self-sufficiency in oil and petroleum products, we need to put in place more incentives to get companies to go out into what are known as ‘frontier regions' to explore and to pursue new deposits. That is a good idea. It is not a new idea; in fact, it is old idea. When I was resources minister I did something similar and I certainly say, ‘All power to the arm of the resources minister if he is going to improve on that.' If we go back in time we come back to this issue. This was put in place as a measure to encourage the development of a field which, as I say, is a long way from any major population centre in Western Australia, let alone the rest of Australia. Without this inducement, without this incentive, without this concessionwhich it is-that field probably would not have been developed. The crude oil excise, as I said, was introduced by those renowned socialists and economic vandals, the Whitlam government. I am starting to wonder whether or not this sort of activity, which the Whitlam government was renowned for, is going to be copied by the current Rudd Labor government. The exemption on the condensate for excise was then introduced in 1977, around about the same time as world parity pricing for oil-and I only mention that as an aside, because even with world parity pricing the development of the North West Shelf would not have proceeded without other incentives. What this bill proposes is typical of Labor, and it shows that they have not changed their way at all. They might call themselves economic conservatives, but underneath it all they are just simple, old-fashioned Laborthat is, they are socialist in policy, they attack the achievers of Australia and they attack the so-called big companies. Companies that were started decades ago in Australia are now apparently the targets of those who sit opposite. It just shows that the Labor Party have not changed at all since the Whitlam days. This bill is incomprehensible in the context of developments over the past decade that have seen Australia's economy become the envy of the rest of the world. It is an economy driven by innovation and in a very vestment that has helped drive unemployment to record lows. But the con end of the bill is more the stuff of Third World economies, where investments are made by multinational companies and then snatched away by governments the moment they tap into a rich resource or become profitable. I guess we could hope that this will be a oncer. We could hope that, in its dash for cash, this government has decided that this is just something it has to do. But this morning we awoke to headlines that another Labor government-one not very far from here that is running up an enormous debt, as Labor governments do-has decided to do the same thing to the coal industry in Queensland. Time will not permit me to speak on that issue; but it is inherent in the Labor philosoElliot, J. phy that the moment anyone has anything it grabs it. It is a philosophy which, as I say, would be far more at home in a Third World country somewhere else in the world. The Rudd Labor government is again trashing Australia's reputation and dragging it through the mud as well, just for good measure, all for the sake of a grubby tax grab. The Kelly, M.J. government is showing it has absolutely no idea when it comes to steering the Australian economy or ensuring investment opportunities remain attractive. Stability in the way companies are treated is essential. Those companies are not just essential; they are absolutely essential. Are you going to cut me off? Mr Albanese-When you're finished.",23

12,Mr BOWEN,NOES,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (12.50 pm)-I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. I move the government amendment as circulated: (1) Schedule 1, item 27, page 14 (after line 10), after subsection 6CA(13), insert: (13A) Despite section 169 of the Excise Act 1901, a by-law prescribing a condensate production area may have the effect of imposing duty, in relation to condensate entered for home consumption before the date on which the by-law is published in the Gazette, at a rate higher than the rate of duty payable in respect of the condensate on the day on which the condensate was entered for home consumption. This amendment adds a new provision to the Excise Tariff Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2008. In particular, the amendment authorises the Commissioner of Taxation to make a by-law prescribing a condensate production area with effect from a date before the date the by-law is published in the Commonwealth Gazette. The amendment removes any doubt as to whether the commissioner can do this. This amendment is consistent with item 27 of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2008. This item allows the Commissioner of Taxation to make a by-law prescribing a condensate production area to take effect from a date before the by-law is registered under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.",26
13,Mr KEENAN,NOES,"I would like to note that this is the government's own legislation. It has been in this House for only a number of days and we are already talking about amending it. This was just tabled then. I will take the Assistant Treasurer's word that it is a technical amendment. Quite frankly, like for a lot of these things, it would be helpful if we were given notice and given time to consider things. Somebody up the back laughs. When we are debating things in this parliament, it is perfectly reasonable for us to have a chance to reasonably consider them. We are not going to oppose the amendment. But, like with a lot of these things, it would have been nice to have had a little bit of notice and some time to consider it in the interests of getting the best legislative outcome for the people of Australia.",26
14,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,NOES,"I am interested to see this amendment brought into this bill. There is only one copy of the supplementary explanatory memorandum, which the Clerk has at the present time and which I have had an opportunity only to have a cursory look at. The question needs to be asked. It seems to be that there is an intention by the government to be able to do things by regulation, rather than by primary legislation in this House, where it can be contested and debated. I would like the government to answer the question: is that the purpose of the amendment?",27
15,Mr BOWEN,NOES,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (12.53 pm)-This amendment clarifies and removes beyond doubt that the policy announcement made by the Treasurer on budget night will be implemented as a technical amendment which removes doubt and confirms the ability of the Commissioner of Taxation to make a by-law. This is not a minister making a regulation; it is the Commissioner of Taxation making a by-law, as is commonly understood to be the case. It simply confirms and removes doubt, for clarification purposes.",27
16,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,NOES,"I now have a copy of the supplementary explanatory memorandum. It says: The amendment authorises the Commissioner of Taxation to make a by-lawas you have just explained. However, it goes on to say: As a result, it removes any doubt as to whether the Bill overrides section 169 of the Excise Act 1901. This is necessary to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to make a by-law prescribing a condensate production area, with effect from a date before the by-law is published ... in circumstances where the by-law has the effect of imposing a higher rate of excise duty on condensate entered into home consumption. I do not have the Excise Act in my hands. Would the minister please inform the House what section 169 of the Excise Act says so that we can be informed as to precisely what the intent of the amendment is.",27
17,Mr BOWEN,NOES,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (12.54 pm)-I have already explained the intent of the amendment to the House. It is to clarify and remove beyond doubt the powers of the Commissioner of Taxation to implement the law as he sees appropriate.",27
18,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,NOES,"When the explanatory memorandum, as amended, says that the intent is to remove any doubt as to whether the bill overrides section 169 of the Excise Act, as this has been brought into the House in an unexpected manner, I think it is incumbent upon the minister to know precisely what this bill is overriding and to inform the House of precisely that. If that is the act, please read it out.",27
19,Mr BOWEN,NOES,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (12.55 pm)-I was not going to go into detail but as this is being made into an issue I can inform the House that this amendment was circulated on 29 May. It was not just moved by me without notice and I must say that the shadow minister's office was advised of this last week.",27
20,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,NOES,"I would be interested to know what time on 29 May. It was the last time we sat, if I recall, to put that into context. Nonetheless, you are the minister, you ought to know what it is that your amendment is amending and you ought to be able to tell us what section 169 of the Excise Act says.",27
21,Mr BOWEN,NOES,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (12.56 pm)-The answer to the honourable member's question is 10.40 am.",28
22,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,NOES,"The question outstanding is: will the minister please tell us what section 169, the one you are amending, says? As the minister, you are supposed to have knowledge of it. If you do not know the answer to the question and you do not know what the section is that you are amending, because you have not been briefed or you have not bothered to look yourself, would you mind telling the House that you are unable to tell the House what you are in charge of and should know, and do not know.",28
23,Mr BOWEN,NOES,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (12.56 pm)-I refer the honourable member to the comments I made on numerous occasions explaining the purpose of this amendment. It is quite clear. It was circulated at 10.40 am-before 11 o'clock-on 29 May. There has been plenty of time for the honourable member or any other honourable member to contact my office for clarification. My understanding is that none have. It is a perfectly clear, techniunable cal amendment and the situation remains as per my previous comments.",28
24,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,NOES,"It is becoming quite apparent that the minister does not know what it is that he is amending, that he is simply dodging the question. If he does not know, he has advisers up in his box-could he please send one of them to find out what section 169 says. You are the minister; you are in government; you are supposed to know. If you do not know the answer, please just rise and say, ‘I do not know,' and send someone out to get it and then you can tell us when they come back.",28
25,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Is anybody additional seeking the call? If not, I will put the question.",28
26,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,NOES,Could I ask the minister if he has asked one of his advisers to go and get section 169 so that he can tell us what it is he is amending?,28
27,Mr BOWEN,NOES,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (12.58 pm)-I have made it quite clear what this amendment deals with. I have made it quite clear which section of the act it amends and which section of the bill it amends. If the honourable member concerned wants to get further advice I am more than happy for her to seek that advice. I am not going to go and get a copy of the act for me to read into the Hansard when it is quite clear what this amendment does.",28
28,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,NOES,"I will not intervene further after this because it is now quite apparent to the House and to anybody who is listening to the broadcast that the minister who purports to know what he is about is unable to tell the House what it is he is amending and he was to 'fess up to the fact he did not know, unless that piece of paper he has just been handed tells him what section 169 of the Excise Act says. I will not intervene further unless he has got some extra information to give us. It is very disappointing to see that the Assistant Treasurer of this government is not across his brief and simply is not up to doing the job that he is supposed to do. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. (Quorum formed) Third Reading",28

31,Ms LEY,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I appreciate the opportunity to continue my remarks on the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008, the Income Tax (First Home Saver Accounts Misuse Tax) Bill 2008 and the First Home Saver Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008, which I commenced in the last sitting of parliament. Those remarks focused on the reasons we in the opposition believe that this First Home Saver Accounts measure is unlikely to do much to help the housing affordability crisis in Australia today. I remind the Treasurer and the Prime Minister of the following real reasons for the worsening housing affordability problem. Limited land supply induced by restrictive land release policies of state and local governments is the main reason for rising housing costs. Government taxes, fees, levies, charges and compliance costs are adding enormously to the cost of new housing and now represent a quarter to a third of the cost of a new house and land package. Not much more than a month ago the Housing Industry Association reminded us of the housing supply crisis when they said there should now be a united focus and interest by all governments in increasing the supply of affordable housing. Housing finance and a range of other leading indicators suggest a further widening in the gap between housing supply and demand. HIA contends that the housing industry should be building at least 175,000 new residential dwellings each year to satisfy existing demand. In my earlier remarks I contended that others have said that the under-building rate is 30,000. I agree with the HIA: it is much, much more. In my earlier remarks I talked about the way the first home saver account addresses the demand side of the housing affordability equation and does nothing for the supply side, and I said that we would not be opposing the measure because anything that encourages young people to save for their first home-or, in fact, save at all-has got to be a good thing. I mentioned the example, which caused some amusement to those opposite, of plasma televisions. I mentioned that because they are still the most demanded consumer item in Australia today. But we have seen them come down in price from about $14,000 five years ago to about $1,500 today-for the simple reason that the supply has kept up with the demand. This is pretty basic stuff. The supply of land to build entrylevel first homes is in no way keeping up with the demand. So, by adding more dollars to the demand side of the equation, you are giving people more money to spend in an already extremely tight housing market. I will anticipate some of what the housing minister may say in her remarks. She may talk about the supply side and the things that the government is doing to address that. There are in fact two measures on the table: the Housing Affordability Fund and the National Rental Affordability Scheme. Anyone who tuned into Senate estimates this morning would have found some very interesting material on the likely effectiveness of both of those schemes. I was able to watch some questions and answers on the Housing Affordability Fund and it reinforced to me that there is a generational divide without comparison in the way we do development applications in this country and in the way that local government produces first homes for first home buyers. So, if you live in the leafy North Shore of Sydney you would pay far, far less than somebody starting out in the western suburbs of Sydney, where sometimes the development applications take three years to process through council. The Housing Affordability Fund is, I think, $500 million-it may be $600 million. I would be unkind but I need to be: I am going to call it a slush fund that local and governments are allowed to apply to. So here we have the federal government providing a fund which state governments can dip into in order to relieve the housing affordability sis. Thirty million dollars has been released to help develop a website where you can track the progress of your development application-a so-called electronic development application website. I noticed that there was a development assessment forum brought together in 1998 to talk about this, and clearly they are just still talking. If we have the delays that we are hearing about, with the holding costs for developers and ultimately for first home owners, it is just not good enough. Why should the federal government provide $500 million for state governments to dip into to do the things that they should be doing anyway? It is incumbent upon them to release land in a progressive and orderly fashion and in a way which allows first home owners to build. The fact that there is no affordable land on the fringes of our major cities is an indictment of us all. I have told the House before about the reasons why: state treasuries must maximise the returns to themselves from the land that they own and from the stamp duty they get from first home owners. Yes, there are some concessions in some states, but overall they get money from first home owners through stamp duty. State treasuries say: ‘Well, we have to maximise the land, so we will release it in a suitably slow fashion so that we get as much money as possible.' But the people who are stuck at the end of this are the first home owners not able to get an affordable home. When the matter was discussed in Senate estimates this morning, they also covered the National Rental Affordability Scheme. It was interesting to see officers from the housing branch of the department of family and community services essentially say that what state they are doing is implementing the government's election commitment-that that is what their work is focused on. So, with the National Rental Affordability Scheme, there cri- will be 3,500 houses in 2008-09, 7,500 in 2009-10, 14,000 in 2010-11 and 25,000 by the time we get to 2011-12. But, when the senators quizzed the department on sound evidence and research to demonstrate the rate at which these housing incentives would be taken up or why they would work or the details of the scheme, they kept coming back to the answer: ‘We are focused on implementing the government's election commitments.' They did not say there was a reason why they would not work, but they could not tell the Senate committee why they would work. This has been my point about the National Rental Affordability Scheme. It is fine to offer incentives to developers. I will remind the House that that is what it does. As a developer you are entitled to a $6,000 tax credit from the federal government and a $2,000 tax credit from the state government, either in dollars or in kind, and that is over a period of 10 years. As a developer you are then required to build an affordable home-the style of the home, of course, is up to the developer-but the requirement is that it is rented out for 20 per cent below the market rent of the geographic area. The questions that the senators quite reasonably asked were: how do you determine the geographic market area; how do you police such a scheme; what happens if somebody within one of these homes moves out or their circumstances change-do they suddenly break through the threshold and have to leave? But, more importantly, what was focused on and what I believe is important is that this is actually not going to address the supply-side problem that we face. There will be 3,500 houses if we are lucky this year",29
32,Mr KERR,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, I rise on a point of order. If I could draw your attention to the subject matter of the legislation, it does seem to be drawing quite a long bow to be discussing these matters, which are not at all at issue in the legislation.",31
33,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,The member for Farrer will return to the bill before the House.,31
34,Ms LEY,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I know it may appear to the government that these are not relevant, but I think they are. This is a bill that discusses housing affordability",31
35,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Can I just point out to the member for Farrer: it is not whether the government thinks it is relevant; it is whether the person occupying the chair finds it relevant, and I have asked you to return to the bill before the House.",31
36,Ms LEY,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I will quickly conclude my remarks on this part of what I wanted to say. What I really wanted to say is that, as is demonstrated all over this place at the moment-in Senate committees, in conversations that are being had, in admissions by government officers-the measures that the government is proposing on the supply side of the housing affordability equation are unlikely to work. They are untested, unresponsive and unlikely to work. I want to make that point because I am not sure whether those measures are coming before the House in any legislation. I think that, while we have something that is being presented as a reason",31
37,Mr KERR,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I appreciate the attempt of the honourable member to continue to do what the chair has directed her not to do, but I ask the chair to make certain that we do not digress further and that we actually do return to the subject matter of the legislation.",31
38,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Member for Farrer, I ask you to address the bill before the House.",31
39,Ms LEY,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,It is clear that the minister for housing does not want me to actually expand on the reasons why the two other supply-side measures are not going to work.,31
40,Mr KERR,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am not the minister for housing, and it is the request of the Deputy Speaker that the member return to the subject matter of the legislation.",32
41,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Member for Farrer, I again remind you that it is not the government asking you to do this; standing orders require you to be relevant to the lation before the parliament, and I ask you to return to the bill before the House.",32
42,Ms LEY,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I appreciate that you are in a frustrating position and I will try to make it less frustrating for you. No doubt, I will have another opportunity to talk about the Housing Affordability Fund and the National Rental Affordability Scheme. As I reminded the House earlier, the opposition are not opposing first home saver accounts, because we appreciate that any opportunity young people have to save is a good thing. However, if the measure is successful, the principal reason for it being cessful will be that people change their saving habits. A relatively modest government co-contribution-$850-is the most one could receive and then you would have to save $5,000. That is difficult for a young person in any situation these days. If you saved $1,000 you would get a government co-contribution of $150. Add that to the enormous complications surrounding the rules that govern the accounts-that have been admitted to be quite inflexible and quite onerous-a young person considering whether to go ahead and take up a first home saver account, should the financial institutions offer them in a competitive way, and we have yet to see that, may well decide to use other savings options. They may well decide that the small advantage they would accrue over the time they held their first home saver account would be quickly outstripped by the rising costs of housing in Australia. If nothing is done to address the supply-side factors I expect that that is exactly what will happen. I conclude my remarks on this bill by reminding us all of those who do not have a roof over their head. We talk about houses, but there are some Australians who will legisnever own their own home and there are many Australians who are homeless and sleep on the street each night. During the last sitting of parliament the Salvation Army was here. I would like to place on record my strong support for their programs. I assisted them in the launch of the Red Shield Appeal in Cairns relatively recently. I could not believe the individual work that they do for the homeless and the quality of the advice and support they provide. So I think it was quite difficult for Salvation Army Captain Paul Moulds to warn the government-yes, there has been a great focus on the homeless issue, which is much appreciated by those who help the homeless-‘I don't think there has sucbeen one additional homeless person that has yet been helped.' It is very important when expectations are this high that we do not continue with reviews, green papers, white papers, committees and discussions that actually do not give the dollars to the people who need them-the people who know very well what is required.",32
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,The member for Farrer is again straying significantly from the bill before the House. I have allowed her a great deal of latitude.,32
44,Ms LEY,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,Thank you. I have concluded my remarks.,32
45,Ms PLIBERSEK,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (1.18 pm)-I am almost speechless to hear representatives of the former government that presided over 12 years of inactivity and inaction on housing affordability and homelessness now getting up and urging a new government in office for six months to do more on an issue that they ignored for over a decade. The extraordinary hide of the shadow minister getting up and saying we have done nothing-when we have spent $150 million already on crisis accommodation, have backed RecLink Australia to roll out their programs nationally, have backed the soccer Homeless World Cup, have released our green paper on homelessness and are now anticipating a white paper in September, which is a very fast turnaround time for anyone who understands how the green paper and white paper process works-after 12 years of neglect by the previous government, is absolutely extraordinary. We see it also in these arguments about the first home saver accounts. I think the shadow minister's most damning indictment was when she said, ‘We have a responsibility to fix this.' What a damning indictment of the previous government. Yes, there is a housing affordability crisis that the shadow minister mentioned half-a-dozen times or a dozen times in her speech. Did this housing affordability crisis evolve in six months? Was housing perfectly affordable on 25 November last year but now, suddenly, there is a housing affordability crisis? This crisis has evolved because we have not been building enough homes-I perfectly agree with the shadow minister on that. We are 30,000 homes short. The shadow minister believes that this is probably an underestimate. I think it is probably an underestimate too. How many years has this been going on? What action did the previous government take to improve housing affordability? Name one thing. Impossible. We have had various criticisms. The first that the shadow minister raised when she started speaking in our past sitting period was that money saved through the first home saver accounts would be capitalised into higher housing prices. That is curious because that was not the approach the previous government took when they introduced the first home owners grant. They did not believe that at the time. There is a very clear difference between the first home saver accounts and the first home owners grant. The first home savers account, as the shadow minister understands, has a minimum lock-in period that she has also criticised. They have a minimum lock-in period because we do not want this extra money to flow through in one lump and push up housing prices. That is a design feature for the very reason that we do not want additional money punching the market all in one go and pushing up house prices. Many people who start saving in their first home saver accounts this year will not be ready to buy a house in four or five years time. It might take them six, seven or eight years to save a deposit, so we will not have the inflationary impact of all of this money coming through at once. We also give ourselves the time to start to address some of the critical-(Quorum formed) The shadow minister several times made a point about this government not doing enough to address housing supply. I really need to take issue with this. The first home saver account is one measure out of a range of measures such as the Housing Affordability Fund, the National Rental Affordability Scheme and the reforms that we are engaging in with our state and local government colleagues. All of these are designed to begin to turn around the critical housing supply shortage we have. We have a housing supply shortage. The shadow minister is absolutely right in saying that. And the reason that we are engaging with the housing affordability problem in a range of ways is so that we help young people save a deposit for their first home and also make sure that there are more affordable homes being built. That is what the Housing Affordability Fund and the National Rental Affordability Scheme will help with. The shadow minister also said that the first home saver account will increase demand. That means more young people will want to buy their first homes. What a scandalous idea: that more young people would want to buy their first homes! If this increases demand for first homes then I will be the first to be pleased about that. We have seen a declining proportion of all loans going to first home buyers because they have been priced out of the market, and a critical factor in that is that they cannot afford the deposit on their first home anymore. This is partly because they are paying so much more for their rent. So if demand goes up for first homes, I will be the first to be excited about that. The shadow minister says this is a small measure. It is a modest measure. We think it will help about half a million people save a deposit for their first homes. I think that is substantial. The shadow minister argued that the measures here should be more tightly targeted. I think, from someone who was in a government where 270 millionaires were paid $3½ thousand each in family payments in the last two years, that an argument about tighter targeting is one that is difficult to sustain publicly. She criticised the minimum lock-in period. The minimum lock-in period is vital because we want people to change their culture of saving. We also do not want a flood of money to hit the market before our supply measures begin to work. She was worried about what would happen to joint accounts when people split up. There are not any joint accounts, so we do not need to worry about that. She was worried about what would happen if the savings that people were making were outstripped by price increases. So the logical argument is that people should go now and borrow 100 per cent of the purchase price of a new home and get themselves into exactly the sort of trouble that we are seeing, with people defaulting on loans in record numbers, because we do not want people waiting around to save a deposit. That is the kookiest logic I have heard in some time when it comes to talking about saving a deposit. The shadow minister puts all of the problems down to land supply, taxes and charges. According to her, it is all the fault of the states, it is all the fault of local government and there is nothing the previous government could have ever done from a federal level. It could not have released Commonwealth land like the states were asking, for example. It could not have done any of that. I will finish commenting on the shadow minister's points with this one last point. The shadow minister was critical of the Housing Affordability Fund and talked about how the $30 million for electronic development applications was for a website. She clearly misunderstands that this is about a substantial reform, not just to how people interact with the system but to the system itself, to give the ability to process applications much faster. She mentioned that the Development Assessment Forum have been around since 1998. They gave the same advice to the previous government as they have given to usthat there needs to be massive reform-and we have actually taken that advice and started to move on it. The fact that they could not get anyone to listen to them for 10 years, the fact that the only measures in this area undertaken by the previous government had no accountability measures at all and the fact that they had no interoperability so that any changes made to electronic development around the states or between local government areas could not work together properly have not been mentioned at all. Mr Sullivan-Who was there, Housing Minister?",32
46,Ms PLIBERSEK,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,Let me think!,35
47,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,The minister will not respond to interjections.,35
48,Ms PLIBERSEK,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"That is right. They did not have a housing minister so it would be impossible to name a housing minister. It shows how important they thought this was. The homebuyers have been shut out of the housing market. We know that now, across Australia, they account for barely one in six of all home purchases. The figure was 16.4 per cent in March 2008 compared with over one-quarter of home purchases five years ago. The size of the typical first home mortgage has more than doubled in 10 years, from $104,000 in December 1997 to $230,000 in March 2008. According to the Real Estate Institute, median house prices continue to escalate and increased by 12 per cent across Australia in 2007. That is great for people who own their own homes already. What we are missing is an entry-level product and the ability for first home buyers to enter the market at that affordable level. I get letters all the time from people who despair of ever being able to own their own home or indeed parents and grandparents who despair of their ability to see their children and grandchildren own their own homes. One letter was from a lady in Perth who wrote to the Prime Minister. She said: Myself and everyone I know can not believe how much the prices of houses ... are at the moment. is a really sad thing, as I am happily married a beautiful baby and would love to have a house of our own, as we live with my parents. Our dream is to have our own house, but ... I doubt it if we will ever have a house of our own. My husband works long hours, 7 days a week ... but there is still no hope. So, it would be absolutely fantastic if the government could do more to help with first home buyers ... Well, we are. First home saver accounts will help aspiring homebuyers like this young family from Perth to save a bigger deposit. The new accounts will be available from October this year. The shadow minister criticised that as well, asking: why only from October? You could ask: why not from last October or the October before or the October before that? The government will provide a 17 per cent contribution on the first $5,000 of individual contributions made each year. That means someone who manages to save $5,000, which I agree is a lot of money to save, will receive an $850 deposit from the government. The thing is that, if you are not able to save those bigger amounts, it will be hard to save for a deposit and pay your mortgage down the track. We do have to encourage people to engage in serious saving if they aspire to own their own homes. I notice that the shadow minister is now critical of the flat rate because it benefits an apprentice on $10,000 a year more than it does a person earning $180,000 a year. The point to make here is that the apprentice is more likely to save for a number of years. If you start saving when you are 18 or 19 you might be saving for eight, nine or 10 years but, when you are in a position to pay the mortgage on your property, you will have saved a substantially greater deposit. That young person might be able to put away hundreds of dollars every year from the government contribution. Someone on $180,000 It a year is not going to save for 10 years to with buy a house. In fact, they might not even take up these new accounts-and we accept that-because they might think: ‘I don't really need to save for four years; I can put away a lot more money over the next two or three years, and I'm going to go down that path.' Good luck to them if they can manage without us. The 15 per cent tax on contributions as they are accumulating interest within the account is a terrific measure. It means that the accounts will be more tax effective as the money collects in them than if they had the money in an ordinary savings account. It is the same amount as if they were older people putting money into their superannuation, and I think that that is a very fair approach to take in helping these young couples save for their first home. A couple on average incomes that save 10 per cent of their incomes would be able to save a deposit of more than $88,000 after five years. I understand that it is a big ask for people to save that proportion of their income, but what I also need to say that we find a lot of young people who set themselves the target of saving for their first home are very prepared to make some sacrifices. The government seeks to help and reward them along the way so that, instead of being caught in a rental cycle as more and more young Australians are today, these young couples and young individuals will be able to begin to save a deposit for their own home. This is not just good for individuals, for couples and for families but also very, very important for our national savings. We need to encourage people to get into a regular habit of saving. We all know that having a mortgage come out of your weekly pay packet and being in the habit of living within your means is much easier than taking the initial step of saving the deposit in the first place. So we hope that this will encourage a culture of saving. We expect that people will save and that, by 2012, the government contribution will have accumulated to about $6½ billion. This is absolutely vital in our efforts to bring down the inflationary pressures in the Australian economy. We do not just need these individual savings, though it is very important to encourage a culture of saving. Tto increase our national savings by $6.5 billion by 2012 is phenomenally responsible, well-judged policy that does reflect our commitment before the last election. I thought it was very curious that the shadow minister was somehow criticising public servants for saying that they are in the business of helping the government to deliver on election commitments. I thought that is what the people of Australia would expect of the government: to deliver on our election commitments. This was one of our election commitments. It was designed to help young Australians who are increasingly finding it difficult to buy their first home save a bigger deposit with a little bit of government help. I is am very proud of that aim and very proud that this policy delivers on it.",35
49,Mrs VALE,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I rise to address these three bills, the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008, the First Home Saver Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 and the Income Tax (First Home Saver Accounts Misuse Tax) Bill 2008. First, all the business that was put before the House last week has demonstrated that this government is forcing through its legislative agenda with insolent disregard to the well-established parliamentary convention here in this place. For decades this practice has allowed the various parties and Independent members the opportunity to scrutinise legislation in the true exercise of the democratic process as it moves through the threshold of initial consideration by this House. The process is essential for the transparency and accountability that our fellow Australians have rightly come to expect from us here in this chamber. Unfortunately for my constituents, there has been no opportunity to fully apprehend the details of several bills that went through the House last week, and these bills were virtually dumped on them by the government late last Tuesday night. Fortunately, these three bills relating to housing affordability measures were held over to this week and I wish to take this opportunity to speak on the bills because they are aimed at an issue which has engaged my interest for some time and one that is of concern to many of my fellow Australians, especially Indigenous and disadvantaged Australians, who see themselves as locked out of the great Australian dream of owning their own home. The First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 is not a supply-side solution; it demand-side measure and a modest measure at that, but I do not oppose the measure. It does establish first home saver accounts, it governs their operation, it provides for the payment of government contributions for account holders and it provides for the prudential regulation of account providers. The First Home Saver Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 provides consequential amendments to other Commonwealth laws, chiefly the taxation and corporations law. Finally, the Income Tax (First Home Saver Accounts Misuse Tax) Bill 2008 imposes the misuse tax to claw back benefits obtained by an account holder who inappropriately uses the account. I note that the government's proposed model has significantly changed since the announcement of the budget. Pre-budget, the government was to pay a variable contribution of between 15 and 30 per cent of the first $5,000 per annum, depending on the account holder's marginal tax rate. This would have resulted in higher income earners receiving a significantly larger government contribution than lower income earners, which would have been grossly unfair. It was a point made a number of times in this chamber during question time, to which the minister never provided a straight answer but which we now note has been addressed in this legislation. I am now advised that the first $5,000 per annum saved in a first home saver account will attract a 17 per cent contribution from the Australian government and earnings on the account will be taxed at a low 15 per cent. The overall account balance limit has also been increased to $75,000 indexed, after which no further personal contributions can be made. Withdrawals can only be made after contributions of at least $1,000 have been made in the last four separate financial years, and withdrawals are tax free when the money is used to buy or build is a a first home in which the couple lives. During the last election the coalition policy regarding home-ownership proposed to introduce tax-free home saver accounts to provide a simple, tax effective way to help Australians to save for their first home. A key difference in the coalition policy is that it was proposed to have two types of accounts: one a tax-free home saver account for children and the other a tax-free home saver account for adults. Tax-free home saver accounts for children were to be available to all Australians under 18 years of age. Parents, grandparents and others wishing to contribute up to a total of $1,000 between them each year could place money into an account. The enticement of this initiative is that these contributions would have been tax deductible and savings in the account would have been available to purchase a first home anytime after the account holder turned 18 years of age. Other initiatives proposed by the coalition last year included shared equity schemes. This included providing a capital gains exemption to individuals who shared equity in a home occupied by a family member and which is the family member's first time home. This legislation now before the House represents the Rudd government's response to the crisis in housing affordability and I repeat that it includes three measures: the Housing Affordability Fund, the National Rental Affordability Scheme and the first home saver account. However, as Australians well know, the major drivers in the housing affordability crisis include the restrictive land release policies of state and local governments, and government taxes, fees, levies, charges and compliance costs which are borne by the new homeowner. These charges make up more than a quarter of the cost of a new house and land package. I note that the report from the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability is due to be presented in mid-June this year. While this government is looking at these three measures to address the current housing affordability crisis, we all know that will not solve the core problem. It seems to me that what is really required here is that we take a objective, fresh and honest look at the issue, which is a problem that impacts on the most disadvantaged Australians, and find a solution that provides equity and equality in home-ownership for disadvantaged Australian families, including Indigenous Australian families. It is possible that such a soluaddress tion could be framed to be a supply-side solution flexible enough to address, at the same time, several key portfolio areas of concern and, further, be implemented at considerable savings to the government. If I ruled the world, I would want such a solution to provide affordable housing for our disadvantaged Australians, our disadvantaged Indigenous Australians, as well as mainstream Australians. I take the opportunity provided by this debate to outline a framework that would include three important benchmarks in addressing affordable housing ownership, particularly ownership by my fellow Australians: one, it must provide home-ownership for disadvantaged Australian families; two, it must pay for itself through savings in recurrent outlays; and, three, it must include Indigenous Australians. Members may not be aware, but the federal government spends around $3 billion a year on rental assistance. This is in payments for rental assistance through Centrelink and housing assistance to the states. This is $3 billion a year. It is spent by the government simply to keep people as renters. The Australian government can do much better than this. Home affordability is an issue in all the states and, evidenced by these bills, it is an issue also for the federal government. If this government is serious about addressing this issue, it needs to set in place a national structural change agenda that systematically addresses the reasons for the emergence of home affordability as an issue in the states they and one that provides for coordinated and economically responsible long-term solutions. The idea is this: the federal government should adopt a national housing policy framework to allow it to take a direct leadership position in stimulating the supply of affordable housing through a private-public partnership approach and at the same time the causes of home affordability issues that have emerged in the states. Let's face it, the piecemeal approach adopted by the states has proved to be an abject failure. We are all aware that the explosion of state fees and charges on land is one of the main causes of the increase in the cost of housing. Mindful that the federal government contributes around $3 billion each year to keep people as renters, it could allocate a portion of this to fund up to 20 per cent of the cost of a house and land package constructed for a price-let us say, $250,000-and sold to approved applicants who are currently on state government public housing waiting lists or for other low-income earners",36
50,Mr KERR,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I apologise to the member for Hughes for the discourtesy of asking her to address the subject matter of this legislation, but she is very far from this particular bill and it was a matter that your predecessor in the chair drew attention to earlier today.",38
51,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,What is your point of order?,39
52,Mr KERR,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,I would simply ask that the member address the actual subject matter of the legislation rather than the generality of issues that she is addressing presently.,39
53,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,There is no point of order. I have been listening to the member for Hughes. She is talking about housing affordability. I think she is also ting forward some suggestions as part of her speech. I call the member for Hughes.,39
54,Mrs VALE,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Indeed, I am-I could not be more focused on a particular policy or a particular piece of legislation. As I was saying, the federal government could allocate a portion of the $3 billion a year that it spends to keep people as renters to fund up to 20 per cent of the cost of a house and land package constructed for a price-and let us say, $250,000-and that would be sold to approved applicants who are currently on state government public housing waiting lists or other low-income earners who may wish to buy in. Three-quarters of this 20 per cent could be allocated as a co-contribution to the approved purchaser as a deposit on the $250,000 house and land package. The remaining quarter could be allocated to the developer as an incentive to provide housing in the market sector.",39
55,Mr KERR,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is a very interesting excursus into what a policy might be on an area not covered by the legislation.",39
56,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,There is no point of order. The member for Hughes is talking about housing affordability. I call the member for Hughes.,39
57,Mrs VALE,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I certainly am. I am talking about housing affordability for our most disadvantaged Australians, and it is appropriate that it be addressed in this particular legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will have noticed that this is a supply-side solution. It is about building a family home for a price. Yes, the approved purchaser would have to source their own house financing, perhaps via the new shared equity mortgage products that are currently appearing on the market, or perhaps cashed-up baby boomers would run putwith the opportunity to equity-share with a grandchild now that the grandchild has access to a home deposit, especially if the government provides that there would be no tax liability for the other party on any future sale of the property. The federal government is in a position to allocate crown land or surplus Defence land to a developer on commercial terms or perhaps offset the co-contribution, where appropriate, to target areas in particular need of affordable housing. Most importantly, this framework would provide a return on the investment to the public purse, which might be of interest to the member at the table. On a $250,000 house package, the cost to the government is $50,000.",39
58,Mr KERR,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is of interest to the member at the table, but it is simply not relevant to the legislation under discussion. Mr Deputy Speaker, you do have a responsibility of holding speakers to the subject matter of the legislation before the House. This is not legislation addressed generally to the subject of housing; it is legislation",39
59,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,The parliamentary secretary has made his point of order.,39
60,Mr KERR,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"which is very specific, and it would be helpful to at least have one or two comments from the member for Hughes on the legislation.",39
61,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"The parliamentary secretary will resume his seat. I listened to the minister herself, who spoke about the previous government's inaction, as she termed it, which I do not think was referred to in the bill. We listened to that. I have ruled on the point of order. The member for Hughes has the call.",40
62,Mrs VALE,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Most importantly, this framework would provide a return on the investment to the public purse. On a $250,000 house and land package, the cost to the government is $50,000. Of this amount, $12,500 would be assigned to the developer and $37,500 to the approved purchaser. These figures are indicative. For example, for a person in public housing receiving rent assistance of about $130 a week, the payback period is under eight years and in this time the approved purchaser is a winner in Australia's economic stability and not a tim of it. One of the key positive outcomes of this approach is that in providing a solution to those communities needing home-ownership support, it creates the greatest long-term short-term return-that is, by providing home-ownership support to a family with two or more children, the social benefits for the family are immediate and as such families attract the highest government rent assistance, the long-term economic benefit is high. This framework would pay for itself in eight years and return about 12 per cent on the investment to our government. This is a national solution to a national problem, and with home-ownership as the key driver to increased supply, we enable people to get out of the rental trap and allow the federal ernment to rebalance federal housing funding by either implementing national long-term solutions or maintaining the currently failing systems of state public housing. It also provides leverage. For every $1 of also public money we get $5 worth of increasing affordable housing and the affordable housing is in the form of home-ownership, not bigger and fatter landlords. This means that the $15 billion allocated over the next five years by the federal government to the states for housing and rental assistance could be leveraged to $75 billion by putting disadvantaged Australians into their own homes. I refer to an article in the Herald Sun on 14 August last year called ‘Rental relief ‘flimsy'' where the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, said the federal government would be spending the equivalent of $15 billion on homes for low-income earners and on rental aid over the next five-year period. The federal government would then be in a position to undertake a long-term program of balancing federal housing funds between vic- providing increased home-ownership and/or the current state public housing. This program would allow the government to target housing solutions to rural and remote areas or to key areas within towns and cities. But and what can this framework deliver for the people of Australia? Several cross-portfolio opportunities present themselves, like the opportunity to implement a national building code and the ability to address the current skills shortage. Also, the program will honour Indigenous Australians and assist with the process of reconciliation in a positive way. But most importantly, such a national structural change will also beget social attitudinal changes. Those federal funds that currently pay to keep low-income Australians in the rent trap will be available to congov- tribute to many of those same Australians becoming homeowners with all the positive social ramifications that home-ownership is known to generate. With an opportunity to implement a national building code, the government would be in a position to assist in driving down the associated building costs of housing which can be part of its solution for affordable housing. Driving down the cost of building houses is important as a long-term strategy, but it would also provide increased certainty to the housing industry and help level out the bust and boom cycles. Further, a national building code could call for all the individual cost components for land to be itemised so that the consumer can see exactly how much of the price is due to value-add by the developer or builder, and how much is fees and charges by state and local governments. Many an Australian family would be vitally interested in knowing such details that go to the cost of their home. I think tant and it is something that was raised by previous speakers on this bill. This framework would also allow the government to address another key cost driver in the housing industry-that is, the skills shortage. A new national trades accreditation regime by the federal government could be based on trainees having their year 12 plus a two-year traineeship program. Already, some school students are undertaking vocational training as part of the HSC. But when we understand that even to be a tiler is a four-year training program, it is ridiculous in the greater scheme of things. The federal government would be in a position to introduce a national TAFE training and accreditation program to address this issue. A national trades accreditation regime means mobility of the workforce and increased supply. It would encourage more trainees and, in particular, it would remove key barriers to mature age people taking up a trade. A national regime would also encourage",40
63,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,The member for Hughes is straying from the subject at the moment by talking about skilling Australians. She will come back to the bill before the House.,41
64,Mrs VALE,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. No doubt, the government would find that other opportunities would present themselves in this framework. It is a practical suggestion regarding housing affordability that is driven by the supply of housing built for a price for disadvantaged Australians who may never have the opportunity to share in the great Australian dream of home-ownership. I will be putting this framework for affordable housing to the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia for the committee's consideration. I this is impor- thank the House.",41
65,Mr RAGUSE,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"In the time given to me in the next few minutes, I will give my introductory views on this bill. I certainly rise to speak in favour of the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and the associated bills that form that set. In my electorate of Forde there is no one issue that is more important than housing-housing availability, housing affordability. It is interesting to listen to the opposition today and their discussions about what alternative legislation would bring to this place, but the reality is that these particular bills are not just about housing to get a person into a house; they are also about the overall economic conditions under which we are placed. The interesting thing for us is that when we talk about south-east Queensland, where the seat of Forde is, it is an area that is experiencing an enormous rate of growth. The pressures there are more specific to the economic concerns we have across the country simply because of the demand. It is, as the opposition have said, a supply and demand issue. But as our Prime Minister has said, silver bullet solutions just do not exist. This is a case of making a raft of options available, and certainly our first home saver accounts scheme is about bringing young people into the culture of saving. We have heard it many times this morning, certainly from the opposition. Interestingly enough, the opposition essentially agree with this bill. They agree so much that they had to talk about their alternatives. The reality is this is before the House; it is important that this bill gets passage through this House because it is part of some relief for those young people who are attempting to buy their first homes. When I say ‘young people' I certainly include other people who are classified under that arrangement, but it is about people having the opportunity to buy their first home. The seat of Forde is an area that is in such demand that people who once had affordable housing in some of the areas are now not able to even find rental accommodation. The pressure is such that the demand for rental accommodation is outstripping supply. We have areas that have had huge rental increases-up to 70 per cent increasessimply because the supply of housing is not there. Mr Speaker, I obviously commend this bill because of its ability to provideDebate interrupted.",41

69,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I rise to inform the House that Australian combat troops have lowered the flag at the conclusion of their mission in southern Iraq. The government, in bringing this about, is delivering on its commitment to the Australian people to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq. The Overwatch Battle Group (West) and Australian Army Training Team Iraq formally ceased operations at a ceremony in Camp Terendak, Talil a few hours ago. Iraqi, American and British commanders publicly thanked Australia, and the Australian troops, for their contribution during Sunday's ceremony. Australia's commitment to southern Iraq included the deployment of an infantry and cavalry battle group for more than three years and a dedicated training team for almost four years. The training team commitment commenced in July 2003 but began in earnest with the formation of the Australian Army Training Team-Iraq in October 2004. The Australian Defence Force deployed a task group to al-Muthanna province in April 2005, initially to work with the Japanese Self-Defence Forces. Later, the group transitioned to an overwatch role and began providing convoy escorts and security for reconstruction projects, as well as training and mentoring for the Iraqi security forces in alMuthanna and Dhi Qar provinces in the second half of 2006. A total of 3,700 Australian Defence Force personnel proudly served in the battle group and training team and thankfully, only six were wounded during this commitment. In addition, specialist training has been provided in logistics management, combat service support and, importantly, effective counter-insurgency operations. The Australian contribution to the Iraqi army's Counter Insurgency Academy is one of the lasting legacies of our commitment. The success of recent Iraqi security operations in southern Iraq is in part thanks to the dedicated and professional role of this Australian training team. Over the period of their commitment, our soldiers have faced and responded to multiple improvised explosive device, indirectand direct-fire attacks. Australian infantry and cavalry soldiers have been courageous and resolute in response. Iraq remains a dangerous place-as recently as two weeks ago, an Australian soldier was seriously wounded in an improvised explosive device attack on an Australian armoured vehicle. Australian forces have been especially recognised for the way they have been able to work so successfully with the local population in helping to improve their lives, cluding through the provision of about $9 million in funding for civil infrastructure projects such as redevelopment of schools, sanitation programs and enhancement of health facilities. About 550 Australian Defence Force personnel are now preparing to-or are in the process of-withdrawing from Iraq. They have performed their mission superbly in a complex, dangerous and unpredictable environment. In the great tradition of the Austraadditional lia Defence Force, they have responded with absolute professionalism to the demands of the democratically elected government of the day in Australia and discharged their mission with distinction. However, this withdrawal does not signal an end to the Australian Defence Force's mission. Australian Defence Force personnel will, of course, continue to support the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq through a variety of important roles: - the Royal Australian Navy will continue maritime security operations in the Arabian Gulf, guarding oil platforms crucial to Iraq's economy-part of a continuing Australian naval presence in the Gulf going back to the first Gulf War; - the Royal Australian Air Force will support the coalition through vital transport, sustainment and maritime patrol tasks; - the Australian Army will protect Australian diplomats, other civilian staff and senior visitors to Baghdad; and - the Australian Defence Force will also maintain headquarters, logistics and embedded support elements. The Australian Defence Force will continue operations elsewhere in the Middle East Area of Operations-in particular in support of our operations in Afghanistan. in- The decision to go to war in Iraq Notwithstanding our government's pride and appreciation for the service and sacrifice of our troops in Iraq, we on this side of the House did not support the decision to go to war. I presented the reasons for our opposition to the decision to go to war back in March 2003, as the then shadow foreign minister. Nor did we support the decision of the previous government to abandon its commitment prior to the 2004 election of no troops to Iraq and after the election to then send a further 450 troops to Iraq. The former Prime Minister presented four reasons in explaining his decision to go to war: - to prevent further terrorist attacks; - to prevent Iraq giving weapons of mass destruction to terrorists; - to prevent other rogue states giving weapons of mass destruction to terrorists; and - to put an end to the humanitarian crisis in Iraq. On every count we on this side of the House rejected these arguments then, as we continue to reject them now. Have further terrorist attacks been prevented? No, they have not been, as the victims of the Madrid train bombing will attest. Has any evidence of a link between weapons of mass destruction and the former Iraqi regime and terrorists been found? No. Have the actions of rogue states like Iran been moderated? No. We are now informed that Syria has been building a nuclear capacity with North Korean assistance. Those reports remain to be fully conformed. And Iran's nuclear ambitions remain a fundamental challenge. After five years, has the humanitarian crisis in Iraq been removed? No, it has not. Of most concern to this government was the manner in which the decision to go to war was made: the abuse of intelligence information, a failure to disclose to the Australian people the qualified nature of that intelligence-for example, the pre-war warning that an attack on Iraq would increase the terrorist threat, not decrease it-and a view that our alliance with the United States mandated our military participation in the invasion. Our alliance with the United States is the first of the three pillars of our foreign policy. As I have said in previous parliamentary debate: I come to this debate as a long standing and passionate supporter of the US alliance, an alliance formed by Labor in 1941, an alliance that has delivered great benefit to this nation, region and to the world, and an alliance that tinues to deliver great benefit ... That is why at the time it caused me great pain as a long standing friend of America to fundamentally part company with this administration's policy on Iraq and the policy of global military pre-emption on which that policy was based. This analysis is not unique to the Australian Labor Party. It is shared by many people of goodwill throughout the world, by many allies of the United States and by many who continue to see, as we do, the United States as overwhelmingly a force for good in the world. I have said before and I will say again: this government does not believe that our alliance with the United States mandates automatic compliance with every element of United States foreign policy. Notwithstanding our opposition to this war, the government has consulted closely with the United States and our other partners in withdrawing our combat forces from Iraq both prior to the election and subsequent to the election. Such a process of consultation is the responsible course of action of any ally. Intelligence on WMD Mr Speaker, we must learn from Australia's experience in the lead-up to going to war with Iraq and not repeat the same mistakes in the future. The decision to go to war was taken without a full and proper assessment by the government of its consequences. A decision to commit Australian forces to such a fundamental course of action as going to war must involve a careful and deliberate assessment by government on the basis of the most rigorous assessment by the intelligence agencies and government departments of the consequences of such an action. This was not done. In 2004 the former head of the Office of to the National Assessments was appointed to reconview the conduct of the Australian intelligence community in the lead-up to the war. He found that the lack of a national assessment or a formal intelligence estimate about Iraq and the implications of war ‘was regrettable'. It was particularly regrettable because we now know that the decision to go to war was based on flawed intelligence. In 2003, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate made the following finding: There was an expectation created prior to the war that actual weapons of mass destruction would be found and found in sufficient quantities to clear and present danger requiring immediate preemptive action - The cost to Australia and Australians; After initial military operations, it became evident that Iraq had not reconstituted its weapons of mass destruction program. The Iraq Survey Group (ISG) concluded that there was no evidence to suggest concerted efforts by Iraq to restart its nuclear, chemical or biological weapons programs. The Australian intelligence community, along with the international community, failed to judge accurately the extent and nature of Iraq's WMD programs. The previous government's own inquiry made the following finding: There has been a failure of intelligence on Iraq WMD. Intelligence was thin, ambiguous and incomplete. Australia shared in the allied intelligence failure on the key question of WMD stockpiles ... The government will continue to monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the various inquiries commissioned by the previous government. The Australian government relies on the Australian intelligence community to prepare fully independent, professional and unbiased assessments. To do so, the intelligence community must be appropriately resourced. It must also be appropriately coordinated. And, on something as crucial as going to war, it should not simply be delivered with a pre-determined political decision. We will continue to review and make adjustments to our intelligence arrangements, as and when required, to ensure the Australian government is always supported by the best possible intelligence. These agencies are a frontline in our nation's defence. The consequences of the decision to go to war Mr Speaker, the decision to go to war has had a number of consequences for the nation: pose a - The precedent created at international law; - The suffering of Iraqi civilians; and - The obligations we have incurred to help post-war reconstruction. The former government said that its actions in Iraq were justified under international law. We on this side of the House challenged the impact that the decision to go to war had on the integrity of the international system. Adherence to international law offers us great opportunities for a stable, global rules based order. Australia has a strong interest in those rules being upheld, as a middle power. In fact, Australia helped shape these rules back in 1945. The UN Charter recognises two legal justifications for the use of force: - firstly, Article 42 of the UN Charter, which indicates that you can act together with other states once the action has been explicitly authorised by the United Nations Security Council-this did not happen in the case of Iraq; and - secondly, Article 51, which is about the right to self-defence-nor did that apply in the case of Iraq. There is a further emerging principle surrounding the debate on the responsibility to protect, but that too in the current debate is centred again on the deliberations of the council. Australia has to be very mindful of new precedents being established at international law and practice which justify the invasion of one state by another in the absence of any reference to these principles. The cost of the war in Iraq Thankfully, no Australian Defence Force personnel have been killed in action in Iraq since the commencement of operations in 2003. We offer genuine thanks for that. However, sadly, the Australian Defence Force has suffered two non-battle deaths: - Warrant Officer Class 2 Dave Nary, of the Special Air Service Regiment, was killed while undertaking battle preparation for a protective security task in the area of operations on 6 November 2005; and - Private Jake Kovco, serving with the embassy security detachment, died in a firearm incident on 21 April 2006 in Baghdad. About 27 Australian Defence Force personnel have been physically wounded in Iraq. The government is determined to ensure that those service personnel who have suffered from their service, and their families, are appropriately cared for. They deserve nothing less. The consequences of a decision to go to war are never simple, without ing or without expense. In a financial sense, the net additional cost of our military commitment to the war in Iraq since 2003 has been $2.314 billion. Estimates of Iraqi civilian deaths that have occurred as a result of the war vary greatly. There is no ‘official' statistic. The UK based Iraq Body Count currently estimates civilian deaths at between 84,000 and 91,000. Other figures range from 50,000 to more than half a million. Saddam Hussein led a regime that was brutal, repressive and murderous. Despite recent successes, the Iraqi government, the coalition and the international community continue to confront significant challenges in providing the economic, security and humanitarian circumstances that the Iraqi people deserve. This is where our efforts must now turn, and our presence there now, in contrast to our initial commitment to the war, has clear international legal authority. That presence is at the request of the government of Iraq and has also been authorised by successive UN Security Council resolutions adopted since the conflict commenced. Australia will remain a friend to the Iraqi people for the long term in the postwar reconstruction of their country. Even if we disagreed with the decision to go to war, we will continue to discharge our responsibilities to aid that reconstruction. Our responsibilities to help the people of Iraq come about from the various UN resolutions on Iraq and our role as one of the initial countries to participate in the invasion. These responsibilities cannot be handed off to another power. In committing to the war, Australia also committed to the reconstruction. This will be a long-term project requiring the assistance of many countries over an extended period of time and, equally importantly, it will require the commitment and goodwill of all Iraqis, suffer- particularly Iraq's leaders. Where to now? The 2008-09 budget provided a significantly expanded Australian program of assistance to Iraq. Total development assistance will increase to $313.4 million, including: first, the provision of a third and final tranche of debt relief of $238 million; second, an expanded program of assistance through AusAID of $60 million; third, $10 million to support Iraqi refugees, provided by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship; and, fourth, $5 million to increase police capacity building by the Australian Federal Police. The AusAID program will be focused on key sectors which will contribute to progress against the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In the first year, one-third of the program-$20 million-will be directed towards humanitarian relief. This will enable Australia to make a more significant contribution to international relief efforts, with an emphasis on vulnerable women and children. Food insecurity remains a critical problem for the Iraqi population. We will make an additional food aid contribution this year, which will complement Australia's work in the agricultural sector and will be in partnerlia's ship with the World Food Program and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation. The remaining program will include reconstruction and support of infrastructure including better water, better sanitation and rural development. Importantly, it will also include building the capacity within Iraqi institutions. We will continue to support the clearance of landmines and unexploded ordnance. When I was in Baghdad just before Christmas last year, I offered to assist the Iraqi agriculture sector through 100 agriculture scholarships for training in Australia. This was in direct response to a request from my Iraqi counterpart when I simply asked him, ‘How can we help for the future?' The first Iraqi students in this program are due to commence language training later this year and postgraduate studies in January 2009. National security decision-making processes Australia's commitment in recent years to a wide range of military operations, in places as diverse as East Timor, the Solomons, Afghanistan, Iraq and the Sudan, are a reminder of the breadth of our engagement and the complexity and the danger of the world in which we live. They also remind us, as a government, that we must be clear and rigorous in our understanding of the national interests which might lead us to commit military forces to such an operation, because there is no more fundamental decision a government can make than taking Australia to war. Getting our national security right is the first responsibility of any government. Our government is committed to ensuring that our national security arrangements are focused, coordinated and effective and that the actions of government are accountable. To that end, the government is preparing Austrafirst national security statement, which we will soon present to the parliament. It will set out a broad, comprehensive and integrated approach to our national security-an approach capable of meeting the breadth and complexity of the security challenges that our nation will face in the 21st century. We live in a complex, highly connected and changing world, which holds great opportunities, equally great challenges and some threats for Australia. National security spans many strands of government, industry and the community. We must ensure that all the necessary sinews of this country are harnessed and coordinated to produce the most appropriate, affordable and effective national security preparations possible. Australia must also play an active, positive and energetic role in the affairs of the world and the affairs of our own region-and, where our interests are engaged, we will continue to work with allies and partners to prevent or respond to threats that undermine our national security or our collective security. To ensure that the Commonwealth's domestic security arrangements are as effective as possible, upon taking office the government commissioned the former Secretary of Defence to examine the better coordination of our national security arrangements. That report will be presented next month. We are also well underway with the preparation of a new Defence white paper. The white paper will take a comprehensive look at our strategic interests, our military and defence capabilities, and the arrangements we have in place to build and sustain a modern, capable Australian Defence Force. We are determined that the Australian Defence Force will remain a force able to protect Australia, and Australia's interests, well into the future. That is why the government has committed to the forward provision of a three per cent real increase on average per annum for Defence out to 2018. In combination, the National Security Statement, the Defence white paper and the review of Australia's national security decision-making processes will establish the foundation for the pursuit of Australia's long-term national interests. Conclusion Australian troops comprising Overwatch Battle Group West ceased formal operations on 1 June, and the last of our combat troops are scheduled to depart Iraq by the middle of June. They have performed magnificently in a difficult and dangerous environment and fully achieved the mission they were assigned in the finest traditions of the Austraterrorist lian military. But Australia's commitment to Iraq does not end with the departure of our combat troops. We will continue to help the people of Iraq rebuild their country in the difficult decade that lies ahead. And we will continue to work in this effort with our partners, cluding the United States and the United Kingdom, and the United Nations and the international community more generally. Our aim is to build a relationship with Iraq anchored in economic, training and humanitarian initiatives to help the people of Iraq so bloodied by this war and their recent history to stand on their own two feet. Mr Speaker, I salute the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, who once again have done this nation proud. The nation will have the opportunity to salute them in an official welcome home parade later this month. We commend their service to the House and the nation. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I draw your attention to whether the member for Mayo was in fact in breach of standing order 91(f) for most of the Prime Minister's statement to the House.",42
70,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Dr Nelson (Leader of the Opposition) speaking for a period not exceeding 22 minutes. Question agreed to.,48
71,Dr NELSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I rise to support the resolution but not all of that which was said by the Prime Minister. On 11 September 2001, the world changed. It changed irrevocably for many people throughout the world and for none more so than the citizens of the United States of America when 3,000 civilians, innocent people, were murdered in a attack on New York and Washington. In response to that, only a matter of days later, when our then Prime Minister, John Howard, was in Washington, the ANZUS treaty was invoked. It is a matter of record that not so long after that the United States, Australia and other countries went into Afin- ghanistan to remove the Taliban from power. The heinous events of 11 September 2001 divided the lives of many Americans into two halves: that which had been lived prior to September 11 and everything that would come after. What then happened was that the United States realised that September 11 was the escalatory event of more than a decade of increasing terrorist attacks throughout the world principally but not only against America interests, from the attack on the World Trade Centre in 1993 to the attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the attack on the US Cole, the Marriott Hotel bombing, the Russian parade ground bombing and many other incidents. By September 11, clearly that was enough. The United States and its allies, then looking out throughout the world for where future terrorist attacks might subsequently come, looked no further than Iraq. The decision was made by the United States and the United Kingdom-both of which asked Australia to consider participation-to remove Saddam Hussein from power. It is a matter of fact that Saddam Hussein had been in breach of 17 United Nations Security Council resolutions at that time. It was known that he did have weapons of mass destruction but that he was playing cat and mouse with the weapons inspectors and the question was whether he still had them. In fact, there were many who argued that in fact he did still have them. Our now Prime Minister, then the opposition foreign affairs spokesman, said on 9 September 2002: I've said repeatedly that there is a significant threat of weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. Only three weeks later to the State Zionist Council annual assembly on 15 October 2002, he further said: Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction ... That is a matter of empirical fact. you don't believe the intelligence assessments, you simply read the most recent bulletin from the Federation of American Scientists, which list Iraq among a number of states in possession of chemical ... biological weapons and with the capacity to develop a nuclear program. It is further a matter of fact that under Saddam Hussein over a 15-year period an average of 70,000 people were tortured, murdered and killed, including in two wars. Five thousand Kurds lost their lives in 1988 in the gassing at Halabja. Many of us would remember the photograph of the father in rigor mortis with his baby in swaddling clothes, one of the 5,000 victims that day. We also remember the attempted genocide of the Arabs in the southern marshes and arguably the greatest act of human environmental vandalism in the draining of those marshes. All of that meant that by the early part of this decade the decision was taken that the world would indeed be a safer place without Saddam Hussein in government brutally controlling his people and that, in a postSeptember 11 world, the risk could not be taken that he still had weapons of mass destruction. It is equally a matter of fact that, following the removal of Saddam Hussein from office, large collections and storage of weapons of mass destruction were not found, but there have been, according to US authorities, 260 mass graves found with as many as 300,000 dead Iraqis within them. It is easy to look back in hindsight on what has happened since the removal of Saddam Hussein. In that first year, there was the ‘deBaathification' of the Iraqi public service, the dismantling of the Iraqi army, the provision of basic Iraqi services, principally from Western contractors-US ones in particular. Those and other things, in hindsight, would be done differently. But none of us who live in a relatively If comfortable and peaceful part of the world, who too often take for granted the things most important to us in our lives-including our freedoms, Australian citizenship and a passport-should ever forget that 12 million Iraqis risked their lives to vote and elect their own government. Since 2003, Iraqis have been the subject of terrorist attacks, and Americans and other allies have given their lives in the name of Iraqi freedom, Iraqi democracy and the values that we in Australia hold dear and for which we stand. Our generation must understand that we are facing a resurgent totalitarianism throughout the world in the form of Islamic extremism. We are facing people that are not only virulently anti-American but committed to building a violent political utopia which denies fundamental political and religious freedoms and which has an attitude to the treatment of women which is incompatible with a civil society, much less a peaceful world. We are dealing with people who see education and the liberating power it brings to those who are oppressed as things which should be fundamentally opposed. Not only are these extremists throughout the Middle East, and not only have they done everything they possibly can to oppose Iraqi democracy and peace, but they go through North Africa, through almost all of Europe and down into South-East Asia, in our part of the world. We have responsibilities in this case to the Iraqi people, to their democratically elected government, to the nations in the region surrounding Iraq, to our key ally the United States of America, and to stand up for our fundamental values and see the job through for the Iraqi people. I remind those who have argued for and at times sought to make political capital from withdrawal of troops from Iraq that alZawahiri, Osama bin Laden's No. 2, when he wrote in July 2005 to Abu al-Zarqawi, the now deceased but then head of al-Qaeda in Iraq, to set out al-Qaeda's agenda for Iraq, said it was: firstly, to remove the United States forces from Iraq; secondly, to build an Islamic authority and take it to the level of a caliphate; thirdly-to use his words-to take the Islamic jihad to the secular states in the region; and, fourthly, to confront the state of Israel. We are immensely proud of what Australian troops-members of the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Australian Army-have done and continue to do in Iraq on our behalf, in our name, under our flag and for our values in support of the Iraqi people and Australia's strategic interests in the region and throughout the world. As a matter of record it should be understood that the Overwatch Battle Grouporiginally the deployment of some 450 Australian troops in April 2005-was, paradoxically for some Australians, to protect Japanese engineers undertaking important civilian and military engineering projects in Al Muthanna province in central southern Iraq. As progress was made, we made the decision, at the request of the Iraqis and of US and British allies, that we would move to an overwatch posture that required us to increase the number of troops that we had deployed and change the composition to make it sufficiently robust, and that is why we opposed vehemently the notion of a phased withdrawal of combat troops, as argued by the government, then in opposition, in 2007. Those men and women over four rotations of the battle group have performed superbly, as the Prime Minister said. We have suffered six casualties-six were wounded-and thankfully no men or women in our uniform have been killed doing overwatch operations, engaging the Iraqis locally, undertaking training of the Iraqi forces or providing security of the most robust nature should the Iraqis, whom we have been training, not be able to undertake the tasks of security themselves. The Australian Army training team has done a superb job based in Dhi Qar province, along with the operational Overwatch Battle Group in Tallil, overseeing operations in Dhi Qar and Al Muthanna and contributing to the training of what are now 33,000 Iraqi security forces that have been trained by the Australian Army. The position of the Liberal and National parties, in government and in opposition, remains the same-that is, in all of our deployments we remain there until the job is done. That means that when the government in the country where we are deployed is confident that its own forces are able to provide for its own security then it is time for us to leave. That should always be subject to conditions on the ground. We made the decision last year, in looking to the future, that if conditions were to be right on the ground in 2008, as they now are, then it would be appropriate to bring the battle group home but to replace it with a training capability which would of course include a force protection element. In other words, there is still much more training of the Iraqi security forces to be done, even though an enormous amount of progress has been made. It is worth the House and Australians remembering that progress has been made in Iraq because of the leadership of the US President and his key military advisers late in 2006, making the decision for a surge of US military forces. There was significant criticism of that decision here in Australia, both in the political arena and in the commentariat. To put an additional 30,000 American troops into Iraq, into Baghdad, to take it to 20 brigade combat teams was a significant step on the part of the US President but one considered necessary to bring improvement to the security situation in Baghdad and in Iraq generally. As a result of that, the leadership of Nouri al-Maliki and the democratically elected government of Iraq, the improvement of the provision of services and the efforts of countries like Australia and the United Kingdom and other nations in areas of Iraq outside of Baghdad, significant progress has been made. So, in al-Anbar province-which had been the home of al-Qaeda in Iraq-where in October 2006 we had 3,200 terrorist events, we now have in the order of 100 a month. We have had whole days with no terrorist incidents at all. Ramadi, Fallujah and many other areas of Iraq are areas where once an Abrams tank would have been required to go through them but where now instead there is much more order, good governance, peace and cooperation. Australians, when they see their soldiers the come back from Tallil in central southern Iraq, can be proud in the knowledge that not only have they done the job that they were asked to do but, by doing what they have in southern Iraq, they have contributed significantly to the effort which has allowed the Americans, particularly militarily in Baghdad, to do the heavy lifting which has brought significant progress in Iraq. The battle group, which is the fourth of those that was deployed to Iraq, has engaged in many things, but we are very proud of the fact that they built the bridge at Samawah. They have assisted with veterinary clinics, ambulance facilities, electricity, roads and the refurbishment of schools and hospitals. For all of these things, as one soldier said to me at one stage during one of my visits as then Minister for Defence: The Iraqi people seem to appreciate greatly what we are doing for them. I might also say to Australians, who were led to believe last year that, if there were to be a change of government, Australian troops would leave Iraq, that the battle group is leaving and, were it up to us, we would be replacing it with a suitably equipped training facility for central southern Iraq, because we believe that the job still remains to be done. There remain about 1,000 Defence Force personnel across the theatre of Iraq. We have the P3 Orions, which provide essential surveillance activity, particularly over the gulf, and the frigate, which is in the gulf, as part of a task force of 10 coalition ships protecting two vital Iraqi oil terminals. We have got the security detachment in Baghdad, comprising 110 troops. We also have our C130 Hercules, which do an absolutely extraordinary job transferring equipment and our people throughout the operational theatre. We have a logistics operation. We have a joint headquarters task force. We are in the multinational forces task force. In all, we will have about 1,000 of our men and women across the theatre of Iraq, and we are immensely proud of them. It also ought to be remembered that Michael Hayden, the Director of the CIA, only last week pointed out that, as a result of all this, we are now close to the defeat of alQaeda in Iraq. There would have been very few-particularly very few on the government benches-who only six or 12 months ago would have even hoped that that would be the case. Thank God we have made progress. Further to that, the Simon Fraser University in Canada has documented that deaths from terrorist acts since 2001 outside of Iraq have declined 40 per cent. There are three principal reasons why we have made considerable progress globally against terrorism. The first is the battle in Afghanistan, to which we are strongly committed and should remain so for the foreseeable future. The second is that the Sunni insurgents, and in particular al-Qaeda, have attacked both Shiite and Sunni targets in Iraq and throughout the world, and the Muslim world is starting to stand up to this. The third reason is the surge in Baghdad, and the courage and determination of not only the United States but also the United Kingdom and Australia to stand by the Iraqis and to make sure that we were able to see that terrorism would not be able to take root in Iraq and that al-Qaeda would not be able to run operations within Iraq, in the region, or indeed throughout the world. It is often said by Australians who are well-meaning that we have been lucky, that our soldiers have been lucky-and indeed there has been luck involved in this. But the reason we have not sustained the casualties of some of our allies-although there are a number-is principally because of the outstanding leadership of the men and women who lead at all levels in the Australian Destill fence Force. It is, secondly, the judicious planning, both militarily and at a government level, for the operations we have undertaken. Thirdly, it is the level of equipment and the nature of equipment provided to our troops, which I consider to be better than any of our allies. It is, fourthly, the training which is undertaken by Australian Defence Force personnel. Fifthly, there is something about the Australian character. In my experience, even 20-year-old privates see themselves not only as soldiers but as educators, diplomats, aid workers and teachers. If every Australian could only see them whether in Iraq or in other parts of the world they would be even more proud of them than they already are. In concluding, I understand that there will be some sort of tickertape parade to welcome home the soldiers from Iraq. That is something which is to be supported. But I also remind the government that, yes, there have been 3,700 Australian Defence Force personnel that have served in these four Overwatch Battle Group rotations, but every Australian Defence Force person, man and woman, from each of the three services, whether they have served on a frigate, whether they have worked in dust storms in 55 degree heat trying to keep a C130 in the air, whether they have been part of a security detachment, whether they have been a military lawyer working in Baghdad-all of those men and women, whatever the task they have undertaken-should be equally recognised for the job that they have done, in our name, in our uniform, under our flag. We have made enormous progress in Iraq. There is still quite some way to go and, from our perspective, we think the job must be seen through. NA Fuel Prices  the Attorney-General. Can the Attorney General advise the House how the government's Fuelwatch scheme will apply to unincorporated small fuel retailers?",48
72,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The extent to which that matter is being considered by the government is a question that we will address through the implementation of the policy. The extent to which the Constitution permits the federal government to legislate and regulate the affairs of unincorporated bodies, including small businesses, partnerships, sole traders and the like, is obviously one to explore in the development and implementationMr Dutton-If you haven't thought about it, just say so!",53
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Member for Dickson, a question has been asked; the Attorney-General has the call.",53
74,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"but the government will ensure that Fuelwatch applies across the board and that the full gamut of constitutional powers will be utilised to ensure that it applies to corporations, unincorporated bodies, partnerships, sole traders and the like and, if it be necessary to discuss matter with state governments, ensure that there are necessary arrangements in place. The arrangements will apply across the board to all those bodies-being corporations, sole traders or partnerships-selling petrol. That will be done utilising the full scope of the federal Corporations Law. It will be done using the full gamut of constitutional arrangements and it will be done in consultation with the states.

77,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for the opportunity to acknowledge his deep interest in the welfare of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force and for the opportunity to share with the House a little more information about the logistics of our withdrawal from the Iraq. I also thank the Leader of the Opposition, who, during his earlier statement, confirmed what former Prime Minister Howard said this morning-that is, if the coalition had won the last election, our combat troops would be remaining in Iraq. This is now a stark difference between us and the opposition.",53
78,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,54
79,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am about to clarify this point. The coalition seem confused. They agree on one hand that the job is done in southern Iraq but then argue that more needs to be done.  Speaker: the minister was not asked for alternative policies or any other discussion; he was asked a direct question.,54
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Aston will resume his seat. The Minister for Defence has been asked to indicate to the House the progress of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. The minister will respond to the question.,54
81,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just making the point that the Leader of the Opposition said they would be retaining trainers in Iraq and that that would require force protection. Force protection comes from combat troops. I join the Prime Minister in acknowledging the fact that in recent years the Australian Defence Force has been working hard in southern Iraq to ensure that we provide the Iraqi people with the security and stability they need to take control of their own destiny. Members of the Australian Army training team and the Overwatch Battle Group have now bedded down security in both Al Muthanna province and Dhi Qar province. At the same time, they have been training and building capacity within the Iraqi security forces, giving them the skills they need to enforce the rule of law in their own country. A ceremony to mark the completion of the mission was held yesterday at our base in Tallil. Importantly, the ceremony was attended by the governors of both Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces. Also there was the commander of the Iraqi Army's 10th Division, the commanders of Multi-National Force Iraq and Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq and the commander of Multi-National Division (South-East). Dhi Qar becomes the second province handed over to Iraqi security forces, the first being Al Muthannna. Our soldiers have worked to ensure that the Iraqi people can look to their future with optimism. Our forces are now well into the process of packing up the extensive infrastructure we have established in Iraq and they are beginning to return home. Indeed, some of them have already returned home. They will continue to withdraw in groups over the course of this month, culminating in an official welcome home ceremony in Brisbane on 28 June. I ask all Australians to keep them in mind. The extraction process is not one without risk. The Australian government remains committed to a secure and stable Iraq. Our frigate in the gulf will continue to protect the sea lanes and Iraq's oil infrastructure. Our P3s will continue their surveillance work and our security detachment will continue to protect our diplomats and others in Baghdad. These elements, along with some headquarters logistics liaison staff, reflect our continued commitment to Iraq and to the Iraqi people. Today I join with the Prime Minister and, I am sure, with all members of the House in paying tribute to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. I thank them for their commitment, dedication, courage and sacrifices. I also thank their families for their sacrifices and the anxiety they have lived with and suffered while their loved ones were away facing danger on a daily basis. We look forward to joining them on 28 June to welcome our troops home safely. All Australians can and should be proud of them. Fuel Prices",54
82,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Attorney-General. Has the Attorney General sought legal advice on the constitutional validity of Fuelwatch and will he release that advice?,55
83,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question. The Attorney-General's Department has not sought that advice. I understand that the advice has been sought, however, by Treasury and the Assistant Treasurer. The advice is that, insofar as unincorporated associations, partnerships and sole traders deal with fuel companies, which are in turn corporations, there is sufficient constitutional power to implement the Fuelwatch scheme.",55
84,Mr RAGUSE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Home Affairs. Will the minister update the House on how the government will assist the Iraqi police service?,55
85,Mr DEBUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As the House would be aware, the government has provided nearly $14 million of support for the Iraqi police service in the recent budget. That funding is to provide for forensic and technical training and for the development of management and leadership skills for up to 243 members of the Iraqi police service. Each year over the next three years approximately 81 Iraqi police service members will receive training under two courses, one in forensics and one in management. In the forensics stream, they will learn how to better manage crime scenes to identify, record and collect evidence so that it will not be contaminated when it is finally analysed. In other words, they will learn to become better at police work. Annually, 51 officers will undertake forensic and technical training in Canberra, with access to the specialist expertise of the AFP's forensic scientists. The AFP has come to be highly regarded for its ability to help law enforcement bodies in various countries to improve their investigatory techniques. It has provided training across our region in dealing with transnational crimes, including people smuggling, human trafficking and child sex tourism, and in surveillance techniques and disaster victim identification. Thirty Iraqi police-middle and senior level officers-each year for the next three years will also receive management and leadership training delivered through the Australian Institute of Police Management at Manly in Sydney. A team of four specialist AFP personnel went to Baghdad earlier this year to determine the feasibility of providing this training and a program management team is now beIraq ing established in Australia to coordinate the training that will begin later in the year. Australia is continuing to support Iraq with reconstruction and humanitarian assistance. It is obvious enough that the establishment of strong law enforcement capacity will help Iraq achieve stability for its postwar reconstruction. In conclusion, there are significant challenges for this program to provide the Iraqi police force with improved skills. But they will be able to take those skills home and use them to train local police into the future, and we look forward to providing that support. Fuel Prices",55
86,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Does the minister want petrol prices in Australia to go up or down?",55
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The word ‘want' means that the question is seeking an expression of an opinion. I give the member for Flinders the opportunity to put the question in order by rephrasing it.,55

90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is a very good point of view.,56
91,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for trying to ask this question a second time. I infer from it that the member thinks that the government's policy or my views are somehow intended to be a vote of confidence for the increase in petrol prices. I want to ask this of the shadow minister: is this the best question that he can come up with? Why isn'the asking me a question about the environment? Furthermore, why isn'the asking a question about climate change? If he wants to ask a question",56

94,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, those opposite have run out of substantial questions to ask. I refer to the shadow minister's question and say the following: in relation to the matters that any government would want to bring forward to deal with the question of petrol prices, this government has delivered. That is the first thing I would say. The second thing I would say is: in the absence of any concrete policy being advanced by the opposition on the wider matters of what likely costs or otherwise there may be in dealing with matters of climate change or the environment, you have had nothing to add to this point in time. You have just wasted your question. Iraq",56
95,Ms VAMVAKINOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Will the minister ingo. form the House of Australian government assistance to the development of a more prosperous and productive agriculture sector in Iraq?",56
96,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for the question. There could be few things more important in helping a nation recover from a difficult period than actually doing something about helping them provide food for their population. The Prime Minister during his visit to Iraq made the commitment for 100 Australian agricultural scholarships. Earlier this year, in January, we had a visit from my counterpart the Iraqi Minister for Agriculture, Dr Ali Husayn Kadim alBahadili. He referred in our meeting here to there being a history of agricultural cooperation between our nations spanning all the way back to the 1970s. The reasons are clear: we face many of the same challenges. Both Australia and Iraq have very high levels of evaporation, particular soil problems and soils and plants that lose the moisture they do obtain from what little rain they receive. Much of the Iraqi vegetation is, as a result, reliant on irrigation. For that reason our assistance to them with dryland agriculture has been of critical importance. For every economy at a time of world food shortage, this sort of cooperation is important. While agriculture is only seven per cent of Iraq's GDP, it does employ more than a quarter of their workforce. The minister, in his comments to me, identified Australia's expertise and referred to a number of Australian universities which he believed would be well placed to deliver courses which might be of assistance. Since then, such courses have been announced at the University of Western Australia, Curtin University, the University of Adelaide and the University of Queensland. They will be starting in September at a cost of $8.5 million. In addition to that, $50 million has been provided to facilitate transition to an open, market based economy through helping restore agricultural services and boosting agricultural production. Boosting skills and the capacity of a further 180 Iraqi officials who are working in the sector and in the field, supporting their veterinary services, implementing projects targeting good crop management and also assisting them with pest control practices in areas such as wheat and barley are all part of the equation in trying make sure that we can help rebuild a better community for the Iraqi people. Fuel Prices",56
97,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, diesel has now crashed through $1.90 a litre. Aside from the government's new road user charge, which will tax trucks and put upward pressure on grocery prices, what is the Prime Minister's plan to provide relief for users of diesel?",57
98,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Interestingly on the question of diesel, the previous government, being in office for 12 years, did not have a sterling track record of acting on this. The assumption therefore, both on petrol prices and on diesel prices, is that in a matter of six months the newly elected government can turn around and undo what has occurred with movements on petrol prices and diesel prices over the last 12 years. I find this a remarkable statement, given that they had the reins of power for so long. Secondly, I would say this. When you look at our approach to a long-term response to the challenges of energy policy and petrol policy, it goes to these factors. One, global demand factors. What can be done when it comes to efficiency measures in developing countries, because when you have got the rise of China and of India you are pushing ahead with the impact on overall global energy prices? Then there are supply factorsand we have been debating the Iraq war here-and other factors which impact on supply. Then you go down to alternative fuels. Then you go down to fuel-efficient cars, and that includes diesel. It includes greater fuel efficiency in those cars which use petrol. It includes greater dependence on what we can do in a whole range of other measures which can assist fuel efficiency. On top of the above, you can also deal with the range to of taxation imposts on families and motorists as well. These constitute the elements of a long term policy to deal with what is a global problem affecting motorists and governments right around the world. What the government has embarked upon is a long-term response along each of these measures. It is not embarking on a course of action such as those opposite: cherry pick a piece here, cherry pick a piece there, turn to rank populism the next day, and hope that that constitutes a policy. Economy",57
99,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on recent developments in the Australian economy, and what is the government's response?",57
100,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Our economy in Australia is greatly shaped by developments across the world. We have seen since last August the unfolding of the global financial crisis, the roll-on effect in North America and western Europe and the United Kingdom, as well as what is happening in our own hemisphere and in Australia. You see also the impact which that has had not just on confidence but also in terms of real economic numbers. For example, I draw the House's attention to data released on Friday showing that consumer confidence in the United States has now fallen to its lowest level in 28 years. Furthermore, the US economy is also suffering from the worse decline in its housing market in a quarter of a century. And this all occurs at the same time as we have global oil prices running at near record levels. We all know the roll-on impact for Australia is significant, not just the impact in terms of global financial markets and confidence within the global financial services community but also, beyond that, the impact on the real economy. If we look at the flow-through impact on prices for Australian families, there is data released today in the TD Securities-Melbourne Institute Monthly Inflation Gauge which says that it rose by 0.3 per cent in May to be 4.5 per cent higher than a year ago. What this represents is a challenge not just for the economy overall but acutely for families struggling with cost of living pressures. And that, of course, forms the benchmark for how the government itself chooses to respond, because the enemy to all working families, all Australians doing it tough, all working Australians, is inflation and, in turn, its upward pressure on interest rates. When this government was elected, we had interest rates running at 16-year highs. We had an inflation rate running at 16-year highs and as a consequence there was a flowthrough impact on rates. On the question of rates, we have had 12 consecutive interest rate rises, two of which have occurred since the election. We did not make an irresponsible promise at the last election-unlike the promise made by those opposite at the previous electionabout keeping interest rates at record lows. But we understand this: to make it possible to bring downward pressure on rates, one of the important things is to ensure you bring about downward pressure on inflation. One of the important ingredients in that respect is to make sure you are prosecuting a responsible fiscal policy. That is why the budget brought down by the Treasurer and by the government, more broadly, is anchored in a $22 billion budget surplus. That is the cornerstone of economic responsibility: to ensure that the expenditure measures we adopted, and which were new, were funded by savings and, furthermore, to ensure that tax is now lower as a percentage of GDP than it was before and that expenditure as a proportion of GDP is now the lowest it has been since 1989-90. The alternative offered by those opposite is to conduct a $22 billion raid on the surplus, and that has one huge consequence for families: it flows through in terms of overall demand in the economy; it flows through in terms of inflation; and it flows through in terms of upward pressure on interest rates. Inflation remains the cornerstone of dealing effectively with the macroeconomic circumstances in Australia. This government believes in fighting the fight against inflation; the cornerstone of it is a $22 billion surplus. The cornerstone for the economic policies advanced by those opposite is instead a $22 billion raid on the surplus. I say this: as each one of the budget measures passes through this House and is debated in this House in the weeks ahead, those opposite will be faced with a single responsibility-that is, as you conduct one raid after another on the surplus, as you seek to vote against and pull out one further budget measure after another, the responsibility of those opposite is to identify what is the alternative source of savings. The failure to identity the alternative source of savings means one thing: that you will raid the surplus, put greater upward pressure on inflation and greater upward pressure on interest rates. So as members opposite vote against and vote down these revenue measures, or vote against or vote on the budget measures, their core responsibility in terms of economic discipline is this: what are the alternative savings measures? Failure to deliver them will result in one equation: walking away from working families and working Australians and saying that the 10 interest rate rises in a row that they delivered to families are of no consequence because they simply want to fuel the inflation fires further. Our response is one of responsible economic management. Our response is to make sure that we stand by a $22 billion budget surplus. Our response has its fundamentals in an attitude to economic management which says, ‘Let's look after families, not just for but for the long term, and deal effectively with the inflation monster, because if the inflation monster",57
101,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,59
102,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"which is obviously the object of great mirth on the part of those opposite-begins to wreak havoc on interest rates into the future, those opposite will be dealing with the consequences of their irresponsible actions one after another as they go in idle pursuit of political populism over economic responsibility. Fuel Prices",59
103,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Assistant Treasurer. Is the Assistant Treasurer aware that the ACCC's modelling of FuelWatch covers the period before the 24-hour rule became fully operational in Western Australia? Doesn't this further undermine the ACCC's modelling of the effectiveness of FuelWatch?,59
104,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. What I am aware of is that informed sources this morning released an analysis of the independent analysis by the ACCC. I am also aware that informed sources, whose business model depends, frankly, on the asymmetry of information between consumers and retailers, alleged that the ACCC's analysis did not take into account that period. I was informed by the ACCC today that those informed sources are wrong. I am informed that the ACCC's econometric work tested FuelWatch effectively starting in September 2001, as well as in January 2001. They found a lower price in the west, relative to the eastern capitals, whether FuelWatch was considered to have started on January 2001 or on September 2001. The ACCC is on the side of motorists. It always pays to take independent advice that is rigorously done by those who are paid to stand up for the short term Australian consumers.  urer table the document from which he was reading?",59
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Was the Assistant Treasurer reading from a document? Mr Bowen-Yes, I was.",59
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the document confidential? Mr Bowen- Mr Speaker, I am happy to table the document as it relates to all the criticisms made by informed sources today, and it deals with the ACCC's data. Economy",59
107,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on recent inflation data and the importance of responsible budgeting in the current inflationary environment?,59
108,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Responsible economic management is central to the fight against inflation. We have some data that came out today from TD-their monthly inflation gauge-and this is what they had to say: Inflation remains the most pressing issue facing Australian policy makers. We on this side of the House understand that. We understand that responsible budgeting and investment in the future is needed to fight inflation. That is why we did deliver a responsible budget-a budget that cut back spending, a budget that began the vital task of investing in the future and addressing the capacity constraints that are putting upward pressure on inflation after years and years of neglect. The opposition on the other hand are content to try and blow a $22 billion hole in the surplus thereby putting further upward pressure on inflation and further upward pressure on interest rates. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say on the Sunday program, just after the budget: Mr Oakes: There is not a single suggestion in Dr Nelson's speech of a saving. Mr Turnbull: ... that's true. There is no suggestion of a saving there, that's right ... And, of course, it is right. They have no credibility in this House when they pout around with supposed alternatives, because they cannot make a budget add up. The shadow Treasurer has had a bit more to say. This is what he said last week: We recognise there is an overall impact on the budget, and that is something that we … take into account. How can you take it into account if you do not cost your policies? You cannot do it. The shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition are blowing a very big hole in the Liberal Party's economic credibility, and it is nothing more than a smoking ruin. Fuel Prices",59
109,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the recent paper by Professor Sinclair Davidson of RMIT which demonstrates major flaws in the methodology used by the ACCC in its analysis of Fuelwatch. Given the mounting expert evidence that Fuelwatch is likely to increase petrol prices, will the Treasurer release the complete ACCC model to the public for peer review and ask his own department to check that ACCC analysis and make the results of that Treasury appraisal public also?",60
110,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The gentleman referred to by the shadow Treasurer is not independent. I have been reading his material for some time. I cannot understand it-he appears to be a fan of the shadow Treasurer. He obviously has not been following the debate in the House. We have comprehensive, credible modelling from the ACCC and we stand by it. Education Funding",60
111,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Social Inclusion. What is the Rudd Labor government doing to lay the foundations of the education revolution?",60
112,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Franklin for her question, and I know about her deep concern for education in her electorate and for the future of the children in her electorate. I would like to answer the honourable member's question by referring to just two aspects of the Rudd Labor government's education revolution. This is a government that believes in delivering on its promises, and this is a government that believes in investing for the future, in ensuring that we equip this nation for the challenges of the future. With our education revolution we are doing both-delivering our promises and equipping this nation for the challenges of the future and particularly the challenge to lift productivity and participation. We are doing this across the board in education, but I want to say a few brief words about what we are doing in early childhood education and what we are doing to renew our vocational education and training sector and our universities. Of course, the education revolution includes schools as well, but I would like to briefly focus on early childhood education. This is a government that will deliver an additional $533.5 million over five years to support early childhood education-funding that supports our commitment to ensuring that every Australian child has access to an early learning program delivered by a university qualified teacher for 15 hours a week, 40 weeks a year in the year before formal schooling. This work is being led by the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare, the member for Bennelong. We believe it is vital, and all of the world research shows that if you can intervene early you can make a difference for life chances. Gone are the days when a Prime Minister-as the former Prime Minister did-would say early intervention is a big part of the answer and then do nothing. Gone are those days. Gone are the days when the former education minister, the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, could say in one breath, ‘Investment in early childhood is very, very important,' and in the very next breath disavow any Commonwealth responsibility for funding. We are investing because we believe in the best possible start for Australian children. We are also investing to make child care more affordable with our increases in the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs. This measure comes into effect on 1 July. I make it very clear that the government will be watching and the government will not tolerate unfair pricing practices amongst childcare providers related to the new rebate being delivered. The government will canvass all options to act if there is any evidence of unfair pricing practices. Our agenda-our education revolutiongoes from the early years all the way through. This is a government that has invested $11 billion in our Education Investment Fund to renew our universities and our vocational education and training sector. This is a fund with $6 billion coming from the former Higher Education Endowment Fund joined by a new investment of $5 billion to enable renewal of the capital infrastructure of universities and vocational education and training. In the words of the Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, Ian Chubb, this new Education Investment Fund will ‘allow us to draw down from the capital. That will make an enormous difference to the size and scope of the projects we do. We go from spending on maintenance to being able to plan for a world-class future'. Also gone are the days when an education minister-as the former education minister, the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, did-can say, ‘Our universities are in the best financial shape they've been in.' This government and ministers on this side of the House will not be making statements like that, and they ought not to be made, when this nation watched, under the Howard government, public investment in tertiary education decline by four per cent between 1995 and 2004 while in other OECD countries it increased by an average of 49 per cent. Those days of neglect of our education system are over. The legacy of the former government to the nation is one of slipping standards and a skills crisis. Our education revolution is there to invest in the future. I have watched as this House in recent days has canvassed a number of issues, and it has intrigued me that the opposition is now pretending to care about petrol prices when in government it did not care about them at all. The opposition is now pretending to care about cost-of-living pressures on families when in government it did not care about them at all. Interestingly, in opposition they do not even pretend to care about education. Here we are in June and I am still waiting to be asked the very first question by the shadow minister for education-the Marcel Marceau of Australian politics, still trying to work way out of that imaginary glass box. Now presumably he will be seen in mimic eating",60

122,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. The Commonwealth is engaging in infrastructure development after 12 years of neglect. We have already had three meetings of the COAG his infrastructure working group, which is working through issues between the Commonwealth and the states to make sure that we get greater harmonisation of regulation to improve efficiency and productivity. For the first time, however, we are not just working between the Commonwealth and the states; we are engaging directly with the private sector to ensure there is national coordination of infrastructure. That is why we have established Infrastructure Australia, which I am pleased to report will have its first meeting this Wednesday here in Canberra. The council will be chaired by Sir Rod Eddington, who brings broad experience from the aviation, resources, energy and finance sectors. The advisory council's inaugural members bring a wealth of experience from planning, financing and regulation through to the construction and maintenance of infrastructure. The inaugural members include Ms Heather Ridout, the Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group",62

127,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure the Australian Industry Group, whose members take in the construction and manufacturing industry, will be interested to hear that. Other mem sland Chairman of KPMG; Mr Ross Rolfe, Senior Executive, Infrastructure, Babcock and Brown; Garry Weaven, the Chair of Industry Funds Management and also a director of Members Equity and of Pacific Hydro; and the Hon. Mark Birrell, a former minister in the Kennett government and Chairman of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, which comprises both public and private sector organisations engaged in the infrastructure dustry. In addition, they will be joined by Professor Peter Newman, the Professor of Sustainability at Curtin University in Western Australia, Mr Terry Moran, Dr Ken Henry, Mr Jim Hallion, Mr Anthony Kannis and Dr Kerry Schott. Showing just how serious the government is about infrastructure investment, we have made an unprecedented commitment of $20 billion for the Building Australia Fund to invest in critical economic infrastructure. Infrastructure Australia's advice based on a rigorous analysis of costs and benefits will feed into the government's decisions about allocations from the Building Australia Fund. The government understands that a considered approach is vital to ensuring a well targeted investment strategy that boosts productivity, captures private sector investment funds and makes efficient use of existing infrastructure. Fuel Prices",62
128,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On indulgence, to start with, I understood that the Deputy Prime Minister had not completed her answer before, and I was waiting for her to get the call. That is by way of explanation to the House. My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his own regulatory impact statement on Fuelwatch released reluctantly late last week. Specifically, I refer him to the statement: ... it remains unclear whether option onethat is, Fuelwatch would be successful in delivering lower retail petrol prices. If the Prime Minister will not rule out higher petrol prices as a result of Fuelwatch, why is the Prime Minister preceding with bad legislation?",63
129,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I draw the honourable memin- ber's attention to the further econometric analysis undertaken by the ACCC, which was released last week, and its conclusions: The purpose of this econometric analysis has been to satisfy the ACCC that the introduction of a Fuelwatch scheme nationally would not, based on the experience in Western Australia, lead to consumers paying higher prices for petrol. From the econometric analysis, on a conservative basis, the ACCC can say that there is no evidence that the introduction of Fuelwatch in Western Australia led to any increase in prices and it appears to have resulted in a small price decrease overall. The government's position on this is as we have said before: based on this advice from the ACCC, drawing from the WA experience and based on this econometric modelling, the advice which was provided to us is that this actually represents up to a 2c a litre advantage to motorists. Secondly, and most importantly, it gives motorists choice. Within a metro area, where you have price variations on a given day of between 15c and 20c a litre, the consumer should have the same choice as the big oil companies. That is, consumers should have the power and information available to them to make the choices about where to get the best price for the day. Whereas those opposite argue that that power should uniquely be held by big oil, we stand up for consumer choice. Those opposite stand up for big oil. Economy",63
130,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his government's decision to set up ‘grocerywatch'. Prime Minister, will grocery stores be forced to lock in the price of groceries 24 hours in advance, and will they be fined for lowering prices during the day?",64
131,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On 22 January 2008 the government directed the ACCC to commence a formal inquiry into grocery prices and report its findings by 31 July 2008. From the farm gate to the checkout counter we thought it was the right thing to make sure that working families are getting a fair deal at the supermarket. The ACCC is considering the industry's current structure and the nature of competition.,64
132,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister's own budget puts $12 million into ‘grocery watch'.",64
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order and I will not entertain calling people on points of order where they are entering into a debate.,64
134,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,64
135,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I have ruled on the point of order.,64
136,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That ACCC inquiry was launched in January 2008 and it is to report by 31 July. The government has also asked the ACCC to undertake a monthly survey of grocery prices for a typical shopping basket of goods across Australia, and to establish a dedicated website on grocery prices. Also in April the government agreed to extend the time frames for the development of vacant commercial land under Australian foreign investment policy from 12 months to five years, as the government's interest in introducingMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was specifically about ‘grocery watch', which is a separate initiative in the budget to anything being undertaken by the ACCC.",64
137,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will respond to the question.,64
138,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I just referred in the second part of my answer to the ACCC undertaking a monthly survey of grocery prices-if those opposite bothered to listen to the answer. The third part relates to how you go about bringing greater competition into Australia's grocery sector. As we indicated in April, we are dealing with how to make it easier for foreign investors who are bringing greater competition into the Australian retail grocery sector. One of the challenges we face here is the concentration within the sector. Major retailers such as Woolies and Coles are estimated to have a combined market share of over 70 per cent in some segments. The annual average growth in food prices in the 10 years to the March quarter 2008 was 3.9 per cent across the CPI headline of three per cent. Given that those opposite were in power for over a decade, what did they actually do on the question of greater competition power in the grocery sector? Let us go to some other data. In the 12 months to March 2008, food prices increased by 5.7 per cent, due to strong increases in dairy and other related products, and that contrasted, of course, with a lower CPI figure for the overall period. The question is: what did those opposite do about that increase? Mr Dutton- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. Can the Prime Minister cut the price? The Assistant Treasurer saidMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order: that is the third interruption of the Prime Minister's answer to a question that was clearly outside of standing order 100(d) and the second question in a row from that side of the House.",64
139,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,65
140,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The challenge for us is how to bring about greater competition and greater information for consumers-like on the question of petrol and like on the question of groceries. We stand on the side of consumers, as opposed to being on the side of big business-whether it is in the grocery sector or, in the case of ‘big oil', whether it in the petroleum sector. The figures show that over a decade there was a 3.9 per cent on average increase in excess of CPI in the price of food. Those opposite were in power for that period. Over the previous two years there was a 5.1 per cent increase in food compared with a CPI of 3.3 per cent. That was over the last two years. What did those opposite do about it? Nothing. In the 12 months to March 2008 food went up by 5.7 per cent. What did those opposite do about the price of groceries in that period of time? Nothing. The government actually stand for having a go. We stand for giving consumers some of the purchasing power within the marketplace which those opposite seem very happy extending only to those opposite. What we have here is a Liberal Party standing up for the distillery companies and alcopops, for the big oil companies when it comes to petrol prices and for the supermarkets when it comes to grocery prices. They stand condemned. Disability Services",65
141,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Will the minister update the House on outcomes from the meeting of disability ministers, and how has the government's new approach been received?",65
142,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Makin for his question. On Friday in Sydney, with the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, the member for Maribyrnong, I attended a meeting of Commonwealth, state and territory disability ministers. It was a very productive meeting. In fact, it was one of the most productive meetings that has taken place for many, many years in this area. It marked a new era of cooperation, the type of cooperation that Australia needs-particularly people with is disabilities, their families and their carers-if we are to move beyond the divisions of the past to make sure that we can deliver the services that vulnerable groups in our community need. Thousands of people with a disability, their families and their carers will benefit from the $1.9 billion boost in funding that was agreed on Friday. State and territory disability ministers agreed to deliver $900 million in funding on top of the Australian government's $1 billion commitment. The good news is that this is money on top of the service provision in the last Commonwealth state/territory disability agreement. This is a very significant step forward for Australia's disability system, and I want to highlight the particular improvements to services that will result. The $1.9 billion is going to deliver around 2,300 in-home support services, 2,300 supported accommodation places, 9,900 individual support packages and, very importantly, 10,000 much-needed respite places in a range of forms across Australia. Ministers also agreed to start delivering immediately the 309 new supported accommodation places with the $100 million in capital that the Prime Minister announced on 4 May would be given to the states and territories for this purpose. So in total there are going be 24,500 places that will begin to ease the anxiety of people with disabilities, their families and their carers, many of whom have waited far too long for this support. There have been some positive responses to the announcement and the agreement that we arrived at on Friday. The convenor of the disability advocacy group the CSTDA Alliance, Sue Harris, said on Friday, ‘It gives people hope.' Carers Australia said in a statement: ... the new agreement will bring greater certainty to the lives of families who had been left floundering for far too long. Carers Australia President Pam Webster went on to say: This is a fantastic achievement for everyone cerned. We would like to acknowledge all the hard work that has produced this important milestone. I echo those remarks and, in particular, give my thanks to our state and territory colleagues and to the parliamentary secretary for disabilities-who, I have to say, is an outstanding advocate for people with a disability. It really does demonstrate what can be delivered when people work together. I would note, however, that Pam Webster did go on to say-and I think she is right: While this is a very significant announcement, the continual growth in the need for carer support means the job is not yet done. We agree. The government do understand that this is just a first step. More does need to be done. There were other measures in the budget. In particular, I want to draw the House's attention to the fairer rules for carer payment (child). This will help 19,000 parents of children with profound disabilities, something they also had been waiting a very long time to receive. Unfortunately, under the previous government, we had disability ministers meetings completely breaking down, with ministers unable to come to an agreement. And, of course, it was always descending into the blame game. The new government have an approach based on cooperation. We intend to get things done-to deliver for people with disabilities, for their families and for their carers. Prime Ministerial Staff",65
143,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to recent reports that the Prime Minister has employed at least six different diary secretaries within six months. Why has the Prime Minister had such significant staff turnover in his own office?,66
144,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When a new government takes over, one of the first things that hapcon- pens is that PM&C provides you with temporary staff. It occurred in our case, and I am sure it occurred when you guys took over back in 1996-that is the first point. I am glad, though, that you raised the question of staff, because what we have done is actually slash the number of ministerial staff by 30 per cent. Do you know what that saves the taxpayer? It is $15.4 million in the current financial year. We stand for saving the taxpayer some dollars; you stand for wasting the taxpayers' dollars. War Graves",66
145,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Would the minister further update the House on excavation activities at the site of the Battle of Fromelles in France?,66
146,Mr SNOWDON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. Since last Thursday, the excavation at Fromelles has continued in five pits. Also since that time. I have spoken to Major General O'Brien, the project manager, who briefed me on the progress of the excavations and the discussions with local authorities. He also confirmed with me the difficulties involved with the excavation as well as the higher level of media interest. I have subsequently been advised that remains of up to three individuals have been found in pit 1 and of five in pit 5. I hasten to add, though, that these remains are bones; there is no body tissue. As well as bones in the pits, many artefacts have been found, including buttons, which we understand may have been from German groundsheets in which bodies may have been wrapped; a bayonet scabbard of an Allied type; and some live rounds of .303 ammunition-none of which is distinctly Australian. Work is continuing carefully, particularly given some of the risks that more ordnance might be uncovered. As well as continuing to remove the clay from the top of the pits, a trench will be dug beside the pits, conditions permitting, to allow a cross-sectional view which will help assess the condition of any remains and the possible number of individuals buried at the site. I say ‘conditions permitting' because this ground is waterlogged and there are serious safety issues for trenching which have to be dealt with. With respect to the future, I wish to thank all of those relatives, some 80 thus far, who have registered their family name on the Defence website. I can also advise that my colleague the Minister for Defence spoke to his British counterpart in Singapore over the weekend about this issue. Clearly, that is important, given the fact that we believe a majority of the bodies that are at this site may well be British. With respect to options for the future, the Fromelles Evaluation Group, comprising Australian and British officials, will continue to consider the options for detailed advice in due course. Also, on the matter of identity, I can advise that we do have a German list of names of those buried by the German army after the battle, we believe, at this site. While this is considered authentic, some reconciliation is needed, though we may never know, obviously, the exact identities of the Australians buried, let alone those of the British. I have said that it is too early to consider the issue of the possible identification and fate of each individual until technical advice is available and detailed consideration is given by the Australian, British and French governments. I repeat, however, that there are also 410 unknown Australians buried in a mass grave at VC Corner, just down the road, as well as some 7,243 unmarked graves in France, Belgium and Gallipoli. Like these, it is possible the identity of those at the Fromelles site may remain known only to God. Australian Public Service",66
147,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. I refer to the minister's comments yesterday on the ABC Insiders program that some public servants think it normal to sit around ‘not doing very much'.

150,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not say that at all. I did not make a statement of that kind with respect to public servants. In fact, the statement. I made was with respect to the work ethic of the former government, actually asklist ing the question of why it is that the Rudd government is setting a very strong agenda. The answer is very simple, and that is that there is an awful lot to do. The thrust of my comments yesterday related to the former government and that, if there were public servants struggling with additional work under the new government, the reason is that the former government did not do very much. My predecessor sat around and watched the cows come home. In the last four budgets, there were not any savings at all-no savings in the last four budgets. What was the Minister for Finance doing in the former government? Where were the savings? There is just one example. The Rudd government have a big, nation-building, reforming agenda. We are committed to working hard. We have a lot of things to do. The former government did very little and that is what my comments on Insiders were directed to.

152,Mr BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries Forestry. Will the minister outline to the House what progress is being made to implement the government's commitment to reform Australia's wheat marketing arrangements, and are there any obstacles to achieving these reforms?",68
153,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There is a very simple question at the heart of the government's commitment to reforming wheat legislation and wheat marketing, and it is this: should wheat growers be allowed to choose who they sell their wheat to? The National Party has decided that the answer to that is no, but the problem is that we have to provide certainty to wheat growers. Wheat growers are now at a time when many of them either have planted or are about to plant and, understandably, want some certainty in what the marketing rules will be for the next harvest. Against that, we have the unusual situation where the shadow minister does not speak on behalf of the opposition. Mr Secker- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order in relation to standing order 100(e). This bill is before the House and the minister should not be debating it.",68
154,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,68
155,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What has not been understood by the members of the National Party is that the current legislation, post 30 June, changes everything. After 30 June this year, if we as a parliament do not change the current rules, all the protections that the Nathe tional Party believe they want to keep in place will disappear. The ministerial veto will go. The concept of the single desk that the National Party are claiming they want to keep will actually disappear under the current legislation. The current legislation leaves us with the worse of all worlds, so the National Party have said, ‘We'll take that and one.' Unfortunately, we have now waited for months and months to find out whether or not that reflects the position of the opposition in order to be able to provide certainty for wheat growers. On 20 March, I wrote to every member of the opposition guaranteeing that they could have private briefings with my department. Those briefings were provided on a confidential basis and remain so. But the question remains: do the Liberals agree with the Nationals? An exposure draft was put out and we still could not find out. There was a report from the Independent Expert Group, but we still could not find out if the Liberals agreed with the Nationals. Then Liberal senators added comments to the end of a Senate report and we still could not find out whether the comments of those Liberal senators matched the position of the Liberal Party. So not only do we not know whether the Liberals agree with the Nationals; at this moment do not know whether or not the Liberals agree with the Liberals. We have been trying to work out what on earth it is that unites those opposite. Then Senator Sue Boyce let us know. In a particularly impressive publication called ‘Effective Opposition', which surprisingly was made by a member of the opposition in the federal parliament, Senator Sue Boyce let us know what the main game was. She said, ‘It's full of tips and strategies to help maintain our focus at branch and SEC level on the main game-beating the Labor Party.' What happened to the main game being a plan for the future? What happened to the main game being providing choice for people who grow wheat? It is actually their wheat; it does not belong to the National Party. It is their wheat and they should have the choice of who they sell it to. Who they export their wheat to is a choice that the government believes they should have. It is a choice that the National Party believes should be denied to them. It is a choice that one day, if there is any interest in providing certainty for wheat growers, the opposition will declare a position on. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Hansard",68

164,Ms PLIBERSEK,CONDOLENCES,"Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (3.56 pm)- Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to say a few words about the death of Len Devine last week. Leonard Thomas Devine was born on 14 October 1923 and was 84 when he died. In March this year, he celebrated his 60th wedding anniversary with his wife, Barbara. I know that his children, Diane and Leslie, and his grandchildren will miss him very much. He was the member for East Sydney from 1963, elected in a by-election, until 1969, when he retired. Barbara and Len Devine and Len's brother-in-law Fred Miller and his wife, Rose, were very important figures in the ALP in the inner city at a very tumultuous time for the Labor Party. I just want to acknowledge Leonard Devine's passing.",69
165,Dr NELSON,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I join the Minister for Housing in supporting those remarks of condolence to Leonard Devine's family. We would have appreciated being notified of this so that we could have had the opportunity to prepare some remarks. NA Days and Hours of Meeting",70
166,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"I move: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until noon on Tuesday, 3 June 2008, unless the Speaker or, in the event of the Speaker being unavailable, the Deputy Speaker, fixes an alternative day or hour of meeting, and for government business to take precedence from 12 noon until 2 pm on that day. I have done this now rather than at the end of the day so that all members can be notified of what is planned for tomorrow. The intention of the government, in consultation with the opposition, is that from 12 noon tomorrow until 2 pm the debate on the Fuelwatch legislation will continue. It has also been agreed that there will not be any interruptions to that debate. The parliament is likely to sit late tomorrow evening. That is on the basis that members have suggested that they would rather sit late on Tuesday night than Wednesday night when there are various functions that people have to attend. The government does have 22 bills that it needs to get through the House of Representatives this week so that they can be ready for the Senate when we return in two weeks time.",70
167,Mr HOCKEY,BUSINESS,"In dialogue with the Leader of the House, we are trying to be as accommodating as we can be. But I say to the Leader of the House that the way bills are being rammed through this chamber at this moment is quite simply unprofessional. Last year 11 bills were guillotined; five of them were related to the Northern Territory intervention. So far, the Labor Party in government have guillotined three bills and indicated they are going to guillotine other bills throughout the course of this week. As a result, we are now finding out more about the Fuelwatch bill, for example, through sources other than debate in the chamber. I say to the Leader of the House: getting legislation through this chamber is difficult at the best of times but, if this is going to be an unholy mess, we will ensure 12 that the government are held accountable for it. If they are not organised, we will make sure that that disorganisation has a price. Question agreed to. NA Financial Stability",70
168,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-A year ago this month, shares in the Bear Stearns investment bank were still trading on the New York Stock Exchange at around $150; the US federal funds rate had reached 5.25 per cent after 17 successive increases; the Bank of England was looking to increase the cash rate; and both the United States and the United Kingdom were completing one of the most robust quarters of growth that either had experienced for some years. It was widely and rightly said then that over the previous five years the global economy had experienced a boom the likes of which had never been seen in human history. In the year since then, a great deal has changed. Last week the remnants of Bear Stearns were formally merged into JPMorgan Chase, ending the existence of an investment bank which had, in its 85 years, survived the Great Depression, World War II and innumerable financial crises in Latin America, Russia and Asia to be brought down not by a financial collapse in emerging markets, not by a global recession and not by a clever hedge fund or derivative strategy gone wrong but by the consequences of poor home lending standards in the American heartlands of Florida, Michigan and California. Bear Stearns was, of course, only a small instance of the damage wrought by what we have come to call the US subprime financial crisis. Since mid-September last year the US central bank has found it necessary to cut the cash rate seven times, US consumer confidence is close to a 15-year low and, partly because of that decline in confidence, the downturn in the US housing market, which explains so much of the downturn in the US economy overall, continues to deepen. The total announced asset write-downs and credit losses as a result of the global credit crisis for US financial institutions and global banks are now estimated to be $380 billion. Through its impact on financial markets and investment banking centred in London, the UK has also been affected by the US subprime crisis. Through losses sustained by global banks based here, Europe too has felt the chill of this long and difficult financial episode. Although to a much lesser extent, Australia also saw some of the impact of this financial crisis and within days of its appearBank ance in the United States. Because of the global uncertainty, Australian banks also became reluctant to part with liquidity. In July last year the spread between the cash rate maintained by the Reserve Bank and the three-month bank bill swap rate sharply increased. Although subprime lending is only a very small proportion of overall Australian mortgage lending, by December the market for high-quality securitised Australian mortgages, which is largely offshore, was as dead as the market for US securitised mortgages infected with subprime risk. And though Australian business profits were strong and corporations were not highly leveraged, it became difficult for even the best names to borrow on reasonable terms directly in financial markets. Our banks found that the global market for term funding was harder to access and very expensive. They discovered, as banks abroad discovered, that at exactly the same time as they encountered new difficulties in funding for their balance sheets they also encountered sudden new demand for credit from borrowers who found it hard to obtain it elsewhere. All this occurred, I must emphasise, despite the fact that major Australian financial institutions had not then and have not now any significant exposure to US subprime debt or, indeed, had not then and have not since then experienced any significant increase in bad debt. I can report to the House that the Australian government agencies responsible for the health of our financial system performed their duties well in minimising the impact of this global crisis on the Australian economy. APRA has conducted a rigorous program of risk evaluation and inspection in the years leading up to this crisis-a program which discouraged institutions from reckless lending. It also moved quickly to step up its monitoring activities as the impacts of the financial turmoil hit our shores. The Reserve of Australia moved quickly in recognising the unusual and immediate liquidity needs of the Australian banking system. It also recognised early that, in the peculiar circumstances of this particular financial crisis, it needed to extend the range of financial instruments which it would accept as collateral in its lending operations. The prompt action by the RBA in respect of both overnight and term funding stabilised the Australian financial system, maintained confidence and permitted Australian banks to expand both their assets and their liabilities to match the new demands placed on them by business and household borrowers. The banks themselves also responded to the US subprime crisis in a timely manner. They were able to rapidly expand their retail deposit liabilities in the second half of last year, for example, and in the first quarter of this year their high credit standing and strong global reputations permitted them to continue to access global debt markets, this time on a considerable scale. There are certainly also problems that we encountered here during the crisis. Because the market for residential mortgage backed securities remains dormant, it has been difficult for many smaller mortgage originators to continue to compete. Highly leveraged businesses with illiquid assets have found that their model no longer works as it did when credit was more plentiful and spreads were narrower. The sharp fall in equity prices since the middle of last year has exposed the perils of speculation funded by margin lending. Though still markedly higher than they were a year ago, credit spreads are today narrower than they were a few months ago and have continued to decline in recent weeks. Credit growth in Australia has slowed, consistent with the rise in domestic interest rates over the past three years and tighter credit conditions. But we have not seen a significant increase in bad debts. Output growth and employment remain quite firm. There have also been some positive signs in international credit markets, but I do not wish to suggest that it is all now plain sailing in the global economy. The US economy remains very weak, and it is quite possible that further credit defaults and in different areas will be exposed as a result of the deterioration in business conditions in that economy. Lending growth has slowed in that economy, credit spreads remain elevated and the lenders' appetite for risk is much diminished. All of this is occurring at a time of very high oil and other commodity prices, rising food prices and global inflation. In the past year the benchmark price for global crude oil has doubled while the IMF's measure of global food prices has risen by almost 50 per cent. Pressure on global oil prices in particular is set to continue. Ongoing strong economic growth in much of the developing world, in particular China and India, is putting upward pressure on global oil prices. At the same time, supply is struggling to keep up, due to significant underinvestment in exploration and development as well as uncertainty about the security of supply from important oil producer countries, not least in the Middle East. This will continue to put pressure on family budgets right around the world, not least here at home, and constrain growth in major consumer nations. This strong economic growth in emergent countries and the associated higher oil prices are also putting pressure on world food prices. We are addressing this at home through measures to increase competition in the supermarket sector. The government is also assisting the world's poorest people through $30 million in emergency assistance to countries most affected by steep rises in the prices of essential food supplies. The impact of higher commodity prices, in particular oil and food, will be a central theme of my discussion overseas, in particular at the G8 finance ministers outreach meeting in Osaka. We will discuss how to address the root causes of food insecurity in developing countries and the role Australia can play through increased development assistance, constructive participation in multilateral processes and the continued advocacy for international trade policy reform. As a major world food producer, Australia also has a central role to play in addressing this global challenge. These are not circumstances in which we can relax or declare the financial problems of last year or their impacts now completely behind us. We only need to look at the forecasts in last month's budget to appreciate the impacts that slower world growth combined with higher domestic interest rates will have on our economy. These also demonstrate that much of the impact on the real economy is yet to be felt. Though we have come through the last year in reasonable shape, the government is still attentive to some sensible things it can do to further strengthen our financial system against the inevitable shocks of the kind evident in the last year. Nor are we concerned only about our own regulatory framework. We experienced here many of the effects of the US subprime financial crisis, despite our financial institutions not sharing any of its causes. That experience reminds us that, however sound our own financial system, we also need to do whatever we can to support a sound global financial system. Both I and the Prime Minister have been in close contact with US, UK and European government leaders, with central bankers and with the heads of the major international agencies who have been grappling with the financial crisis. In the international forums which we participate, including the Financial Stability Forum, the G20 and the IMF, Australia has pressed a firm view in support of international cooperation in addressing the crisis, greater transparency in the disclosure of risk and strengthened systems for providing early warning of emerging global financial risk. We ourselves have responded to the recommendations of these global forums. The Financial Stability Forum, for example, has recommended strengthened prudential oversight of capital, liquidity and risk management; enhancing transparency and valuation; changes in the role and uses of credit ratings; strengthening the authorities' responsiveness to risk; and robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial system. I have asked the financial regulators and my department to work closely together on the recommendations and to keep me regularly informed of the developments. The government has also been developing two measures to strengthen our financial system. The first is the increased issuance of Commonwealth government securities, which I announced last month. This action will support market liquidity and ensure sufficient market depth in threeand 10-year parts of the government bond yield curve to support consistent pricing in the Australian market for long-term debt. There will, of course, be no increase in the net debt of the Commonwealth, because the increase in government bonds outstanding will be matched by the acquisition of new financial assets. The government is also broadening the range of securities that the Australian Office of Financial Management may invest in and accept as collateral for its securitieslending facility. The other change which I am announcing today follows a proposal from the Council of in Financial Regulators for dealing with financial institutions experiencing difficulties. The government intends to establish a financial claims scheme to give depositors in an authorised deposit-taking institution-or ADI, as the legislation describes it-prompt access to funds in the unlikely event that such a financial institution should fail. The financial claims scheme will also cover general insurance claims by households, small businesses and not-for-profit entities where the insurer has failed. At the same time, the government will enhance the existing tools that Australia's regulators have to effectively manage an institution in difficulty. This risk of failure of a bank, credit union or building society is, I must say, a very small one. Our framework is designed to minimise the likelihood that any institution regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority could fail. That is not to say that the rules will prevent a regulated financial institution making a loss, which is something that all businesses risk, but it is to say that the rules are designed to minimise the likelihood that a regulated institution could make a loss substantially bigger than its capital reserves or its capacity replenish those reserves. Even where the loss threatened the financial viability of the tution, the Australian government and its agencies would seek a commercial solution to see both the remaining assets and the deposit liabilities assumed by another entity. The outright failure of a regulated bank is, I think, very unlikely, and indeed the history of the Australian financial system shows that such failures are rare events. Were it to occur, honourable members will know that under the Banking Act depositors have first call on the assets of the failed institution. They have priority over all other creditors. This means that in the unlikely event that an ADI failed, liabilities to depositors would be paid out before any other liabilities were met. I am advised that it is difficult to envisage cumstances in which the totality of these deposits would not be more than matched by the remaining assets of the failed institution. In my view, however, it is not enough to know that depositors would very likely eventually get their money back through the liquidation process. Many depositors, especially households and small businesses, depend on their funds in their bank accounts for day-today needs and would suffer considerable hardship if they were unable to access those funds for some months while an institution was wound up. Most people, for example, have their wage paid into a bank and draw it down as required. Pensioners and superannuants have their pensions paid into a bank. Students have their allowances paid into a bank. The Australian government, by and large, these days pays family allowances and so forth through banks, preferably directly into the account. It would cause considerable distress if these depositors were unable to access their funds for a considerable period of time. We now propose that the Australian government will establish a scheme under which to depositors in a failed institution would, within weeks of a failure, be refunded their instideposit up to the limit, per person, of $20,000. The scheme will include chequing deposits, savings deposits and term deposits. It will cover banks, credit unions and building societies which are regulated by APRA. The scheme will be administered by APRA and, were it ever necessary to activate the scheme, the Treasurer would seek advice from APRA, the RBA and the Treasury. These proposals are not new. They have had a long period of time in development, both under the previous government and under our government. I would also like to assure the House and through it the Australian people that these proposals are not a response to any concerns with Australia's cirADIs. As I have said, they have weathered the current turbulence well. The proposed scheme is part of a comprehensive and thoughtful package of reforms proposed by the Council of Financial Regulators and agreed by the government. The scheme I am announcing today had its genesis in policy reviews following the failure of HIH and in the 2003 study of financial system guarantees by Professor Ken Davis. These are changes that were supported in the IMF's financial sector assessment of Australia and have been carefully considered by our leading financial regulators. The Australian government will fund the operation of the scheme in the first instance, with taxpayers' contributions recouped through the liquidation of the failed institution or, in the event that it was insufficient, by a levy on relevant financial institutions, which will be authorised in legislation accompanying the establishment of the scheme. Honourable members will readily understand that this scheme is limited and designed to be limited. Its essential purpose is to have a reliable means of quickly giving retail depositors access to funds they need for their day-today expenses should an institution fail. It will fully cover the deposits of the vast majority of depositors in a failed institution. I am advised that approximately four-fifths of depositors have balances of less than $20,000. It should be noted, however, that a small number of large depositors with balances over $20,000 account for well over half of the volume of deposits in most institutions. These larger depositors would have access to only $20,000 under the scheme and would have access to the remainder of funds in the usual way-through liquidation. This is not and is not intended to be a general deposit insurance scheme. We are not seeking to protect large-scale investors from risk, nor to burden the banking industry with a prefunded scheme that may never be used. What I am announcing is a simple plan to minimise the distress for working families, pensioners and students in the very unlikely event that an Australian ADI fails. It will give them an assurance that they will get their money and get it quickly. There is nothing in this scheme which will reduce the incentive for large depositors to prudently examine the circumstances of the institutions in which they have deposited money. Nor is there anything in this scheme which abridges or circumscribes the ability of the Reserve Bank of Australia to offer liquidity facilities to an otherwise sound institution which, for one reason or another, is experiencing withdrawal of deposits at a faster rate than it can realise assets to meet those withdrawals. Australia and New Zealand are alone among OECD nations in not having a predetermined scheme to assist depositors in the event of a financial failure of a depository institution. This scheme I announce today meets that need and in a manner appropriate to Australia's circumstances, and that reflects the sound and successful arrangements already in place. It is designed to minimise the cost to taxpayers and the burden on existing financial institutions. It is important to note, particularly given the most recent failure of a regulated institution in this country was the HIH collapse, that the government is also introducing measures to protect general insurance policyholders. If an APRA regulated general insurer fails, the scheme would compensate policyholders for the full amount of any valid claim under their policy. In the same way as the scheme is intended to apply in relation to banks, the focus will be on those least able to bear the losses, with eligibility limited to individuals, small businesses and not-for-profit entities. The scheme will not cover life insurance, superannuation or market linked investment products where investors are motivated to increase their returns by taking greater risks. Nor will the scheme apply to institutions which are not regulated by APRA. In reviewing Australia's crisis management arrangements in the financial sector, the Council of Financial Regulators also considered the suite of powers available to regulators for managing financial instability and distressed financial institutions. The council has identified a number of reforms which would enhance the ability of regulators to effectively manage a distressed financial institution and to maintain financial stability. These reforms include providing consistent arrangements for the transfer of business across banking, general insurance and life insurance, with the appropriate oversight by the courts and the regulators. The reforms will also provide for the cial management of general insurers and bring non-operating holding companies in the life insurance sector into the regulatory net and remove potential legal barriers to the recapitalisation of a failing institution. These are sensible enhancements to our existing regulatory arrangements, and the government will bring forward legislation to enact these proposals as part of the package of measures that I am announcing today. It is important that the government ensures that APRA and the RBA have the tools they need to act swiftly and effectively to resolve sible, to avoid any crisis in a regulated institution. This is particularly important with our key financial institutions, where instability one can quickly spread through the system and create instability in other, otherwise sound, entities. As I mentioned, our financial system and our regulatory structures have weathered the financial turmoil of the past year well. I have had my differences with the major Australian banks, and I do not apologise for that. But there is no doubt about the strength and soundness of the Australian banking system over the last year. I do not propose to say anything today about the proposed merger between Westpac and St George, which, as honourable members will know, will be subject to scrutiny by the ACCC and APRA, as well as by me and my department. We will review the facts which emerge from this scrutiny and make our decision based on those facts. But I want to say that in my view the issue of whether or not the merger is approved does not bear on the four pillars policy, which has been maintained in one form or another by four successive Prime Ministers and seven successive Treasurers over nearly two decades. Indeed, I take our experience over the last year as a demonstration of the soundness of the four pillars policy. These judi- are banks which have performed as well as or better than any banks in the world during an exceptionally difficult period. Quite apart from the need to sustain competition in the banking market, I would not be at all comfortable if the soundness of our banking system depended not on the strength and risk management skills of four banks but on the strength and risk management skills of a lesser number. Whatever may be the outcome of the banking merger now under consideration, this government sees no case for changing the four pillars policy, which has and, if pos- served Australia well. The Australian government is committed to working with the financial services sector into build Australia's regional presence as a financial services centre. Innovative Australian providers of financial services have achieved considerable success in global markets in recent years. But the potential is even greater, as financial service markets in our region continue their rapid expansion. The government looks forward to working with the industry on a range of matters, including education and training, overseas market access and tax and regulatory arrangements to strengthen Australia's competitiveness in regional and global markets for financial services. As I mentioned earlier, Australia has been actively pressing for stronger international cooperation and an enhanced international early warning system for financial and economic risks to diminish the risks of future crises. I propose to pursue this reform agenda in visits to London later this week, to Beijing and then on to the G8 meeting in Osaka the following week. At the same time, I will be taking to the global financial markets of London and to the leaders of the major economies in Osaka a clear message about Australia's experience in the global financial crisis of the last year and about our prospects for coming years. I will be telling the world that we have weathered the last 12 months of financial crisis well. I will be saying that this is not because our financial system is closed against the influences of the global financial system, not because we have limited our engagement in the international economy but because we have sound financial institutions with good risk management practices, supported by a strong prudential regulatory framework and an adroit central bank. I will be saying that, after 17 years of uninterrupted expansion, the central economic objective of this government is now to use our fiscal strength to invest in infrastructure, education, skills and training-areas we think essential to support our continued expansion and which have been for too long neglected. I will be saying that Australia is and-under this government-will remain an exemplar of openness, of engagement with the global economy and of willingness to invest of our own future. I thank the House. I seek leave to move a motion to enable the member for Wentworth to speak for 26½ minutes. Leave granted.",70
169,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional ders be suspended as would prevent Mr Turnbull speaking for a period not exceeding 26½ minutes. Question agreed to.,77
170,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The Australian financial system is a robust and resilient one. It has withstood the turbulence of the subprime crisis, as the Treasurer has noted, because of more prudent lending practices in Australia and the very disciplined regulation of our financial sector. The numbers tell the story. In the United States, subprime loans represent around 13 per cent of all outstanding mortgages; in Australia, they represent less than one per cent. While there are some areas in Australia where there are significant default rates and very significant declines in property values-I cite some suburbs of southwestern Sydney as examples of that-by and large our default rates are low historically and relative to other countries, the United States in particular. So it is, as the Treasurer intimated, somewhat unfair that the Australian financial system has been tarred with the same brush. The securitisation markets for mortgages have been, as he said, as closed to Australian issuers as they have been to those emanating from the United States. That has obviously reduced the ability of Australian financial institutions to outsource their balance sheets, effectively, and this has had a particularly harsh impact on the smaller Australian lenders, the smaller banks and the mortgage brokers, and the various intermediaries whose presence in the market has done so much to improve competition and to reduce the cost of mortgage finance or at least the margins on mortgage finance for Australian borrowers. That has been the consequence of the subprime crisis in the United States. It has also had an impact in that there has been a flight to quality. That has happened right across the system. The difference in the orborrowing cost by a bank rated ‘A', a smaller Australian bank, and one of the big four-a bank rated ‘AA'-has increased significantly. In other words, one of the factors no doubt underlining the thinking of the directors of St George Bank in its discussions with Westpac is that as a lower rated bank, in terms of its credit rating, than Westpac it now has to pay relatively more-relative to Westpac-to borrow money that it on-lends to customers than it did a year or two ago. And of course that works all the way through the system. Nonetheless, the system is strong and it is likely, indeed almost certain-there are no certainties in finance-to remain so. The Treasurer has outlined a number of measures in his statement which we welcome in principle. We will need to see the detail of them all, and I am sure he will make those available in due course. I have seen no more than the Treasurer's statement so I cannot speak to the detail of what he is proposing. But the proposal on the $20,000 guarantee-I suppose the best way to describe it is as a guarantee-per customer for deposits in a failed deposit-taking institution is one that, in principle, the previous government supported but had chosen not to announce because of a concern that, in the credit market prevailing towards the end of last year, the announcement of that measure might have created more uncertainty than it would remedy. Having said that, there are some important design features associated with this guarantee that we need to discuss now, and it is very important that the Treasurer addresses these. Any guarantee of this kind carries with it a moral hazard; that goes with the territory. I can give you a classic example with which I had some personal experience nearly 20 years ago, and that was with the savings and loans industry in the United States. These were in effect what we would call building societies or credit unions. For many years, from time immemorial, they had had very strict prudential limits on what they could invest their money in. But there was also a $100,000 guarantee for depositors: the first $100,000 of every depositor's account was guaranteed by the federal government. The congress decided to relax the prudential requirements but left the guarantee in place. What that meant of course-this is the classic example of a moral hazard-was that depositors knew that as long as their deposit was $100,000 or less they would get their money back no matter how risky the activities of the savings and loans company might be. So there was, if you like, an indifference on the part of depositors to risky activities by S&Ls and, as we know, many of them did engage in extremely risky activities in terms of investments-investing in junk bonds and highly leveraged real estate transactions-in order to chase yield and be able to offer higher deposit rates to their depositors. The consequence was that a great many of these S&Ls went into bankruptcy and they ended up being taken over by the US government through a vehicle called the Resolution Trust Corporation, which in my previous profession I represented in a very large bankruptcy. That was a classic case of the moral hazard going wrong. In fact it was said at the time, with the benefit of hindsight, that the government should have either left the guarantee in place and left the prudential limitations in place or alternatively, if it was going to relax the potential limitations, removed the guarantee. Doing one and not the other created that problem. In the context of this proposal by the Treasurer here, there is a very important question which he has not answered and not addressed in sufficient detail, in his ministerial statement, and I would encourage him to do that. The question is this: does the guarantee or the assurance of a timely return of $20,000 for each depositor mean that deposits up to $20,000 have a priority in an insolvency over deposits greater than $20,000? One can readily see where the problem might arise. The Treasurer himself notes that in many of these institutions up to half of the total value of deposits is taken up by a smaller number of large deposits-of well in excess of $20,000-but the vast bulk of depositors have deposits of $20,000 or less. If for example, in a nightmare situation, there is only 50c in the dollar available to return to depositors and if all depositors have a priority, a first claim, as to the first $20,000 in their deposit, that would mean that a depositor with a $20,000 account could get 100c in the dollar back but a depositor with more than $20,000 could get considerably less than what his or her pro rata entitlement might otherwise be. Why is that important? It is very important in the Australian context because our deposit-taking institutions have different profiles in terms of their funding base. Professor Kevin Davis noted in his report on financial guarantees following the HIH collapse back in 2004 that the credit unions and building societies have a much larger percentage of their funding base coming from what we would call retail deposits. It is a very high percentage, whereas the larger banks have a lower percentage because they access the wholesale markets for funding. In the inconceivable scenario of a major bank going into insolvency, the depositors would rank ahead of the providers of wholesale money. In those circumstances, if you like, they have a lot of headroom above other liabilities. With a credit union or a building society, that is simply not the case. This issue is one that has been of concern to regulators, commentators and reviewers for a long time. I note that there was a good description of it in the Wallis report back in 1997. Mr Wallis makes this observation about capping depositor preference, which is what the Treasurer is talking about-capping the preference for depositors at $20,000: Capping depositor preference is an approach adopted in most deposit insurance schemes. Under such an arrangement, depositor preference would operate in two tiers: first preference would apply up to the cap and second preference would apply to all other deposits. However, smaller DTIs which have a much heavier reliance on deposits for their funding than larger institutions could have difficulty attracting larger deposits under such a restriction and would be relatively disadvantaged in the marketplace by an arrangement designed to deal only with circumstances that are likely to arise rarely, if at all. He goes on to say: On balance, the Committee concluded that there should be no cap placed on the value of deposits subject to preference. The point is a very powerful one, and it is something that we simply do not know, based on what the Treasurer said. We do not know whether the Treasurer is saying that deposits of $20,000 or less have a preference so that they all have to be returned, up to $20,000, before any remaining funds are divided between other deposit holders, or whether all of the funds available to depositors are distributed pari passuproportionately to their interest-so, if there is 50c in the dollar available, everyone gets 50c, but the government would only step into top up those deposits up to the level of $20,000. The difference is a very important one because, plainly, if it is the first scenario, those depositors with sums in excess of $20,000 will, firstly, be inclined to open up several different accounts and break them up into accounts of $20,000 or less and, secondly, there will be a clear incentive for a depositor with, say, $200,000 to take that deposit to a larger institution whose funding base is composed of a smaller percentage of retail funds. It would mean taking that deposit from, say, a small bank, a building society or a credit union, and taking it to one of the big four. That flight to quality is already happening to some degree and this could exacerbate it. That is something the Treasurer should take into account. I urge the Treasurer to clarify precisely how this $20,000 guarantee is going to work. Having said that-and that is purely a question of clarity and clarification-it is vital always for the Treasurer and the government to project confidence about our financial system. We have a very strong financial system here in Australia and we should tell that to the world. I am delighted that he is going to be travelling abroad and doing so, but he should mend his ways. Now the budget is done, he does not need to keep talking down the Australian economy, which he was doing for the first six months of his tenure. It is very important that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia speak strictly accurately and confidently about our financial system. In that sense, it is also important to speak fairly. In the last few sitting days we have seen an extraordinary performance of venous denigration of those people in the financial community who dare to disagree with the government and with the Treasurer. You may recall that last week, in the context of ing Fuelwatch, I quoted Michael Luscombe, the chief executive of Woolworths, who had said in a call with analysts that their margins on petrol were higher in Western Australia than in anywhere else in the country, thanks to FuelWatch. Mr Luscombe is the chief executive of a very large public listed company. As the Treasurer knows, the consequences of a CEO of a listed company making misstatements about its financial affairs are tremely serious, and nobody would do that wantonly or recklessly or deliberately if they valued their reputation and that of their company. I cited that simply to make the point that the argument that Fuelwatch would be better for motorists and would bring down prices really flew in the face of a great deal of evidence. That was one piece of evidence. The Assistant Treasurer's response was to interject: ‘If you believe that, you will believe anything.' In other words, Mr Luscombe was a man not to be believed. That is an extraordinary thing for the Assistant Treasurer to say. There has been no apology, no correction, no retraction-nothing. Today I cited a report by a very distinguished economist called Sinclair Davidson, from RMIT in Melbourne, criticising the methodologyinsofar as it is understood-used by the ACCC in assessing Fuelwatch. The Treasurer's immediate response was to attack the man and to say that Professor Sinclair Davidson was biased. He attacked his credibility not on the basis of what he had written and not on the basis of any of his arguments or any of his algorithms but rather by saying that he cannot be believed; he is a political confederate of the shadow Treasurer. Then we had similar criticisms of the ACCC's work by the expert petrol industry data provider, Informed Sources, which came out today and which really undermines the debatcredibility and the methodology of the ACCC in a very profound way. This is an expert group. They know more about petrol price data, patterns, markets and cycles than any other group in Australia. Their data is relied on by everybody, including the ACCC. They have expressed their very grave concern about it, and the answer again from the Assistant Treasurer was to attack Informed Sources' credibility and say that they are biex- ased too. That type of conduct undermines the credibility of the Australian government and undermines international financial markets' faith in the Australian financial system. It is vital that we have a Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer and a Prime Minister who speak confidently, positively, accurately and fairly about financial issues in Australia. If people criticise a decision of the government and go to the trouble of producing a paper-a mathematical analysis full of algebra and algorithms and setting out all of the assumptions-the appropriate response for the government is to take that on board, take it on its merits and if they believe to demonstrate why it is wrong. The government employs more economists than anyone else in Australia, so there is no shortage of people who can be set to work to pick holes in any analysis that is presented out of the business world. Instead, the reaction was to denigrate, to attack and to sneer. That is very damaging. It gives the impression of a government that is not interested in an accurate, well-regulated financial market but simply wants to play politics. We saw that with the Treasurer's notorious remark, which we hope we will never see again, when, the day before the Reserve Bank met, he held that extraordinary press conference and said, ‘The inflation genie is out of the bottle.' That made headlines around the world. The headlines and stories were saying-in the Financial Times, for example, and in the other great financial newspapers of the world-that the Australian Treasurer thinks inflation is out of control in his country. Plainly, inflation is a very serious challenge. It is a very serious global challenge and it is a very serious challenge in Australia. It has been so for some time. We recognise that, and we regularly debate the appropriateness of different measures and approaches to dealing with it. But to say that inflation is out of control was an extraordinary thing to do because that undermined confidence in our economy and, above all, it undermined confidence in our central bank. That was why when the Reserve Bank Governor, Glenn Stevens, was asked about this when he testified before the House of Representatives economics committee not so long ago, he very testily responded, ‘Inflation is not out of control.' It is his job to manage inflation, and he has-just as the previous government had-a very proud record of managing inflation precisely in accordance with the inflation-targeting objectives of monetary policy: that is to say, between two and three per cent it is wrong, on average over the cycle. It is fine for the Treasurer to stand up here today and talk about enhancing the stability and credibility of the Australian financial system, but, as with so many aspects of this government, he has to do more than talk the talk-he has to walk the walk. He has to move beyond the spin and actually demonstrate that he has a commitment, a real commitment, to the type of confident, accurate and disciplined economic management that is expected from the Treasurer of a great country and a strong economy like Australia. We have seen far too much spin from this government, and much of it has been very damaging-not just to the government in a political sense but also to Australia. He also needs to be quite precise as to how this $20,000 guarantee is going to work, because the lack of clarity there, for the reasons I described, could have very significant implications for Australian deposit-taking institutions, particularly the smaller deposit-taking institutions whose funding is much more heavily dominated by retail deposits. It would be a great pity if a lack of clarity from the Treasurer resulted in a decline in deposits in excess of $20,000 in institutions of this kind, because that would put those institutions under more pressure. They are under considerable pressure at the moment for the reasons I described at the outset of my response. I thank the House. NA",77
171,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,I present petitions in accordance with standing order 207.,81
172,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions from certain citizens have been lodged as follows: Immigration: Asylum Seekers To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. Whereas the 1998 Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne carried without dissent the following Motion: ‘That this Synod regrets the Government's adoption of procedures for certain people seeking litical asylum in Australia which exclude them from all public income support while withholding permission to work, thereby creating a group of beggars dependent on the Churches and charities for food and the necessities of life; and calls upon the Federal government to review such procedures immediately and remove all practices which are manifestly inhumane and in some cases in contravention of our national gations as a signatory of the UN Convenant on Civil and Political Rights.' We, therefore, the individual, undersigned Attento dees at Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Hampton 3188; St James' Anglican Church, Drysdale VIC 3222; St Paul's Anglican Church, St Leonards VIC 3223; St John's Anglican Church, Portarlington VIC 3223, and Monash Church of Christ, Glen Waverley VIC 3150, petition the House of Representatives in support of the above mentioned Motion. AND we, as in duty bound will ever pray &c. by The SPEAKER (from 50 citizens) Australia Post To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of concerned residents of Australia draws the attention of the House the need for a Post Office in Jewells. We the undersigned believe that there should be a Post Office in the Jewellstown Shopping Centre Your petitioners therefore respectfully request the House to consider the opening of a Post Office at Jewells, this area has the population to support their service. by The SPEAKER (from 1,176 citizens) Homelessness To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House the issue of the decline in affordable housing and the growing number of people who are homeless. The overall increase in pogeneral living expenses including a considerable increase in the cost of housing; both to buy or rent, has put considerable strain on people and is contributing to the overall increase in homelessness. Further to this, over the last several years there has been a decline in real funding for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP), emergency accommodation and public oblihousing adding to this issue. Your petitioners therefore request the House invest a proportion of the government's vast surplus provide further funding for SAAP services, emergency accommodation and public housing to ensure safe and affordable accommodation for all citizens because Housing is a Human Right! by The SPEAKER (from 1,498 citizens) Townsville To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of Townsville draws to the attention of the House that there is a proposal to build a V8 Supercar racetrack in Reid Park in the centre of Townsville. This proposal can proceed only if the Federal Government provides $10,000,000.00 funding. Your petitioners believe that it is not appropriate to use this central open parkland in the centre of Townsville for a V8 Supercar Racing facility. The Park is central to existing residential suburbs, proposed high-density housing, community centres and the Townsville High School. Your petias tioners further state that the amount of Local, own State and Federal funds ($41Million) being used for an inner city race track that will be used for only one week a year is a poor use of the people's money. Your petitioners therefore request the House do NOT fund the proposal for the V8 Supercar racetrack in Reid Park, Townsville. by The SPEAKER (from 5 citizens) Cluster Munitions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: That unexploded cluster submunitions disproportionately kill and maim civilians, including a high percentage of children, delay relief efforts in post-conflict tries as well as disrupting long-term development, and continue to kill and maim long after they are deployed and the conflict has ended. We note that Australia does not possess cluster munitions and does not use them. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to - Legislate a ban on the production, transfer, stockpiling and use of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians; - Pass a motion supporting the Oslo Declaration committing Australia to working towards an international treaty that would ban the production, transfer, stockpiling and use of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians globally. by The SPEAKER (from 2,194 citizens) Petitions received.",81
173,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Cluster Munitions Dear Mrs Irwin Mrs Julia Irwin MP Member for Fowler Chair Standing Committee on Petitions Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 Thank you for your letters dated 17 March 2008 about a petition on cluster munitions and a petition on anti-vehicle mines made to the Standing Committee on Petitions. I note that the Minister for Defence, the Hon Joel Fitzgibbon MP, has responsibility for anti-vehicle mines, and he will reply to the Committee on this issue. Regarding cluster munitions, I note that the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade reviewed Senator Lyn Allison's Cluster Munitions (Prohibition) Bill 2006 in 2007. I draw that Standing Committee's report on cluster munitions to the attention of the Standing Committee on Petitions. Australia strongly supports the humanitarian goal of banning cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians, and to that end participates actively in both the negotiations taking place uncounder the “Oslo process” and the United Nationsbased Certain Conventional Weapons Convention. Australia will work to conclude the text of a treaty to ban cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians at the diplomatic conference in Dublin in May 2008. To maximise its effectiveness, the treaty must be widely supported and needs to take into account core national security concerns. The Dublin conference is to negotiate the final text of a cluster munitions treaty. The ability to retain representative samples of cluster munitions for clearance training and to develop counter-measures is a security concern for Australia. This is to enable Australian forces to protect personnel and civilians against attacks using cluster munitions, and to facilitate battlefield and humanitarian clearance. Stocks would minimised and not be for operational use. Responses Another security concern for Australia and other countries is interoperability. Australia engages in coalition operations with partners that are not “Oslo process” participants. This includes missions mandated by the United Nations to restore peace and security, and humanitarian operations. It is important that a cluster munitions treaty not jeopardise such operations. Australia supports integrated approaches to mine action to improve the livelihoods of landmine and explosive remnants of war survivors, their families and communities, including in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Iraq, Laos, Uganda and Vietnam. We fund survivor assistance and mine action ($8.5 million in 2006-07), and in addition, have provided $2.5 million to the United Nations Mine Action Service in Lebanon. I trust this information is of assistance to the Standing Committee on Petitions. From the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith, to a petition presented on 17 March by the Speaker (from 48 citizens).

174,Mr RAGUSE,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I will continue my remarks on the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills, which I commenced prior to question time. In doing that I will not go through a range of points but I will continue on the theme of the importance of this particular legislation for the electorate of Forde. It is an area in southeast Queensland that is under intense development and there is a lot of economic activity. We are seeing what I would suggest are some of the worse examples of the lack of home availability and affordability. This bill will go some way towards relieving some of the pressures, certainly on young families. It is very much about providing solutions. I will reiterate some of the features Assent of the bill before I give relevance to the concerns within my electorate. This is about the Australian dream-people getting into their own homes and having the ability to save their deposits. Essentially, the price rises in Queensland in particular have been quite horrendous. The criteria in this bill cover more than just young people; they cover all people who qualify to buy their first home. The biggest hurdle for those wishing to buy is saving for their deposit. The Rudd government recognises this and will provide for $1.2 billion over four years to help first home buyers save for their first home. First home saver accounts will provide a simple, straightforward and effective way for Australians to save for their first home. I will give a little detail about the bill before I talk about the benefits of this legislation. The first $5,000 of individual contributions to these accounts each year will attract a 17 per cent government contribution, providing more assistance to average income earners-a great incentive for our next generation of home buyers who may currently feel denied the opportunity. They have felt the pressure of trying to get a start in the market. For every $1,000 contributed the government will provide $170 tax free. Earnings will be taxed at a low rate of 15 per and withdrawals will be tax free when used to buy or build a first home in which to live. The accounts will allow a couple, each on average earnings and saving 10 per cent of their incomes, to accumulate a deposit of $88,500 after five years. This is about $12,600 more than would have been possible by saving for the deposit on their own. I am so concerned about these issues of housing generally that I have a separate motion before the House to discuss them further at some stage. The relevance of this bill is that it allows the government to give some relief to young families. It is all about the great Australian dreamowning your own home. I bought my first home when I was 21. It cost me $19,000 and I was on a salary of about $15,000. So the house price was a little more than one year's salary. Today house prices are about seven times annual salary. This is particularly true for the residents of my electorate who are finding it very difficult to enter the market. We should also understand that this is a raft and clarifies very much the Rudd government's approach to young families and families who need relief. It is a piece of the saw to give relief to workers and their families. The Howard government probably ignored these warning signs. I know that for a long time we called for a relief in public housing in Queensland. Even that would have certainly given us some relief. I heard the opposition speaking this morning about rent assistance and how rent assistance funds should be channelled into some other scheme. Essentially, we are stuck with that process-people who are dependent on that particular rent assistance scheme. This is another era; this is a complete approach to providing affordable housing through savings. We have heard many times in the debate over the budget-we hear it from our Prime cent Minister and from our Treasurer-that it is very much about putting downward pressure on inflation, which is then going to put downward pressure on interest rates. In that environment the culture of saving is very, very important. Re-engaging young people with the ability to buy their home through an assisted program of savings has to take top marks. It is interesting to note that the opposition probably do not quite understand that our total approach to this is about providing a whole range of approaches. One of the challenges, of course, is that the availability of land is always going to have an effect on the prices of houses. It was suggested that maybe the government should look at plans. We have done that. Our raft of proposals in this bill and in other legislation talks about our first home saver accounts, which I have just spoken about. We also have our Housing Affordability Fund, which will increase housing supply by providing money for local infrastructure and by giving state and local governments incentives to lower development charges. That is directly in response to some of the challenges that were made this mornjiging by the opposition. We have the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which will provide investors with tax incentives to increase the supply of new affordable rental properties across Australia, saving 50,000 lowto middle-income families 20 per cent of their rental bills. Further to that we have a better approach to land release, with Commonwealth surplus land being freed for housing development or community infrastructure. The pressure is no more obvious than in south-east Queensland where, with the economic boom-the resources boom-and a lot of people moving to Queensland, this whole raft of options will give us in Queensland and certainly in the seat of Forde some relief. We really are looking for solutions but there is negativity coming from the opposition. While generally they support this plan, they want to pick off individual points and drill down into some of the aspects of the bill without understanding that this is part of those four other proposals that I mentioned. As an example, in my own family I was very pleased that on 31 May my nephew and his wife, Mitchell and Jess Raguse, had their first child. They are a young family who want to get their own home. I know that they were very, very excited by the prospect of this particular piece of legislation. They are already trying to save furiously for their first home, so this bill is certainly going to give them some relief on that. I mentioned that this is not only about the mortgage stress but about the whole supply and demand. The opposition challenged us today by talking about the bill as not being a solution to supply. The reality is that it is about providing new housing. Young people will have the option to buy an existing home or to build their own home. Of course, one reason we have major issues with rental property and rental availability is that there are just not enough properties available. So any encouragement to build more homes to get young people and others into their own homes will then free up that rental market. In fact the rental market in my electorate of Forde has probably been most affected, with increases of up to 60 per cent in 18 months. It is quite phenomenal. The First Home Savers Accounts Bill and associated bills are an important start for young Australians and for working families who want to make the great Australian dream of owning their own home a reality. This bill will, I believe, culture of saving, which is a necessary tool to help put downward pressure on interest rates and inflation while giving Australians an opportunity to own their own homes. For these reasons, I commend these bills to the House.",84
175,Mr HAWKE,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I rise to speak on the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008, the First Home Saver Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 and the Income Tax (First Home Saver Accounts Misuse Tax) Bill 2008 before the House, as a matter of vital importance to my electorate of Mitchell is the issue of affordable housing. It is a fact that one of the main contributors to unaffordable housing in Australia is state and local government taxes and charges. Also, as new-found conservatives on the benches opposite will note-understanding conservative economics as they do, with all their newfound interest in such topics-you cannot escape supply and demand inequities in the market. One of the biggest shortfalls of the legislation before the House today is that it does nothing to address supply problems. The 2006 census showed that my electorall ate of Mitchell has one of the highest proportions of mortgage owners, one of the highest proportions of MCMansions and one of the highest rates of couples with dependent children in Australia. Indeed, Western Sydney and north-western Sydney are facing housing affordability issues. Whilst this bill is a very small step and may help some Australians obtain their own house in the future, it is going to produce results that are, at a minimum, four years away. It is not going to do anything to address the very serious problems with supply and demand now, and they are the pressures that are pushing up housing prices. Indeed it would not be unfair to say that this legislation is tinkering around the edges of this problem rather than tackling some of the big picture issues related to afpromote the fordable housing. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in her presentation to the House, mentioned that she had received some letters despairing about unaffordable housing in Australia and referred to it as a crisis. Indeed there is a sis. I was on the phone to a real estate agent in my electorate today who was advising me that they were despairing for older Australians and for people who were already struggling with rental problems in Sydney. The minister argued that she would welcome increased demand and that it would be a good thing. I think that is a great ignorance of supply and demand and market economies, because you cannot welcome increased demand in the current environment in Australia for housing without addressing supply issues. In the current environment in Sydney, where there is a rental crisis and a housing affordability crisis, it is extraordinary for a minister to say that there should be an increase in demand without addressing supplyside problems. In fact, you could observe that it would be a disastrous effect of this legislation if that were to take place. However, we do recognise that this bill is a small step that will, down the track, have some impact upon this problem. The members opposite have spent some time outlining their view that the former government really did not do a whole lot in relation to this issue. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this crisis has come about as a direct result of the policies of state and local governments and has been a while in the making. This problem has been building, and the first home owners grant was one step that the Howard government took in relation to addressing unaffordable housing at the time. Of course, we now know that it has not overcome state and local government charges and levies, which we know are almost a third of the cost of a new house in Sydney. I will say that again, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I think it is worth saying again: the crisis in affordable housing is such that a third of a cost of obtaining a new house in Sydney is government taxes and charges-a full third. If you take into account the second third criof costs, which I think would be the result of state government policies of underbuilding, of urban consolidation without thought for the expansion of the population and how you meet that expansion-in other words, we are underbuilding housing; we are not releasing enough land-you could almost estimate that half of the cost of a new house would be the direct result of state government policies. In this bill, while we have some very fine measures to encourage a culture of savingswhich goes to the heart of how we change the long-term thinking of Australians, how we get them to think ahead about their needs in the future in terms of housing and owning their own houses-they do nothing to address those issues of land release and underbuilding. My electorate of Mitchell has gone through this whole ideological obsession of state Labor governments across Australiaand their environmental departments, which I might make some reference to-with locking up land under this contention that we have somehow run out of land in this country, that somehow we have such a huge population and our cities are expanding at such a rate that we have to do something to curtail growth. We have heard a lot about this. We have heard a lot about urban planning that says that if we do not curtail the size of cities our country will be overwhelmed with undesirable greenhouse gases and other elements. I saw a very good and effective presentation by an urban planning expert, Wendell Cox, who demonstrated on a map of Australia that if you condensed all of the urban land into what it represents it is a small circle on the map of Australia-so small that it is quite amazing to think that state governments have contended for so long that we have to do something to curtail the expansion of our cities. In fact, if you look at the problems in many countries overseas, such as the United States and other areas, you will note that we have no problems with density or urban planning that some of the state government planning departments contend. At the moment there are hearings underway in which the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia is taking evidence that relates to some of the provisions in this bill and what the problems are that this bill is attempting to deal with. In you will hear that areas like Campbelltown and other large areas in Western Sydney are really suffering under this crisis. A proposal which says that in four years time you may be able to access some money that you have saved and some money that the government has given you to reward you for saving and that will somehow alleviate those pressures that are there in Western Sydney right now is not realistic by itself to deal with some of those problems. Indeed, if you look at Sydney today, an average mortgage is around half a million dollars. We know that about 30 per cent of income can often be paid in rent or to service mortgages. There are many challenges in the suburbs of outer Sydney, and I sometimes think that the Minister for Housing and, indeed, the member for Grayndler, who come from inner city electorates, do not understand that out in the suburbs-out in the suburbs of Western Sydney, in the north-west and in the south-west-there is a real challenge associated with the cost of living. That challenge includes transportation costs. We know the member for Grayndler is funding a western metro line in his electorate through the budget at the expense of the outer suburbs of Sydney-the north-west, the south-west and Western Sydney. One of the other problems that this legislation does not address is the public housing stock. We also know that state governments have been reducing the size of the public housing stock across Australia. Much public housing has been sold off. It has not been replaced. Indeed, in the Senate select committee hearings on housing affordability we are hearing about some of those problems, which are also adding pressure to the housing affordability crisis. In looking at the specific provisions of the legislation it is important to note that there is it a lot of complexity in some of the arrangements for these accounts. There are some confusing settings. If you asked an Australian family at the moment to put aside money to save for their future so that they could buy their first home, and you said, ‘We ask you to put aside a minimum of $1,000 a year'this bill provides that it has to be $1,000 per year, every year, for four years-‘even if something happens to your circumstances that alters your ability to do that,' from what I have heard so far I am not sure and not clear what the intention would be for them suffering a penalty for a change in their circumstances. We know that people's circumstances change rapidly in the modern world. Some years people can afford to put aside money one year. In other years they may not be able to do so. Our modern world moves at an enormous pace, and I think if you also said to that same person or family putting aside money, ‘You will not be able to access that money at any time during those four years; you will have to wait until the end of that process, until you had lodged your tax return at the end of the year, to access that money,' then that again would be an unrealistic impost upon families and people who are doing it hard and looking for a solution to the fordable housing crisis. Those provisions of this legisaltion could have been improved because, if you allowed more flexibility into those arrangements, people who are genuinely struggling would appreciate the ability to contribute one year but not contribute the next year. Perhaps could take an average of people's contributions over the years. But not being able to access that money earlier will mean that there is no alleviation of the circumstances that are there at the moment. The pressures are real. They are substantial. They exist day. Indeed, I do not think this legislation will go to addressing those pressures that there right now. Without the flexibility to access the money earlier, what if a person finds within the four years a house that is affordable and within their target income or wealth level, something they would like to invest in? Again, I think the settings are quite confusing about what the government is willing to support and not support. I do not know that we should be penalising people for not waiting out the four years and therefore not accessing the government contribution. One of the other statements the minister made was that one of the problems was that the Howard government did not release enough land in its past 11 years. I consider that to be an extraordinary statement from the Minister for Housing. I had the opportunity to check with the Parliamentary Library as to how much Commonwealth land there is which could be released for use by the Commonwealth, not regarding land that is already locked up. They had to get back to me and did so quite quickly-as they do. Sheepishly they indicated that there was no reliable figure for how much land the Commonwealth owns in Australia and that, furthermore, this was something the Howard af- government was looking at inquiring into to put together a comprehensive and detailed package so that people would know. I would ask the minister what she was referring to when she said that the Howard government would not release land over its 11 years in office. The Parliamentary Library cannot tell they us how much land there is under Commonwealth management, as no reliable assessment has been done. An old valuation put it at $7.4 billion, they inform me, but that valuation must be well out of date, because the Sydney airport-just the airport alonetowhich recently sold, went for almost $5.6 billion. I do not think that that comment by are the minister added anything to the debate in general about this issue. I think the Howard government's attempts through the First Home Owner Grant, which was the first of its kind-an innovation in government policy-went a long way to recognising that we had some building problems because of state governments and we were attempting to address them. Certainly there is a further attempt to address this through this scheme but, again, for some of the reasons I have highlighted, it fails to address the supply-side problems, state government regulation and state government taxes and charges and to immediately tackle some of the problems that are facing people who have problems with their incomes and affordable housing at this time. If you look at some of the other measures before us today, you will see that Labor has not put a lot of thought into this scheme in the sense that it is long on spin and short on detail, something we are becoming quite used to from this government. Housing affordability has put many Australian families into crisis. The scheme the government is proposing today could be seen as an administrative nightmare, because it is a very complicated mess. There has been some contention that it could drive up rents for Australian families. The National Rental Affordability Scheme, which has also been proposed, has a lot of detail in it that may well add to the problems in the rental market at the moment, and that is of grave concern. I mentioned that when speaking to real estate agents in my electorate, and there is a sense that people who are facing a severe crisis with their rents and who have to make some very difficult choices are already on the breadline, so anything that adds to the problems in the rental market at the moment should be avoided. You really do not want programs or measures which, you could argue, will add to the cost of housing and the cost of the rental market rather than address the supply-side issues. So, really, it is very simple. My central contention today to those members sitting opposite is that, as economic conservatives, having come across and joined us in supporting the operation of the free market and rejecting the socialist objective that for so long they have held so dear, they would understand that you cannot support demand-side policies without increasing supply. The supply of housing stock is critical. The minister's statement that the demand going up was a welcome development is an extraordinary statement in the context of this legislation. We cannot welcome extra demand on the housing market at this time without addressing supply-side measures. I think the opposition spokesperson on housing's comments in relation to supply-side schemes are very important and something members opposite should take notice of as supporters of the operation of the free market. Supply and demand are very important and, if you do not have supply and demand in check, when you have massive demand for housing and massive demand for rental properties but not enough supply, you will put pressure on price. That is just a quick summary for those members opposite who may be new to market economics about what happens when you have demand out of control and supply",86
176,Unknown,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,Government members interjecting,90
177,Mr HAWKE,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Yes, you are struggling with supply. Price goes up. So, when we are thinking about future legislation and looking at measures we can take to address the housing affordability crisis that has been created by state Labor governments, we ought to look at supply-side measures that will deliver real downward pressure on price. An increase in supply will mean a matching with demand, which means the price will even out. Let us think about those sorts of things. As I said, my electorate of Mitchell has one of the highest proportions of couples with dependent children, one of the highest proportions of mortgages in Australia and one of the highest proportions of what are termed MCMansions. Housing affordability is a real concern to those people in my electorate. The rental crisis is striking fear into the hearts of many people across Sydney, especially Western Sydney, and we need to take measures in this parliament to address those problems and really take over the jobs of the states, which have failed badly in ensuring that there is sufficient supply in Australian housing markets to ensure we do not have a crisis. I will be supporting these bills because they take a very small step towards dealing with this problem. It will be four years down the track, but anything that encourages greater savings and encourages people to think about their future housing requirements and to understand that with a lack of supply they are going to have to take their saving responsibilities very seriously is something that I support as the member for Mitchell and that I know the opposition supports. So I would strongly say in conclusion that without a complex response to this problem, without thinking about all of the supply-side legislative issues, we may not make a big dent on the housing affordability crisis quickly enough for the likes of many people in the outer suburbs of our metropolitan areas and those families that are doing it tough. But that ought not to stop us from supporting these bills and trying those very small measures that this government has been able to come up with. But I would recommend a handbook on market economics to those opposite for future measures.",90
178,Mr BUTLER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I thank the member for Mitchell for that short course in market economics. The First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related will begin to rescue the Australian dream of home-ownership from the wreckage of the Howard government. Housing affordability, whether in the form of home-ownership or rental accommodation, plummeted under the previous government. It is a simple matter of record. True to form, that one-trick pony of a government could think of little more by way of a response than a lump sum cash handout without paying any regard to the complex factors at play in this question and without paying any regard whatsoever to the challenges faced by renters. Australia is by no means alone over recent years in having to grapple with a housing bubble. After the dotcom bubble burst and share market investment became temporarily less attractive, low interest rates around the world drew money into the residential property market. The Economist magazine tells us that residential property prices in the veloped world rose by over US$30 trillion from 2000 to 2005. That increase was equivalent to about 100 per cent of the combined GDP of those countries and represents in percentage terms the biggest asset bubble in history. We know that Australia's price increases were right at the top of that table when measured in percentage terms. By any measure, this period caused housing in Australia to become overvalued, a great benefit no doubt to those who managed to get over the rope bridge before it burned through but the core of the challenge that we now face for so many other Australians, particularly in younger generations. The standard method of measuring whether housing stock is overor under-valued is using the price-rent ratio, the property market's equivalent of the price-earnings ratio used in the share market. By 2005 the price-rent ratio for Australian residential property was 70 per cent higher than the 25-year average to 2000, an increase in the ratio that far outstripped other overheated property markets such as in the US or in the UK. Logic and experience tell us what happens when the price-rent ratio is so far from the average. Prices stagnate or even fall, or rents rise, or perhaps there is a combination of those. While some overseas markets have seen prices begin to fall, in some cases quite dramatically, by and large in aggregate terms the effect in Australia has been more on rents. Unfortunately for aspiring homeowners, though, the moderation in the housing market that started a few years ago came just at the time that the Howard government's run of 11 interest rate rises on the trot was beginning. As a result the housing affordability index continued to fall under the previous government's housing policy. The most recent index published by the Housing Industry Association and the Commonwealth Bank saw a record low result. The HIA reports that de- the average home loan repayment across Australia is now $2,799 per month or $33,588 of post-tax income every year. While repayments at that rate are simply out of the question for many working families, the deposit now needed for an average house has also become a major barrier to entering the market. Using the traditional deposit rate of 15 per cent, the average Sydney house now needs a deposit of $83,000, the average house in Melbourne requires a potential buyer to find a deposit of $69,000 and in my own home town of Adelaide you will need $54,000. As one would have predicted looking at the price-rent ratio in 2005, we have also started to see very significant rises in rents. This impacts negatively on two groups: firstly, those Australians who are long-term renters; and, secondly, those who would follow the traditional path in this country of renting while you save a deposit to buy. Higher rents, combined with higher prices for consumer goods, generally make it harder again to young Australians to save a deposit to get into the market. This budget and these bills in particular provide new hope to those Australians who are struggling to find affordable rental accommodation and struggling to save a deposit to buy. These bills constitute an important element of a $2.2 billion package contained in the budget targeting housing affordability. The centrepiece of the package reflected in these bills is the enhanced first home saver accounts. This policy will help Australians saving to buy to build their deposit in a tax effective way. The first $5,000 of individual contributions to these accounts will be matched by a government contribution of 17 per cent or $850, or $1,700 for a couple who are both making that level of contribution. Earnings from the account will be taxed at the discounted rate of 15 per cent and withdrawals will be tax free when used to buy a home or to build one. A young couple both making such a contribution would over five years or so be able to benefit by well over $10,000 towards their deposit. The second element to the package is the National Rental Affordability Scheme. That scheme commits $623 million over four years to encouraging the construction of rental housing priced at least 20 per cent below the market rate. It is clear, in spite of the member for Mitchell's lecture on market economics, that government intervention or at least support is needed to stimulate growth in affordable housing. In my own state of South Australia, the Rann government has legislated a quota of 15 per cent affordable housing in new large housing developments. This scheme will build on schemes like South Australia's to ease the pressure on renters. Finally, the housing package outlined in the budget contains a number of measures to boost supply. We know that supply has been running well below demand in recent years under the leadership of the Howard government. We also know that the previous government paid no real attention to supply-side measures. True to form, they preferred to sit on their hands, point the finger at state governments and avoid any real leadership. But, given the shadow minister's exposition on supply-side economics earlier on in this debate, that might actually have been a blessing. I was not sure that I had heard the member for Farrer correctly, so I checked the Hansard. Indeed, it does appear that the shadow minister thinks we should draw a lesson on housing supply from the plasma TV market: everyone wants one, demand has been skyrocketing, but prices have come right down on plasma TVs, so why doesn't it happen in housing? On this side of the chamber we suspect the question of housing supply might be a little more complex. Some time ago, the new government announced a review of its land holdings to identify new housing opportunities and assist the member for Mitchell on the question he asked the Parliamentary Library. The budget also delivers $500 million over five years to cutting a range of supply-side costs. These are meaningful supply-side policies. Australians will look back on the Rudd government's housing affordability package as the first step in bringing the dream of home-ownership back from the brink. These bills constitute the centrepiece of that package, and I commend them to the House.",91
179,Mr ROBERT,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I rise to not oppose the passage of the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills, despite their limitations, as anything that encourages people to save is a welcome and good thing. The facts of the bill are that you must be 18 years old to have one of these new first home saver accounts. There is no restriction on who can make a contribution to your account, although all contributions must be made in post-tax amounts. To ensure that the taxation incentives are appropriately targeted, there is an overall balance cap of $75,000, noting it is indexed annually by $5,000. Government contributions are only paid on the first $5,000 each year-indexed, of course. Payments can only be made from a savings account to purchase a first home if personal contributions of at least $1,000 have been made in at least four consecutive financial years. You cannot use the funds from this account for at least four years. A government contribution is payable for an individual for a financial year on personal contributions up to $5,000 indexed per annum, and the rate of contribution by the government is 17 per cent. Funds are taxed at 15 per cent. They are the facts. That is the basis of the government's proposal. Whilst we will not oppose it, as all savings are good, I think the government has missed the mark and not provided the full potential that this bill could possibly bring. For a start, the bill the government brings to the table deals with the demand side of the equation. And whilst I am sure the Labor government believes in big government-it believes in giving outcomes to people-we believe in giving people opportunities, getting them to the door, giving them as much incentive as possible and allowing market forces to rule. There is no commensurate supply-side equation in the bill, and the supply-side equation is fundamental. The Labor states must release more land. It is a statement of the absolute bleedingly obvious. I am faced with the farcical situation in my electorate, the seat of Fadden, where around Woongoolba, the vast canegrowing areas, the average farmer is making something like $20,000 to $30,000 a year and is going broke. Out of 60 farmers, 55 of them are not interested in farming anymore, yet in the south-east Queensland plan the Labor state government has demanded that the area stay for primary production of cane. No-one is interested in actually growing cane-the price they are getting is dismal and there is no way to make a living. That land could easily be changed in the southeast Queensland plan to bring up more supply of land. Labor states must get rid of stamp duty on first home purchases. It is a farce for Labor states to continue to charge a tax on people struggling to get in their first home. City councils must amortise infrastructure costs across the life of a land investment, because at present almost 30 per cent of the costs of a development house and land package are the infrastructure costs leveraged by local city councils. If states released more land-obviously with a greater supply of land, prices come that down; it is simple economics-if the states got rid of stamp duty for first home buyers and if the councils amortised their infrastructure charges, housing prices could be reduced by as much as 30 to 40 per cent. That would put a dent in the issues and the difficulties of first home buyers entering the housing market. Labor has talked up cooperative federalism-Labor from door-to-door across state and federal governments-and yet it still cannot get the states to get stamp duty on the purchase of first homes or release more land. Cooperative federalism has failed the first hurdle. While a major deficiency of the bill is that it deals with the demand side of the equation and not the more extensive supply side, there are other deficiencies. The bill only allows for someone to open a bank account if they are 18 years old. I suggest that this is based on the logic that someone finishes school when they are 18. I finished year 12 when I was 16. There are many people who finish school when they are 15. This bill is saying to people who finish school at 15: ‘I'm sorry, you can't save for a house. We don't want you saving for your first house. You've got to be 18 to save for your first house, because your government knows best.' I entered the workforce at 16. This bill would have prohibited me from enjoying the benefits that this bill purports to offer because apparently I would have been too young to save for my first home. If that is what this government thinks about the capacity of young people to save for their first home, may I suggest to Kevin 07 and team: go back to the drawing board. Furthermore, the bill is capped at $75,000. This equates to a 20 per cent deposit for a $300,000 home, excluding other costs. Let me shatter the little bubble that the Labor government lives in: an article in the Courier Mail on 9 September 2007-six months ago, so these numbers are on the low side-said that overall the median price in Brisbane six months ago increased to $434,000, ahead of Melbourne at $420,000 and close behind Sydney at $525,000 and Perth on $446,000. This bill caps the amount you can have at $75,000, which is a 20 per cent deposit for a $300,000 house, and yet in Queensland the average house in Brisbane is $434,000. I say to the government: you are $134,000 short; your $75,000 is too low. Nearly one-third of rid of Brisbane suburbs-43 out of 151-have a median house price above half a million dollars, but only five out of 151 suburbs are below $300,000. So if the $75,000 limit capped for these accounts in this bill, and all good financial commentators say a deposit should be 20 per cent, was available to someone with one of these accounts-if they were over 18 of course, because heaven forbid, if you are below that you could not possibly save for your first house and enjoy the benefits that this bill would offer-only five out of 151 suburbs would be able to have the pleasure. Other Sunshine Coast hotspots, getting a more rounded view of Queensland: Buddina, up 24.9 per cent to $585,000; Alexandra Headland, up 24½ per cent to $644,000; in Mackay, the median price for homes at Shoal Point on the northern beaches rose 20.9 per cent-double the average for the city-to $535,000; and at the Gold Coast, where I hold the seat of Fadden, the median price of $420,000 six months ago was up 6.3 per cent. Considering the cost of entering into a home, considering the fact that this government will not touch the supply side of the equation because clearly it is a little too hard to take on the big scary Labor state governments, why cap the amount at $75,000? It is literally too little. It must be a minimum of $100,000 or more. And why cap the contributions that the government will pay a percentage on at $5,000? Where did the $5,000 come from? The figure needs to be higher to keep pace with the rising price of housing. It needs to be somewhere around $10,000. Furthermore, the government must review why it intends to tax the earnings. While I understand the 15 per cent rate is in line with the rate of superannuation, if this is such an emergency as the government purports it to be-I acknowledge the housing crisis means it is difficult for people to get in-and this government is so flush with funds courtesy of the member for Higgins and the financial discipline of a previous government, why tax the earnings in the accounts? Why not allow the earnings to be untaxed and to grow at a more rapid rate? Furthermore, there is no incentive for parents to save for their children and take a long-term view. This looks like a short-term, politically expedient symbolic view of a hapless Labor government. Why not allow parents to save for their children? Allow the accounts to be open for any age child, to give the incentive for parents to make sacrifices now so their children will be able to afford a house when they come of age. Why not allow accounts for any age? Why not allow a tax deduction for people who contribute funds, up to a limit, into the accounts of their children or others? By providing a tax deduction, it will get a greater degree of dollars and cents flowing into accounts to assist people to purchase their first home. So while the bill is not opposed, it lacks in so many areas. The government must consider the supply side of the equation. It must take on the Labor state governments. The 18-yearold level at which an account can be opened is ridiculous considering so many people start work at a younger age. It is saying to them, ‘I'm sorry, we don't believe you've got the capacity to save and we're not going to help you.' It is another means test that this budget looks at putting in place, but rather than a means test by the politics of envy on those who apparently have too much money for this Labor government to be pleased with, this is saying, ‘You're not old enough to be able to save for a house.' The cap at $75,000 is too low. The cap at which government will pay a contribution of $5,000 is too low; it should be $10,000. Tax on the earnings of 15 per cent will simply lessen the amount of money and the incentive for people to put dollars and cents into those accounts, and there is currently no incentive for parents to save for their children. I was communicating with constituents Nadine and Kirk Hamilton last week. It was interesting because they reflected on this and other budget measures. They are paying more for health insurance and are dreading the Medicare surcharge going up as private health insurance will soar above 10 per cent increases in premiums. They cannot save for their children through various accounts like the first home saver account and enjoy the government contribution because apparently their children are too young for this government. They note the increases of rent and the difficulties of housing affordability coming through, and also note the inadequacies of this legislation. While it has the framework, the bones, the architecture of something remotely decent, it falls over in so many areas. On top of that, with the government unsure about what they are doing with the $4.7 billion Conroy city-centric plan, these people cannot even get ADSL in the city. The average people like Nadine and Kirk Hamilton, who work hard, who love their families and who are the backbone of a nation, look at this bill and say it has not gone far enough. It has not extended to the areas where it needs to. It has not reached anywhere near its potential. So, while the bill is not opposed, I encourage the government to take a good, hard, solid look in the mirror and look at areas where it could be substantially improved for the benefit of all Australians.",93
180,Mr SYMON,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I rise in strong support of the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and, rather than pick holes around the edges, I want to say I think it is a very good package all up. Together with the other two bills, the First Home Saver Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 and Income Tax (First Home Saver Accounts Misuse Tax) Bill 2008, this bill implements the Rudd government's 2007 election commitment to introduce a first home saver accounts scheme. It is an initiative that makes it easier for lies to put money away for a deposit to buy their first home by giving them access to low-tax accounts. From 1 October 2008, thousands of young families from across the country, many from my own electorate of Deakin, will be able to edge closer to that dream of owning their first home through this initiative. It is a dream that has become more and more distant over recent years as housing affordability has decreased. The prices of properties have increased much faster than wages. Many families need a scheme such as this to help them achieve the very Australian dream of owning their own home. The great benefit of an account such as this is its concessional tax feature. You save money, rather than putting it into a bank account where you find out, at the end of year, that you have to pay marginal tax at the full rate on the small amount that you have been able to save. That is a great benefit and one that more and more people will see as the scheme rolls on. I talk to many young house hunters and many young families as I get around Deakin between Canberra sittings. I talk to locals who are looking to purchase homes in the growth areas of my electorate around Croydon, Ringwood and Bayswater North. I know these areas very well. I grew up in the local area and I have lived and worked there my whole life-and I have seen it change. In that time it has gone from an area with open spaces-there were even farms and orchards around-to being almost fully developed. But, because it is 30 to 35 kilometres out from the city of Melbourne, housing prices there, whilst expensive, are in the range where first home buyers think they may be able to make a purchase if they shop wisely. So this type of scheme is particularly relevant to a seat like mine. These are the mortgage-belt suburbs of Melbourne's outer east and they are examples of the very places that famifirst home buyers want to settle in. These people tell me how hard it has been for them to save a deposit as they try to lock money away whilst they deal with spiralling rents-and it is almost impossible to rent in eastern Melbourne now; we have a vacancy rate of one per cent-with the increasing costs of living and with the cost of running two cars. If you are going to live that far out from the city, you actually need two cars out there because public transport does not always go to where you need it. Quite often many of them are travelling 70 kilometres or more to and from work each day. That is a cost, and all that comes out of the family budget. One of the first things to go in that case is savings for a house, because you are looking after your week-to-week expenses. First home saver accounts help in that regard because of the tax advantages that come with them. There was no sign of a helping hand for first home buyers from the former federal government. We have heard a lot in here today about things that might be wrong with particular little points of this scheme but nothing about what should have happened in the previous 12 years. There was no helping hand, there were no new ideas and there was no strategy to help these aspiring young first home buyers get their foot in the door. First home buyers in Deakin have a friend in this new Rudd government, a government that is acting on the housing affordability crisis. First home saver accounts are just one part of the government's $2.2 billion package to tackle the housing affordability crisis. The first home saver accounts, the National Rental Affordability Scheme and the new Housing Affordability Fund now come together as a complete strategy to help young families save that deposit and get into their first home. First home saver accounts will provide first home hunters with a simple, taxeffective way to save for a place to call home, through an effective combination of low taxes and Rudd government contributions. The government will contribute 17 per cent on the first $5,000 of contributions made into individual accounts each year. That means that a typical couple in Deakin, each earning an average income, will be able to save a deposit of more than $88,000 after five years if they exercise discipline in their savings. Depending on returns, that can be up to $12,600 more than if they had saved their money in an ordinary deposit account. A key feature of the accounts is that parents and grandparents can make contributions to their children's and grandchildren's accounts, with all benefits flowing to the home saver. That means a bigger deposit and a faster start to buying their first home and planning the rest of their lives. It is by getting into their first home that most young families can begin to map out the rest of their lives. They can make big decisions, like having children and deciding which local schools they want them to go to and which community they want them to grow up in. They now have the ability to do so with greater confidence, knowing they finally have a federal government going into bat for them, a government that is putting in place first home saver accounts that will mean real dollars for them at the end of the line. This can be shown by having a look at how the average young family in Deakin will benefit in dollars and cents. Let us look at a mum and a dad with two kids, aged four and six, as an example. Dad works full time and earns $60,000 per year, while Mum works three days per week and earns $27,000 per year. They work hard and set aside 10 per cent of their combined income into their first home saver accounts in 2008-09, putting away $8,700 split evenly between their accounts. This will mean that both of them will receive about $1,480 of Rudd government contributions. And, if they keep working hard to put money away at that rate, in five years they will have a combined balance of $64,800 for their home deposit and be $10,100 better off than if they had put it in a regular deposit account. There are real dollars in this scheme, giving young house hunters more money in the bank and cutting down the time before they can start their house hunting. The Rudd government has consulted widely with the community on the design of this policy to make sure that it is as fair and accessible as possible. The Rudd government has improved the first home saver accounts to include the flat 17 per cent contribution for all individuals, to make sure that people on average incomes get better returns on their savings. We have removed the planned $1,000 up-front contribution so that accounts can be opened up without the need for existing savings. That is particularly important to parents who might want to open up an account for one of their adult kids but who do not have $1,000 at hand to do so. This bill now calculates the four-year rule from the financial year in which the account was opened, in order to reduce compliance costs. It also introduces a 14-day cooling off period to give people the chance to change their mind, although with such a good scheme I would not think that there would be many doing so. We have replaced the $10,000 annual contributions cap with one overall account balance cap of $75,000 indexed. This cap includes personal contributions, government contributions and earnings and, when the cap is reached, earnings and any outstanding government contributions are still able to be credited to the account, although no further personal contribution is permitted at that point. The ASIC, the ATO and APRA will work closely with the industry to minimise the reporting requirements as much as possible to make accounts easier to use and understandable for the end-user-those that are saving the money. It is anticipated that these changes, from making first home saver accounts fairer and more accessible, will also increase savings in accounts from over $4 billion to around $6.5 billion over four years. This is another example of the new Rudd government doing things smarter and delivering fresh ideas that produce results and which net massive savings at the same time. It is perhaps a good idea to place the gains for first home buyers and young families through this initiative into the basket of the other benefits flowing to them from the Rudd government. I commend this bill to the House.",95
181,Mr TUCKEY,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I rise to speak on the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills. Owning a home when one reaches retirement is the difference between a comfortable livelihood and very difficult financial circumstancesmore particularly if your sole source of income is the age pension. Every step should be taken by governments to ensure that people have an opportunity during their working lives to become the unmortgaged owners of a home. This can be looked at in a number of ways. The member for Deakin painted a scenario where people, having paid tax on their income, can put money into a special savings account and, if they have a surplus of $5,000 a year, attract $850 in government assistance. They will have paid, if those savings were from a $50,000 income, probably twice that amount in income tax prior to making the deposit. That is a guess; I have not exactly calculated it. If they save $64,000, that represent approximately half the state government rip-off in the development and purchase of a building block. In New South Wales that is reputed to be over $150,000 and, for the member for Deakin's consideration, it is probably a little less in the lovely city of Melbourne. The reality is that, compared to the rip-off orchestrated by state aside governments in the cost of developing a block of land, it is peanuts. Furthermore, for the 18-year-old to whom the government offers some assistance now, what will those costs have escalated to? The first thing is this. Is this a measure of substance? It sounds good: pay tax on your income, put it in a bank account and, if you can manage $5,000 a year, the government will give you 850 bucks a year. The aggregation of that money is going to be achieved all through interest or earnings paid on that amount of money. Is that going to be tax free? No. It is going to be taxed at 15 per cent. But then, of course, that could be attractive, as it might otherwise be paid at 30 per cent or 40 per cent under income tax laws. But you have already paid that. So it is hardly generous, when one looks at the problems involved. I believe it does not address the serious problem. The other day, I attacked the government for its foolish-which is the best way to describe it-but also unfair choice of certain amounts of money for means testing, for instance, the baby bonus. Quite a few people actually buy a house because they want a safe environment for a baby or two or three-as we encouraged people to have. There is $5,000 out the window if your combined income as a couple exceeds the amount of money you need to buy a house in Sydney. As I note, between 2001 and 2004 the median jumped from $300,000 in round figures to $460,000 in round figures. You are not a rich person in Sydney if you cannot will afford a house. Unless you have a combined income of the order of $150,000, it is pretty obvious that you cannot afford to take a significant mortgage on a house-whether you have accumulated $66,000 or $88,000, as the minister referred to in his second reading speech, as a deposit. Where is the benefit? Reference was made by the member for Deakin to the failings of the previous government. The previous government introduced the first home owners scheme. As I recollect, that was $7,000 with no strings attached. When it came to having to deposit your own money, we did not say that you had to have a deposit of a certain size. We did not say you had to have been banking your money since you were 18. When that money was originally provided the amount was close to 10 per cent of the cost of a house. As significant research has shown, building costs-notwithstanding people's increased aspirations for what one might now call a home-have been contained within inflation. It is the cost of land that has increased the price of housing. Australia is a pretty big continent, and one thing we are not short of is land. But I want to offer the benefit of one of my experiences as a local government councillor in a remote district as to what has changed in the last 30 or 40 years. In Western Australia at the time. I wish to talk about, we had a minister for the north west and development who actually believed in the development side of things. He later became Sir Charles Court-at that time he was Charlie Court to most of us-and that was his job. I was the shire president of Carnarvon, a very small town with a population of about 2,000 at the time, 11 feet above sea level at the mouth of a river that can fill Sydney Harbour in four hours when it makes up its mind to run at all, and we had a land development problem. We had used up the land that was 11 feet above sea level and everything else was subject to flooding and had been flooded in quite recent times. Nevertheless, by the nature of the river, we could protect the land with levy banks. Into the town walked two Americans, who said, ‘Look, within a very short period of time we want to bring 200 families to your town to run the biggest tracking station outside America.' We were pretty anxious that they should come and, fortunately, they did. But we had to get some land. We went to the appropriate authorities in Perth and we got all these hard luck stories about the availability of finance and who was going to build the levy banks. So I wrote a terse letter to the then Premier, a fellow called Dave Brand, and a little bit later Charlie Court turned up in town with the two relevant ministers for lands and local government. We walked over to the land that we thought should be developed and went through the difficulties, and the two ministers gave us their hard luck stories again. I said to Charlie Court, ‘Will you get out of the road and let our council do it?' to which he said, ‘Can you manage it, Wilson?' I said, the ‘Yeah, we have borrowing powers. We know all about roads and sewerage and all those sorts of things.' He turned straight to the other two blokes and said, ‘Get back to Perth, give them the land, give them the approvals and let them get on with it' We had people building houses within a couple of months on land that did not have a road-did not have anything. But the road was there by the time the houses were finished. By the way, we eventually sold the land-and I am talking some years back-for $2,000 a block. We developed it but made no profit for the council-maybe just a few hundred dollars to cover administration. Compare that with today. It can take you five or 10 years to get a subdivision. What are the costs to some developer going into the marketplace, paying tens of millions of dollars for land on which the interest rate clock starts ticking on that day and then waiting 10 years to jump the ever-increasing hurdles? How long before it is some thousands of dollars per block? We now have some state governments which cannot live off the GST and want to be paid in advance for the freeway they might build in 50 years time. The concept of headworks charges were unheard of and we have just loaded up and loaded up, and it is the politicians of Australia who must take the blame. So, when a state government wants to rake $150,000 out of the system when it has probably imposed some thousands of dollars in start-up costs, planning costs and the cost of interest, what is the good of this scheme? I am not allowed to use the words I should. Why are we not looking at other options? The funny thing about that is that the town we are standing in does not sell freehold land; it sells 99-year leases. That in itself pretty meaningless because the government still expects the purchaser to pay what is tually the lifetime rent up front and the cost therefore is no different from that for a hold title. That lease document is bankable and, what is more, is of a nature that may as well be freehold anyway. But who has stopped to think of the concept of developing land which, on a bankable lease, is rented to people at $X a month with a 10-year clause whereby you have a right of purchase but at a market value at that time-10, 15 or 20 years later-and when you have settled your financial affairs? Under those circumstances, the amount of money you borrow is for the construction of the home which, as I have pointed out, is frequently less than half the total cost of a package. If you really want to do something for people and give them access, give them those opportunities. Of course, that requires talking with developers, because developers expect a profit. Of course, in the superannuation area, sometimes they can accept the profit of the land at a later date and a low rental fee in the early period. More importantly, and I have raised this in my electorate, we have town planning rules around Australia that limit the number of houses that can be built on a farming property. It might be 100,000 acres or hectares, and you are typically allowed to have two houses on it. But, if those farmers, frequently seeking cash flow-and some would be in a better position than others-could do a virtual subdivision of some land on their property and offer it to people for a weekly rent on a bankable lease document and for a respectable period, people could move onto those blocks of land and do as the average farmer does: supply their own septic tank, supply their own water et cetera but probably pay only the headworks charges to get the is electricity connected. In fact, if you pick up most Sunday papers, you will see people vir- who manufacture sheds and transportable buildings offering new, adequate shelterfree- not the most glamorous-from $20,000 upwards. I wrote to the Western Australian minister for planning about that and she gave me a thousand reasons why it would not work. I might add that some of the town planners on the councils I wrote to did not think that was a good idea either because it cuts them out of the process. But the fact of life is that, if you choose to live and work in a rural area and accept the wages that rural industries and their associated service industries can afford to pay, you do not want a mortgage much over $50,000. So why don't we encourage those things? If the rent was $20 a week for the block and a farmer had 10 of them, in a drought year he would at least have a cash flow of $10,000 in simple terms. Why do we lack the wit to go through those processes? Why would the minister for planning dismiss that out of hand, saying that it was going to create ghettoes and all sorts of things? It would be 10 blocks on 1,000 acres and, because it would be a lease, it could actually dictate behaviour and the way people lived upon that property to an extent. Think of the opportunities for people. I put some of those arguments to the previous government with a similar lack of success, so I will not compare the performance of each government. Whilst any scheme is helpful, this particular scheme is not a response that will help people in the short term. There are people out there at this moment who would like to own a home and cannot afford one. The last budget took the baby bonus off most of those couples-where the female partner is pregnant-who could afford a medium-priced house in Sydney. I see the member sitting over there-I am afraid he has not been around long enough for me to know the name of his electorateis starting to shake his head and say, ‘If you're on $150,000 a year, you can afford a house in SydneyMr Shorten- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for O'Connor, who it seems has been here a very long time, is meant to address members by their seat or by their title. When he just says, ‘The member over there,' and has a go at someone's youth, for whatever reason",98
182,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,The member has made his point. The member for O'Connor will refer to members by their seat or their title.,101
183,Mr TUCKEY,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Thank you for that bit of advice. He is one of those who shunted someone else out-and that makes for two of them in the room. The fact is that I did not refer to him as anybody. I said, ‘I don't know his seat.' I did not call him ‘Bill Smith'. The point of order was frivolous. I was saying that the member over there, whose seat I cannot name, was shaking his head when I said that if you live in Sydney or Melbourne and you have a mortgage then you are not rich on a gross family income of $150,000particularly when you look at the tax rates that are applicable at those higher levels. I make that point as an example of how difficult it is for people to acquire homes. There are no practical responses to addressing the cost of the building block for a new house. We all know that the cost of a finished new home package flows through to those houses previously constructed. Unless governments are prepared to find alternative means, I put it to this House that providing people with leases that can be converted to freehold as their financial circumstances improve is a sensible proposition and not one warranting an interruption to my speech. I think it is a very positive idea that people should think about because it removes what has become the most expensive part of the process. If state governments went back to their responsibility for providing services and not trying to be paid in advance by 50 years for some of them then in fact this particular proposal would have some meaning. I point out that an aggregate amount as mentioned by the member for Deakin would be half what the state government rips out in the development of a building block.",101
184,Mr BRADBURY,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Lindsay) (6.12 pm)It is my pleasure to rise in support of the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills and to support the initiative contained therein. It is an initiative that will encourage a new savings culture, particularly amongst young people. The member for O'Connor was reflecting upon experience and lack of experience. I must say that some of us in the House probably have a little more recent experience of the challenge of saving funds to acquire our first home. In the context of my experiences, I wish to add my voice in support of these bills because I know that the initiatives contained within these bills provide a genuine incentive for people to save over a period of time in a responsible way to prepare themselves for the task that lies ahead in owning and purchasing a property. It is a lifetime commitment for most people. The typical time frame for a mortgage is 25 years, and many mortgages are now being taken out over a 30-year period. This is a long time frame that the typical family or couple might be looking at in preparing to save for and ultimately own their own home. The criticism that has been levelled by those on the other side that the four-year lock-in period-the four-year rule-is something of a considerable disincentive or disadvantage that potential homeowners might face lacks substance. The very people who will be most willing to take up the offer of a first home saver account are the people that this initiative is targeted towards, and that is an indicator of what will be the success of the policies contained within this bill. If you are looking to save a deposit over a short period of time, this may not be an attractive proposition to you, but, as we have heard from many speakers on the other side, it is difficult to save enough money to secure a deposit and own a home, particularly in our major cities, whether it be Sydney or Melbourne. As someone who hails from Western Sydney, I have to respond to the member for O'Connor's suggestion that only those with over $150,000 in their household income can own a home or pay off a mortgage in Sydney. There are plenty of people in my community doing it tough but in an honest and consistent way. They are working hard and bringing home modest incomes; we have a median income in our electorate of $50,000odd. We have a rate of home-ownership in the vicinity of 30 to 35 per cent. Clearly, many people on incomes of far less than $150,000 are rising to the challenge, albeit a very cult challenge, of paying off a mortgage with a view towards owning their own home. As many speakers in this debate have said, one of the great elements of the Australian dream is being able to buy and own a home and being able to raise a family, if that is your wish and inclination, within a home that you have acquired through the efforts of your labours. I wish to respond to a number of the comments that have been made by previous speakers on the other side. I make this general observation: we have seen in this debate something we have seen in other debates and we will continue to see. There is no question that housing affordability is a big problem. We all recall the member for Higgins denying that there was a housing affordability crisis; it was not that long ago. Those on the other side have come around in recent times. It has taken only a fairly devastating election defeat for them to see the error of their ways, and now they appreciate that families in suburbs such as those within my electorate have been doing it tough for a range of reasons when it comes to owning their own homes and sustaining the mortgage repayments required. Now that those on the other side have recognised that this is a problem, they say, ‘This bill will not be a comprehensive response to the challenge of housing affordability.' They are right. This bill on its own will not be a comprehensive response to the challenge of housing affordability, but thankfully this is not the only bill that the government intends to bring forward as an integral part of a comprehensive strategy designed to make housing more affordable over the medium term. We could come into this place and suggest that this bill is going to make the difference, but in the end these are complex problems that require multifaceted solutions. This bill is one of the facets that we wish to bring forward. This proposal will be of diffisignificant assistance to people wanting to save money. Being able to contribute up to $5,000 a year, having a co-contribution from the government of 17 per cent of the contribution and then enjoying the benefits of earnings taxed at the concessional rate of 15 per cent will deliver real benefits and provide a real incentive for people to save over the medium term. It will not only prepare people for seeing a bank manager and securing a loan but also demonstrate a savings history that will hold them in good stead for paying off their mortgage throughout the course of their loan. I support the first home owners grant and this government will keep it in place. Apart from being one-off compensation for the effects of the GST, it is an important payment that is factored into every first home buyer's considerations in preparing themselves for a mortgage. But if there was a downside to that proposal it was that it handed over the money in one hit, allowed some people to get a mortgage without establishing a savings history and made them more vulnerable to the ultimate increases in interest rates that we have all experienced. Those on the other side who claim credit for the first home owners grant do not recognise that there were some inherent flaws in the way in which the scheme operated, and that is one of them. The other was that it was inherently inflationary in its impact. Because it brought a surge of new home buyers onto the market in a very short space of time, it drove up house prices. I note that the member for Farrer said she was very concerned that this policy might achieve the same result. Unlike the first home owners grant, which led to that initial flood of first home owners into the marketmany of whom have subsequently found out that, having not established a savings history, it has become a lot more difficult to sustain the consecutive increases in interest rates that have prevailed in the time since-and drove up the cost of housing, this proposal will not lead to that inflationary effect, and that is why it is a very sensible policy. courages a savings culture and sends a clear message to potential first home buyers that it is a difficult business. It is not easy. Anyone that has ever had a mortgage and had to pay it off will know that it is not easy. You need to be prepared for it and you need to save for a deposit that you can bring to the table when you first secure the mortgage. The other point that those on the other side have not reflected upon is that in recent years we have seen a massive increase in the number of people obtaining a mortgage with a very small deposit. There has been criticism from the other side that the amount on offer-potentially up to $75,000, or $88,000 if you factor in the additional earnings over time-is insufficient to cover the cost of a deposit. In recent years, we have seen many people getting a mortgage with a deposit that is nowhere near that amount, so it is a bit rich for those on the other side to say that there is insufficient money for a deposit when the reality tells a very different story. As opposed to a system that encourages people to get themselves into a situation where they have a mortgage that is almost the same amount as the value of the house that they are currently living in, this is a policy that encourages people to get some runs on the board-to save some money over a period of time-so that, when they are in a position to enter the first home owning market, to take on a mortgage, they will have been through some of the preparation that is required in order to prepare them for what lies ahead. I think that this is a good policy. It is one that I support. It is only one measure but, when you combine it with some of the other things that we are doing-whether it be the Housing Affordability Fund or the National Rental Affordability Scheme-you see a package of policies. Those on the other side have criticised the lack of supply-side policies. Do not forget that we are currently It enundertaking a comprehensive review of Commonwealth owned land, with a view towards determining whether or not some of that land could be or should be released to assist in opening up supply in the housing market. When you combine all of these things, you start to see some semblance of a comprehensive policy designed to attack the housing affordability crisis. Those on the other side can reflect upon the 11½ years that they had to address this issue, and they will not be able to come up with more than one comment. The only thing you hear from them is ‘the first home owner grant'. But the first home owner grant on its own did not do anything to address the massive challenge of the housing affordability crisis. You need a range of policies. That is why we have a package of policies of which this is an important part, and it is one that many people in my electorate will get great benefit from. It is in that vein that I support the bills.",101
185,Mr SIMPKINS,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I embrace the opportunity to speak tonight on the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills, on what is a very important issue. We have that old catch cry ‘the great Australian dream'. I say, ‘Long may it live.' We should be pursuing these sorts of things. I strongly believe that it is everyone's right in this country to have the opportunity to buy a home, if they wish to, with landsomewhere for the kids to play, somewhere to run a dog if they want that. These are the important things in life. This is a key thing. is right up there with jobs. I would like to go back a little bit in time to cover the points in relation to this bill. The first house that I ever bought was back during the Keating government period. Unfortunately, it was not for me or my wife to live in; it was actually for my parents-in-law to live in. It was because my parents lost their business during the time of the high interest rates that the last Labor government delivered. Due to good management, we had a bit of a deposit, and the price of houses was a lot lower then-in fact, I think this house was $108,000 in a reasonable suburb in Perth. Of course, there was no-one there to help us at that time. There were no opportunities for first home buyers or anything like that. The last Labor government forced us into that purchase. In listening to a lot of what has been said today, and I think will be covering some things the member for Lindsay said, I find it incredible that the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs can lecture us-I might even say, give us a sermon-about how much this government has done and how little the last government allegedly did. I want to speak on this bill because of the past and the future. In the same way that this new government continues to espouse its revisionist propaganda, I know that they have regressed, and will keep regressing in the future, to the catatonic mantra of ‘11½ years of neglect' that we have just heard. Just because you keep saying it again and again, it does not mean you are telling the truth. The new government is very fond of rolling out a denial of any action by the last government, a denial that any of those actions by the Howard government actually added value in this country. But there is an extensive list of very good things that the Howard government did. The minister asked, at one point It today: what did the last government actually do? ‘Give us one point,' I think she actually said. The member for Lindsay mentioned that point already, so I am surprised that the minister asked. The answer, of course, is that there was the introduction of the first home buyer grant. Just to deal with what the member for Lindsay said. I think he said, ‘11½ years of housing affordability crisis.' I do not know where he was during a lot of that 11½ years, but my house that I bought is now worth twice as much as I paid for it. In 2001, I do not think anyone was actually talking about a crisis-certainly not in Perth. Maybe there was a crisis in Western Sydney at that time, but certainly there was not in Perth. There were a number of places around the country where you could do quite well. You could afford a house in most cities and it was not too much of a struggle. But things have changed, obviously. There have been the issues of the mining boom in Western Australia-a lot of people coming in, increased demand for a limited stock-but I will get to that in due course. I mentioned before that there was a great deal of denial that the former government had done anything right. I sometimes wonder whether, apart from the revision of history that seems to be taking place with those employed by the government in the ministerial wing, at some point there will be some rewriting of history books to reflect the new realities. This rewriting of history by the Rudd government does tend to take you back to the days of school, where I remember reading George Orwell's 1984. It seems to be pretty similar: the past has been rewritten into a new reality and badged as the truth. In every portfolio area, it is as if the past existed-or at least the past where $96 billion of government debt was never eliminated by the good economic management of the Howard government, which did, of course, occur; or where the number of young Australians in apprenticeships was increased threefold by the Howard government; or where there are over 2 million more jobs in the economy now than there were back in 1996. So the government is now rewriting the reality that I recall. Let us go back to the past for at least the homebuyers. At the time. I bought my house I was a captain in the Army and did not have access to the First Home Owner Grant-it did not exist at that point in the Paul Keating period. Suddenly I had to buy a house to keep a roof over the heads of my parents-inlaw. I am not upset by missing out on the First Home Owner Grant. When we were looking to buy our own home, the one we wanted to live in, we then made additional sacrifices. We went without things. That is the way we have always approached things in our family. My circumstances are probably no different from those of a number of other people in Western Australia and other places around the country. We all know that adversity can affect to anyone. I know that that certainly has occurred. When my wife and I bought our house-the one we live in-back in 2001, we did stretch ourselves, but we had a built-in capacity to address interest rates changes and put together a deposit. We made sacrifices to meet our financial obligations, but what made it harder were state government taxes. The only place these taxes have gone in recent times is up. To my mind, that is just one of the elements which the government has not confronted. I want to see success. I want to see the first home savers fund work, but the government needs to concentrate, to put the heat on or throw acid on state governments to never come through and make a contribution. That remains the major impediment to the government in confronting housing affordability. It is good to give more people more money. That is good for increasing demand, but more land is required so that houses can be built. It is not just a matter of whether the government is still thinking about selling off SAS land over in Perth or wherever elsemaybe kicking the reserve out of Karrakatta. I would hate to see that happen. I do not know what the government's plan is. When the government is talking about what Commonwealth land can be sold, that worries me a little bit because the states control most of the land and they need to pull their weight. At this point, I cannot see the government putting the pressure on or throwing the acid on state governments. I think we will see more of that in future or at least refusal to act to get the states to pull their weight. It is important that I get back to the bills before the House. I draw inspiration for my next comments from the First Home Saver Account fact sheets for account holders. The fact sheets describe the scheme as ‘simple' in the first paragraph. The first section of the sheet concerns me on two counts. Firstlymaybe this is being facetious-any document that this government puts forward as a fact sheet is immediately suspect. I would like to look firstly at the eligibility section. know this point was made earlier by the member for Fadden, but why does commencement have to start at age 18, when locking in good savings and budgeting practices should commence earlier than that at 16? Kick people off in their economic lives by concentrating on what is really important rather than mobile phone plans or trying to buy that V8. They should be encouraged to concentrate on something where they can really make a difference to their long-term security, and buying a house is it. Why does it have to be age 18? I think you can get past the limitations that have been suggested on this matter. My next point-this is the one I really want to draw attention to, and I can see the minister's advisers over there-is regarding the dot point, which says: ‘not having previously bought or built a first home'. In my extensive consultation with the people of my electorate before and since the election, I am afraid to say I have learnt that not all marriages survive in Cowan. I am sure it is the case in every other electorate. We know that some people cannot continue to live together. While that is regrettable, it is not something that can be avoided in all cases.",104
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,Order! I direct the member for Cowan to address his remarks through the chair.,106
187,Mr SIMPKINS,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will look more forthrightly toward you. I recall many occasions on which a man or woman have told me about the circumstances of their marriage ending. It was always the case that one party in the relationship ended up with the house, the significant asset, while one did not. I think it is reasonable to say that the information regarding assets is held by a federal government body such as the Child Support Agency or by the I Family Court and it is probably possible to determine who did the best out of some of these matters. With regard to eligibility, I ask the government why there cannot be some flexibility with regard to access for first home buyers or savers-flexibility to consider that some former partners from broken relationships want to get back on their feet and get some assets behind them. I therefore speak today for these forgotten people. I speak for the lady of Polish origin whom I met one day in Ballajura who raised this specific issue with me. I also speak for the lady in Marangaroo, not far from Rawlinson Primary School, who also raised the issue of her friend. What about some flexibility to help these people get on their feet again? They had a house, they have lost that house and now they have no options for support. The First Home Owner Grant is not there for them and the first home saver account is not there for them either. It seems to me that this is a great opportunity to extend it a little bit. It might be a little difficult, but the facts are there. Somewhere within the bureaucracy we would know what sorts of circumstances they are truly in. It is a good opportunity to help people who are up against it later in life. It would be good to get some help for those people. On the savings side, which we have been lectured on recently, in tightening up the legislation I would also like the governmentand I am not sure if this is covered; I did not find it in the fact sheet-to, when eligibility is determined, take into account homes that are gifted to a person. After all, if you have house, you have an asset that someone who is struggling to save does not have. You have that advantage, and that should be taken into account. On the point of withdrawals for a first home purchase I believe that further clarification is required. The holder of the first home saver account clearly has to live in the house for six of the first 12 months. I worry that a person who is a fly in, fly out worker may not be able to achieve compliance on this point. Therefore, I hope that there is some flexibility for those who face these sorts of employment conditions. I have made some commentary on the fact sheet. I recall that the government claims that as many as 500,000 people will benefit from the scheme. I wonder if the beneficiaries are individual account holders. Are their families included in that number? I want to look further forward on the matter. I want to look beyond savings and at the capacity to pay. The member for Lindsay has raised points in this area. In the end, the of the deposit will be irrelevant if the capacity to service the eventual home loan is not there. To emphasise that point, I draw on an article in the Australian Financial Review from 8 May this year by Rohan Alexander. Mr Alexander suggests that the result of this scheme will be that families will qualify for loans that they could not ordinarily afford. The point being made is that saving a deposit over four years indicates a certain capacity of the family involved to service the interest on a particular loan amount. Because the 17 per cent government contribution applies only to the raising of the deposit, there should be provision for the eventual loan application to not consider the government's contribution, as it would otherwise distort the figures regarding how much the family can repay. Mr Alexander's next point leads on from a there. If the circumstances of these people are degraded-for whatever reason-the number of foreclosures would rise. Given that the government predicts 134,000 fewer jobs in the coming financial year, and possibly more losses in the years to come after that, we can assume that no income in the house would be a significant change in people's circumstances. At the end of the day, we still have no acceleration in the release of land by states and no benefits for supply. I call on the government to put the pressure on the states to do so. The sale of Defence land, if that is the plan, is not going to cut through in the end. What we will have with this system is more people with a deposit competing in a competitive market. This is an inflationary risk. Obviously, we are not going to oppose this bill. There are some areas in which it needs refining. The point that I would make in particular one final time is that all aspects of the problems of housing affordability and the pursuit of the great Australian dream need to size be addressed. We must look at what incentives can be put out there for a change in savings. Some people in this country need to change their savings patterns. We need to look at what the federal government can provide in the way of more land. Most of all, what we need to do is get the states to increase the supply of land. We also need to address the issue of state government charges and taxes. At the moment, these are the important points that the government-by the looks of it-are not interested in looking at. Somewhere along the line, they might have to tread on the toes of the state governments, call them to account and ask them why they have not been doing more to address the housing affordability problem. Being from Perth, I obviously cannot speak for those who live in other cities. Things picked up about five or six years ago. They picked up because there were a lot more people coming into the state. People were immigrating from overseas and from across the country. They were pursuing the mining boom. The amount of land that is out there has not kept up. These are the problems that need to be addressed.",106
188,Ms RISHWORTH,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I am very pleased to rise to support the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and associated bills. The introduction of the first home saver account legislation not only delivers on one of the Rudd government's key election promises but also provides a real practical measure to help thousands of young Australians get a step closer to the Australian dream of home ownership. This is something that the previous government seemed uninterested in doing anything about. They sat back and ignored this growing crisis without any strategy. They had their head in the sand when it came to housing affordability. Those on this side of the House know that housing affordability is placing significant strain on our neighbourhoods. That is why this government has placed, and will continue to place, housing affordability firmly on the national agenda. This is in stark contrast to those on the other side who for the majority of their time in government did not even have a housing minister. There is not a week that goes by that someone in my electorate of Kingston does not bring up with me their concerns about housing affordability, whether it is anxiety about how to pay the mortgage if there is another interest rate rise or where to find rental accommodation or how to pay a rental bond. One of the many young people affected by the housing affordability crisis in my electorate is Danielle. She is a 20-year-old woman living in Woodcroft who earns about $35,000 per year. Danielle had recently embarked on what many young people want to do-that is, move out of the family home and share a house with friends. For Danielle this only lasted a short time as she found it almost impossible to pay rent and afford food and petrol, let alone save for a deposit to purchase a home. She has had to move back home with her parents who help subsidise her living costs. This, unfortunately, is a too common story around my electorate. Australia's housing market is one of the least affordable in the developed world. Over the past decade the price of an average house has risen from five to 7½ times the average annual wage. Also over the past decade, average weekly rents have risen by approximately 82 per cent and, according to the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, 1.1 million lowto moderate-income households are paying more than 30 per cent of their disposable income. This is an approximate 20 per cent increase since 2004and it is our young Australians who are at the greatest level of housing stress. Homeownership has historically been an essential part of wealth creation and economic security for families in this country. The high cost of rent makes it very difficult to save for a deposit for a new home. There was a time when renting was only a temporary measure for families who were saving to buy their first home. However, this is no longer the case. One of the most significant barriers between young people and home-ownership is that challenge of saving for a deposit. With the cost of rent taking a huge chunk of the weekly budget, it is near impossible for individuals or families to save for their own home. The government's first home saver account will help young people and families in this task. It will help young people like Danielle. This initiative is particularly important in my seat of Kingston, where a significant proportion of the population is aged between 18 and 30-the stage in life where most people are starting to think about buying their first home. The first home saver account will be able to be offered by banks, credit unions and superannuation funds, and it is expected that account holders will be able to choose from a number of institutions with a number of different investment options. Account holders will receive a 17 per cent government contribution to their account on the first $5,000 of individual contributions. This will mean that a person who contributes $5,000 in their first year will receive a government contribution of $850. Account holders will continue to be eligible for government contributions in subsequent years, until the account holder withdraws the balance to purchase a home or if the account reaches the balance cap of $75,000 indexed. Over time, and with the effect of compound interest, the government's contribution will build and become a substantial component of the final account balance upon withdrawal. Investment earnings or interest on these accounts will be taxed at a flat rate of 15 per cent. This gives a considerable concession to the majority of young families who pay a marginal tax rate of more than 15 per cent. I believe that one of the best features of these new accounts is that parents and grandparents are able to make contributions on behalf of their children. It is often parents who express to me their deep concern about the housing affordability crisis and the impact it will have on their children's future. They fear their children will never be able to achieve the dream of a family home. Many of these parents and grandparents around Kingston want to take action to help their children save for a deposit but they cannot afford to pay their children a lump sum at once. Under this new program the government will pay the 17 per cent contribution for payments made by parents or grandparents into their children's accounts. The Rudd government has a broad agenda on housing which considers the whole spectrum of housing issues. This ranges from the chronically homeless to the needs of aspiring homeowners and to those who own their own home but are burdened by significant debt. In addition to our home saver account, the government has announced a number of other innovative initiatives. These initiatives are part of a $2.2 billion package to tackle housing affordability and homelessness. As mentioned previously, rental accommodation has become extremely expensive. The Rudd government's National Rental Affordability Scheme aims to deliver up to an extra 50,000 new affordable rental homes over the next four years and another 50,000 if the demand remains strong into the next decade. This will be achieved by providing incentives to investors to deliver affordable rental properties at 80 per cent of prevailing market rates. This initiative will help ease the burden on renters and has certainly been warmly welcomed by the community housing sector in my electorate who already invest in housing and rent these properties well below the market rates. Another initiative in this budget which will assist with lowering the cost of buying a new home is the $512 million Housing Affordability Fund. The new fund will help pay for the infrastructure for new developments, such as water, sewerage and transport, and help streamline development approval processes around Australia. This fund will help lower the cost of building new homes and reduce supply-side barriers to developing new housing. This is particularly significant for my seat of Kingston, which sits in the outer metropolitan area of Adelaide where many new houses will be built over the coming years. The Rudd Labor government is taking the issue of housing affordability seriously. We have a challenge ahead of us which has been severely exacerbated by the years of neglect by the previous government. The first home saver accounts are one step to help ease the burden of housing affordability on young people and young families. I commend the bills to the House. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (6.52 pm)-I rise in support of the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills. The first home saver accounts initiative, which was announced by the Labor Party during the election and delivered in the 2008 budget by the Rudd Labor government, fulfils an important promise made to the Australian people. This is an exciting and innovative initiasummit. tive that will make a difference to many people's lives. During 2006 and 2007, while meeting people on doorsteps, at mobile offices and at many public forums around the electorate of Petrie, the message was clear. Young adults were concerned that they will never be able to afford their own homes. Parents of young children, like me, were equally concerned about their children's future ability to own their own homes. And many older Australians expressed deep concern about their children's and grandchildren's future opportunity to own their own homes. I heard this message, as did Wayne Swan, Kevin Rudd and the entire Labor team. It was clear that more needed to be done. That is how this initiative came about-listening to the community. That is how many great ideas originate-from the local community. It is a practice that I strongly support. The benefits of community involvement and the gathering of ideas were recently evidenced when I held a 2020 schools summit in my electorate. Twenty-three schools, over 70 students and over two dozen principals, teachers and parents came together to discuss important national topics and also topics that were equally important to our local community. This forum once again reinforced the overwhelming benefit of gathering ideas from your local community. There is no doubt that it is government's responsibility to make the hard decisions, but there is no reason why such decisions should not evolve from the ground up. That is what consultation is about-not just talking but listening to our communities. At the Petrie 2020 schools summit one of our discussion topics was housing affordability. I thank all of the students, principals, teachers, parents and chairpersons for their fantastic efforts and contributions not just to this topic but to all of the important topics that were discussed at that The First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 has come about through extensive consultation with the Australian community. The benefits of the bill now before the House are unequivocal. Many of us in this chamber had the benefit of buying our homes at a time when house prices were much lower and overall cost of living was much lower. Saving for a deposit for your first home has never been easy for the majority of workers. It was and is still not uncommon for couples to call upon their parents to assist with the raising of sufficient funds to cover a five per cent deposit, even when your first home may have been only $100,000. According to the Real Estate Institute of Australia, the median house price for outer Brisbane is now $355,000, which is a 24 per cent increase in the past year. For other dwellings, such as units and flats, the median price is $276,800. These prices are as at the December quarter 2007. While these prices are good for existing homeowners, these rapid price rises make it harder than ever for aspiring first homebuyers to break into the market because they cannot save a big enough deposit in an ordinary bank account. That is why the Real Estate Institute concluded in Brisbane: Housing affordability continues to decline … … … ... leaving many would be first home buyers locked out of the market. Focusing even more on my electorate of Petrie, which is in outer northern metropolitan Brisbane, there are 12,639 rental dwellings within the electorate, according to the census data. According to the ABS 2006 census data, the median gross weekly income for individuals within the electorate of Petrie was only $484 and for families it was $1,196. When you consider the median price of houses or other dwellings and the median gross weekly income, it is understandable that many people in my local community are facing financial pressures. In addition to the everyday cost of living, many people saving for their first home are currently renting. According to the Real Estate Institute of Australia, for the December quarter 2007 the median rental price in Brisbane was $300 per week. Individuals and families seeking to save for a deposit for their first home are paying these rental prices on the incomes identified. This and other costs facing families and individuals create significant impediments to people raising sufficient funds to have a deposit for a first home. These figures show the immense financial pressure that people in outer northern metropolitan Brisbane are facing. First homebuyers have been shut out of the housing market. In March 2008, across Australia, first homebuyers accounted for only 16.4 per cent of all home purchases, which is less than one in six of all home purchases. This compares to 26.1 per cent, or over a quarter, of all home purchases in July 2001. In Queensland the proportion of first homebuyers is now only 15.3 per cent. This rate has halved since August 2000, when 30.4 per cent of all home purchases were by first homebuyers. The first home owners grant and the first home savers account will assist those most in need in our community to obtain their own home. This is despite the views we have heard today from the member for Fadden, who is praising the credentials of the member for Higgins and the previous government. This is the government that did nothing to encourage or to assist individuals to save. What they did do was provide consecutive interest rate rises and irresponsible spending. Although the member for Cowan thinks it is good to have somewhere for the kids to play and the dog to run, it is a little bit more basic than that. It is about actual home security; it is about having a roof over your head for you and your family. My concern is also for our young adults coming out of school now and into the future. Those of us who are a little bit older remember the days when we left school. We did not have mobile phones and we did not immediately get credit cards. We had little debt for the first few years of our working lives other than maybe paying board to our parents or possibly paying rent in a shared house or unit. Times have certainly changed. Most young adults have a mobile phone before they leave school. Many are committing to phone plans at the age of 18 and credit cards are very much a part of our society now. The damaging effects of early debt that young people are accumulating are multiplied for those who progress from secondary school to further education. This is why many young adults are staying at home longer. Only last week the Courier Mail ran a story about more and more young adults choosing to live at home. The story appeared on Tuesday, 27 May. I would like to read to the House some of the opinions of these young adults: After living independently in Japan for nine months in 2005, Rhiannon Holland returned to Australia with little money to support herself. Knowing she wished to pursue a university degree, Rhiannon's parents, aware that the average price for a rental property was $220 a week, invited her to move back into the family home at Aspley. “The advantages are not having to worry about the money expenditures,” Rhiannon said. “I haven't come across any disadvantages, bar the occasional privacy issues. But I see this as my parents' house, not as my own.” … … … Alana Wells, 18, of Scarborough, is a full-time university student studying business and earns $292 a week as a part-time receptionist. “My weekly income goes towards paying off my laptop for university, which is $100 a week,” she says. “I save over $70 and the rest of the money pays for my entertainment and travel.” According to Donna Wells, Alana's mother, most parents don't have a problem with their adult children living at home. “As a parent my role is to support Alana so that she'll have a career and a stable lifestyle,” she says. “The workforce is competitive and living at home allows Alana to save money and devote time to her studies.” … … … Twenty-year-old Dean Muller moved out of his family home in Bracken Ridge to a flat in Newmarket, closer to his university, but discovered he did not have enough time to concentrate on his studies. After six months, he was back living at home. “I was working two jobs at the time and it just became too much,” he says. … … … “You can save much easier living at home. Moving out was a nice awakener to reality, with bills that you've never heard of before, not to mention shopping for groceries, cooking your own food every night; all little things you take for granted when you live at home with your parents.” Celia Lucas, 19, works full-time as a marketing and events coordinator and graphic designer for Sherrin Group in Brisbane and lives in Redcliffe with her parents, despite the fact she has to drive 35 minutes to work. “I like where I live and it's convenient,” she says. “I live right on the beach, near my friends and it's cheaper than moving out.” Celia earns $630 a week, $80 of which goes to her parents for board, which is a fair deal, she says. “Mum and Dad do so much for me. Paying board is really good training because I know to allocate a specific amount of money each week.” The article talks about four young adults, who all live in the electorate of Petrie and who also make the point that anyone who labels them as bludgers is misrepresenting them. The article talks about the benefits of young adults staying at home for longer or, in some of the cases that I have referred to, moving back home. I can certainly relate to their circumstances as I am also one of those people who, as a young adult, moved back into my parents' home at the age of 18, because of the costs of renting on a low income. I congratulate their parents for ensuring that these young adults get the support they need, and also, as the article reflects, the parents are ensuring that these young adults are learning the life skills that they will need once they are out of the family household. I do hold concerns about how equipped our young adults are to plan and save for the future with such debt that I have referred to building up at such a young age. I am very supportive of schemes that assist people in saving. We need to teach our young adults and people saving for their first home the importance of personal responsibility. Teaching people to save teaches them to be responsible with their income, and it teaches them to be independent and self-sufficient. The First Home Saver Account scheme not only assists people in saving for a first home but it teaches people the important life skills of budgeting and saving into the future-something that the previous government failed to assist with. This is not a skill that we should presume everyone has. Juggling financial obligations is not easy. The less money coming into the household, the harder it is to balance the competing costs; thus the importance of budgeting is heightened. The benefit of learning to save is that will also equip these people to balance their finances better once they are in their own home. As we all know, the costs do not end when you buy your first home. There are new costs-of maintaining the home and paying rates-that previously the individuals or couples have not had to manage. The Rudd Labor government's first home saver accounts do more than simply help people to save and teach them the importance of saving. The government itself contributes to the savings, further assisting them in achieving the aim of home-ownership. This is achieved through the government providing additional assistance through a government contribution of 17 per cent on the first $5,000 of tributions for all individuals. The first home saver accounts are low-tax accounts to help young Australians realise the dream of home-ownership. With housing affordability an issue that needs shortand long-term solutions, having these accounts offered from 1 October 2008 will allow immediate savings to be accumulating from this year. One of the key changes that the Rudd Labor government made to this scheme, since the release of the discussion paper and based on the community consultation, was to ease the criteria to open accounts. The new first home saver accounts will allow individuals to open an account without having existing savings and will allow parents to open an account for their children. In addition, parents and grandparents will be able to make contributions to their children's and grandchildren's accountswith all benefits flowing to the home saver. As I said at the beginning, this initiative is exciting. It gives opportunity to those that otherwise were struggling to see a future that included them owning their own home. The Rudd Labor government, Treasurer Wayne Swan and I understand the anxiety that the uncertainty of not being able to own a home it creates in young adults, parents and grandparents. This bill is a Labor bill-a bill to provide long-term benefits to people in our communities and a tangible benefit to deal with the increasing cost of living and the difficulty this places on the potential for home-ownership. I have pleasure in commending this bill to the House and I look forward to encouraging many in my electorate to take up this opportunity.",108
189,Ms NEAL,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I rise to speak on the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008, the First Home Saver Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 and the Income Tax (First Home Saver Accounts Misuse Tax) Bill 2008. They are bills aimed con- at dealing with an emerging social problem, and that is that the costs of homes over decades have risen to such an extent that many young people find themselves in a situation where purchasing their first home is an almost unattainable aspiration. If no action is taken we are heading to a generational divide of, on the one hand, the affluent older generation holding property which increases in value over time and, on the other, a younger generation without real property whose net worth is being eroded by the cost of housing for themselves and their families. In my electorate of Robertson families are paying, on average, 29 per cent of their income on servicing their mortgage. They are the lucky ones, as they have already entered the marketplace. Those who still have not yet bought their home are in an even more difficult situation with a larger, almost insurmountable barrier. With a median house in New South Wales now costing $385,000 and even on the Central Coast a median house is $364,000, a 10 per cent deposit is a huge amount of money and many people are not able to accumulate this sum. Despite reduced clearance rates and negative publicity about the housing market, in recent years the annual rate of increase in property is still 4.8 per cent. We are certainly at risk of shutting people out-people who are not in the real property market but completely outside. I bought my first house 20 years ago at a cost of about $80,000. That was not an unusual figure. Houses were available at that price both where I bought on the Central Coast and in Sydney. Certainly a 10 per cent deposit was reasonable. You could save and you could do it. Now I do not know how anyone does it, particularly people on low incomes. I am lucky enough to deal with a number of young people, and to know them quite well, particularly through my involvement in soccer. There are many young people in their 20s and early 30s who still do not have any idea of when they might buy a home. I find it very difficult to assure them that some day they will be able to do this. That is why I am so proud to be part of a government that is trying to find a solution this problem. It is part of delivering our promises. I am very pleased to see that this government, this Kevin Rudd Labor government, takes its commitments-its commitments generally and in particular commitments made during the election-very seriously. This legislation is delivering on our promise to make housing move affordable, particularly for the younger generation. This legislation assists saving for a deposit with a combination of tax concessions and government contributions to the first home saver account. This is about this government delivering, as I have said, in a very practical way. This home saver accounts bill and the consequential amendments establish a regime for first homebuyers saving for their deposit. To be eligible to establish a FHSA a person: must be aged between 18 and 65 years, must not have previously owned a home, and must provide their tax file number. The legislation also does not allow such an account to be established before 1 October 2008, when this legislation comes into effect. Only one such account can be opened by each eligible individual to ensure that individuals do not double up on the concessions available on the account. The maximum contribution to the account is $75,000. Generally an individual can have or have had only one of these accounts unless the account was closed for a number of specified reasons: the money was paid into another FHSA; the contributions to the account were refunded because the account was set up under an unsolicited offer under subsection 992A(4); there was a defective product disclosure document under section 1016F; or the account was closed within the cooling-off period. There are a number of institutions that can to provide these accounts, and they are already regulated. They are authorised deposit takers-essentially banks-life insurance companies and registrable superannuation entities, RSEs, that are authorised to offer FHSA accounts. The manner in which payments can be made from this account is specified under part 3 division 3 of the bill. These are limited if an account holder wishes to retain the benefits this account is entitled to. The authorised withdrawals are for: acquiring a qualifying interest in the person's main residence when they are under age 60-the account holder must also have contributed at least $1,000 in at least four financial years; transferring to another first home saver account; or making a contribution to the account holder's superannuation fund. This is in fact compulsory where the account holder becomes ineligible to hold the account, which happens upon the purchase of a home, of course. The benefit of such an account for an individual is twofold. Firstly, a government contribution is made to a saver account on annual contributions of up to a maximum of $5,000 at a rate of 17 per cent. This maximum is indexed. The minimum government contribution is $20. Where the calculation determines a lower amount then the contribution is rounded up to that $20 amount. The contribution, thus calculated, is paid directly into the account after the lodgement of the individual's tax return or of their statement where they are not required to lodge a tax return. The second benefit of a home saver account is the tax concessions. The contributions to such an account are not taxed, coming from after tax income, and the earnings on the account are taxed at a rate of 15 per cent rather than the marginal rate of the indiand vidual, which would generally be substantially higher. This tax concession extends to the withdrawal of funds. No tax is payable where the funds are withdrawn to purchase a home or where an account is closed and the balance of a fund is paid to a superannuation account. As I have said, this is a decision of the government made in pursuit of an election commitment but is far more important than that. This is about delivering equity in our usual community-equity between the younger and the older generation. It is also ensuring that we do not create a group of individuals and families who have no home and do not have the security that that provides. I commend the bill to the House.",113
190,Mr CHEESEMAN,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I listened very intently to the contribution of the member for Robertson to this debate on the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008. In fact, the circumstances she described for people in their 20s and 30s are identical to the circumstances of many people in my electorate and certainly were the circumstances that I found myself in several years ago. Labor is committed absolutely to helping people own their own home. For the overwhelming majority of Australians, owning their own home is one of the great milestones in life. It provides security. It provides satisfaction. It provides sanctuary. It is the boundary around the family. Within a family home there are usually thousands of happy family memories and experiences. The biggest step in home-ownership is the first. I know that because I am still paying off my first home loan. Just a few years ago I took that very big step. Buying a first home for many is a great leap of faith. It certainly was for me. It is a time when families take on a large debt and many families need support assistance to make that transition. That is why Labor has committed a very significant part of its federal budget towards helping first homebuyers. The Rudd government will be investing around $1.2 billion over four years in the First Home Saver Accounts initiative. Labor's first home saver accounts are a policy breakthrough. They are the first of their kind in Australia and will provide a simple, taxeffective way for Australians to save for their first home. Labor's First Home Saver Accounts policy will not just help young families; it will help older families who have missed their chance of owning their home. It will resurrect their hopes. Any individual can open an account if they are aged over 18 and under 65. These accounts operate very flexibly. Following a detailed consultation process with consumers and finance and housing industries, they have been designed to accommodate and meet the needs of individuals and families. The benefits from these accounts will be derived from a combination of government contributions and low tax cuts. There are four key ways that consumers will benefit from these accounts. Firstly, tributions to these accounts will not be subjected to tax. Secondly, investment earnings or interest will be taxed at a minimal rate of 15 per cent. Thirdly, withdrawals for the purpose of purchasing a first home will be tax free and, finally, first home saver account balances will be exempt from the income and assets tests. Withdrawals will also be tax free unions. where they are used to purchase a first home to live in. An overall account balance cap of $75,000 has been introduced, but the initial stipulation of an up-front contribution of $1,000 has been removed. So we have actually significantly improved the benefits in these accounts above and beyond what we promised at the election. I have a couple of other important issues to do with these accounts. Contributions may be made by an account holder or another party, such as an employer, on behalf of the account holder. The government will make additional contributions which will be paid directly into the account after the individual has lodged their tax return and the provider has submitted the relevant information to the ATO. The government will contribute 17 per cent on the first $5,000 indexed on individual contributions made each year. This means an individual contributing $5,000 will receive a government contribution of $850. No minimum annual deposit is needed to keep the account open. All I can say is that I wish this policy had been around when I purchased my first home just a few years ago. This is a very good scheme. It has been well thought through. Consideration has been put into people's changing circumstances. For example, if an individual's circumstances change during the life of the account so that they no longer wish to purchase a first home, they will not be able to access the account but can transfer the balance into superannuation and then close the account. By transferring the account balance into suconperannuation, individuals may apply to access the superannuation through early release provisions of severe financial hardship, compassionate grounds or terminal illness. A wide variety of providers will be able to offer these accounts such as public offer superannuation providers, life insurers, friendly societies, banks, building societies and credit Over the first three years federal Labor's first home saver accounts will help around half a million first homebuyers to save bigger deposits. That is a lot of help to a lot of people. The impact and benefits of Labor's first home saver accounts are broader than to individuals. They will be good for the overall Australian economy. Federal Labor's first home saver accounts will also help boost national savings, with the accounts anticipated to hold over $6 billion in savings after three years. This is attacking one of the fundamental problems with our economy-our ratio of savings-and is another legacy left to this government by the now opposition along with the skills crisis, rising mortgages and interest rates. As I said, it was only a few years ago that I was saving for a deposit for my first home. I know it was hard then, but today it is even harder. With the escalating housing costs over recent years, saving a home loan deposit is very tough. It is the greatest obstacle to buying a first home. This policy will help thousands of Australians overcome that barrier. It will help more Australians save a larger deposit. And a larger deposit will also reduce the debt burden for young homebuyers. It can, for example, help them avoid incurring costly mortgage insurance. I point out something else: as good as this scheme is, it is not all we are going to do for Australians wishing to buy their homes. This policy goes together with a range of other initiatives that will further assist with housing affordability. As an example I point to Labor's housing affordability infrastructure fund, which provides a very significant contribution to helping bring down the cost of housing and land. Labor, through the housing affordability infrastructure fund, is offering to assist councils to meet the cost of some community infrastructure and services so as to bring down the cost of land and house purchases. Through these initiatives you can see what a difference Labor is making in government. You can see a government that is up early, thinking about how to help working families. This is a government with a strong work ethic, a government that knows what matters to working people, a government that is creative and a government that has policy incentive. What a difference an election makes. What a contrast we have today. There is the fading memory of the tired Howard-Costello government, tied up in policy knots, tangled in ideological obsessions, twisted inward with factional positioning and leadership jockeying and trying to shore up their own job security whilst abolishing job security workers. Contrast this with a united, new Labor government with well-crafted and targeted policies, looking decades ahead and rebuilding Australia after a decade of neglect. Labor's first home saver accounts are not just good policy in themselves. They are a sign of Labor's creative thinking and our commitment to tackle the real needs of working Australians. I commend this bill.",115
191,Mr ZAPPIA,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I too rise to support the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 that has been presented by the government, and I congratulate the member for Corangamite on his remarks. I start by talking about a report that was released only a year ago by the Urban Development Institute of Australia. I quote some of the statistics that were produced in that report, because those statistics highlight the dire straits that many Australians are in in respect of being able to buy their first home. Between 1984 and 2006 house prices rose across Australia by 493 per cent, whilst over the same period incomes rose by only 183 per cent. Between 1984 and 2006 outright home-ownership fell from 41 per cent to 33 per cent. And in the 10-year period from 1996 to 2006 average mortgage payments rose from $780 per month to $1,300 per month. Today that figure is even higher. In fact it is much higher, sitting at over $2,000 per month. Not surprisingly, between 2001 and 2007 the first homebuyers' share of the market dropped from 23 per cent to 16.6 per cent, and the figure is at about that point right now-that is, the share of first-time buyers entering the market has dropped by almost 30 per cent over the six-year period from 2001 to 2007. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the steepest price hikes in the cost of housing occurred in the years immediately after the introduction of the GST. So the great Australian dream of owning your own home is becoming a near impossifor ble dream for too many Australians and, in particular, young couples wanting to begin their new life together in their own home. That is why it is important that all three levels of government work constructively together in order to ease the housing affordability crisis and why I speak in support of the government's First Home Saver Accounts Bill. This bill provides very real tax benefits and savings incentives for first homebuyers who are saving their money to buy their home. It creates an incentive for people to save money and it encourages a disciplined commitment in managing money, which is exactly what will be required when the next step is taken and a home loan is taken out. Owning your own home is not just an idealistic dream. It has widespread benefits for both the homeowner and the local community and for the broader Australian community. Firstly, home-ownership creates stability and security within the household. It establishes the best environment in which to raise children as well as creating a sense of achievement and raising the self-esteem of the new homeowner. But it also creates stability in the local community because it encourages commitment to the local community and builds community pride and community spirit. Homeownership is an investment in the local neighbourhood. For governments, it means less reliance on public housing, less social disruption and less homelessness. There is a secondary benefit in helping people move into their own home. The housing sector is a significant contributor to the Australian economy, providing about 20 per cent of our gross domestic product. A decline in housing construction will have serious negative effects on our economy. In my own electorate of Makin around 30 per cent of the population are what I would call younger people who would aspire at some stage to owning their own home. Many of these people hope to one day own their own home. When I was campaigning for the 2007 election I was frequently approached by both parents and young people who expressed their real concerns to me that home-ownership was becoming out of reach for so many of them. What is just as frustrating is that as home prices rise so do the rents, and therefore those people who are renting are never able to save up any money because of the rents they pay and they find it even more difficult to achieve their dream of owning their own home. That is why this bill will be welcomed by so many Australian families. I want to briefly respond to some of the comments that I have heard from members of the opposition with respect to this bill and the constant game of blaming the state governments for the reduction in public housing stock. The reality is that, in the 12 years of the Howard government, federal government funds for public housing declined markedly and so state governments were left to manage the stocks they had with far less money. It is not the fault of the state governments if they are trying to manage a public housing stock when they had their public funds reduced by billions of dollars. That is the first point I want to make about that matter. The other point I will make is this: opposition speakers have frequently talked about what I would refer to as urban sprawl and making more land available in particular by the state governments. Firstly, whilst state governments certainly hold some land, the reality is that about half of it is owned by private owners. Therefore, it is not just the state governments that have land available which could be released for the building of homes. There is an additional issue relating to urban sprawl. As the mayor of a council in the outlying areas of Adelaide for 10 years, I understand exactly what urban sprawl means and the impacts it has on housing and living costs. In fact, one of the initiatives I put to my council at the time was for the council to get involved in a housing scheme which could be described as a shared equity scheme, in order to try and help people get into their first homes. When that proposal was publicly reported, the telephone lines at the council were overrun with people inquiring about how they might be able to access a new home under the scheme. The points I really want to make are these. When you go out into the outer suburban areas, what you immediately do is add to the cost of living for the people who go out there. Whilst the house prices might be lower, the cost of living is higher and the transport costs of those people getting to their workplace are higher, so the affordability factor is in fact lowered. In addition that, whilst the house price might appear to be lower up front, what inevitably happens is that the infrastructure required to service those new housing allotments has to be borne by someone. Either it is paid up front, as many developers now cost it into the cost of their blocks of land, or it is added on to the council rates, because the councils, under pressure to provide the necessary services and infrastructure required by new homeowners, have to take out loans in order to provide that infrastructure. That in turn means that every year those people in the outlying areas are paying higher council rates because they have to pay for the infrastructure that is required to service their needs. I will use another example of when it quite often does not serve the purpose that it appears to. The example is this: people who live outside the CBD in most capital cities are inevitably further away from most of the services that they rely on. Because they are further away from those services, it costs them money to get there. Of even more concern is that there were people in the northern suburbs of Adelaide-and I expect it would be the same in many other parts of Australia-who were not going to tertiary education or universities because the cost of getting there and the time it took them was making it prohibitive. In other words, it was just compounding the cycle of disadvantage by having people living further out from where all the services were. For all of those reasons, this bill is welcome. It is welcome because it is by no means the simple and only solution to fixing the housing affordability crisis facing Australia. The problem arises because of a number of factors. Therefore-quite properly-there needs to be a number of responses. That is what the Rudd government is doing, with a to $2.2 billion housing affordability package that includes investments in public housing and public infrastructure and tax incentives for housing investments. It is those kinds of initiatives that will ultimately make a difference to the affordability of homes by people in this country. For those reasons I commend the bill to the House.",117
192,Mr BIDGOOD,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I rise to support the government's First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008, which implements Labor's election commitment to introduce first home saver accounts. The government is introducing first home saver accounts to provide a simple, tax effective way for Australians to save for the purchase of their first home in which to live through a combination of low taxes and government contributions. People in my electorate welcome this bill because they know that the option of starting a first home saver account will bring the dream of home-ownership closer to a reality for hundreds of thousands of young Australians. The proposed first home saver accounts are low-tax saving accounts to help Australians realise the dream of home-ownership. Since this government came to office, my electorate office has ironically been flooded with inquiries about the scheme we are introducing today. I am happy to say that the wait will soon be over and that the detail will undoubtedly satisfy those many constituents who have shown a deep interest in this measure. Many people in my electorate aspire to own their own home. It is part of the great Australian dream, whether they aspire to a house or a unit and whether it is in the city or in the great number of suburbs or towns in my electorate. Thanks to the Rudd Labor government implementing yet another election commitment, aspiring home purchasers will have the option and an incentive to save and turn aspiration into reality. This proposed scheme rewards those who save to purchase a home of their own. The government is legislating an attractive deal with the first home saver accounts. We are proudly supporting and encouraging Australians to save for their first home. We in the Labor Party understand that one of the biggest barriers to home-ownership is the saving of the deposit. This bill offers potential first homebuyers saving for a deposit added financial incentive to purchase their first home. I am proud to be part of a government that is introducing into this place measures to boost savings for people in Dawson. I am proud to be part of a government that fulfils every one of its election commitments-and, in this case, has not just fulfilled its commitment but improved it. Working families in my electorate have been doing it tough, having endured 12 straight interest rate rises, with inflation at a 16-year high, and having had 11 years of those opposite spending like drunken sailors, with the member for Higgins asleep at the wheel on the economy and ignoring key investments in infrastructure and skills during an unprecedented minerals boom. In what was to be his final term in office, the former member for Bennelong was more worried about his own legacy than everyday working people. There is finally some good news, finally a decision by a government that will do something about getting money in the bank that will help people to get a key in the door of their first very own home. Homeownership will always be a part of the Australian dream, and the Australian Labor Party understands this. A home saving plan is one part of showing that we understand, but it is our commitment to responsible economic management that will also get more people into their own homes. We are committed to move on and do what members opposite failed to do in the 11 long years they occupied these benches and address our nation's skills shortage, build on our capacity by investing in essential infrastructure such as roads and ports, and invest in our young people by putting money into schools and universities. The budget has proved we are getting on with the job of building and growing the economy to meet the challenges of the 21st century with confidence. This legislation shows that we are serious about delivering for the people of Dawson, serious about encouraging saving and serious about assisting people to own their first home. We are serious about tackling the inflation legacy left by the National and Liberal coalition government. This bill goes above and beyond our election commitment made to the people in November 2007. It takes into account improvements arising now from the consultation process to make the accounts simpler and fairer. In summary, the government will contribute 17c to the dollar up to $5,000 invested in a year into the home saver accounts. This means an individual contributing $5,000 into a home saver account in one year will receive a government contribution of $850. Tax on investments in a first home saver account is capped at 15 per cent, up to an indexed $75,000. By combining own savings, government incentives and tax treatment to boost the deposit, we have made these very attractive accounts for first homeowners, and I know there will be a lot of happy savers in Dawson come 1 October when banking institutions and other eligible finance providers can begin offering first home saver accounts. Through consultation, we have removed the stipulation in the election commitment that there be a $1,000 up-front contribution to open an account, allowing savers the choice of how much money they have to begin saving for their first home. The potential for these accounts to be used for something other than first home purchasing is minimised with the stipulation that any funds not used to purchase a first home must be transferred into superannuation. Flexibility is ensured as people can freely transfer from one first saver fund to another. Savings into home saving accounts are anti inflation, as young people are saving already. Under the scheme, a couple each earning average incomes and saving 10 per cent of their pay would be able to save more than $85,000 after five years of disciplined saving. This up to $14,000 more than what they would have saved otherwise, depending on returns. To conclude, it is estimated that these changes will increase savings in accounts from over $4 billion to around $6.5 billion after four years-a tremendous achievement. On behalf of the people of Dawson, I wholeheartedly endorse these bills.",119
193,Mr SWAN,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"in reply-I want to thank all honourable members who have made a contribution to this debate on the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills. The introduction of the First Home Saver Accounts marks an important new beginning in housing policy in Australia. The accounts will help young Australians to once again realise the dream of home-ownership. Of course, the biggest barrier to home-ownership is saving a large enough deposit. The first home saver accounts will help a couple on average earnings save a deposit of more than $88,000 over five years, which is almost $13,000 more than they otherwise would have been able to. The 17 per cent government contribution together with the low 15 per cent tax rate on earning on a first home saver account will make these accounts attractive to many first homebuyers. Federal Labor's First Home Savers Accounts scheme is also part of our responsible approach to economic management as it encourages young Australians to save some of their hard-earned income. The accounts represent a key plank in the government's root and branch strategy for tackling housing affordability. After 12 years of neglect, housing policy is once again getting the attention it deserves from the Australian government. Contrary to the view of Sussan Ley MP, the member for Farrer and opposition housing spokesperson, the first home saver accounts are supported by other measures which will increase housing supply. These is include: the Housing Affordability Fund, which will increase housing supply by providing money for local infrastructure and giving state and local government incentives to lower development charges; the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which will provide investors with tax incentives to increase the supply of new affordable rental properties across Australia, initially saving 50,000 lowand middle-income families 20 per cent on their rental bills; and a better approach to land release, with all surplus Commonwealth land being freed for housing development or community infrastructure. The start date for the accounts has been delayed until 1 October 2008 to allow providers more time to develop products. But, contrary to the claims of Sussan Ley, first home savers will not be disadvantaged by the deferral as they will still be entitled to the full annual government contribution on the first $5,000 of personal contributions in 2008-09. The former government never took housing seriously. Housing stress mounted and more and more young Australians were locked out of the housing market, but they did nothing about it. Our government has established a Minister for Housing and has acted to introduce the first home saver legislation, demonstrating the importance the government places on housing policy.

197,Mr HARTSUYKER,NATIONAL FUELWATCH,"The government bases its entire case for Fuelwatch on advice given by the ACCC. We know the government decided to take the advice of the ACCC over the advice of four of its own departments. We know that motoring groups such as the RACV and the RAA of South Australia oppose such a scheme. We know that there are question marks as to the constitutionality of the Fuelwatch proposal. But let us take a close look at the ACCC's advice. The ACCC produced its report into unleaded petrol in December 2007. It recommended: ... the arrangements for terminal gate price publication should be reviewed as part of the scheduled review of the Oilcode by the ACCC and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. It recommended: ... a more detailed examination and on-going monitoring of buy-sell agreements to fully assess whether they are exclusionary in nature, or have the purpose or effect of substantially lessening competition ... It recommended: ... Commonwealth and state governments endeavour to align Australian fuel standards with appropriate fuel standards overseas. It recommended: ... a comprehensive audit of terminals suitable for importing refined petrol in Australia. It also recommended: ... following the audit, there ing of the use, leasing and sharing But it did not recommend Fuelwatch. Why was that? The report said about Fuelwatch that there were a number of issues that needed to be resolved before such a scheme went national. These issues were - limitations in the analysis already undertaken that might influence the direction of a recommendation - the effect of a price commitment arrangement on independents - whether regional and country markets are sufficiently competitive to benefit from increased price transparency - the effect of FuelWatch on price cycles and therefore some consumers' ability to predict the days of the week when prices are likely to be relatively low - the dependence on the media to realise the full benefits of a FuelWatch scheme - administrative and compliance costs associated with a national scheme. At that point, it was clear that the ACCC did not support the introduction of a national scheme. The Prime Minister's current position is that the ACCC supports the scheme and that it will save 1.9c per litre based on the experience in Western Australia. Let us look at the regulation impact statement, tabled last week by the Assistant Treasurer. I refer to the impact analysis of option 1, which was to introduce price transparency and price commitment rulesessentially, the Fuelwatch scheme. Paragraph 59 says: It is possible that the introduction of this option may have anti-competitive effects. Whilst consumers may benefit from potentially greater levels of competition and reduced search costs these benefits may be offset by potentially adverse anticompetitive effects. Most importantly, the provision of this taxpayer funded service creates greater opportunities for price coordination amongst retailers, especially in more concentrated be on-going monitor- markets. of terminals ... Paragraph 60 says: Independent petrol retailers provide some evidence that FuelWatch has not enhanced competition in Western Australia and has, in fact, harmed the competitive position of independents as it allows large operators to adopt a strategy of rolling price leaders. Paragraph 61 says: The absence of significant levels of competition in regional and rural petrol retail markets means that consumers in these areas are less likely to benefit from increased price transparency. Paragraph 62 says: This option presents some risk of higher prices in rural and regional areas resulting from the creation of greater opportunities for price coordination … It comes as some relief to read in paragraph 63 that for that reason the national scheme would cover only some 72 per cent of retailers. It will not cover most of rural and regional Australia. Since then we have learnt that the Prime Minister has said that local councils will have the option of taking part. ‘Here's where we stand,' according to the statement tabled by the Assistant Treasurer. It is not a national scheme at all. There is no mention of price reductions. It will not cover most of rural and regional Australia, where people are more dependent on their own transport. At the time the impact statement was written, it seemed clear that some of the ACCC's reservations had been found to be valid as to why a national scheme should not be introduced. Let us turn to the analysis on which all this rests: the analysis which the Treasurer says is so much better than that provided by four government departments. Last week we were given what the Assistant Treasurer described as the comprehensive econometric analysis more recently conducted by the ACCC. But it was not comprehensive at all. What was released by the ACCC and tabled by the Assistant Treasurer was a summary of further analysis-a glorified press release, if you like. No-one can tell from what was released whether it is a convincing analysis or not, but one or two flaws are evident. The ACCC's numbers are based on unweighted averages, not averages based on the volume of fuel sold at a particular price. It is one thing to know the price but it is an entirely different thing to know how many motorists are buying at that price. If FuelWatch in Western Australia is working then more people should be buying at a lower price, but are they? That is a very good question. Let me again quote from the government's own document-the regulation impact statement, tabled by our good friend the Assistant Treasurer. In turn that statement quotes an independent survey of urban consumer perceptions and purchasing practices undertaken in November 2007 by ANOP Research Services. It says: - 72 per cent of consumers in cities other Perth always or usually try to purchase unleaded petrol when its cheapest whilst 59 per cent of consumers in Perth always or usually try to buy petrol when it is cheapest … So in Perth, where FuelWatch has allegedly been such a roaring success and motorists are logging onto the website and speeding off to make an empowered choice, more people are buying expensive petrol. I find that quite confusing. In other cities where motorists have to struggle on without Fuelwatch and, according to the Prime Minister, are at the total mercy of big oil, more motorists are buying cheaper petrol. When you drill down into this phenomenon it becomes a whole lot more interesting. The reasonable man or woman-or the man on the Mount Druitt omnibus-would expect that Perth motorists would be purchasing fuel at the low point of the cycle. They know where the cheap fuel is-they have looked it up on the website. They know a day in advance what the price will be and they know that that price has been locked in for 24 hours. So, according to the Prime Minister and according to the Assistant Treasurer, with all of this immense power and weaponry that FuelWatch has provided, or allegedly has provided, they should be buying cheaper petrol. But, in fact, the rhetoric is not matched by the reality. Let us look at this a little closer. According to figures from August 2007, for example, some 34.5 per cent of motorists in Sydney buy in the lowest percentile band in the fuel cycle. The comparable figure for Perth is only 18.1 per cent. So it is 34.5 per cent in Sydney versus 18.1 per cent in Perth. Let us look at the next percentile band, between 10 and 20 per cent: some 14.9 per cent of motorists in Sydney and only 8.5 per cent in Perth buy in that band. In the third percentile band, between 20 and 30 per cent: in Sydney than some 15.9 per cent of motorists purchase in that band and in Perth only 9.8 per cent do so. So, to summarise those figures, in the lowest 30 per cent of the fuel cycle we have motorists purchasing some 65.3 per cent of their petrol in Sydney as compared to 36.4 per cent in Perth. This is a curious outcome. People in Perth, despite all those factors that we talked about previously-despite being notified a day in advance what the price would be, despite knowing where to get the cheap petrol and despite knowing that that price is locked in-are paying, relatively, a higher price within the fuel cycle. If you do not believe me or the government's own regulatory impact statement that the ACCC's work is unreliable then let us turn to the Institute of Public Affairs and one of its senior fellows, Professor Sinclair Davidson. He has looked at the ACCC analysis published as part of its report into unleaded petrol in December last year and the additional analysis published on 29 May. He said-and this is quite enlightening: The ACCC data has not been released to the public, nor have they been very clear as to what analysis has been done. The ACCC has been vague in reporting their econometric techniques and have simply published tables, expecting the public to accept their analysis on face value … Let us be clear what he is talking about. He is talking about what the Assistant Treasurer described as a ‘comprehensive econometric analysis' by the ACCC when he tabled its report. As I said earlier, it is nothing more than a glorified press release. Professor Davidson also said: - The ACCC analysis is not convincing. - The ACCC analysis remains unconvincing after 29 May-the new analysis is even vaguer than the original analysis released in December 2007. - The ACCC did not test for a “Coles effect” in their December 2007 analysis. - The Coles effect totally dominates the FuelWatch effect. - The ACCC claim to now test for a Coles effect, but do not say what test they tually performed. His own conclusion is: ... it appears that FuelWatch has had no effect on the average monthly price differential in WA relative to the eastern states. What we had in the 2007 report was the unvarnished professional view of the ACCC, which was guarded about the value of Fuelwatch. Only last month, its chairman, Graeme Samuel, told the ABC that Fuelwatch was not about saving motorists money. He said it was a process ‘whereby consumers might be able to shave 1c or 1.5c off their fuel costs'. Then in the words of Professor Davidson we get an even vaguer analysis from the ACCC which purports to support the Prime Minister's claim that it will save 1.9c per litre but, of course, not in rural and regional Australia. What we are now getting from the ACCC is a view that seems to be in a state of evolution. Could it be due to pressure from the Prime Minister, desperately casting round to find evidence to justify his elaborate hoax on the Australian people? His own department does not support it. The Department of Finance and Deregulation does not support it. The Department of Energy, Resources and Tourism does not support it, nor does the department of industry. Here you have the ACCC as the sole defender of the PM's position. As we watch the evolution of this, it is interesting to note my correspondence with Mr Brian Cassidy of the ACCC. It was quite informative. I wrote to Mr Cassidy on 22 April and asked him a very good question. I said: Could the ACCC provide me with the latest data and ACCC analysis regarding Fuelwatch's effectiveness in providing cheaper fuel for motorists and greater transparency in fuel markets? Did Mr Cassidy provide volumes of research, meticulously done, peer reviewed, have acbeyond reasonable doubt? No. When I asked him for the latest report, what did Mr Cassidy send me? He gave me a copy of this-the ACCC's report back in 2007. I asked for the latest data and he sent me what he had last year, the very same report, which was quite surprising. The ACCC is giving the Prime Minister what he wants to hear. Despite advice from four government departments, the ACCC is telling the Prime Minister exactly what he wants to hear. In a telephone conversation as late as the first week of May, I asked Mr Cassidy: Were the results of testing since the cember 2007 more compelling, less compelling or consistent with the results reflected in the report? That was a very good question. He advised me that the results were consistent with the work done in the report. Given these comments and given that the work they have done since they put out the report-a report which did not recommend Fuelwatch-is consistent with the contents of the original report, the way in which the rhetoric of the ACCC is evolving seems curious. It begs the question: in a 380-page report with lots of graphs, tables and thousands of words, why in all of that was there not a recommendation to implement a national Fuelwatch scheme? In the whole of that report, you will find no such recommendation to implement a Fuelwatch scheme, the very centrepiece of the government's attack on petrol prices. It is also interesting to note comments today in the Australian Financial Review which I found most enlightening: The ACCC chairman acknowledged that he and other commission members had criticised the West Australian FuelWatch plan but said the new positiontheir new post-Rudd position, I suspectwas a response to last year's inquiry into petrol prices ... How could that be? They had their opportunity to comment on Fuelwatch in that report and the report did not recommend Fuelwatch. Mr Cassidy has informed me that since that report the data that has been received and developed is consistent with what is in that report. So upon what grounds would they be changing their position? The article goes on: ... which included the first detailed ACCC analysis of petrol prices since the WA scheme was introduced ... ‘Yes, our position changed on a whole range of issues'report of De- there is no doubt about that he told The Australian Financial Review, adding that it would have been a ‘complete and utter waste of time' if the ACCC had gone into the petrol price inquiry with an unmoveable position. We are not so much concerned about what their position was going into the petrol inquiry; what is of more interest is their position coming out of it. The report did not recommend that there be a Fuelwatch scheme, but somehow the ACCC seem to be shifting their position. And the ACCC is yet to answer that good question: if Fuelwatch is so compelling, if the ACCC's findings are as compelling as the Treasurer says they are, why was a proposal or recommendation to incorporate a national Fuelwatch scheme not up in lights as recommendation 1? You would think, as Fuelwatch has been adopted as the centrepiece of the government's proposal to attack fuel prices, that a proposal for a national Fuelwatch scheme would have been recommendation No. 1. The ACCC have not answered that question and the reason is that Fuelwatch is nothing but a fraud. It is nothing but a hoax, nothing but a confidence trick on the Australian people. It is a policy advocated by a Prime Minister, who wants to take pressure off himself rather than taking pressure off families, pensioners, self-funded retirees and carers. It is all about pressure on the Prime Minister; it is not about pressure on average Australians. It is a scheme that will push up the cost of motoring for motorists in regional areas. I speak in particular to the new members opposite. To this point in your parliamentary careers you have been bit players in a carnival of symbolism, but I can tell you that the rubber is going to hit the road now. The people who sent you to Canberra expect better than a scheme that is a fraud and a hoax. The people who sent you to Canberra expect you to fight on their behalf. The people who sent you to Canberra are looking for relief on rol prices. They are looking for a 5c a litre reduction in the fuel excise. They are not looking for a scheme that is nothing more than a fraud or a hoax. The members opposite will be judged. If the new members talk to the old hands they will be told, ‘You don't have to win every fight. Politics isn't like that: you win some, you lose some. Your electors can certainly be understanding about the fights that you do not win. But sure as hell, they will want you to try on their behalf.' And falling in behind the Prime Minister's hoax on Fuelwatch, toeing the party line when motorists are hurting so badly out there, and supporting a scheme to take pressure off the Prime Minister rather than taking the pressure off families is certainly going to win those opposite no credit within their electorates. No doubt if you walk down the main street of any town that you represent there will be few people, if any, who will say to you in all conscience that the Prime Minister is taking real and meaningful action on fuel prices. Fuelwatch is a scheme that will push up the cost of motoring. It is a scheme contrived by the Prime Minister to his benefit, not the benefit of Australians. Why else would he fail to guarantee that motorists would not be worse off? This is nothing but a fraud.",122
198,Ms JACKSON,NATIONAL FUELWATCH,"I am pleased to speak in support of the National Fuelwatch (Empowering Consumers) Bill 2008 and the National Fuelwatch (Empowering Consumers) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. I am especially pleased to do so as a Western Australiansomeone who, unlike the previous speaker, the member for Cowper, has experience with the Western Australian FuelWatch scheme and an understanding of the benefits of it. I have been contacted by fellow sandgropers pet- who have been quite bemused by the recent parliamentary and media debate surrounding Fuelwatch. We are bemused because it would appear that members opposite do not understand how the scheme works and how consumers can benefit from it. The bill's title should make that clear. It is the national Fuelwatch bill and it is about empowering consumers. It is a comprehensive fuel price monitoring and reporting system. It places an obligation on fuel retailers to advise and notify the consumer about the next day's fuel prices. It requires the information to be made public. This, in turn, allows consumers to make informed decisions about the purchase of their fuel. As I have previously said, I am at a loss to discern what the opposition finds so reprehensible about this proposal. The other benefits to consumers, which are set out succinctly in the explanatory memorandum, are also clear. It empowers consumers to make informed decisions about their fuel purchases. It allows consumers to be informed of the lowest price possible for fuel in their local area. It allows consumers to go directly to the retailer in their local area with the lowest or most competitive price, saving the cost of searching for the best deal in town. It allows consumers certainty, and the price of fuel when published will apply for the whole day, eliminating that daily price volatility. Our Western Australian experience demonstrates that this scheme also promotes competition in the retail fuel market. I said earlier that some Western Australians had been bemused by the parliamentary and media debate on Fuelwatch. Let me quote from one email I received from a local Western Australian supporter of FuelWatch after he heard some of this debate on the national media. He said: I've been following the fuel watch debate with interest and have gathered some statistics of my own which demonstrate that fuel watch in WA can be used to save costs on petrol. I watch the fuel cycles and generally try and buy when it is at its lowest point. I will provide figures below which show the average amount I paid per month per litre for fuel in the 10 months from April 2007 to March 2008. Note this includes my 4c per litre discount vouchers which I've indicated below. I will also show the average monthly figure from Fuel Watch. The reason that I have shown 10 months only is that I was on holidays for two months last year. He goes on to list the comparison: Month Avge Fuel Watch April 2007 117.9 124.8 May 2007 123.1 130.2 June 2007 120.8 129.9 July 2007 117.4 126.7 August 2007 111.5 122.7 His list continues: November 2007 123.2 130.5 December 2007 131.57 137.1 January 2008 128.5 138.6 February 2008 128.3 136.1 March 2008 132.7 139.7 As he indicated: I should add that generally I also have a Coles/Woolworths/IGA shopping voucher which gives me an additional 4c per litre discount so to accurately compare my average cost with fuel watchs figure you would need to add 4c per litre to my monthly cost. However, in all cases this is still quite a bit cheaper. I think this demonstrates that if you are prepared to shop around, although the price of petrol is extravagant, you can get it cheaper if you shop wisely. The opposition do not appear to take this into consideration in any of the comments they make. For members opposite, that is a practical example from one consumer in Western Australia who has used FuelWatch to ensure that he buys his fuel at the lowest price possible and, as a consequence, has made substantial savings on the purchase of fuel. He goes on to talk about when he was away for a couple of months, in April-May: Another interesting fact is that in April/May this some year a group of four couples from WA went on a caravanning trip to the eastern states. I might interpose there that we in the west generally refer to everything to our right, on that side of the country, as the ‘eastern states'. He went on: We were amazed to see how the prices for petrol changed so drastically on the one day. A couple of examples are in Ballarat it was 139.5 in the morning and about 150.1 in the afternoon and in Heathcote, just out of Sydney, it was 139.5 at Cost Avge for same about 4pm and 6pm the same day it was 153.5. P/Lt Month That is one practical example, and I thank Chris White for that. Perhaps those comments about the eastern states might explain in some way the lack of understanding of members opposite about how the Fuelwatch scheme is intended to operate. I again thank Chris White for his contribution and I look forward to receiving further information from him on the daily fuel price comparisons if this debate continues. This is a clear example, as I have said, of how consumers can benefit from the Fuelwatch scheme and it also demonstrates in bold terms why I cannot understand the position of members opposite in opposing the Fuelwatch scheme. I have also been critical of the media debate on Fuelwatch and its apparent lack of understanding of the scheme. Again, that may be a reflection of the fact that the majority of national papers and the national debate come from the eastern states-not that my own state's paper can hold its head up high in that regard. But I was pleased to see one article, published on 29 May 2008, from Malcolm Maiden, a writer at the Sydney Morning Herald, because as I read it I thought, ‘Finally, one of our journalist colleagues has got it!' His headline was ‘FuelWatch will put consumers in the driving seat'. Frankly, that is the bottom line: it is about empowering consumers to make informed decisions when they are purchasing their fuel. He talked about the ‘divergent opinions' that had been put to the ACCC, who have conducted the most detailed inquiry into whether or not the WA scheme ‘promoted competition, or stifled it by locking prices up for to 24 hours'. He said: ... the ACCC's report was loaded with caveats, about the absence of demonstrable cause and effect between the scheme and petrol prices, risks associated with the potentially process-heavy cost of a national rollout and its relatively minor influence on petrol prices. But he went on: It nevertheless concluded that FuelWatch was unlikely to hurt petrol consumers and might help them-not just because there was qualified evidence from the West Australian scheme that it worked to push prices down but because the system allowed price discovery, and, for those who work the system to its fullest, about a half a day in which to fill up ahead of posted price rises: score one for the Rudd Government. When you finally understand it, the essence of the scheme is about putting consumers in the driver's seat. It is about promoting competition and transparency in the retail petrol industry. And for those who are feeling the pinch, it empowers them with the opportunity to purchase fuel at the lowest price whenever they choose to purchase that fuel. There has been much criticism about the ACCC report on the FuelWatch scheme, in particular of its assessment of how it operates in Western Australia. I think this is incredibly unfortunate because the criticism seemed to completely omit the fact that the ACCC was the only organisation that undertook substantial econometric analysis of how the scheme works in Western Australia. The ACCC report concluded, in comparing relative prices between Perth and the eastern states before and after the introduction of FuelWatch, that prices in Perth were around 1.9 c per litre less on average for the period January 2001 to June 2007 than for the period August 1998 to December 2000. It seems to me that nobody else has been able to refer to any independent advice that in any way undermines the findings of that ACCC report. I think it is outrageous for the member for Cowper and others opposite to come in here and describe Fuelwatch as a ‘fraud' or a ‘confidence hoax' and to lecture members of the government about why they were sent to Canberra. I will just say this: the people who sent me to Canberra expect me to behave honestly and to hear honesty from me, not rhetoric and populist policy. And I say to members opposite: who benefits if you kill off Fuelwatch? It certainly will not be ordinary consumers in Australia as they go about their business and meet their need to purchase fuel. I do not intend to belabour the point today because I have spoken a couple of times on this matter in debates, including in the matter of public importance debate the other day. I have talked about the popularity of the scheme in Western Australia. The mere fact that it is shown on commercial television during the news broadcasts each night is great evidence of the fact that it is a highly popular scheme in Western Australia, and I think the information I have provided from Mr White demonstrates how an informed consumer is empowered by a scheme like Fuelwatch. I urge members opposite to move on from their rhetoric and their populist posturing and support something which gives consumers in this country real power when it comes to purchasing their petrol.",127
199,Mr DUTTON,NATIONAL FUELWATCH,"I rise to speak on the National Fuelwatch (Empowering Consumers) Bill 2008 and the National Fuelwatch (Empowering Consumers) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. The Labor Party at the last election promised cheaper petrol. Delivering on this promise has become the biggest political headache for this government. These bills have been introduced into parliament on the back of some clever and tricky politics by this Prime Minister. Four key economic departments have advised against the scheme, including his own department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. At least one of the government's ministers has argued against the scheme, and we strongly suspect that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation also argued against this scheme. We also suspect that the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy argued strongly against this scheme. Those departments know that this scheme potentially will result in higher petrol prices for people in the eastern states. Fuelwatch will undoubtedly make consumers worse off as the smart consumers who take advantage of the weekly discounted specials will no longer have that opportunity. Fuelwatch reduces price certainty. Outside of WA consumers know when petrol is cheapest. They do not know that to be the case when it occurs in Western Australia. The data published in the report of the ACCC inquiry in December 2007 into the price of unleaded petrol shows that the petrol markets in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide operate in a very similar manner. The cheapest day to buy petrol is Tuesday when around 20 to 24 per cent of petrol is sold. The most expensive day is Thursday when around 10 to 12 per cent of petrol is sold. Almost two-thirds of petrol was sold on the four days where the average daily prices were below the average weekly price. Perth has a much flatter and longer cycle, which does appear to make Perth motorists worse off. The average volume sold each day was relatively stable. Due to the two-week cycle, it is not obvious which days each week are cheapest, although on average Wednesday is the most expensive and Sunday is the cheapest. More importantly though, 40 per cent of petrol was sold on the three days when average prices were below the weekly average, and 60 per cent was sold on the four days when prices were above the average. That is a salient point and it needs to be reiterated. In Perth 60 per cent of petrol was sold on the four days where prices were above the average. In the eastern states-that is, in the markets of Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide-the cheapest day is Tuesday, when around 20 to 24 per cent of petrol was sold, but two-thirds of petrol was sold on the four days when the average daily prices were below the average weekly price. That is a remarkable statistic and it is something that this government has chosen to ignore. The regulatory impact statement that was released with the bill raises at least 10 areas of concern over the scheme, including the following: firstly, independent Western Australian retailers suggest that FuelWatch has harmed the competitive position of independent operators as it allows large operators, including refiner-marketers, to gain a competitive advantage through their great capacity to adopt sophisticated pricing strategies across different metropolitan markets; secondly, that the ACCC analysis is not conclusive; thirdly, it is possible that the introduction of Fuelwatch-this is the advice from the regulatory impact statement-will have anticompetitive effects, and whilst consumers may benefit from potentially greater levels of competition and reduced search costs, these benefits may be offset by potential adverse anticompetitive effects. This advice was provided in the regulatory impact statement that was tabled in parliament with this legislation last Thursday. It is interesting to note as part of this debate that, when I asked the Minister for Finance and Deregulation in question time some two hours before the tabling of the legislation, his very clear advice to me was that the regulatory impact statement would not be tabled. What this demonstrates is a government full of hubris and arrogance, a government that is staring in the face the facts of this matter, and that is that they have received advice from those four key economic departments and the initial advice from the ACCC that this was not a good scheme for consumers. It is amazing when you read through the detail of the regulatory impact statement to see the length of their criticism of this legislation before the parliament. It demonstrates that this is a government which is intent on providing spin over substance. They are more concerned with the media cycle than they are with the petrol cycle. They are more concerned with what journalists think than with what Australians who fill up at the bowsers think. The average family, for whom it now costs $100 to fill the family Commodore, will remember back to November only a few short months ago, when the Prime Minister-the then opposition leader-promised the Australian people that he would bring lower petrol prices to them and therefore some relief to their family household budget. How deceived those people must feel today. Not only must Australian motorists feel deceived; so too must business and particularly small independent retailers in the petrol sector, who must be wondering why on earth the government has arrived at such a disastrous position. We also understand from the regulatory impact statements and the advice from Treasury, the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and other departments that it will cost businesses up to $4,000 annually to comply with the Fuelwatch legislation-or $18.7 million per annum. The coalition supports-and there is no question about it-consumers being armed with as much information as possible to assist them to purchase cheaper petrol. There is no question about that. That is a stated aim of the coalition. We will support consumers to ensure that they can find the cheapest petrol, but we do not support the price-fixing elements of the Fuelwatch scheme. That is the stark difference between where we stand on this issue and where the ALP stands. They have chosen a quick fix political stunt. They have chosen to let down the motorists they promised during the election campaign last year to support with cheaper petrol prices. And at the moment they are being found out as the opportunists they truly are. The other interesting part to the debate is the backflip of the ACCC, so much so that there is no doubt in my mind that the ACCC has felt the government breathing down its neck to support the Fuelwatch scheme. Nobody can explain the stark difference in the ACCC's position between December of last year and this current debate. It is something that we need to examine further and it is something we would like some more information on. Debate interrupted. NA Australian Election Observer GroupConstituent Assembly Election",130
200,Mr BUTLER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the delegation of the Australian Election Observer Group to the Constituent Assembly Election in Nepal on 10 April 2008. May I also acknowledge the presence of His Excellency Mr Yogendra Dhakal, the Nepalese Ambassador to Australia. Namaste. From the perspectives of stability, prosperity, peace and democracy in our region, this is an incredibly important election, and I feel privileged to have led the Australian observer delegation to Nepal to observe it. Nepal is a country not greatly different in size to Australia, with about 27 million people, and is blessed like us with some of the world's most spectacular natural resources. Historically, in more recent times, Nepal has been either a British colony or an absolute monarchy but over the course of the 1990s was able to hold three multiparty elections. At the same time, though, it is true to say that unrest over economic issues and the ongoing role of the monarchy sparked an insurgency led by the Maoists, which is said to have resulted in about 13,000 deaths over the last decade. This election flows from the peace agreement concluded between the Maoists and the Nepalese government in late 2006-a peace agreement that included a ceasefire between the warring parties and agreement to conduct an election for a constituent assembly. After some postponements of that election over the course of the last year in particular, there a final agreement reached between the Maoists and the Nepalese government which finally cleared the path for that election place in April. Australia was one of 12 or so countries, as well as the European Union, that was sent to observe that election under the auspices of UNMIN and the Nepalese electoral commission. There were also a number of non-government organisationsnotably the Carter Centre, the National Democratic Institute, ANFREL and a range of other organisations from Asia. In all, there were over 900 international observers and about 90,000 domestic observers accredited and trained by the electoral commission. The Australian group broke into four teams and was able to observe over 90 booths on the day. I will quote quickly from the statement issued by that group shortly after returning to Australia: The Australian teams observed no apparent restriction on the ability to vote at the booths visited by the teams. Indeed, in many booths, votes were cast with obvious enthusiasm. Booths observed by the teams were staffed and attended by effective and dedicated polling officials and national observers. The Australian teams observed no significant or systematic abuses or malpractice in the voting process. The group's assessment is that voters at the booths observed by the Australian teams were able to exercise their right to vote in a free and fair manner. Given the background to this election, it was a very successful election indeed. In spite of a ban on vehicle traffic, including bicycles, on the day, turnout was over 60 per cent-a turnout that puts the American presidential elections to shame. In spite of very serious concerns about violence and intimidation that might have taken place on polling day, the election was, in the circumstances, conducted peacefully. There were also very notable and perhaps surprising results, given the estimation made by pundits, in that the Maoists won a pretty handsome victory. I am was happy to also say that one-third of the new constituent assembly members are women. The constituent assembly has already met, to take the monarchy has been abolished-again, beating Australia to that-and the constituent assembly now has two years to agree on a new system for democratic elections to take place after that time. This is a new beginning for Nepal. It is true that there are still many challenges, such as the decommissioning of the Maoist militia and its integration with the Nepal army, ongoing unrest in the Terai and-most importantly-endemic poverty. Nepal is one of the 10 poorest countries in the world. But Nepal has wonderful opportunities as well. Stability and peace should see tourism blossom. Its natural assets present huge potential in hydropower. In closing, I thank my fellow delegation members, particularly the member for Bowman and Dr Chris Drury from the Electoral Commission, as well as the staff from the Australian embassy-Ambassador Graeme Lade, Elizabeth Morris, Kumudh Gurung, Rajesh Tuladhar, Peter Morris and Angela Tierney. We wish the Nepalese constituent assembly all the very best.",131
201,Mr LAMING,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I would also like to endorse those words on the tabling of the report on the constituent assembly election held on 10 April in Nepal. I also acknowledge the presence of the Nepalese Ambassador to Australia and his first secretary and also the many Nepalese Australians who are watching from home on what is a very important two weeks in Nepal's history. In adding to the words of the member for Port Adelaide, I would only go back a little further in history to point out extraordinary path to democracy that Nepal has taken. Many would realise that Nepal is flanked on its two major borders by two superpowers-excusing Bhutan, who also shares a border with Nepal. Effectively, the struggle between those two nations has shaped so much of Nepal's history, and their determination not only to remain independent but also to strive towards democracy is something that needs to be remarked upon in this House. It goes back to a constant struggle between the king and the attempt to have a people's movement. That has fluctuated a number of times, including a non-party arrangement for nearly 30 years between 1959 and 1989. Also, in 2001, the very tragic moment that the world would be aware of led to further tumult in the royalty. At the same time, from 1996 onwards, the Maoist movement-the Communist Party of Nepal-cost 12,000 Nepalese lives in their struggle to make Nepal a republic. The lesson for all of us here is that democracies take different paths on their journeys, and those journeys are never over. But Nepal in particular is a lesson for the international community that there is no one simple formula for democracy. That is a lesson for the major powers involved in democracy and governance around the world. Nepal is a classic example. We saw not only significant concessions made to the parties to bring them to the table, but also significant nervousness about whether that was the prudent thing to do. With the external parties-the observer missions and UNMIN itself-and the Nepalese Election Commissioner, who took significant risks, even though there were two false starts last year, ultimately it transpired that this extraordinarily successful election exceeded everyone's expectations. When you visit a country just prior to an election there is always that trepidation and that uncertainty. Coupled with that was a the complete misunderstanding in the general sentiment of how the people of Nepal would vote. The result was a complete shock to almost every election observer, even those who had been aware of Nepalese politics for decades. There was concern at having a 23point agreement and a seven-party arrangement after the comprehensive peace accord of November 2006, but in the end it all pulled together. There was uncertainty around cantonment of the Maoist rebels, of confining to barracks the Nepalese army, and whether that agreement would hold. In the end it was a number of groups: the armed police force; the Nepalese police, who are unarmed; the volunteer police; and of course the huge number of observers both from within Nepal and from overseas who were able to see this complex transaction occur almost without a hitch. We note that one candidate and a small number of election helpers were killed in the days leading up to the election. But the big picture across those 75 districts-some of the most remote and beautiful parts of the world-was the overt and obvious enthusiasm to vote. For anyone coming from a democracy to see that enthusiasm is really encouraging. For Nepal the future is that they now have a people's constituency that can have parliamentary functions and also design a new constitution for the country. The transition, with the completion of the royalty's reign last week, will, hopefully, remain a smooth one. The unexpected result does now mean that there are some potential coalition and multiparty arrangements that will occur between the Communist Party Maoists, the United Marxist Leninists and the Nepal Congress Party, which has a long history of democratisation in Nepal. That is all before us and the world will be watching as Nepal enters a new stage of its democratic path, a new stage in its relationship with Australia, and it is one that everyone in this chamber will support. NA Economics Committee",133
202,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia Annual Report 2007 (first report), together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",134
203,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics is responsible for scrutinising the Reserve Bank of Australia and for ensuring its transparency and accountability to the parliament, the community and the financial sector. The RBA governor's appearance before the committee at biannual public hearings is an important element of the bank's accountability. So too is the Rudd government's initiative in making sure that the utes of those hearings are published and that the decision of the Reserve Bank is announced on the day. It is also important to note that legislation that has passed through this House and is with the Senate in relation to the appointments of the Reserve Bank is part of this scheme of increasing the transparency of the Reserve Bank and its operations. The upward trend in inflation has prompted the Reserve Bank of Australia to increase the official cash rate to 7.25 per cent-up 75 basis points since the former committee met with the bank in August 2007. The RBA has increased the cash rate 12 times since 2001, a total of 100 basis point increase from 8 August 2007, which was yet another strong year for the Australian economy, with growth of more than four per cent over the year to the December quarter. Domestic demand expanded by 5.5 per cent. The RBA's forecasts for inflation indicate that underlying inflation should start moderReport ating from June 2009 and reach 2.75 per cent by December 2010. The CPI rose by 1.3 per cent in the 2008 March quarter, lifting the year-ended rate to 4.2 per cent. The underlying inflation rate increased by 1.2 per cent in the March quarter, taking the year-ended rate to 4.2 per cent. It is interesting that we see this analysis by the Reserve Bank in relation to the pressures that we have with inflation because we have members opposite telling us that inflation is nothing more than a charade, a fairytale or it does not exist. This prompted some questioning of the Reserve Bank governor as to what would actually happen if inflation were to be ignored. What would happen if we took the position of the opposition and ignored entirely the problem of inflation, as the former government did despite 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank? The governor's response minwas unequivocal. He said, ‘Ultimately you end up with higher interest rates.' That is right: ultimately you end up with higher interest rates if inflation is ignored. Another area where there was considerable debate and questions was in relation to the labour market and the effect that Work Choices may have had on the economy. The governor was asked how productivity is best achieved. His answer was: ‘Why take a whole bunch of things out of the equation? Let them sort it all out as widely as possible. You also have to have fairness in the system. These are considerations that need to be kept in mind, as everyone knows.' When asked about signs of wage pressure in relation to what might happen now that Work Choices has been dismantled, Mr Stevens said, ‘The labour market has performed very well in adjusting to the nature of the shock.' So he was quite clear that the demise of the unfair and unjust Work Choices was not going to have a major effect on wage pressures and that narrowing the issues on which people could bargain was not in the best interests of increasing productivity. Finally, I would like to acknowledge and thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Glenn Stevens, and the other representatives for appearing on 4 April; Mr Kieran Davies, who provided a private briefing; Steven Boyd, the committee's secretary and all of his staff; and the other members of the committee. The next hearing with the RBA will be held on 8 September 2008 in Melbourne. The public hearing in September will be an opportunity for the RBA to report on the most recent data. The committee will use this opportunity to continue to scrutinise the RBA over its conduct of monetary policy and see the most up-to-date forecasts for inflation, growth and interest rates.  as Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Economics to speak to the Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2007 (first report). This was an interesting report, as you have just heard from the chair, the member for Dobell, because this was the first time that the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and senior colleagues had had the opportunity to be questioned by the Australian parliament following the election last year. Of course it was during that election that the current government promised to lower the cost of petrol, to cut the cost of groceries and to lower home loan interest rates, and we all know now as a matter of history that, since the Rudd Labor government was elected, all three of those things have in fact gone up. The report is a detailed report and it has been tabled, but I would like to focus on two issues in the report if I could. The first one is the nonsense that the Labor Party and particularly the Treasurer have been peddling about the inflation genie being out of the bottle. Even today in question time we heard the Prime Minister talking about the inflation monster. So the genie has now been converted and is now a monster. I asked the governor a very direct question. I said: Some people have said that ‘the inflation genie is out of the bottle'. The plain meaning of an expression or a phrase such as that is that something, if you like, is out of control, off and running, cannot be controlled, cannot be fixed-it is all over the place. My question to you is: would you agree that inflation is out of control? I got a very interesting answer from the governor. He said. I do not want to comment on colourful things that are said in public debate, but what we have said is inflation has risen and that is a problem. It has to be dealt with and we are dealing with it. We will contain it and it will come down. Is it out of control? No, I have never said that. I have tried, if you like, to make balanced comments that one cannot say that there is not a problem. There is a problem, but I do not think it is out of control. So we have the Prime Minister calling it a monster, we have the Treasurer saying the genie is out of the bottle, but the Governor of the Reserve Bank has said that inflation is not out of control. The other aspect that I want to particularly touch on-and we heard the chairman of the committee continue to peddle this fallacy just a minute ago-is about the 20 so-called warnings. This is a very interesting line that the Labor Party continues to try to run. Again I asked the Governor of the Reserve Bank a particular question. I asked: Could you outline to the committee what warnings you have issued to the current government? The governor said: Warnings about what in particular? I then said: Have you issued any warnings to the current government? The governor said: I am not sure what we mean by ‘issuing warnings'. We meet with the Treasurer monthly, as has long been the tradition, and talk about the economy and the various risks it faces. I do not think that would qualify as: ‘Treasurer, I am warning that you've got to do this or that.' Most of our conversations with governments over the years have not been of that sort of nature. They are an exchange of information and opinion about what is happening, what issues may be arising and how we are thinking about things. I then asked: Did you issue any warnings to the previous government? That was the previous Liberal-National coalition government. Mr Stevens said: About? I said: Well, did you issue any warnings to the previous government? We have just heard the chair of the committee say that there were 20 warnings, and this is what the Governor of the Reserve Bank said to my question about whether he issued any warnings to the previous government: I cannot recall us writing a document saying, ‘We warn you of X,' if that is what you mean. So the Governor of the Reserve Bank is on the Hansard record as saying that there were no warnings issued to the previous government; yet we have the Prime Minister running out there peddling this line. We have the Treasurer and even the chairman of the committee five minutes ago saying that the previous government ignored 20 warnings when the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia said in Hansard that the Reserve Bank did not issue any warnings whatsoever.",134
204,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allocated for statements on this report has expired. Does the member for Dobell wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,136
205,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report.,136
206,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 39, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report",136
207,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the Defence annual report 2005. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",136
208,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, I appreciate the call and your assistance this evening to enable me to stand here on behalf of the committee. This review of the Defence annual report of 2005-06 was undertaken by the Defence Subcommittee in the 41st Parliament-that is, the previous parliament. Due to the 2007 election the committee's deliberations on this report were interrupted and its finalisation has occurred since the election as part of this, the 42nd Parliament. The current committee did not feel it was therefore necessary to seek new evidence or to conduct additional hearings prior to considering and tabling this review, although I should point out that the committee did in fact consider the draft at its meetings isfy itself of the contents. The committee in this, the 42nd Parliament, is now focused on the review of the Defence annual report 2006-07, which has been adopted as an inquiry and for which public hearings are set down in June and July. Given, of course, that much of the work was done in the 41st parliament, it would be appropriate for me to acknowledge the work of the members of that committee-in particular, the member for Maranoa, who chaired the committee in the last parliament, and a number of our former colleagues who are no longer in parliament for one reason or another. At the risk of offending some, I gle out Graham Edwards, who was a very active member of the defence committee in the previous parliament, and indeed the one before that, and a Vietnam veteran who was well respected on both sides of the chamber. This report provided the opportunity for the committee to look at a number of the major areas of defence operations. There were five major topics reviewed by the committee during the course of the inquiry, particularly in the previous parliament. Those five areas were the Proliferation Security Initiative-the PSI-the Navy's patrol boat capability, the Remuneration Reform Project, the Army's current and future projects, and Army aviation. The report includes two recommendations. The first is that the committee recommends that an invitation be extended to Defence Subcommittee members to observe and/or participate in the next Pacific Protector exercise hosted by Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that Defence has traditionally been very reasonable in extending to members of this parliament and the committee the opportunity to participate in exercises of that kind, and I am sure that the Defence Force would welcome the opportunity to extend to members of the parto satliament the opportunity to observe and, where appropriate, participate in these exercises as well. The committee also recommended that Defence report to the Defence Subcommittee on the implementation of the HNA and ELF programs, with a focus on the delivery schedule of the additional battalions. Those two acronyms stand for Hardened and Networked Army and Enhanced Land Force. Both of those are particularly important initiatives that have been undertaken. The hardening of the Army was an issue that I know the outgoing Chief of Army had strong motivation for. General Peter Leahy was certainly very keen to pursue that sin- agenda over his tenure as Chief of Army. Although that was a recommendation of the committee in the last parliament, as chair of the Defence Subcommittee in this parliament, I am quite sure members would want to maintain an involvement with those areas, and I anticipate that during the hearings we have on the 2006-07 annual report we will hear a little bit about the hardening of the Army as we conduct those inquiries (Extension of time granted). I will take a little bit of the additional time to make a couple of extra comments. At the outset I acknowledged the contribution of the member for the Maranoa, particularly in the previous parliament. I understand he is unable to participate in the debate",136
209,Unknown,COMMITTEES,Opposition members interjecting,138
210,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"I see, he is in the other place. The inquiry into the Defence annual report 2005-06, which is the subject of the committee's report that is tabled here today, was assisted by the ready availability of senior Defence personnel. The Chief of the Defence Force has cooperated and made himself available, for which the committee is very grateful. I know that Angus Houston has, over the many postings he has had in Defence, been very supportive of the defence committee and willing to assist wherever he can. The Acting Secretary of Defence and a range of other senior Defence personnel also made themselves available. The committee has enjoyed the cooperation of senior Defence personnel and, I have to say, the committee has also enjoyed the bipartisan nature with which defence inquiries of this kind are conducted. I look forward to sometime, perhaps later this year, tabling the annual report review 2006-07. The committee has been some time in delivering the 2005-06 report. That can be a factor of the sittings of the parliament and the workload on the committee. On this occasion it was exacerbated by the timing of the election. Nonetheless, it is an important part of the parliamentary process for key department annual reports to be reviewed by bipartisan committees. Although it has taken some time for the 2005-06 report to find its way here, I am very pleased to be able to present it to the parliament on behalf of the committee.",138
211,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted for statements has concluded. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2008 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Billson.,138
212,Mr BILSON,INTERACTIVE GAMBLING,"Dunkley) (8.58 pm)Gambling is a popular activity. In Australia around 80 per cent of the adult population gambles, and half of these gamble at least once a week. Lotteries and instant scratchies are the most popular forms of gambling, with 60 per cent participation, followed by pokies at 38 per cent and betting on the races at 24 per cent. However, most Australians would not be aware that they have a greater chance of being killed by lightning-one in 1.6 million-than of winning Powerball, which is a one in 54.9 million possibility. Australians spent more on gambling, around $16 billion, in 2003-04 than on their own health, at $13 billion. Nearly 300,000 Australians have significant gambling problems. Problem gamblers lose a staggering $3.5 billion annually or, on average, $12,000 each. It is estimated that there are around 1,600 gambling related divorces annually and between 35 and 60 Australians commit suicide for each year due to their problem gambling. New technologies will have a profound and increasing impact on gambling patterns and experiences. We need to act to address these new problem gambling risks. The opposition is concerned about the despair, economic and emotional hardship and the real life impact on families and their futures that results from problem gambling. The Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2008 seeks to amend the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 to address a new gambling threat-a new powerful, insidious and potentially pervasive form of gambling. This is a practical and meaningful action to address the genuine community concern about the impact, omnipresence and, for too many, overwhelming influence of gambling in Australia. The bill seeks to prohibit the roll-out of new gambling technology in the form of subscription television based interactive gambling. It rejects the suggestion by proponents and gambling revenue addicted state Labor governments that this new form of gambling is no big deal-it is just another convenience inspired baby step beyond the abundant gambling opportunities currently available. The bill makes its absolutely clear that limited exemption to current interactive gambling prohibitions, permitting wagering over the phone or internet, does not allow for interactive subscription television gambling with all of the sounds, sights and stimuli of race day in the family lounge room. The bill also obliges the Rudd Labor government to conduct an open and extensive examination of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001, including wide public consultation, to ensure it can adequately address new gambling and converging technologies and reflects contemporary community standards concerning interactive gambling. The review aims to ensure that the Commonwealth law reflects current best practice, international research and knowledge about problem gambling and linkages to particular kinds of gambling and embraces protections and effective safeguards against problem, excessive, underage and unlawful gambling. The 30 June 2009 reporting date provides ample time to consider how best to use new and emerging technologies to negate the risk, prevalence and consequences of problem gambling. The duty on the minister to provide a copy of the review report to both houses of parliament will ensure that legislators can consider whether the regulatory framework is sufficiently robust to cope with technological change, innovation and convergence. This is all about recognising, understanding and getting ahead of the impact of new and emerging gambling technologies and their consequences. Contrast the practical political leadership and clear, decisive and tangible action of the opposition with the inaction and political deception of the Rudd Labor government. Instead, Prime Minister Rudd has sat back, happy that his spin and deception generated the desired ‘War on Pokies' newspaper headlines to secure a typical Labor ‘optics' outcome of appearing to care and take action, while actually doing the nothing practical or of substance. Turning a blind eye may have kept the Rudd government sweet with their state Labor mates when the pending introduction of subscription TV gambling was revealed earlier this year, but the Prime Minister and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Stephen Conroy, cannot continue to refuse to lift a finger while a new lucrative and highly addictive form of gambling with serious and significant known risks is rolled out despite the Commonwealth having clear powers to stop it. Pay TV gambling has begun in Victoria with racing, but many suspect it is just a matter of time before pressure mounts to extend interactive betting on football codes, other sports and even in virtual casinos. The gambling industry describes interactive TV gambling as an ‘exciting fledgling market'. Pay TV gambling presents a new danger to problem gamblers and will also provide an easy and tempting introduction to gambling to teenagers, where they will not even have to leave the couch. You can lose your shirt without having to put one on. The US Office of Substance Abuse and the British Medical Association have both recognised and warned about the additional risks associated with remote interactive gambling. Its availability and accessibility, solitary and hidden nature and appeal to socially inhibited, vulnerable and escapist gamblers give rise to these risks. Similarly, the 2004 review of the operations of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 expressed concern that interactive gambling, including television based platforms would potentially normalise aberrant behaviour and exacerbate the social harm associated with problem gambling -(Time expired) Bill read a first time.",138
213,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTERACTIVE GAMBLING,"In accordance with standing order 41, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Genetically Modified Crops",140
214,Mr BROADBENT,INTERACTIVE GAMBLING,"I move: That the House: (1) urges the Australian Government to act to restrict any further planting of genetically modified crops in Australia, the use of genetically modified products in the manufacture of food in Australia and the sale in Australia of food products containing genetically modified material until a full, independent, scientific investigation is carried out to determine: (a) the level of risk to health of foodstuffs containing genetically modified organisms; and (b) the threat of contamination posed by genetically modified crops already planted under relaxed provisions in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria to crops and the food chain as it relates to stock production in general on neighbouring properties; and (2) calls on the Australian Government, in considering its course of action, to take sideration the commitments made by the current Prime Minister on this issue in the lead up to the 2007 Federal Election.",140
215,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTERACTIVE GAMBLING,Is the motion seconded? Mr Wood-I second the motion.,140
216,Mr BROADBENT,INTERACTIVE GAMBLING,"I respond to two things in this motion. The first is representations from my constituency, which are always very important to all members of this House on both sides. The second is a profound disappointment with regard to genetically modified products and crops which the community that I have met with in the last few weeks believed the federal government had promised to them before the election. That promise is unfulfilled. It is not fulfilled. It was a profound disappointment in the community, but we began a process after the representations, and what a process and what a journey that turned out to be. That journey was one of consultation with my community. The journey was one of not driving the process but listening to the community as they came to their elected member and spoke to me about the issues that were of concern to them. Those people were keen that we take a direct interest. In this whole process there was not only I who took the journey but also my staff. I have never mentioned my staff before, but Ken Mitchell, Jennifer Paproth, Kevin Carmody, Margaret Burridge and Millie Maclean took an interest in this whole process of consultation about genetically modified crops and the concerns that our community has. Who did we meet with? Of course, we went not just to a town hall for a visit but into the kitchens and the homes and onto the beef farms and the dairy farms. We met with live- people from all walks of life and with all sorts of characters. From Kardella to Tarwin Lower, we met with interested parties. I said I would not drive the process, but I was keen into conthat, if it were going to be a worthwhile process, it be driven by the participants: Jessica Harrison, Bev Mustchin, Robert Vickers, Yvonne MCRae, Elly Wishart, Jo Hogan, Mary, Lyn Chambers, Syd White, Lee Storti, Jim Seabrook, Brian Enborn and Colin and Jenny Dowel, who had a great story about their own dairy farm. They found that they had calf losses that were not usual to their 120-year-old dairy stud farm, so they began to look at the changes that had taken place on the property and the changes they needed to make to look after the farm in a more natural way. They have completely reversed the loss of their calves on that property. It is a great story. We met with Julie-Anne Trease-her interest in sustainable agriculture extends to the leadership group that I spoke to a few weeks ago-councillors like Nigel Hutchinson-Brooks, Meredith and Gil Freeman of Kardella, Becky Banks, Rosemary and Graeme Trease, Suzanne Wightman, John Beamish, Ron and Bev Smith, on their organic dairy farm down at Fish Creek, Shelley Riddle, Bernice Mook, Emma Mook, Tim and Liz Farrell, Sue Svenson, Carylon Johns, Jackie Dargaville, Rob Roberson, and Shane and Ann Bundy. What an experience it was to go to Shane and Ann's beef farm and to listen to their presentation. It is important as we raise the issue to what the constituents are saying. When we came to this place for ‘Science meets Parliament' we met some very pro GM professors. Immediately, we asked them to return to the electorate with us. We said to the professor from Monash: ‘Come with us back to the electorate. Come with us to a vegetable property on the peninsula.' We probably should have told Greg Hunt before we went down there. We said: ‘Come with us. Look at how we grow the vegies and then meet the people who have these concerns.' We went from the peninsula all the way down to the Koonwarra Sustainable Communities Centre at Koonwarra and met with another 30 people. We had interaction between the scientists and the people so that their concerns could go straight to the scientists. On that day, Robert Shepherd actually joined us. He was in his lab at Monash University with his white jacket on and I said, ‘There is a seat in the car for you; do you want to come?' He hopped straight in the car and came with us for the day. It was really great to have someone that young with us. I have to say that meeting those amazing young honours students at Monash University working in this area of gene technology was a great eye-opener for me. Where are we now on the election promises? One of the questions was: why was the issue of gene technology and chemical residue regulation or public health systems excluded from the scope of the inquiry that the government has set up and which the minister has described as a major independent review of Australia's quarantine and biosecurity arrangements? The message here was that the community believes that the federal government had made a promise to them for a wide-ranging review of the whole GM process-how it affects our soils, how it will affect the interaction between farms. We have written a report on this and it will come hear out of the office once it is cleaned up. The issue is: where are we going with this whole issue and why wasn't it included in this review that the government has set up? It is called a major independent review of Australia's quarantine and biosecurity arrangements, but we have had comments like this from people like Dr Rosemary Stanton on Crikey on 29 February: Nick Evans, editor of BioTechnology News.net complains that opposition to GM foods is coming from a “hodgepodge of dieticians, geomorphologists, epidemiologists and anti-gm activists”. As a nutritionist who has called for transparency and more appropriate testing of the current crop of GM foods, he may well be including me in his “hodge podge”. In fact, I have repeatedly stated that I am not against GM technology as such. Like three of his four “hodge-podge” groups, I am a scientist, and as a scientist, I object to the method of restricting tests on the current GM crops by claiming they are “substantially equivalent” to other crops and allowing only industryfunded testing (independent scientists have great difficulty obtaining GM seeds for testing). For all we know GM foods may be entirely safe. They obviously don't kill you, but the fact that the current crops have been released without adequate testing and are unlabelled (so the poor epidemiologists would have little hope of trace any ill effects) means we have no scientifically valid evidence to make such an assumption. Why are GM companies so against independent scientific testing? There is a place here for the scientists on one side and the scientists on the other side to come together so that people like me who are not scientists in any of these fields can try to get an understanding of where we are at. Rosemary Stanton also asked, ‘Why was this left out of Australia's quarantine and biosecurity review? It is a major review and it was left out.' The chefs of Australia have come out and said in an article titled ‘Chefs boiling mad over GM foods': More than 50 of the country's top chefs, including Neil Perry and Kylie Kwong, have signed a GM Free Chefs' Charter to protest against the introduction of genetically modified food crops to Australia. They called on the NSW and Victorian governments to reverse their position on growing GM canola and demanded thorough labelling of all food products that contained GM ingredients. Chefs have also said: In the US and the EU, and across the world the great growth area is in clean, green food products. We believe that it is not wise to give up our global, unrestricted GM free marketing advantage, particularly when the long term implications of GM food manufacture and consumption are not yet known. Then we go to the Western Australian Premier, who was so concerned about it. In ‘Gene Ethics backs WA Government call on GM foods', it said: The GM giants must prove their GM products are safe before they reach the shelves, so FSANZ should stop all GM food approvals until real safety tests rule out allergies, damage to vital organs and links to cancer. As Premier Carpenter says it is ‘unbelievable and unacceptable' that FSANZ relies mostly on GM company data to say GM foods are safe to eat. There is a real concern about the control of seeds across the world. Who owns the seeds? If you look at the price of Roundup and some fertilisers and how they are controlled around the world-I know you will blame China and India for the use of those-the prices have gone up. The price of Roundup has gone up so substantially in such a short time and it is owned by one company. As we went on the road, it was hard for us to discern what was truth and what was not. But we did realise this was a grassroots issues for people with genuine concerns. It is up to me and every other member of this House to address those concerns. If I as member do not stand up for those people, I ask you, who will? (Time expired)",140
217,Mr BIDGOOD,INTERACTIVE GAMBLING,"I rise to speak against the motion moved by the member for MCMillan. The government recognises there is concern in the community about the safety of GM crops and food and about the adequacy of Australia's regulatory processes. I would like to assure the House that Australia has robust frameworks for regulating GM crops and food and for ensuring that risks to human health or the environment are identified and managed. The national framework for management and regulation of gene technology, which came into effect in 2001, includes: the Gene Technology Agreement, which was signed by the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments in 2001; the Gene Technology Act; the Gene Technology Ministerial Council; and the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator and its current powers. This framework regulates the use of gene technology by identifying risks posed by or as a result of gene technology and by managing those risks through regulating the use of gene technology. The Gene Technology Regulator assesses all applications for approval of GM crops to ensure that any risks to human health and the environment have been identified and can be managed. Approvals are based on rigorous science, and the regulators will examine all available information when undertaking assessments. The regulation of GM foods and organisms, including GM crops, involves all Australian governments, overseen by the Gene Technology Ministerial Council and the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council. Food Standards Australia New Zealand has rigorous and transparent processes for assessing the safety of GM foods, undertaken in accordance with internationally established scientific principles and guidelines. I am advised that this includes a rigorous process of peer review. I would also like to assure the House that the government supports the existing national framework for management and regulation of gene technology and that the government believes the current regulatory framework provides adequate safeguards to assess and consider environmental and food safety risks. I also remind the House that GM crops and the protective framework in place have the support of the bulk of industry. Perhaps the member for MCMillan has not consulted widely enough with the industry on this issue. The industry is certainly not saying to stop planting. Canegrowers, the peak body that represents 80 per cent of Queensland's sugar cane growers-sugar cane being an important industry in my electorate of Dawson-support GM use. This is what Chairman Alf Cristaudo had to say on 27 August 2007: As an industry that embraces innovation and best practice in our farming systems it is appropriate that we have a strategy within the sugar industry to promote the introduction of GM canes. The new technologies promise to deliver lower costs and higher production using less inputs, providing gains for growers and the environment. I have had consultations with Canegrowers Proserpine Chairman, Peter Quod; Canegrowers Inkerman District Manager, Jim Collins; and Canegrowers Mackay Chairman, John Eden. They all spoke to me about the positive future of cane, about the need for them to have the science available to produce the best crop and about getting the best possible crop returns now and into the future. They spoke about value-adding to the industry, including producing fibre from the crop and the future of furfural. They all speak about the long term, and under a Rudd Labor government the sugar industry will have a long term, whether the member for MCMillan and the Liberal Party like it or not. The member's motion seeking to ban the planting of crops is not about the long term of the industry; it is short term, knee-jerk and out of touch with what is in place now. Notwithstanding the measures and safeguards in place and the support for GM crops from the majority of industry bodies, the government believes that genetically modified crops should not be approved for commercial release unless they are safe to health and the environment and beneficial to the economy. The government understands that safe and beneficial standards must be established beyond reasonable doubt and that standards must be met to the satisfaction of the government, the scientific community, the consumer community and the farming community. The government also ensures that the process for assessment of GM crops includes careful consideration of health and environmental risks. ABARE found in its latest report Economic impacts of GM crops in Australia, released earlier this month, that there would be significant economic costs to Australia from delays in adopting GM crops and significant economic benefits-potentially $8.5 billion over ten years-from growing these crops. Criticisms of the report by the Australian Greens and others are unfounded. ABARE has surveyed and cited international experience and Australian trial results in preparing this report. I encourage people, especially the member for MCMillan, to read the report in full to understand the context for findings. I seek leave to present the report. Leave granted.",142
218,Mr BIDGOOD,INTERACTIVE GAMBLING,"Thank you. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Tony Burke, has said he believes GM crops will provide ‘a piece of the jigsaw in tackling climate change', and I agree with that. GM crops will help farmers mitigate climate change effects by enabling increased uptake and improved management of minimal tillage systems that increase soil carbon sequestration and help them adapt by improving drought tolerance and resistance to changing weed, pest and disease pressures. What is more exciting about GM crops is that they can also play an important part in helping Australian farmers increase their productivity and remain competitive in export markets. The ABARE report entitled GM crops in emerging economies: impacts on Australian agriculture, released in March 2008, reinforces ABARE's earlier findings that if Australian farmers do not adopt this technology they will fall behind their international competitors. I seek leave to present the report. Leave granted.",144
219,Mr BIDGOOD,INTERACTIVE GAMBLING,"Thank you. On the matter of sequestration and the coexistence of GM and conventional products, the $6 billion Australian grains industry believes it is possible to keep non-GM grains separate from GM grains throughout the supply chain in Australia. ABARE, in its 2006 report GM grains in Australia: identity preservation, concluded that the cost of segregating GM and non-GM canola would be modest and manageable at four to six per cent of the average farm gate price. I seek leave to present a third report. Leave granted.",144
220,Mr BIDGOOD,INTERACTIVE GAMBLING,"Thank you. In concluits sion, I affirm to the House that the government supports the national framework for managing and regulating gene technology.",144
221,Mr WOOD,INTERACTIVE GAMBLING,"I congratulate the member for MCMillan for listening so carefully to his local community and for working so hard. This is obviously a very big issue in the electorate of MCMillan. The issue of genetic modification, otherwise known as GM food, is also a sensitive one in my electorate of La Trobe. As my electorate is the neighbour to Macmillan, you can imagine this. I have been contacted by many constituents angered by the lack of public debate on GM crops. I therefore support the call of the member for MCMillan for the government to conduct an independent, broad-ranging scientific investigation into the genetic modification of food and biotechnology and to assess not only the health of the crops and the food but also the potential for contamination, the commercial implications for Australian primary industries and the benefits and risks associated with genetically modified organisms. Until Australian consumers can be confident of the safety of GM foods, these foods should not be produced or sold in Australia. We need an urgent review. In my electorate of La Trobe is the Yarra Ranges Shire Council, which has been instrumental in raising public awareness about the potential dangers of GM food. La Trobe is home to several diverse agricultural industries, from orchards and vineyards in the south to livestock grazing in the west. Contamination from GM crops would be disastrous for these industries. The decision of the Victorian government to lift the moratorium on the cultivation of genetically modified crops threatens Australia's primary industries, particularly organic agriculture. Farmer groups, such as the Berwick farmers market-and I congratulate them for putting on a fantastic market, held in my electorate of La Trobe, on the fourth Saturday of every month-celebrate organic and farm fresh produce. GM contamination of their crops would spell the end of this organic food market. Contamination can occur in many ways: wind can carry GM organisms from a GM farmer's crop to a non-GM farmer's crop or organic produce could come into contact with materials that have previously come into contact with GM produce, such as machinery or grain storage facilities. Once the supply chain has been breached, farmers cannot market their food as organic again. Even more alarming is that such breaches can have legal consequences for farmers as well. As most genetically modified crops are patented, farmers of non-GM crops can potentially be sued for patent infringement and theft of intellectual property if they are found to be cultivating crops with GM organisms belonging to another farmer, even if the cultivation was unintentional. This actually happened to Canadian farmer Percy Schmeiser, who was successfully sued by biotechnology firm Monsanto for patent breaches of GM canola. Even with 10kilometre buffer zones surrounding GM farms, there is no fail-safe way to protect GM-free crops against contamination. Seeds can be carried tens of kilometres by wind. Supporters of genetic modification argue that GM food can eradicate world hunger by drought-proofing crops and making them disease resistant, increasing yields. While there is certainly evidence to suggest that GM has benefits for overall crop yield, it cannot be ignored that almost one-third of all GM maize grown in the United States is used for ethanol production. The maize needed to produce only 95 litres of ethanol would feed one person for a year. When considered in this context, it suggests that the impetus for cultivation of GM crops is not eradication of world hunger. Despite indications that GM crops could prove more profitable than nonGM crops, fears about the potential health risks posed by GM foods mean there is a high demand for non-GM products throughout Europe and Asia. Tasmanian canola farmers recently secured a lucrative contract to supply Japan with GM-free canola, proving that farmers can choose to remain GM free without compromising the profitability of their yield. While there are many arguments supporting the cultivation of genetically modified crops, the simple fact is that a long-term study needs to be done in Australia to ensure they are safe. Finally, I am not opposed to GM crops, but I want a correct and proper review to make sure everything is done to ensure that these products are actually safe to be used in Australia and to help Australians without endangering our agricultural industry.",144

223,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being almost 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. ",145
224,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT,"Berowra) (9.30 pm)Tonight I want to draw to the attention of the House a tragedy that befell one of our former colleagues, Alan Cadman, when on Saturday, 10 May his son Phillip Manning Cadman passed away. This was a tragedy for the Cadman family, for Alan and Judy. It has always been said and I think very much understood that with the passing of time we may see the passing of our parents but it is a great tragedy when parents lose one of their children. Phillip was 44 years of age, single, active and worked widely around Australia. He worked extremely long hours and had many skills. He was a pilot. He worked in mining developments. He had an artistic side to him and was particularly popular amongst family and friends. On 16 May, a funeral was held for him at the Uniting Church, Galston. Attending that service were numbers of Alan's former colleagues-John Howard, Leader of the Opposition Brendan Nelson, Bronwyn Bishop, Louise Markus and Kerry Bartlett. Amongst the many hundreds of mourners, I also attended. It was a very moving occasion because there were eulogies from Stephen and Andrew Cadman. Alan and Judy spoke as well. Reports were included in our local press of what the family members had to say: Phil was the most unexpected, exciting and generous person and most of all he was special,' his old brother Stephen said with a smile. ‘Phil was such a great guy, both inside and out.' ... Andrew broke down as he remembered the wonderful uncle Phillip had been to his own dren. He called him ‘a loving and tender brother, uncle, son and man.' They spoke of his love of the bush. Judy Cadman, a very brave lady, spoke of all the gifts Phillip had given her, including a silverplated gumnut pendant which she clutched as she spoke to us all. She said: ‘Phil might have undervalued his own attributes and worth but everybody around him knew how special he was ... ‘He was caring, generous, thoughtful, kind ... amazing and his quick wit and intelligence always had us on our toes.' Alan said he was: ... overwhelmed by the support his family had received. ‘Everybody has touched our hearts with their support, but nobody has touched us like our Phil.' ‘Phil had told me of his sleepless nights as he feared for the future of Australia. He took everyone's problems as his own and worried about the drought, climate change and becoming overpopulated. His anxiety of our future had become too much and although no-one detected it, we know now that he is free. Phil is safe and is happy once again.' Occasions like this are very emotionally draining on all of us, but one could not help greatly admire Judy and Alan for the loving way in which they came to this occasion, understood the burdens that their son had borne but also had great faith that he was taken to his god. The faith of Alan and Judy is something I must say I greatly respected and appreciated on this occasion. It gave them great strength. I spoke to Alan last week. I saw him again in my own electorate on Sunday at a service at the Midway Christian Centre. He feels great loss, but he is managing it well. I wanted to report that his colleagues feel for him and Judy at a time like this. I hope others will have the opportuchil- nity to send him a message of goodwill. International Men's Health Week",145
225,Mr DREYFUS,ADJOURNMENT,"Isaacs) (9.34 pm)International Men's Health Week, to be held from 9 to 15 June 2008, is a week of activities designed to raise awareness of men's health and related issues. Men and boys face specific health concerns relating to anatomical and biological differences and also to differences in lifestyle and culture which are far too often overlooked. International Men's Health Week is an important opportunity to encourage men to attend regular check-ups with their doctors and other health services. As Professor John MACDonald, the Codirector of the University of Western Sydney's Men's Health Information and Resource Centre, said in 2007, and I strongly endorse these comments: The key is to make the annual check-up a normal part of men's lives-much like taking the car to the mechanic for an annual service is accepted essential for the safe and optimal performance the car. It is important that we act decisively on men's health issues. Australian men have an average life expectancy of 78 years compared to 83 years for women, and it is not only the quantity of life which is important but the quality of life we enjoy. Disease such as diabetes, kidney disease, mental health and obesity related illnesses severely impact on the quality of life enjoyed by Australian men. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing. There are probably 5,000 people with diabetes in my electorate alone. Labor governments have a proud record of developing comprehensive national health policies. In 1989, Australia's first national women's health policy was launched by a Labor government. Dr Carmen Lawrence, the former member for Fremantle and Minister for Human Services and Health, had prepared a national men's health policy in 1995 prior to the election. Those opposite failed to deal with the issue comprehensively when they reached the Treasury benches in 1996. As announced by the Minister for Health and Ageing in November 2007, the Rudd Labor government will launch a national men's health policy. It is currently under active development by the Department of Health and Ageing in consultation with state and territory governments, health providers, consumer groups, advocacy groups and of course Australian men. On 14 June, I plan to attend the International Men's Health Week function to be held by the Bayside General Practice Network at Mentone in my electorate of Isaacs. This event will help to raise awareness amongst men about the need to get regular health check-ups from their doctors. I look forward to taking part in this community health event at one of the local hardware stores in my as electorate. I would encourage other members of in this place to do so in their respective electorates. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among Australian men. I was involved earlier this year in a long-distance charity bike ride to raise funds for prostate cancer research with several other federal parliamentarians from both major parties including the members for Parramatta, Wills, Oxley, Menzies, Farrer, Macarthur and-I almost forgot-Warringah. The government will invest $15 million over five years to two dedicated prostate cancer research centres-the first in Australia. These centres will be at the forefront of developing new treatments and screening and diagnostic techniques in relation to prostate cancer. I would like to take this opportunity to commend to this place the great advocacy that the Treasurer, himself a survivor of prostate cancer, has made to ensuring that men are put in the best possible position to fight this terrible disease. Bowel cancer is the second most common cancer amongst Australian men after prostate cancer and kills 80 Australians per week. The government has committed $87.2 million to screen all 50-, 55and 65-year-olds for bowel cancer. The Rudd Labor government will not neglect the specific needs of men's health. We understand that cardiovascular disease, diabetes and work related injuries affect more men than women. Pollie Pedal",146
226,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased to follow the member for Isaacs, who has been talking about the importance of research into cancer, because I rise to congratulate all my colleagues involved in the Pollie Pedal of 2008. The 11th annual Pollie Pedal bike ride went from Melbourne to Sydney via Yea, Benalla, Rutherglen, Henty, Junee, Boorowa, Goulburn and Camden. I am pleased to say that more than $220,000 was raised for a number of very good causes-for the education of children with autism at the Vern Barnett School in my electorate; for medical research at the Nepean Medical Research Foundation in Penrith, in Sydney; but most particularly for prostate cancer research at Westmead Hospital, which is the largest health campus in the southern hemisphere. I wish to thank the major sponsors of Pollie Pedal 2008: Amgen, the pharmaceutical company; Novartis, another pharmaceutical company; the Mormon Church; Hartmann, which provides bandages to public hospitals; Blackmores, the well-known natural health provider; Johnson & Johnson, another pharmaceutical company; and Ramsay Health Care, the private hospital operator. It was particularly pleasing to see not only that these sponsors provided financial support to these good causes but that the key personnel of some of them also participated. Richard Davies, the local managing director of Amgen, and Martin Cross, the local managing director of Novartis, were key participants in the ride this year, as was Graeme Shelley, who is one of the senior executives with Hartmann. But it was not just the large corporates who were involved; I was particularly pleased to receive a $500 donation towards the great cause of prostate cancer research from the Albury Aboriginal Medical Service. I want to particularly thank that organisation for their generosity. But it would not be a Pollie Pedal without the participation of some of my parliamentary colleagues. The member for Parramatta, Julie Owens, rode every kilometre of the distance. Pat Farmer rode almost every kilometre. He often says that he could probably run faster and further than we ride, but nevertheless, to his great credit Pat, the member for Macarthur, was riding most days. Kevin Andrews, the member for Menzies; Sussan Ley, the member for Farrer; and Senator Guy Barnett were also participants over several days. Bernie Ripoll, the member for Oxley; Mark Dreyfus, the member for Isaacs; and Kelvin Thomson, the member for Wills, all participated on the first day. I thank them and I congratulate them. Of course, it was not all plain sailing or easy riding every day. I probably should thank the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital for the excellent medical attention that was provided in the casualty department to one of our riders who came off his bike, and also Campbelltown Hospital for the care of another one of our riders who suffered a suspected heart attack. But I have to say that all of them are fine and they are looking forward to participating next year. Pollie Pedal means that at least some politicians turn up at towns far from the beaten track for politicians. Politicians turn up at little places which are often forgotten in our national debate. The other nice thing about the Pollie Pedal is that travelling on bikes and staying in caravan parks suggests to those who are familiar with it that politicians are not quite the creatures of luxury or the indulgent people that at least some of our critics like to think. I would like to say that Pollie Pedal has become a very important part of my life. I really appreciate the camaraderie of my brother and sister politicians. I look forward to next year's event and I hope that all who participated this year might get on their bikes again next year. Epilepsy",147
227,Mr HALE,ADJOURNMENT,"I congratulate the member for Warringah for enlightening us on the Pollie Pedal ride for the cause of cancer. It is a great cause. I think that politicians at times are underestimated in what they do for the community. I want to speak today about epilepsy. I know that we hear a lot about cancer, and there is a lot of money raised to research cancer, but a disease that affects some 200,000 Australians is epilepsy. It is a very common and most serious neurological condition in Australia. There is no cure for this condition, and there are various ways people can control or manage symptoms to improve their quality of life, particularly if the condinever tion is identified and managed early. Epilepsy is a disorder in the activity of nerve cells in the brain which is characterised by unpredictable, recurring episodes known as seizures. The location of the electrical discharges in the brain determines the parts of the body that are affected by seizure activity. The cause of epilepsy cannot be identified in nearly 70 per cent of all cases. There is a burden with epilepsy. The psychosocial and socio-economic consequences of epilepsy often cause more suffering than seizures themselves. Problems arise in the fields of independent living, education and employment, mobility, personal relationships such as marriage, and insurance and law. The reason I am very passionate about this subject is that my sister, Jacintha, suffers from epilepsy. She is a very professional lady; she is a school teacher. She was diagnosed with epilepsy when she was 22 years old. I still remember the phone call I received from my mother to say that my sister had had a seizure of some type. She was back from James Cook University on holidays when Mum heard a crash and bang and walked into discover my sister having a seizure on the floor of her bedroom. It was quite disturbing at the time, not knowing what had actually happened. There was no apparent reason for her epilepsy. There was no history of it in the family and she had had no head injuries. It was very rare indeed to have an example of adult onset epilepsy and it has affected our family. I have spoken to my sister because I wanted to know first-hand some of the things that have affected her life, professionally as well as personally, including having children-she is a mother of three. She said that when the kids were young they had to run things differently, including some of the little things that I suppose other mothers would take for granted. For example, my sister bathed the kids unless there was someone else at home with her, and nappy changing was done on the floor if she was there by herself. She said the worse seizure she ever had happened when she was downstairs on a Saturday morning and she ended up with a black eye and lacerations to her feet and hands. Her daughter was only a few years old and witnessed this occurring, so it had an impact on her. What my sister used to do, which she said was quite amusing, was to pretend to have seizures in front of the children as they got older, putting herself on the ground and going into a seizure type activity, so that the children would learn how to react and what they had to do to bring it to the attention of my brother-in-law, Tim. My sister went on to work in boys' education. She left teaching for a little while but is back teaching now. It is amazing how many of her colleagues say that she is probably the best school teacher they have ever seen teaching year 12 English. In some notes she has given me about her experiences she says her job involved a lot of interstate travel and most of the travel usually involved two people going somewhere. But she remembers going on her first trip by herself and how terrified she was that she could have a seizure. The reason I am talking about this is that Epilepsy Australia is looking to establish an office in the Northern Territory by the end of the year. This will be welcome because it is something that we need. The suicide rate among people with epilepsy is 25 times greater than the rate in the general population, and the Northern Territory is not immune from this. So I welcome the fact that the epilepsy centre will be established in the Northern Territory. And I find it quite humbling that I get to tell my sister's story in place. I am very proud of her. She is a great sister and her story deserves to be told. (Time expired) Mrs Paula Ford",148
228,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to advise the House at the passing of Paula Ford of Medowie. Paula was a devoted life partner and best friend of Tom; a loving mother to Andrew, Terry, Sandy and Tom Jr; a wonderful mother-in-law to Kim, Julianna, Glen and Libby; a wonderful Nanna to the apples of her eyesgrandchildren Catherine, Emily, Michael, Samantha, Erin, Leigh, Mitchell and Rhiley; and a sister to Peter, Christopher and Vanessa. Most importantly, Paula Ford was a friend to many. We all know Paula in a different form, but we all know that she put others first. There are talkers and there are doers. Paula was definitely a doer. My first meeting with Tom and Paula was in June 1995, when I ran for preselection for the Liberal Party, when I first heard that distinguishably Paula line: ‘Now listen here, my boy'-and then you would get the sermon from the mount. I listened; I was elected. The world according to Paula: invariably she was right, and it was always for others, for the community that she and Tom loved so much. I believe that the greatest thing in this world is not so much where we stand but in what direction we are moving. Paula always moved heaven and earth for her community. No obstacle was too great. Apart from her example to others by being a fine wife, who in partnership with Tom raised a happy family who remain close knit and productive members of society-she instilled in them and in her grandchildren a sense of community spirit-Paula is remembered for many things. We are all aware that one of Tom and Paula's many legacies is the creation of Pathis cific Dunes. Many Medowie residents would know Paula from her involvement with that community and for her unflinching support for that development against all the odds. I used to drop in for a cuppa regularly with Tom and Paula at the house on the hill. I saw the vision and passion first-hand. Tom could never say no to a challenge, and Paula always made sure it was followed through. Support for the community was not a newfound thing for Tom and Paula. Some may have forgotten in the passage of time the donation to the NBN Telethon: donating the land and then teaming up with Craig Baumann at Valley Homes to build and donate the house-always to help others. We often see the structure but overlook the support and the raising of money for projects like the PCYC at Nelson Bay while Tom was in Apex. Winston Churchill said: ‘We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.' Funny, Tom would make the commitment and, again, Paula would follow through, but they always gave their all. Paula was involved in Red Cross at Williamtown and the Rotary Club of Williamtown, where she was made a Paul Harris Fellow, and she was a charter member of Salamanda Rotary. She was involved in Little Athletics, soccer and youth issues and she was a vital member of the Medowie Probus club. It is no secret that Paula supported the Grahamstown Dam Sailing and Aquatic Club and, with Rotary, purchased dinghies for Sailability. More recently a dinghy was donated in her name. Unfortunately she was not well enough to christen the boat, but her grandchildren did her proud that day. They definitely follow in Paula's footsteps. Many would not know that, if it were not for Tom and Paula Ford, the release of the dam for broader community use would never have happened. My involvement in having the dam as a community asset came as a councillor on Port Stephens Council following yet another sermon on the mount from Paula. Paula and Tom were relentless in advocating that young kids had nothing to do and here was a dam that no-one could use. The rest is history. Paula was a tireless worker for her beloved community and in spite of, not because of, her own battles with breast cancer she was a champion for raising awareness of and fundraising for breast cancer research. She even got me to participate in Relay for Life though I must admit I paid others to walk the kilometres for me. It is indicative of her local community spirit that she wanted her friends not to mourn her passing but to celebrate her life, knowing that each of them was a part of that journey of life. Finally, to quote Mark Twain, who I think summed up life in general: Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.",150
229,Ms HALL,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to congratulate the member for Solomon on his fine contribution in relation to epilepsy. On Wednesday, 28 May, we launched the Friends of Epilepsy here in Parliament House. The decision to form the parliamentary Friends of Epilepsy came as a result of my having spoken to Jacinta Collins, the chair of the Joint Epilepsy Council of Australia. She convinced me of the need for such a group. She referred to the World Health Organisation campaign, which identified epilepsy as arguably the most stigmatised and the most under-resourced health condition in the world today, with 60 million people world wide suffering from the condition. In Australia there are around 200,000 people with epilepsy at any one time. These are people like the member for Solomon's sister and my sister-in-law, who have lived their lives affected by epilepsy in many different ways. It affects their standard of living, their life choices, their occupational choices and their employment opportunities. It has an impact on their general health. As well as that they have to live with the stigma of having epilepsy. The launch was attended by over 40 people from all around Australia. These were people who had been associated with epilepsy in one way or another. As well as that, we had members of parliament in attendance. The keynote speaker at the launch was Christine Walker, from the Chronic Illness Alliance, on behalf of the research working group of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria. She highlighted many needs in relation to epilepsy, such as the need for social research into epilepsy in Australia. A research Sail project was undertaken in 2006-07 that looked at the impact of living with epilepsy. The research explored the impact on comEpilepsy munity attitudes and it went on to discuss with the participants matters concerning barriers and the way it affected their lives. In a country town those who have seizures cannot play sport and people avoid them-this was all brought out at the launch. Australia has a world-class health system and epilepsy, unfortunately, does not receive enough attention from governments, or at a community level. Epilepsy Australia has adopted a research agenda and the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria has a working group. That is where Christine Walker was involved. The Friends of Epilepsy want to raise awareness and put epilepsy right there on the agenda. We want social research into epilepsy in Australia. We want people in Australia to understand what it is like for Australians who suffer from epilepsy-how just the simple fact of getting around is very difficult in such a car-dependent society as we have here in Australia. Employment and education are impacted on enormously by epilepsy. Children who suffer from epilepsy have their schooling interrupted and later in life that impairs their ability to get jobs. Quite often the only jobs that they can get are casual ones. My sisterin-law has, in her whole working life, never had a permanent job. Epilepsy acts as a barrier, it leads to social exclusion and it impacts on the quality of people's lives. I learnt a great deal last Wednesday. I learnt how epilepsy had impacted on the lives of many of the people who attended the launch. In fact, I spoke to two mothers who had lost their sons. The launch was the start of Friends of Epilepsy and it will become a strong group within this parliament. It will raise awareness, not only that of members and senators but also that of the Australian community as a whole. It is time we put aside our fears and prejudices and undertook the research that will lead to a cure for epilepsy and the control of it. This disease affects over 200,000 Australians and their families. We can ignore it no longer. Mr Michael Francis Nolan",151
230,Mr HALE,ADJOURNMENT,"We were going to get an early mark, but I thought it would be remiss of me not to mention that we buried an AFL legend in Brisbane this morning: Michael Francis NolanMick Nolan-who was known as the ‘galloping gasometer' by the fans of the North Melbourne Football Club. Mick played in the 1975 premiership-the inaugural premiership-for North Melbourne. I took leave from the House today to attend his funeral. It was a fantastic occasion reflecting on a real gentleman and family man. He was a fantastic individual. I had the pleasure of coaching his sons up in Darwin at St Mary's Football Club.

The Treasurer would have had us all believe order to put downwards pressure on inflation. the Treasurer actually knew what was in this sort.

All up, Labor's high-taxing policies have forward estimates. The preliminary economic estimates that Labor's new taxes and charges The Treasurer has long been saying that ‘it is 1½ per cent of GDP, but what was revealed in $16.8 billion, which is 1.5 per cent of GDP, out Mr Swan's intervention. So he could sit actions have meant that it is only 1.5 per cent. to be 1.8 per cent of GDP. Again, this is a Howard-Costello years.

I think that is being fined for offering cheaper petrol to Minister and the Assistant Treasurer want wide. I will now turn to grocery prices, because about this issue, as we see that there is now nism. Money has been allocated in the budget prices was apparently core business for the year the Prime Minister was quoted as saying: The buck stops with me. How quickly things change! Mr We'll all be expecting to see positive programs, positive grocery prices down. That is what he actually said at the start of similar things. But already we have the Prime months, surrendering on this. It really is extraordinary and the government had no idea about how to deal with them. I just might turn to local issues in the minutes Stirling has been severely hit by measures contained measures. Firstly, this budget fails to deliver prior to the last election. Two that are very Highway intersects with Mirrabooka Avenue ander Drive. Sadly last week there was another Because of the high incidence of fatalities it occupied a lot of time in the House last of this week-and that is petrol prices. What quite ludicrous.
