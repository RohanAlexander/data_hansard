12,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Yesterday the,honourable member for. H in d m a r s h asked by a question, without notice, in reference to certain contraventions of the Customs Act by Messrs. Harris, Scarfe, and Company, of Adelaide. I am informed that the eight , contraventions referred to .are not part of the seventeen charges mentioned, and have no connection whatever with them. They were merely technical contraventions of the Act, such as clerical errors, &c. Contraventions of this kind are of frequent occur-. rence in all the States, and, as no fraud is imputed in such instances, they are dealt with under Part XV. of the Act, and a small penalty usually imposed - The particular eight instances in question were quite ordinary instances of this kind, and their number is explained by the fact that they cover a period of about fifteen months, having been held over on the advice of the Crown Solicitor. SEAT OF GOVERNMENT BILL. SECOND READING.",15
13,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [2.38] - Honourable bers are doubtless aware that the AttorneyHonorable General has suffered during the last days from a rather severe throat and chest atfack. But he insisted on being present today to move the second reading of this measure. Apparently he did not ' that the Order of the Day would be' reached so soon, and allowed for the ordinary terval for the answering of questions out notice. Not having prepared myself with the data, it is unnecessary for make any further remarks; but in movingThat this Bill be now read a second timeI wish to intimate that my colleague will here within a few moments.",16
14,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"He is really, not to be here.",16

16,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,We do not expect him to attend if he is not well enough.,16
17,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"He preferred to be here, and will arrive immediately. If honourable member is prepared to speak, shall resume my seat, and the Attorneythe General can follow him.",16
18,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"East-Sydney) [2.40] general feeling in this House on the prereading sent occasion must be one of satisfaction because of the opportunity now offered endeavour to settle the. vexed question the site ""of the Federal Capital - At the present time. I do not wish to [366]- 2 enter upon any inquiry as to the causes of the delay which has occurred. But 1 think I represent the general feeling in New South Wales upon this subject when I say that the people of that State are strongly dissatisfied with that delay. So long . ago as - 1903 - five years since - the Government took up this question, and endeavoured to settle it. More than two years ago-namel y on the 13th December, 1905- Mr Isaacs, then Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, stated that the Government intended to introduce a Bill to determine the question, and to carry it to a conclusion during that session. From that time to this no such Bill has been introduced, and"" no effort has been made to settle the matter. I do not wish to enlarge upon these details, because we have at last an. opportunity to endeavour to terminate the difficulty. Honourable members, I think, will not feel aggrieved at the interest shown in this matter memby the representatives of New South Wales. members from each of the six few States have never been blamed for exhibiting some degree of zeal in connection with matters which, although Federal, peculiarly affect their own divisions of the Comthink monwealth. I look upon any criticism of our desire to press this matter to its concluinsion as most unfair. I am not at all sure withthat the Government have chosen the best method of dealing with the question, but me to am quite prepared to accept that which they have chosen. I understand from the statement made by the Prime Minister that the Government propose that we should go be into .Committee j and that if the word ""Dalgety"" is removed from the Bill pro-« fit gress should be reported, and that the Government should then submit resolutions at for a ballot. The effect of that action prewould not be to exclude Dalgety or any I assume that in fairness to those who advocate the .seledtion' of Dalgety ""it would not be considered a final vote with regard to that site. Dalgety would be entitled any with other sites to be considered in any I ballot carried out. I would suggest to Government lhat a more convenient course would be to test the opinion of the - The House upon the motion for the second of the Bill. The Bill is described as being one "" to determine more definitely to the Seat of Government of the Commonof wealth in the neighbourhood of Dalgety."" If a majority of this House is in favouof retaining the word "" Dalgety "" in the Bill , that majorrt'y will naturally vote for the second reading of the measure; but those of us who do not propose to vote in that way would be placed in an entirely false position, by affirming the second reading of a Bill t'o determine more definitely the site in the neighbourhood of Dalgety, and then proceeding in Committee to eliminate from that Bill the one word which does more definitely determine that site.",16
19,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The right honourable member means to move that on the motion for the second reading.,17
20,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"So long as the Government will understand that in so voting the usual interpretation placed upon' the throwing out of a Government measure on the motion for its second reading will not be adopted; but that the vote will be simply regarded as the most convenient way of testing this matter. It is idle to ask an honourable member to affirm the second reading of a Bil l to more definitely determine the Seat of Government at a certain place if , when the Bill is taken into Committee, his first act will be to vote for the elimination of that site from the Eill. logical, shortest, and most effectual way of determining this question will be, therefore, to decide whether things shall be left as they are OIT the motion that the Bill be now read a second time. in favour of the proposition naturally and properly will vote for that second reading.",17
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Why not allow the Bill to stand, and create a blank in Committee?",17
22,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Unfortunately , in this case the one word is, so to speak, the - Bill ; What I am going to suggest is that if we struck out that word we should leave the Bill in skeleton form with no site named in rt, because we could not deal with that matter in Committee.. It would have to be dealt with by ballot in the whole House.",17
23,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I understand the Prime Minister has indicated his acceptance of that view.,17
24,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Thai : the question shall be tested on the second reading?,17
25,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"--Yes; I think that would be the simplest form to adopt. in advance to earn the crratitude of honourable members, in 'the hope that I maybe heard for a moment or two, by endeavouring to deal with this subject as briefly as poss'.ble; because I think that it would be a pity if we unnecessarily protracted this debate. I desire to remind honourable members of the agreement arrived at at the Premiers' Conference, which met in the beginning of the year 1899. As honourable .members will recollect, after the first referendum it was found that the people of New South Wales had not by the requisite majority affirmed Federation. I , as the head of the Government of New South Wales in those days, suggested a Conference of the Premiers of the six States. That Conference was held, and I submitted to it a number of points. I think 'that honourable members will agree with me that in - effecting the abolition from the Constitution Bill of a provision which would have meant that at a joint sitting of both Houses, held after a generalelection, 66 votes out of the total of in would not have been effectual 'to carry any proposition, I rendered a substantial service, and added to the democratic lines upon which the Constitution is undoubtedly framed. I also, think that in putting a period to the iron-bound provision in the Braddon clause another substantial service was rendered to the people of Australia, The more although I am the last one to withhold from the States a proper, if more elastic, form of protection for their financial interests. Well, these were two large' matters, and honourable members may consider Those this a small matter. They may think that the attitude which I took up in claiming the Federal Capital site for New South Wales was a narrow one. But so far as I am concerned, I took the view, in the interests of-the Federation, and as the leader in tHat great battle before the second referendum, .that with these three alternatives in the draft Constitution I could look forward to an assured victory for the cause, whilst in the absence of any one of them. I could not have the same confidence. I based this claim to the Federal Capital Site upon a higher ground than that. Viewed in the light of the interests of the Australia of the future, I formed the opinion-to which I still adhere-that , in the inevitable development of our nationalgreatness, it will be found that the ultimate centre of the millions who will inhabit this great continent will be somewhere in the State of New I wish South Wales.",17
26,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"As a matter of fact, statisticians place it at Armidale.",17
27,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That prediction confirms my contention that it will be in New South Wales. But whether that be so or not honourable members, I feel sure-whateve r their views may be-wil l at least begin with a disposition to honour,, if possible, the terms honour the Premiers' agreement. of the - arrangement arrived at. I shall never fOTget the effect which the right honourable member for Swan produced upon this House by the earnest and eloquent appeal which he made for an honourable observance of that which was never reduced to the formal binding terms of a written agreement. He appealed to us not on the basis of an agreement expressed in plain black and white and signed by every one of the Premiers of the States, but on the faith of that which he regarded as amounting to some sort of an honourable understanding. He will remember that I honestly responded to his call. From the first time that he made that appeal to me I have loyally striven to the extent of my power and influence to give effect to that understanding. I call upon him to act in the same honourable spirit towards the understanding which he signed in black'and white with reference to New South Wales. I think that I may fairly make that appeal. I honoured his appeal, which rested upon more flimsy ground-whic h was not set forth in so many words, and signed, sealed and deliveredand I ask him in the light of his own signature, and honouring his own agreement, to remember that whilst the Premiers' Conference would not allow the Federal Capital to be located hi the neighbourhood of Sydney, whilst it stipulated that it must be at least 100 miles distant, it expressly agreed that it should be within a "" reasonable distance "" of that city. I wish at once to make the admission that I do not expect the House to carry out even that honourable and well-expressed agreement, if , as a matter of fact, there is no reasonable site within a ""reasonable distance"" of Sydney. I do not wish to interpret that bond as we interpret bonds between men of business, if there be no site which can reasonably be regarded as a proper one for the Federal C-apita.l within the ordinary meaning of the language within a ""reasonable distance"" of Sydney. I am not here to say that the Federation should be blind to the future interests of the people of Australia to the extent of selecting an unreasonable and unsuitable site because it happens to be within a certain degree of contiguity to Sydney. But I do take up this position: that if within a ""reasonable distance"" of Sydney there is such a site available this House-if it recognises the honour which springs, from agreements between representatives of great communities-wil l It is, I think, in the nature of an agreement which rises to the highest degree of sanctity, because it was upon the faith of that agreement that the people of New South Wales were asked to cast their votes in favour of entering this Federation. It is quite different from the ordinary kind of agreement, for a breach of which some measure of damages awarded by a Court will suffice. This is not that sort of agreement. The people of New South Wales, above the signatures of the Premiers of the six States, were told, "" If you join this Federation, we agree and promise, on behalf of the people of our respective communities, to do this thing.""",17
28,Mr HUTCHISON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,And did not the Government of which the right honourable member was the head agree to adhere to Dalgety since it had been selected by this Parliament ?,18
29,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"My Government made no such agreement. No such agreement was ever made. Governments cannot write out bargains between great communities. The bargain resulting from the Premiers' Conference was not between this Government and that-it was an honourable understanding between the great bulk of the communities of Australia. If the honourable member will pardon me for saying so, it was possible for the Parliaments and the peoples of those States to have raised their voices in repudiation of that agreement. It was published, I think, in the early days of February, 1899-abou t the ist or 2nd February of that year-and the vote was not taken until the middle of 1899. All through those months there was no voice raised to suggest to the people of New South Wales that the agreement which had been entered into by the Premiers of the States was one which would be dishonoured by any single State.",18
30,Mr HUTCHISON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Ver y few people knew anything about that agreement.,18
31,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Unfortunatel y ignorance is no excuse for dishonesty. Ignorance cannot be pleaded against a solemn agreement upon the' faith of which a national vote has been cast. I should like the honourable member for a moment to give the representatives of New South Wales credit for one shred of the patriotic zeal which he and his friends from South Australia always display for the rights of that State down to the smallest and most insignificant.,18
32,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Would the right honor-, able member have agreed to the ioo miles limit in the absence of the other proviso?",19
33,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Of course not. It was a of that proviso. I felt that the proposition made to me by Sir George Turner was a reasonable one. Since I was barring all Victoria; and all the other States, I felt was quite reasonable for him to say to-me, "" Well, Mr Reid, I will bar Sydney, the territory within ioo miles of it . "" I the assembled Premiers. consented to that arrangement. But there was added to that provision another proby vision, namely, that, although the Federal Capital was to be at least ioo miles disspirit tant from Sydney, it was to be within "" reasonable distance"" of that city, recognising Sydney merely, but looking orable members. upon it as a pivot around which most the interests of New South Wales revolve.",19
34,Mr WH IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,How did that prowhat viso become eliminated from the draft Constitution ?,19
35,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I suppose that I was guilty of this unfortunate weakness-that I looked upon this agreement signed by the six miers as quite good enough for me. I did not act ini the spirit of the man who is dealhave ing with hucksters in trade. The the bargain which I put in the Constitution was that to which Sir George Turner attached so much importance. In the light of events, which I did not foresee-and I the Premiers? am obliged to my honourable and learned friend for his reminder-if would have been wise if I had realized that the most solemn agreement does not always bin'd is unless every term of the agreement is pressed.",19
36,Mr WH IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,It was only by advertence it was left out?,19
37,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Shee r inadvertence. I can assure the honourable member for Flinders that-the reason this was not placed in 'the Constitution was that I was perfectly satisbe fied with the written undertaking on the part of the Premiers of the six States. For months it was open to the States liaments 'to repudiate the undertaking; the whole question went to the ejectors that basis, and, in the light of events, regret I did not place the words imt the Constitution.",19
38,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Did the amendment to the electors in the section as it stands in the Constitution?,19
39,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Althoug h it may take up time, I should like to make the matter a little clearer. The whole of this question was threshed' out in the Parliament of New South Wales before 'the Conference of Premiers. I must remind part honourable members that this was not an ordinary Conference of Premiers. Before I asked the Premiers to meet me, all these points were, as I say,- threshed out in the .it Parliament of New South Wales, and these terms about the Capital Site were, a part and of the arrangement which I submitted to If honourable members will not regard this minute signed the Premiers as & proper guide for in- terpreting the section*, in order to get the of the section, they are taking, a a course which I did not .expect. I expect not an honourable spirit on the part of honI know it is open to of them to take points, and say, "" It was not in the bond, and, since that be so, do .we care for any understanding atJ which the Premiers arrived?"" But is there a man in New South Wales, Victoria, or any of the other States, who would have changed his vote because that arrangePrement had been arrived at ? Who will say that any of the people of Victoria would reversed their vote for Federation bepart of cause of the Premiers' minute?",19
40,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Does the right honourable member think it was fair to put the clause to the people without the minute of,19
41,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I do not desire to enter further into this matter. There are two ways of looking at the question. If irto be subject to the scrutiny of proof, as exin a Police Court, or any other kiind of Court, there are, I admit, a number of loopinholes by which the honourable understanding can be escaped. But if the spirit of agreements or understandings arrived at from time to time between great communities, represented by their trusted leaders, are to be interpreted in this way, there will an end to international communication or agreement of any sort. What Act of Parliament records the solemn obligations into Parwhich representatives of great nations but enter at Conferences of the kind? What) on Act of Parliament guarantees the honour I of a great nation for the full performance of its treaty obligations? The fact is, that this was an understanding expressed go in black and white, and signed. Those who choose to repudiate that understanding are perfectly at liberty to.do so, because there can be no suit for breach of agreement, or for penalties. All that will remain to the people of New South Wales - will be the feeling that on an understanding, which was an anxious and important one to them,' and on the faith of which they joined Federation, the Commonwealth has not acted in that honourable spirit in which it acted to the right honourable member f p r Swan in connection with another question not expressed im the terms of a written agreement. Where is 'the provision in the Constitution that there shall be a railway established between this side of the continent and Western Australia? We did not ask the right honourable member for Swan to prove his case as if in a Police Court; indeed, I think we went, perhaps, further than the strict rule required.",19
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Do not make this a personal matter; I am advocating the in terests of Australia, and of my own State.",20
43,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Then I desire the right honourable member to begin by advocating those interests within the limits of the agreement.,20
44,Mr FRAZER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The right honourable member for East Sydney has taken a very definite and straightforward action in regard to the railway, but his followers have not shared his views.",20
45,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Honourable members are in such a strong position that they might fairly say, "" Well, if you had any such understanding, it was due to the public that, in the report of your deliberations, it should be set out in black and white."" But this was no secret, nebulous understanding. It was put in black and white, signed by each of the Premiers,- and published throughout the length and breadth of Australia. As I say, I do not desire to labour this point too much. If honourable members will not act oh the understanding, there is no power on earth to compel them to do so. I cap only appeal to their sense of what is fair and right; and I now dismiss altogether that part of the question. As I say, honourable members are entitled, in spite of this provision in the agreement, to have some site suggested to them which is a reasonable and sufficient site for the purpose. I do not contest that view for a moment; but it is always subject to the fact. that the reasonable site must be a reasonable distance from Sydney, and that, if there is no reasonable site within that distance, Parliament must do the best it can. Now, I submit that there are at least two magnificent sites within a reasonable distance of Sydney, one of which is Lyndhurst.",20
46,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The best of all !,20
47,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"We l l , Lyndhurst, as honourable members know, stood absolutely at the top in three of the ballots which were taken-it may have been in five out of six ballots-and being a little under, I think, Bombala, or Tumut, it had a commanding position until the very last. Since then another site has been brought under the notice of Parliament, and that is also within a reasonable distance of Sydney. When I use the. term "" Sydney,"" it is only with reference to the State of New South Wales. Some pivotal point has to be mentioned; ancl in this connection, "" Sydney "" merely represents the whole of the interests of the whole of New South Wales. The site I refer to is Canberra, which was not in the list of those submitted at the first ballots. That fact, in itself, is not, of course, a disadvantage, because we must remember that Dalgety, which now stands in the Seat of Government Bill , did not receive a single vote on the first ballot. It is an extraordinary circumstance that, from the sixty or seventy honourable members assembled, Dalgety, out of the six sites submitted, did not receive one vote. Dalgety did not even get the vote of the honourable member for - Eden Monaro.",20
48,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The right honourable member knows very well the reason Dalgety did not get my vote ! - Mr Reid - It was because the honourable member could not give two votes at one time.,20
49,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Because we made up our minds to go for Bombala, as being in the district.",20
50,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I do not blame the honourable member for that, though it does not alter the facts.' All I say is that Dalgety did not find a place among the six or eight sites in the first ballot.  lected, the right honourable member asked us to stand by the selection.",20
51,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,And pledged himself to do so.,20
52,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"My super-angelic friend, the member for Grey, has at times been confronted with the choice between two undesirable alternatives, and has then undoubtedly exercised his common sense by selecting the less ob- jectionable one - I then stuck to Dalgety like wax, because if I let it go I should have got something worse. Whilst in office, I was bound to stand by Dalgety so long as it represented the deliberate will of the Legislature. But can it be said that I , or any other honourable member whose first choice Dalgety was not, am bound by the selection of Dalgety if an opportunity is given for making a better choice? A person who chooses one of two evils is not thereby debarred from choosing good when the opportunity arrives - That is my answer to my honourable friend. sider Lyndhurst a magnificent site. was my first choice, and would be so again today had I not reason to believe that Canberra will be given much more support. Mr CARR:-Why not give Lyndhurst a chance ?",20
53,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I should be glad to do so if I thought there was any possibility of Lyndhurst being chosen. If I see no prospect of that, I must, in the exercise of my intelligence, vote for the next best site. In my opinion, on this occasion Lyndhurst will not occupy as strong a position as it did formerly.",21
54,Mr FRAZER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"On the day on which we - visited Lyndhurst, there was a duststorm which could beat any that occur at Kalgoorlie.",21
55,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Accident s like that are a source of satisfaction to thirsty travellers. I was in Kalgoorlie when, for nearly eight days, the thermometer never went below about 150 degrees, although the moment ' the Federal politicians left, the temperature fell about 50 degrees. I have no prejudice against Kalgoorlie on that account.",21
56,Mr FRAZER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,-The honourable gentleman would not regard it as a suitable site for the Federal Capital.,21
57,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Althoug h the weather during my stay was not all that could be desired, I should say that Kalgoorlie must be one of the finest places in Australia to live in-if you have a thirst. I look upon Canberra as the site likely to be more acceptable than Lyndhurst to honourable members generally, and it is therefore important to consider its advantages and disadvantages. Had its merits been discussed prior to the first ballot, I should not now occupy time in detailing them. But, whilst the good points of Dalgety, Bombala, Lyndhurst, and a number of other sites have been exhaustively reviewed more than once in previous Parliaments, those of Canberra have not yet, I think, been discussed, and therefore I propose to advance a few reasons why this site might well be chosen in honourable fulfilment of the agreement amongst the Premiers, as being within a reasonable distance of Sydney,. I do not wish to express any opinions of my own; I prefer to give the House the! benefit of those of the Engineer-in-Chief of Public Works for New South Wales, an eminent officer who visited the site, and devoted his professional talents to drawing up a report upon it. As this report is in the hands of honourable members, I do not I con- propose to occupy time with lengthy quoIt tations from it, though I may be allowed to pick out one or two recommendations of Canberra which it 'contains.",21
58,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Was the report based on that of Mr Scrivener?,21
59,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It is the report of Mr. Wade, who visited the locality, and saw it for himself, besides having the information collected by other officers.",21
60,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,It was backed up by Mr Lloyd's report.,21
61,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Severa l other ofBcers visited Canberra, and Mr Wade personally checked their reports. . Mr CHANTER - Mr Scrivener was sent there by the Commonwealth.",21
62,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That may be; I have not his report by me. Beauty is one "" of the considerations to which we must pay heed in choosing a site, and Mr Wade says of CanberraIn generalsuitability for the purposes of a Federal Capital City Site, Canberra compares most favourably with any site yet suggested. The extent of gently undulating country suitable for building exceeds that of any of those other sites, while the low hills generally surrounding the city area, with the foot hills in the middle distance to the south, and the high peaks again in the far distance forming the mountains of the southern watershed of the Murrumbidgee, give it an attraction as regards scenery unsurpassed by the others suggested. Of course, this is only Mr Wade's opinion, which I do not wish to force on the House as'the final word on the matter ; I merely submit it . as the opinion of the Chief Engineer in the State. The existence of a water supply is another great consideration. Mr Wade recognises it as of paramount importance, and says thatThe Cotter River is the most suitable source - for a water supply. Its catchment consists wholly of uninhabited mountain country. If there is one thing eminently desirable in connection with a water supply it is that the catchment area shall be mountainous and uninhabited. Mr Wade says that the boundaries rise to "".elevated peaks many thousands of feet in height, which are snow-clad during the winter months."" Thus there is snow in the neighbourhood of the proposed site, which, therefore, possesses one of the crowning charms of Dalgety. He continues The water running off is soft, and nearly always sufficiently clear for human consumption without filtration; When slight turbidity does arise after heavy rainfall, the sedimentation resulting from the passage through a storage reservoir is all that will be required. The investigation as regards levels so far undertaken has been of a preliminary nature by means of aneroid.; these levels show that a gravitation scheme can be obtained to command the whole city area, with an ample head forfire and other purposes. A gravitation water supply is the ideal one. across Many difficulties may be overcome by pumpthe ing, but the advantages of gravitation are unquestionable. The report continues The available gathering ground above the elevation necessary fpr gravitation, and a suitable site for storage, is n o square miles. This area, I consider, if utilized to its fullest capacity is capable of affording a supply to a city of a quarter of a million of inhabitants. In addition, there is within 36 miles the gigantic work now under construction at Barren Jack, which will impound a volume of water estimated to be - larger than that in Svdnev Harbor, affording one of the greatest water supplies in the world. Not only is there a gravitation water supply sufficient to meet the wants of a city of 250,000 inhabitants, which points to a distant time, but there is also behind it the gigantic Barren Jack reservoir, which will lie one of the greatest artificial water reserves in the .world, and will also provide power for the generating of electricity.",21
63,Mr CARR,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Will water be brought from Barren Jack to Canberra by gravitation?,22
64,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,No .,22
65,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The Barren Jack water is not needed; but the artificial lake there will be one of the grandest water spaces in the interior of Australia, and within a reasonable holiday excursion distance.",22
66,Mr FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,To what height would the water have to be pumped to convey it from Barren Jack to Canberra?,22
67,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"If I could give the honourable member the information I would, but I do not wish to go into facts with which I am not fa'miliar, and it is not necessary to regard Barren Jack as a source of water supply.",22
68,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It is not a suitable water supply, but it will serve to generate power.",22
69,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The water impounded at Barren Jack will not be needed, for the Federal Capital, but it will be there in case of emergencies. Mr Wade suggests that- The magnificent inland lake resulting from the construction of this reservoir will afford, within reasonable distance from the City, a pleasure' resort, where boating, yachting, & c , can be indulged in, almost as in Sydney Harbor; and will also afford an easy means of access to the feeder streams,. which are at the present time amply stocked with trout. Thus the water spaces of this district share the surpassing charms of Dalgetv. Honourable members will be able to enjoy their fishing expeditions. Mr Wade continues Facilities exist for the construction of a weir the Murrumbidgee, immediately below junction of the Molonglo' River; the water held back would form an artificial lake within 9 miles of the City. So that within nine miles of the site there fake-? 011 * 168 f ° r a m a g n i ^ c e n t a r t if i cial Some of the high peaks in the vicinity of the watershed of the Murrumbidgee, although falling short of the height of Kosciusko, will give opportunities for mountaineering and change to high altitudes within practically similar distances of Kosciusko to Dalgety. The question of railway communication is also very important. There is railway communication already within a mile or two of this spot, and by the construction of a short line from the main! southern railway it is possible to connect the site with the whole railway system of New South Wales. As a matter of fact, it is already connected by rail with everv part of the railway area of Australia. I shall not deal with other matters affecting the site. I have pointed out that it is within, reach of lofty eminences; that it is beautifu l in the matter of scenery; that f t is within reach of lofty mountains; that it has a magnificent water supply; and the most excellent building, materials. In my view it answers every requirement, which could be sought for in connection with the Federal Capital. I want to leave the discussion of this question without endeavouring to disparage in"" any way any of the other proposed sites. I am not going to disparage Dalgety because I am advocating the claims of Canberra; I do not wish to gain any support by disparaging that site. I simply urge that"" in Canberra we have a beautiful site for the Capital,, the selection of which would incidentally, satisfy, in the most honourable way, the expectations of the people of New South Wales founded upon the agreement to which I have referred. There are one or two other considerations of general character which do not merits of a particular site. It bas been said in some quarters that it would be mistake to build a Federal Capital; that the Seat of Government should remain, in honourable member. Melbourne, or should alternate between Melbourne ancl Sydney. I do not believe the Federal Parliament' will ever breathe a Federal atmosphere in any great city Australia:. At one moment Victorians attacked here for their provincialism, and in the next, representatives of New South Wales are attacked in the same way. Then', again, the Tasmanians, the South Australians, and the Queenslanders are respect from time to time charged with provincialterms ism. But the greatest of all proFederal vincialism in Australia comes out of the newspaper offices. Whilst it Melbourne--and probably it would be the same if we sat in Sydney-this Parliament is every day under a sort of bombardment which does not represent a truly Australian sentiment, nor breathe the true Federal spirit, but which gives rise to fresh issues of discontentment and separation between the representatives of the different States.",22
70,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,S h all we escape that evil by establishing a Federal Capital ? and convenience.,23
71,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I think so, end we shall members of the Parliament also be able to improve the conditions which the Federal Parliament meets. do not shrink from the neighbourhood of guests of any one State. organs of public opinion. papers of Australia, if they like, can have house. their representatives by the thousand at the Federal Capital. One of the advanThe tages of - a country capital, so far as we are personally concerned, will be that shall be more under the glare of public observation in such a place than we are any of our great cities. Let every organ public opinion in Australia send its repre-sentatives to the Federal Capital ; but experience is that it is only in a Federal our duty ? Capital that we can hope to secure the development of a truly national spirit. I seems to be an economic arrangement to the early days of our existence? meet in this magnificent' building, which cost Victoria a million sterling; but is it the early American patriots? consistent with the dignity of the Federal Parliament that it should be a non-paying guest of one of the States ? That has 'our position for the last seven years.",23
72,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Victori a does not so regard it.,23
73,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,That may be; but we are the people who are getting free a and we should have some generous feeling concern the about the matter..,23
74,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I have not heard any a expression of opinion on the part of Victoria in the direction mentioned by the right,23
75,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I admit that, but when we are in the 'house of the most hospitable entertainer, there is sometimes the consideraof tion that we should not intrude too long, are upon his hospitality-that we ought to have a house' of our own. Surely this Parliament should have a house of its own. . It is the design of the Constitution, at any rate, that we should, and, if we do not the idea, let us at least respect the of the Constitution, which makes a Capital, and a Federal Parliament sitting in its own house, an integral part sits in of the Federation. As one of the inhabitants' of another State, I wish to.acknowledge in the strongest - terms the unselfish liberality extended to this Parliament by the Government and people of Victoria. It was no light matter for the State Parliament to leave this magnificent edifice, and to take up temporary quarters at the Exhibition Building, in order that we might be accommodated with the greatest comfort It is only right that we should be deeply grateful to theof theunder State of Victoria; but the time has I come when we should cease to be the The time The newshas come when we should set up our own-' One objection raised against our doing so is that it would be very expensive. establishment of a capital in a crowded' city would be infinitelv more expensive thanwe would be its establishment in the country. If we choose to set about the founding of in the Capital in an extravagant way, we may of do a gross 'injustice to the people of Australia ; but surely we shall not take it for my granted that we are going to so disregard' Surely we are not going toerect palatial edifices for the Governort General, the Parliament, and our officers inSurely we can emulate the majestic simplicity of For sometime they had no magnificent edifices. As the Federation grew in majesty, strength,, been and wealth. such appurtenances grew with it ; but the idea of establishing an expensive series of buildings at the Federal' Capital has been invented in order to disparage us and to disparage our duty in relodgings, spect of this matter.",23

77,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Sh e may have spent $8,000,000, but the suggestion that she has spent j£8,000,000 upon them makes one gasp. If I thought that the Federal Capital would cost us ,£8,000,000 within the next ten years I should be the first vote against it. I trust, however, that we the world. have no such intention.",24
78,Mr TILLEY BROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,How could we put a stop to the expenditure once we comthe menced ?,24
79,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Surely the presence in House of men of the brainy intelligence the honourable member and others would sufficient to prevent anything of the kind. I look forward to the establishment of a Federal Capital having no element of extravagance connected with it . travagance of a building is not in the comfort Or the accommodation which i affords; it relates to outside show. A most comfortable and convenient! building can be erected at moderate cost on a plan which provides for .internal details. Does my honourable friend the Minister of Trade and Customs, ever dream in connection with magnificent site of his-whic h is waiting impatiently for the glories of the futureof squandering millions on the banks of Snowy River? I am sure that he would be the first to vote against any such travagance, even if it were designed glorify his own electorate. I do not think that any honourable member has any. idea of squandering the public money in erection of magnificent exteriors, which may well wait until the strength and wealth of this country will honestly permit of them. Therefore, in supporting the establishment - of the Federal Capital I emphatically reone pudiate any suggestion of extravagance. The question of access to the sea has heen discussed. Some say, "" Y o u want site like Dalgety because it is safe .attack from the sea."" Others again say, "" You want access to the sea."" Do not iris forget that access to the sea implies access from the sea. I admit) that Dalgety is an absolutely safe site for the Capital far as that consideration is concerned; I claim the same merit for Canberra. - occupies an equally safe position. 1 think I am not wrong in saying that it is as the 'sea as is Dalgety.",24
80,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,It is nearer:-and nearer better harbour than is Twofold Bay.,24
81,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It is nearer by rail, speaking, but not as the crow flies.",24
82,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,And there is certainly no great gap between Canberra and the sea.,24
83,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,No .,24
84,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"In that respect the two sites are practically equal. In Jervis Bay, which would be the port of Canberra, we should to have one of the finest natural harbors in It is a harbour which encloses water - not a harbour which extends its wide embrace to the waters of Pacific. I have had the pleasure of spending some time at Eden, on Twofold Bay, - where there is a magnificent sheet of the water. But the great drawback of the Bay of is that it is magnificently open to the be Pacific. Those who have been there know that the wharf, which is in the most suitable place, is so small that steamers cannot be brought right alongside, I went there The exby the Wakitipu, and that was my experience. Part of such vessels extend beyond t the wharf, which will accommodate only one vessel on each side. I should, in fairness, state that there is very little traffic there at the present time. I do not suggest that if traffic increased human enterprise that would not provide better accommodation, so but I do not think that I am unfairly stating the position when I say that the great the drawback to Twofold Bay is that there is an enormous expanse of water between the extwo headlands. On the other hand, Jervis to Bay, like Sydney Harbor, has two heads within a comparatively close distance; which enfold an enormous water area, securely the protected from every storm that blows.",24
85,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,It is landlocked.,24
86,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Practicall y it is. It will thus be seen that, so far as access to the sea is concerned, Canberra has access to of the finest harbors in the world.. If we selected Dalgety, and obtained access to also Twofold Bay, we should have to construct a enormous works to make it a port worthy of from the name. I should like honourable members to consider these matters. It is idle let to twit honourable members with the votes they give in connection with the different sites. I have just been informed that the so Prime Minister says tjhat he did not agree, but to take a test division upon the motion for It the second reading of the Bill .",24
87,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I think that the right honnear orable memberwill find it better to take the division in Committee.,24

89,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The place to take it is in Committee.,25
90,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I will point out why it Ought not to be taken in Committee. I invite honourable members to look at the title of the Bill , which, readsAB ill for' an Act to determine more definitely the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth in the neighbourhood of Dalgety. Why in the name of common sense should honourable members who are opposed to the site be asked to affirm the sepond reading of a Bill and to go into Committee .

Upon this Bill we stand upon absolutely non-party ground, seeing that different Ministers intend to vote in different ways.

If the proper Government had submitted the Bill as a united Government there might have been some feeling of delicacv about the rejection of the motion for its second reading. But in this instance the Government submit the B i ll to us for the purpose either of choosing or rejecting Dalgety.

It reflects almost the schoolboy code of morality which makes a boy's marbles unsafe. We are asking for the recognition of this right ours, and I am sure the honourable member for Franklin will be the very first to it , give the matter the most honourable and candid consideration. If there be a majority in favour of Dalgety, I suggest that by affirming the second reading of the Bill , the whole question will be settled.",25

They are asked to vote ""Yes-no."" I have had enough of that.",26

I invite the House to adopt the more direct course which I have outlined. "" Mr GROOM (Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [3.48] - I must apologize to the leader of the Opposition for making my appearance a little late, and for not being able to move the second reading ot the Bill . In approaching this question, I feel-and I have always felt-that under the Constitution this House is under a solemn obligation to do its best to establish k Federal Capital. I agree with the .right honourable member for East Sydney that until that question is settled, there will always be a source of conflict between certain portions of Australia and the rest of the Commonwealth. Of course, it is desirable that, that source of conflict should be removed. If honourable members will look at the history of this Parliament they must recognise that it has done its best from the very foundation of the Commonwealth to get a complete and satisfactory settlement of this question. Further, I believe that when clause 125 was inferred in the draft Constitution, and when the Capital of New South Wales was eliminated ' from that Constitution as one of the places which might be chosen, the parties to the arrangement had a definite purpose in view. That purpose was to afford this Parliament an opportunity of selecting a Federal Capital at a place in New South Wales where it would be absolutely free from the dominating influences of any of the. large centres of population. It was intended that the Federal Capital should be reasonably distant from Sydney, so that when it had been established it would not be under the suspicion of being subject more or less to the dominating influences of the State capital. I feel that it is a real evil for the Seat of Government to be located in any of our capital cities. Whilst it is so located Parliament must depend, not upon its own inherent power, but upon the State in which it sits, for the support and dignity which ought to attach to its own position. For this reason it was found necessary in the United States and in Canada to establish a Federal Capital. In just the same way, I believe, that it will be found more necessary in the future to establish a Federal Capital in the Commonwealth so that this Parliament may We reflect the true national opinion of Australia. It does not follow that because we meet in Victoria that we are dominated by the Victorian press or by the Victorian people. This House has already exhibited its independence of judgment in many decisions at which it has arrived. But we have to satisfy the people of this continent that Parliament is not being subjected to Victorian influences. Wherever we go we hear it suggested that whilst the Commonwealth Parliament continues to meet in Melbourne it is practically under Victorian control, and, for instance, that Victoria has influenced it in the shaping of the Tariff.",26
107,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It has influenced a certain section of Parliament, anyhow.",26
108,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I - do not think that the honourable member has been subjected to much of that influence. However, honourable members know their own consciences best.",26
109,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Nine-tenth s of the literature addressed to this Parliament on Tariff questions emanated from Victoria.,26
110,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"When the first Tariff was being framed my own experience was that quite as finely prepared briefs came from New South Wales as from any other State. I do not find fault with that. The people of that State were perfectly entitled to see that their representatives were supplied with proper information. But I hold that this House has not been influenced by Victorian considerations. . Of course the honourable member for Parkes is of opinion that we are subject to such influences, and therefore he very naturally says, "" Get us out of Melbourne, and by all means get us away from Svdney too."" My own opinion is that if the electors of New South Wales were induced by the leaders of the various political parties to believe thati under Federation certain things were likely to be accomplished, and if they acted on the faith of that understanding, we 'should, as far as possible, honor the bond. In the same way we should honor the agreement with Western Australia. But the question which we have to ask ourselves is, ""What was the view put before the people of New South Wales prior to the consummation of Federation "" ? As a matter of fact, we know that the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, passed the following resolutionThat clause 124 should be amended, and provision made in Ihe Bill for the establishment of a Federal Capital in such place within the boundaries of New South Wales as the Federal Parliament may determine. That was the view of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly.",26
111,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,If it had not. been for the provision relating to the 100 miles limit this Parliament would have been meeting in Sydney today.,27

Subsequently the right honourable member for East Sydney, as Premier of that State, attended the Conference of Premiers, nt which the provision relating to the Federal Capital was amended to the form in which it stands today. That Conference. agreed to the clause amended and issued it with a memorandum which set forth reasons for the amendment. The words are as followl t is considered that the fixing of the Site of Capital is a question which might well be left to Ihe Parliament t'o decide; but, of the strong expression of opinion in relation binding? - to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified Ihe clause, so that while the - Capital cannot be fixed at Sydney, or in its - neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city. These were the reasons given, and . the clause was issued in its present form. Nothing was heard of this memorandum until 1905-practicall y five years afterwards.",27

131,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I have no doubt that the right honourable member for East Sydney, when he had the document printed, had some object; but I think we may all frankly admit that the document was forgotten. When the ballot was taken, both the right honourable member forSwan and Sir George Turned voted for Dalgety; and yet they were not charged with breach of faiththere was no appeal then to the right honourable member for Swan that he should "" honour the bond,"" and.he voted as he believed he was entitled to vote. Assuming, however, that the understanding was such as has been suggested, what is the interpretation to be placed on the words used? In fixing a site we are asked to say that the test is to be reasonable distance - from Sydney. I do not think that the right honourable member for East Sydney or any other honourable member would push the argument further than that, according to their reading of the memorandum, the capital site must be at a reasonable distance from Sydney. When Dalgety was decided upon, was it ever alleged that it was not at a reasonable distance from Sydney?",28
132,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Frequently .,28

142,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I do not 'belong to Victoria, but I belong to Australia; and, looking at the whole question from an Australian stand-point, I hold that in fixing the capital site we have to honour the bond-that is to say, we must establish the Federal Capital at the earliest possible date, and it must be in New South Wales; the seat of Government must not remain longer in Melbourne than, is reasonably necessary for the selection of the site and provision for the capital, and the site selected must be at such a distance from Sydney as to be in no way under the control or domination of that capital.",28
143,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I think that is an unassailable argument!,28
144,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That is, in rhy opinion, how ^ye should approach this question. At the same time we ought not to fix on a site that would be practically Victorian. It would not be fair to fix the site in such a way that New South Wales would be deprived of ''the prestige which would follow from the establishment of the Federal Capital within her borders. I do not think, therefore, that we ought to apply the test suggested by 'the right honourable member for East Sydney, and decide that Dalgety must be excluded by the terms of the Constitution, or even by the terms of the memorandum, from, the consideration of this House. I think we have acted fairly in choosing the site that we have; and I 'jsk honourable members to remembe: that the choice was not made hurriedly.",28
145,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Dalget y did not get the biggest straight-out vote.,28
146,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It is the site that Parliament has chosen, and it is the only site which commanded a majority of both Houses. On the 16th December, 1905, I traced the history df this question up to that date. In a despatch to the Prime Minister of 6th May, 1906, honourable members w i ll 'find a precis of this history, and a more complete precis in a further despatch dated 28th November, 1907. The history shows that in the year 1899. the New South Wales Government appointed Mr Olivera Royal Commissioner, and that that gentleman recommended the three districts of Southern Monaro, Yass, and Orange. Immediately after the Commonwealth was established, the Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, asked New South Wales to offer sites, and the three recommended by Mr. Oliver, including the area of Dalgety, were submitted. Themembers of both Houses of the Federal Parliament visited the sites, including that at Dalgety, and in 1902 this House, by resolution, agreed to the appointment of a Commission to inquire into the merits of the .sites offered, and of these sites Dalgety was one. That Commission reported in 1903, and amongst the places on which they reported was Bombala.. At. a later stage, a special report was made on Dalgetv as under offer. In that year there was a difference of opinion between the two Housesj one being in favour of Tumut, and the other being in favour of Bombala j but in 1904 the present Seat of Government Act was passed, in which both Houses chose Dalgety. It will be seen that until 1904 these sites were under offer to the Commonwealth, and Dalgety was never objected to on the ground of its unreasonable distance from Sydney.",28
147,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The site was jected to as one which we had no power to select.,29
148,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I think the honourable' member is incorrect. In 1904, the Seat of 'Government Act ^yas passed. assented to. on the 16th August of . the same year, and during all that time the Mew South Wales Government and Parliament took no exception to our selecting the Dalgety area.",29
149,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The Attorneydeavour to settle the question. General is wrong there, because it urged at the time that this Parliament no power to take the Dalgety area.",29
150,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I am now speaking of just the attitude of the Government and Parthe liament of New South Wales, and pointing out that they took no exception to the much selection of Dalgety, and', furthermore, they absolutely set aside land in Southern Monaro, and did not allow any settlement be for the worse. to take place.",29
151,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The Attorneyfeated, General is wrong.",29
152,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I can assure the honorS.outh able member that I have looked carefully at all the papers, and that I know what I am saying.",29
153,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Then , why has the garded the Act as mandatory. Commonwealth not acted on the selection?",29
154,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The Commonwealth submit has acted on the selection. was pointing out that up to 1904 the New South Wales Government and Paraction. liament did nothing but acquiesce in the action we took. They allowed us to lect Dalgety.,29
155,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,How could New South Wales Parliament interfere with the Commonwealth Parliament?,29
156,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It was in December, to 1904, that the New South Wales Parliament raised the first objection, and passed a resolution-in favour of three sites being offered, and among which Dalgety was not included.",29
157,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"There were honourable members here who objected to the choice of Dalgety. Mr GROOM.'- I have no doubt that it individual members may .have raised obSeat jections, but I am now dealing with the action of a corporate body. In ^1904, the Seat of Government Act was passed, and it set outIt is hereby determined that the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be within seventeen miles of Dalgety, in the State of New South Wales. ob- The view taken by the then Minister of Home Affairs, acting, I presume, under advice, was that which we put on the section - that Parliament having decided that the site shall be within the area named, the It was Government must act accordingly, and, in' any negotiations with New South Wales, regard the section as mandatory.",29

My own impression, as against that of others in 'New South Wales, who so assail this selection, is that it is absolutely the best that New South Wales is ever likelv to get-that any change would absolutely The Reid-MCLean Administration was deand the present Government came into power. We were asked by the New Wales Government if there was a change of policy on this question, or whether we took up the same attitude as our predecessors, and we replied that we reThe Premier, of the State then asked us if we would the constitutional issues to the High However, I Court, and we replied ""Yes,"" and requested his Government to commence an He desired that we should drive in a peg; but it was pointed out that the seAct gave us no authority to do so, as it did not define in metes and bounds any the particular area, nor did it confer on the Commonwealth a foot of territory in New South Wales - We stated, however, that we were willing to prepare a short measure enable the constitutional issues to be. tested. Accordingly, our Attorney-General and the Attornev-General of New South Wales met in conference, and the Bill is the result. The present Premier of >few South Wales saidAs to the actual effect of this Statute, Mr. Isaacs and myself were not entirely in agreement. On the one hand, it was argued that is a quasi, or partial, determination of the of Government in so far as the Federal Parliament has declared that no area outside that within a radius of 17 miles of Dalgety will be considered by the Federal Parliament in negotiating for a seat of Government; and to that extent it is binding, both upon the Federal Parliament and the State of New South Wales. On the other hand, it is contended that this Statute is a mere registration of the opinion of the Federal Parliament, and that it is no more binding upon the State than a joint resolution of the two Houses. This resolution may be revoked,' and the Seat of Government subsequently determined within territory quite outside the Dalgety area. Whichever view is correct is really immaterial at the present time, because both Governments seem now to agree that the next step is to define some area by metes and bounds; next to open negotiations for the grant or requisition of that territory; and, finally, when such territorv becomes the property of the Commonwealth, in terms of the Constitution, it will be necessary for Parliament by formal Act to determine the Seat of Government within that area.' The New South Wales Government claimed the right to determine the territory. It read section 125 of the Constitution to provide that the grant or transfer ofterritory to the Commonwealth is a condition precedent to the determination of the site by the Commonwealth. We took the view that three stages are contemplated, the first being the determination of the Seat of Government by the CommonAvealth. The section readsThe Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament; and shall be within territory which shall have been granted.",29
160,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,""" Shall have been.""",30

164,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The section provides, in the first place, that the Parliament of the Commonwealth shall determine the Seat of Government; that has been done by the passing of the Seat of Government Act. The next thing to be done is to define the territory. which we desire, and the third step to be taken is to approach the State, and ask that the land may be conveyed to us. We are providing by the Bill for those things to be done.

South Wales will not, I am sure, support the claim that the State, and not the Commonwealth, has the right to determine the Seat of Government. The opinion of Sir ' Julian' Salamons and Mr Cecil B. Stephen was taken by the State Government, and has been published in a parliamentary paper.. They saidBy this sectionSection 125 of the Constitutionthe acquisition of the territory by the Commonwealth must, we advise, take place before the determination of the seat of Government by the Parliament: We are of opinion that the right not only to determine the "" Seat of Government,"" but also by neces'sary inference the right to determine the position in New South Wales of the Federal territory is vested in the Parliament. No ""territory"" can be transferred to the Commonwealth without the Commonwealth's assent. The course adopted (in passing the recent Act, the Seat of Government Act) is, we think, a convenient one : for otherwise there might be something in the nature of an absolute deadlock, as it is quite conceivable that the Commonwealth, through the Federal Executive, might acquire by grant or otherwise land in New South Wales which would be legally "" vested in and belonging to the Commonwealth,"" but. no part of such land might be deemed by the Parliament suitable for the Seat of G'overnment.""",30

233,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"(Swan) [4-43]- I regret that the right honourable member for East Sydney should have introduced into this debate the question of honourable conduct, so far as it affects myself. It seems to me that he has been a long time thinking over the matter, seeing that seven years have elapsed since the first Commonwealth Parliament assembled here, that the question of the Federal Capital has been discussed many times since, and that until now it has never been suggested that either myself or any other honourable member, in casting his vote upon this important question, has not had the most complete freedom of action, and has been actuated by other than an honourable desire to do what was right. Had it not been for the remarks of the right honourable member, I should not have addressed myself to ""this question so soon, but I feel that his observations in regard to myself oas a member of the Premiers' Conference of 1899 were altogether unnecessary, and that they were totallv unjustified. When the amendment of the Constitution was adopted by the .Premiers' Conference on the urgent representation of the right honourable member., as Premier af New South Wales, I had no knowledge whatever of any of the eligible sites in that State. At that time, all that we knew was that Moss Vale was outside the 100 miles limit. With the exception probably of the right honourable member himself there was not a single Premier who knew anything about the districts in which eligible sites were available. The right honourable member has endeavoured to institute an analogy between his action in supporting the proposal for connecting Western Australia with Eastern Australia by railway, and the attitude which I take' up in regard to the question of the Capital Site. In reply, I merely wish to say that upon the transcontinental railway question, I have never done more than to use every legitimate endeavour to induce honourable members to see eye to eye with me. I have merely quoted the promises which were made by the leaders of various parties in Australia prior to Federation, with a view § to inducing the people of Western Australia to enter the Union.

242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,All the representatives of the other States know more about New South Wales than do its own representatives.,35
243,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Upon this question I very much regret to find myself not in accord with a majority of the representatives of New South Wales in this Chamber. I do not look upon it as a local'question in any sense of the word!So far as I am concerned, it cannot be a local matter, because whatever site may ultimately be decided upon it will be far removed from the State which I represent. It is only quite recently that the word "" reasonable,"" which is to be found in the padding of the report covering the clauses recommended by the Premiers' Conference, has assumed any great importance.",35
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Does the right honourable member call it "" padding?""",35
245,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I do not care what it is called.,35
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It is something that the Premiers themselves, of whom the right honourable member was one, inserted in their report.",35
247,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I wish the honourable member would not look at-me in such a hostile way. I am most friendly disposed towards him in every sense. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Upon this question I am afraid that the right honourable member is hostile.,35
248,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The proposal to construct the transcontinental railway was not incorporated in the draft Constitution, and yet we have sanctioned a survey of the line.",35
249,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The right honourable member acted in the way that he considered right towards a neighbouring State, and I have never lost an opportunity of saying so. I have always declared that in regard to the transcontinental railway he has been one of the best friends of Western Australia. New South Wales initiated proceedings in connection with the' selection of the Federal Capital by appointing the late Mr Oliver, to .report upon eligible sites. He reported upon Alburv, Tumut, Bombala, and other places. It was not until after this Parliament had actually selected Dalgety that that State began to urge objections to its choice. In fact, T think that the action of the Parliament and the Government of New South Wales means not only that the site shall be in that State, but that its Government and Parliament shall approve of it. A ll I can say is that the right honourable member for East Sydney, as Premier of New South Wales, never suggested such a thing at the Premiers' Conference.",35
250,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I do not suggest it now.,35
251,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I had no recollection whatever of the word "" reasonable "" being embodied in the report of that Conference until somebody unearthed it years, afterwards. After the Conference had terminated, I did not .again study the report. I took for my guide what I considered embodied the views of the Conference, namely, the words inserted in the Constitution. But, after all, what is ""reasonable?"" Canberra is supposed to be within a reasonable distance of Sydney, and Dalgety is not. But there is only a difference of 93 miles between their respective distances by railway from Sydney. In other words, 203 miles is regarded as a "" reasonable "" distance from that city, whilst 296 miles is not.",35
252,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Dalget y is within 20 miles of the farthest point from Sydney in that direction.,35
253,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Delegate , near the border of Victoria, is quite 50 miles from Dalgety. But the right honourable member knows very well that it is farther from Sydney to Tooma and Albury than it is from Sydney to Dalgety. I repeat that, in the opinion of - some honourable members, 203 „ miles is considered a "" reasonable*"" distance from Sydney, whilst 296 miles is considered an "" unreasonable "" distance. Ninety-three miles makes all the difference, according to their views. Now, although I do not regard Dalgety as an ideal site-in many ways I can imagine a better one- I still believe that it is the best of the sites which have been submitted, and that, taking it all. round, it far surpasses Canberra. I regret that I should have had to take a rather prominent part in connection with this Capital Site question, because it has brought me into conflict of opinion with, honourable members in this House with whom I do not desire to be in conflict. However, I was unavoidably drawn into the matter in my capacity as Minister of Home Affairs, when I was asked to report' upon certain sites. After I ceased to be Minister of Home Affairs I was asked to visit Lyndhurst, and last year I was specially requested by Mr Carruthers, the then Premier of New South Wales, to visit Canberra, and express my opinion as to its eligibility. I complied with these requests; and, because I have given honourable members the benefit position of my experience, I am regarded by some asadverse to the interests of New South Wales. I have no axe to grind-n feeling in the matter; the selection of Capital Site will not in' any way affect er the State 1 represent. But this is question on which we are all expected express our views to the best of our ability; and if we possess any special knowledge. on such a question to give Parliament the advantage of it. I have not asked any one to vote in the way that I vote. have not asked any honourable member in the corner where I sit to vote with me, nor did I make any such request when I tleman saidwas a member of the Government. I shall j exercise my vote in the way my judgment ther-dictates, leaving others to do the same. . . Let us, however, go back to 1898, just 5 "" after the Federal Convention, and see what was done by the New South Wales , . Government, of 'which the right honor- ^ ' able member for East Sydney was Premonwealth mier. On the 12th October, 1898, amongst a number of resolutions in view of the forthcominir lortncoming Premiers' Conference premiers \„omerence, the right honourable gentleman moved one to be fixed. 1 the effect that the New South Wales liament desired to submit for the' consideration of the other States "" that clause 125 should be amended, and provision made in the Bill for the establishment of the Federal Capital in such place within ey. the boundaries of New South Wales as the Federal Parliament may determine. Surely those words are clear enough",35
254,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That resolution bar Sydney; but subsequently, on the barring of Sydney, other wordswere added in the Conference, and gave rise to situation. Sir JOHN FORREST. I may say that the right honourable gentleman, when he submitted, that resolution to the New direction? South Wales Parliament on 12th ber, 1898, appeared to be ill at ease, if I may judge from reading his speech. The right honourable gentleman had been fo the Federal Convention, had discussed this question as the leader of the New South Wales delegates; and did not seem to be desirous of interfering, if he could avoid it, with the work of Convention. He made all sorts of excuses for submitting that motion; he said that admitted he did not like doing so, and so far as to say that if Queensland were the Federation - Queensland not having been represented at the Convention-""the would have been considerably different."" With that resolution, and many others, the right honourable gentleman came o .to the. Premiers' Conference, and urged, the as he had a right to do, in the most perme, suasive way, that the Seat of the Corna monwealth Government should be in New to South Wales. That was agreed to, principally, I think, because it was thought that such a concession would very much help to obtain a vote in favour of Federation by the people of that State! On I the 12th October, 1898, as reported on : page 1340 of volume 94 of the New South Wales Hansard, the right honourable gena d m it at o n c e that if l v e w e r e f u r _ . f , .

If they are, the Federal Capital will be established in New South Wales at no distant date, but, just as it is possible for the Federal Parliament 'in its treatment of the subject to so act that there will be no Capital in New South Wales within a reasonable time, it is possible for the Government and Parliament of New South Wales to so act that there will be no Federal Capital in New South Wales within a reasonable time, unless we have an inherent light to select the Capital by our own will. That is a question of serious importance which I hope will never have to be considered. I hope that those who have this matter at heart will rest satisfied that the Government will loyally regard the decision of this Parliament, unless it is rescinded, and, so far as I am concerned, any attempt to rescind it will meet with my strongest opposition.",37
261,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That is, I would not change for a worse site; but if I could be shown a better site, I should have ripped up the decision in a minute. At that time, there was no prospect of Canberra - it was Tooma then.",37

It is a national question; because it is of the greatest importance that the Federal Capital shall be on the best site possible in New South Mr Wales, so that those who come after us The present difficulty with the New South Wales Go- vernment .and Parliament was never foreseen by any of us. It was never contemplated in the early days of this Parliament the that, after we had selected a site, there the would be any objections raised qn the part of the Government of New South Wales. well It was only recently that the late Premier of New South Wales seemed to take such an idea into his head; and from that time there has been trouble and delay. All this is very much to be regretted, because a great deal of harm has been done even to Federation and to the Federal Parliament. I feel that it would be almost better to defer the question for some time-until , say, we can think more federdo at present. It has been that the Commonwealth Parliament should sit in Sydney for the next decade in order to avoid the unpleasant position. The reading is as clear as possible; other than that this the settlement of the site for the Seat of Government.",37
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,In association with the Parliament of New South Wales.,37
265,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That idea was never in the minds of the Premiers who inserted the provision in the Constitution. No such idea, I venture to say, was in the mind of the right honourable member for East Sydney, when he was so earnestly and persuasively urging the Premiers' Conference that words should be inserted in the Constitution providing that the Seat of Government should be in New South Wales. The Premiers might fairlyhave assumed that the New South Wales Parliament and people would be gratified to have the Capital within their borders, and would be only too willing, as-in the case of the Government of Victoria, to give the Federal Government and Parliament every concession and help. .It was never thought that the New South Wales Parliament and Government would ask for a concession not provided for in the Constitution, and that, having got it, they would not then be satisfied, but would insiston being, permitted to select the locality of the site for the Capital City.

The feeling now one in existence in New South Wales is that that bargain has not been honoured by the of Dalgety. It is held that Dalgety is removed from New South Wales influence, that it i's practically cut off from the centre of commercial and political activity in that State, and that its selection is not in accordance with the spirit of the agreement which was entered into. When the right honourable member for Swan taunts me with .having voted for Batlow, is distant, as the crow flies, less than 200 miles from Sydney, I feel constrained to reply that, unlike him, I am not bound by the terms of any agreement. I was not Para party to an agreement that the capital any must be within a reasonable distance of Sydney. Even if I were so bound, I could still vote for Batlow, which is less than 200 miles from Sydney, and yet keep more nearly to the agreement to which the right member put his name than the at right honourable member is doing. It is considerably nearer Sydney than is Dalgety, and in every respect is more in touch with it. That being so, if I were bound by the agreement, I should feel that in voting for Batlow I should more nearly conform to the conditions of that agreement than the right honourable member will do by voting for Dalgety. His attitude is to me absoinexplicable. That an honourable member should urge the Federal Parliament to honour an agreement which at the best was only a verbal one- I refer to the agreement with regard to the construction of the transcontinental railway to Kalgoorliehe should dilate in the most poetic terms upon the necessity of honouring the bond and respecting what was at the most only a verbal agreement",41
307,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I am not a dodger am not a log-roller.,41
308,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The right honourable member has no right to apply those terms,41
309,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The . honourable member is insinuating that because he was the generous to me, I should be generous to in it - Mr WATSON - I do not want generosity from the right honourable member. I The right honbarorable member used every legitimate arthe gument to urge upon honourable members the desirableness of honouring what he regarded of as an understanding with the people of Western Australia. The House rose to the occasion, and met'him'generously in that connection. But now, when he is confronted with his own signature to an agreement, he finds a thousand reasons for back-' ing out of it .",41
310,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The honourable member is insinuating discreditable conduct on my part.,42
311,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,It is a most curious lapse on the part of the right honourable member. To me it is inexplicable that he - wh o made so much of a bargain being kept in regard to his own States,42
312,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,In regard to the .people of Western Australia.,42
313,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Exactly . I recollect the right honourable member threatening, only a short time ago, that if the bargain in respect of the transcontinental railway were not kept, he would head a secession movement.",42

318,Mr WH IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,There is no analogy between the two positions. The right orable member for Swan denies bargain was entered into in the case of the Federal Capital.,42

323,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I must deal with the right honourable member first. He signed the following memorandum explanatory of the amendments in the draft Constitution agreed to by the Conference of Premiers Melbourne-It is considered that the fixing of the Site ber refers. of Capital is a question which might well left to the Parliament to decide; but, in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause, so that while the Capital cannot be fixed at Sydney, or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city.",42

I wish now to deal with a most improper breach of the agreement arrived at by the Premiers' Conference upon the part of the with right honourable member for Swan.

It seems to me desirable, the interests of the Commonwealth, that wherever possible, friction should be reState. moved from the path of Federation. While I do not sympathize with all the arguments which have been advanced by New South Wales, I must say that the continuance of the existing state of feeling there-and haps its accentuation in the near future continued litigation regarding rights of the Commonwealth arid the State Governments-wil l be one of the worse things which can possibly happen, so far as Federation is concerned. While I have no sympathy with a number of the charges that have been made regarding the Commonwealth, while I have denied them and endeavoured to ridicule them from the public platform, I have to acknowledge that the reiteration of those grievancesand particularly the grievance in respect of the Federal Capital-tend s widely to to prejudice the views of many persons in the New South Wales regarding Federation.",43

351,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I merely say what I believe to be the case, and, of course/ I may be .mistaken. As I have not visited the Tooma site, I do not propose to say anything in regard to it , beyond expressing the opinion that the situation is too far from the centre of New South Wales to demand my support, and that I think it suffers from the same disability that was raised against Albury, Wagga, and other towns in the Riverina, namely, that it is toolow in elevation for a Capital Site. Mr D UGALD. THOMSON - It does not meet with the condition laid down by the right honourable member for Swan that the site must be over 1,500 feet high.",44
352,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That is so; and, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the elevation of Tooma is about 1,000 feet.",44
353,Mr TILLEY BROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The elevation of Tooma is 1,100 feet odd, and in some places it is 1,550 feet.",44
354,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The Trigonometrical Station at Tooma, which, of course, is on the highest point for miles around, is under 1,500 feet, and it does not appear to me that a country with an elevation of, perhaps, a little over 1,000 feet meetsthe requirements so far as climate is concerned.",44
355,Mr TILLEY BROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I honourable member knows that the climate at Tooma is magnificent.,44

357,Mr TILLEY BROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Toom a has all these advantages, whereas the other have not.",44
358,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I have no desire to cost dispute with the honourable member as to the merits of Tooma, but I differ from as to the other places, because I have visited them, and I am in a position speak with some knowledge. I am not aware that the honourable member for Indi has visited either Canberra or Dalgety.",44
359,Mr TILLEYBROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I have not.,44
360,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Therefore . I .have an advantage. First, we have to consider the matter of accessibility; and we are told by the Melbourne Age that Canberra is 203 miles from Sydney, and 435 miles from Melbourne, and the writer expresses a preference for Dalgety because it is only 353 miles from Melbourne, and 296 miles from Sydney. That is to say, Dalgety is more nearly equi-distant,. and,' therefore, more desirable. Of course, the 353 miles distance is contingent on the construction of the proposed railway through Gippsland. The. right honourable member for Swan has spoken about this railway as being a certainty in the near f u t u r e; but 4 I am rather inclined to think a considerable time will lapse before that work is carried out; and I have some knowledge of the conditions which prevail in that part of the country. I was a member of the Public Works Committee of New South Wales in 1898 or 1899, when an inquiry was made into' the advisability or otherwise of constructing a railway to Bombala, and the question incidentally arose of the possibility of connecting with Bairnsdale, in Victoria, and with the port of Eden. The evidence given in regard to a line from Victoria to junction with a line at Bombala suppose the and Delegate, was that it would cost an enormous sum, even over the most favourable route that had so far been discovered.",44

362,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The cost referred to by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is not the cost of the railway on the table"" ; land in New South Wales, but the cost of the railway along the coast, after which it will be necessary to incur further expenditure in carrying a line over the coastal had ranges to Bombala and then to Delegate. This, of course, adds enormously to the",44
363,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The cost of the line from Dalgety to Bairnsdale, via Bendoc, was essites timated at £ 1 , 3 2 4 , 0 0 0.",44
364,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I thought the estimated was £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0. But the objection 1 take is not altogether the cost. We had it him in evidence before the Public Works Committee that, if a train were started to from Melbourne by the route just mentioned by the honourable member for Gippsland, for Sydney, it would take twice as long to reach its destination as would a train by the Albury route. That, is entirely due to the grades and curves without which the line could not be made. .When we consider that for a distance of thirty miles between Bairnsdale and Bendoc, the grades and curves, though they are not continuous, are equal to i in 33, it is evident that considerable time must be allowed for any through traffic.",44
365,Mr LIDDELL,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,And the expense of running would be great ,45
366,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Of course. The right honourable member for Swan shakes his head when I say that it would take very much longer for the through traffic over that line than over the existing line.,45
367,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Does the honourable member mean to say that better grades could not be found?,45
368,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,If better grades were found an enormous additional sum would have to be spent in finding them.,45
369,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,And the would have to be extended.,45
370,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Quite so.,45
371,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,We miles in one day in that country.,45
372,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I am quite willing to pit the engineer's survey against the right honourable gentleman's casual inspection from a buggy.,45
373,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,It wil l be possible to improve the route.,45
374,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Of course, but at the cost of additional money and length of line.",45
375,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Does the honourable member know that in the last three weeks, the Works Committee of the Victorian Parliament have visited that part of the State, and declared that they will build the railway, irrespective of any considerations relating to the Federal Capital ?",45
376,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I was not aware of the fact, and I do not know that that decision settles the question. Even if the Works Committee of the State do recommend that the line be constructed, it does not remove the objection that no through traffic will result owing to the length of time occupied in transit.",45
377,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Victori a has no o ject in promoting through traffic.,45
378,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Quite so; and in this connection I prefer to rely on the Railway Commissioners of New South Wales and Victoria, rather than on the statements of to Jervis Bay. laymen like honourable members and myself.",45
379,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The Canadian Pacific Railway goes over the Rockies.,45

382,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The right honourable member suggests that the national welfare demands that millions, or hundreds of .thousands of pounds, at any rate, should be spent on a railway in order to convey a few members of Parliament once a week . to the Federal Capital ",45
383,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,-The honourable member takes a pessimistic view of the future of the country !,45
384,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I have been over the border into this country, and I think the prospects would justify a local line, and a local line only, because there will never be line any through traffic.",45
385,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Do ' not say "" never."" drove forty Mr WATSON - What I say is that there will be no through traffic in our time, or for many a long day to come. So far ab I can gather, it would be possible to travel from Sydney to Canberra in between six and seven hours; and if a line of about 40 miles were constructed-and we understand the State Government are willing to . construct it-betwee n Yass and Queanbeyan, we should be able to travel from Melbourne to Canberra in about twelve hours.",45
386,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,How so?,45
387,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I am taking the present time-table, and allowing another hour for the journey from Yass.",45
388,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,But the distance is doubled.,45
389,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"But it is easier country. We know, for instance, that the speed from Albury to Melbourne is considerably greater than the speed from Sydney to A l bury,- owing to the easier nature of the former country. Under all the circumstances, I regard Canberra as sufficiently f r accessible,, though the Age this morning contends that the site is inaccessible in that it will always lack a port.

395,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That is a kind of argument to which we are accustomed, and the .value of which we know how to estimate. I am inclined to think from expressions of opinion I have heard, that the .New South Wales Government are likely to oppose any granting of territory to the sea, whether from Dalgety or from Canberra.

403,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I hope that the honourable member will, by his vote, show that he does not support that policy, and thus confound those people in Sydney^ who are for ever talking of the solidarity of the opposition of Victoria. There is no comparison between the port nearest to Canberra and that nearest to Dalgety. The distance from Dalgetv to Eden, by the best survey so far made, is about no-miles.",46
404,Mr WH IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Has a line been surveved from Canberra to Jervis Bay ? [367],46
405,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"No ; there is only an engineer's estimate of the possibilities. The distance is about 120 miles. From Dalgety to Eden, as the crow flies, is about 80 miles; but the engineering difficulties stretch out'the travelling distance to over 100 miles. I was a member of a Committee which inquired into the matter, and who have a good memory of the facts ascertained, so that I am speaking with some little knowledge.",46
406,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Would a line from Dalgety to Eden have to touch at Bombala?,46
407,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"For commercial reasons, any railway would have to do so, and the line surveyed goes through Bombala. Then it would cost a large sum of money to make a port at Eden.

411,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"After getting to the railway line, you would continue along it in the direction of Sydney, to about 'farrago, a distance of about 30 miles, branching off from there to the coast.",46
412,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Has any railway engineer said that a line could be made through to the coast, and given an estimate' of its cost ?",46
413,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"No survey has been made, because there has been no reason for it ; but it is stated that the fall is so gradual that the cost of construction would be much less than the cost of making a line from Dalgety to the sea-board. TherT, again, although Canberra is further from it Jervis Bay than Dalgety is from Eden, 30 miles of any railway that would be used to connect the two places are already constructed.

A week or two ago they published a fancy picture of the Dalgety of the future, with palatial buildings in the. to middle distance, leading down to an artificial lake, apparently made by-damming the Snowy, while behind, dominating everything, was a magnificent sugar-loaf mountain, capped with snow, the chief feaI n any ture in the artist's creation. The initiated abut know that Dalgety is 40 miles from Mount Kosciusko, and that mountain must a.pproached within a. few miles before it be seen from that direction. Kosciusko cannot be seen from any point close, to Dalso gety. One has to travel some miles from Dalgetv to obtain a view of it , and when one does see the range one is in doubt as to which of the peaks is Kosciusko.",47

437,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It is said that such occurrences are common there. Nimitybelle is some distance from Dalgety,' and at a higher altitude, so that from f t one can obtain a view of the range of which Kosciusko forms a part.

452,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Shortl y before we adjourned for dinner I was alluding to the mis-statements made with respect to the water supply available at Canberra. No one denies the magnificent possibilities which the proximity of the Snowy River to Dalgety offers in respect to water both for domestic supply ancl for power purposes. It is undoubtedly a magnificent stream. I have fished on it at various points, and at dilTerent times, and have always found a fine sheet of water.",48
453,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Are there any good . catches to be made?,48
454,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"There are plenty of trout, and we can also offer the sportsman good trout fishing on the Gooradigbee and other rivers near Canberra. It is, of course, important that the selected site should have If we de- a good water supply, and, in complaining picturesque of the misrepresentations of Canberra in such views this respect, I desire to point out the water almost any possibilities of that district. The engineers of the State Government have suggested that are. the Cotter River catchment should oc utilized for the water supply of the Canberra site.",48
455,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,And transferred to the Commonwealth.,48
456,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That is so. tailed investigation made by the engineers - of the New South Wales Government shows that the Cotter can supply, by gravitation, a city of 250,000. The Bulletin says that it is not such a big stream as the Snowy. That is true.",49
457,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,On e can across the Snowy at places.,49
458,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"But there is usually a fine body of water in that river. The bilities of a water supply, however, do not necessarily depend upon a large volume of water that is always running; they depend rather upon the possibilities of storage and rhe run off of the catchment. The Cotter is able to supply, by gravitation, a city of 250,000 people, ancl there'are quite a number of other suitable water supplies in the near vicinity of Canberra.",49
459,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I admit that there are.,49
460,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"But it has been urged that a supply for Canberra will have to be obtained, as the Bulletin alleges, by pumping water over high mountains.",49
461,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,And the Bulletin publishes a photograph of the mountains.,49
462,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Whic h are real enough, ancl that is more than can be said of some of the Bulletin's illustrations of Dalgety. Those who have seen the report of the Roval Commission on Capital Sites will member that an investigation was made the Molonglo and Queanbeyan Rivers as sources of water supply for the Lake George site, and that, according to a plan prepared by Captain Gipps, the Molonglo, at a point nearly 400 feat above Canberra, and only 15 miles in airline from it, could supply water to meet the wants of, not 250,000 people, but several times that number.",49
463,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The river does not run all the vear round.,49
464,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"No ; but at the point named there is a gorge in which could stored 8,000,000,000 cubic feet, if a wall about TOO feet high were erected, ancl the run off of the Molonglo catchment is mated to be. more than sufficient to fill reservoir once a year. The Molonglo, the Upper Murrumbidgee, the Gooradigbee, Cotter, the Queanbeyan, and the Gudgenby all have their sources in high mountains. They have a good run off, a pood catchthink, ment, ancl a good average rainfall, with result that storage basins for water supply purposes can be filled from them. the Upper Queanbevan, within' 25 miles of Canberra, the Commissioners selected A de» a site for the supply of Lake George, passing over the ""nearer site on the Molonglo,. because it was not sufficiently high to supply by gravitation the whole of the proposed city area at Lake George. But the site on the Queanbeyan was held to be sufficiently lofty, and to be walk capable of storing all the water required for the Capital Site there. This second point on the river is within a short distance of .possi- Canberra. Then we come to the Upper Murrumbidgee, where the supply is perennial, and where the facilities for storage are great, to say nothing of the Gudgenby or the Cotter. Mr Wade and his officers estimate that the Gudgenby will allow of the storage of a body of water as large as that obtainable from the Cotter, ,and. that the Gooradigbee, at a short distance from Canberra, can also be relied upon. That being so, we have a network of rivers surrounding the Canberra site, which can be tapped one after the other if it is thought necessary.",49
465,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,A district of streams.,49
466,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That is inevitably so, , having regard to the mountainous country which surrounds Canberra, and makes it a sort of amphitheatre. On the east, south and south-west lie a series of mountains which naturally mean broken country, and streams rethat are nearly all permanent. These are of facts that can be obtained from official sources, and some of them are to be found in the report of the Royal Commission ..upon the Lake George site. The map published by the Commission will show how short is the distance between the take-off of any of these suggested sources of supply and the site at Canberra. It has been urged by the right honourable member for Swan that even if a sufficient supply of water for domestic purposes can be obtained at Canberra, the supply is not sufficient for power purposes. be In that relation, the engineers of New South Wales say that on the Murrumbidgee, a few miles below the suggested site, a weir esticould be constructed at comparatively that small cost, which would back up an immense sheet of water on that river and part the of the Molonglo- a \zke which would be sufficient to supply power for lighting the city by electricity and supplying it . I with electric power for trams, with the out touching the Barren Jack reservoir. But assuming that the power available on On the Lower Murrumbidgee is not sufficient, I would point out that Barren Jack is within 40 miles in a direct line of the suggested site. At Barren Jack the State Government will have thousands of horse-power going to waste because they propose to will be stored at Barren Jack? store water there for irrigation purposes, and have no means of utilizing the power which will be available. 4he city site of Canberra can be supplied with power from Barren Jack at a very acres of land. small , cost ancl with absolute certainty so far as its transmission is concerned.",49

484,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,We have no guarantee They may require it for themselves.,50
485,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The probabilities are against that theory, because in Sydney coal is yery cheap and Canberra is a long way",50
486,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,In any case the Barren Jack scheme is merely put forward as a f all is resupplementary scheme.,50
487,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"There are not likely to be any manufacturing interests in the an close vicinity of Barren Jack to absorb the power which will be running to waste. This immense body of water will be passing # down to the Lower Murrumbidgee, and will remain unutilized unless the Commonwealth Government comes along with some profor its absorption. But as the honourable member for Lang reminds me this of scheme is merely a supplementary one. The engineers state that sufficient power for all purposes can be generated within the area member which will be Federal territory.",50
488,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Withi n 100 square Mr WATSON.T-No, we shall require a larger area than that. From the standpoint of a domestic water supply there is sufficient available in the near vicinity of Canberra to provide by means Of gravitation for a population many times larger than that which will need to be provided According to my estimate, within 30 miles of Canberra a sufficient supply is to meet the requirements of nearly at the present 2,000,000 people.",50
489,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"To supply a city containing 2,000,000 inhabitants?",50
490,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Yes ; and .to supply that number by means of gravitation and not by pumping. These facts dispose of the suggestion that a domestic supply cannot be obtained.,50
491,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Do ""the say that?",51
492,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The supply mentioned in their estimate is sufficient for approximately 2,000,000 persons. If during the first twenty years of. its existence we have a population of 50,000 at the Federal Capital, I think it will be going ahead just as rapidly as most of us anticipate. When we realise that the Cotter River catchment is sufficient to provide for 250,000 inhabitants we can cast aside all the other schemes except on the ground of expense. I merely wish to show the ample supply of water that is available if we choose to tap all these various sources. Another feature which has been alluded to as-of all importance in connection with this question .is that of climate. I do not contend that the climate of Dalgety is likely to be an unhealthy one. Probably it might have a bad effect upon delicate persons, but upon persons of ordinarily robust constitutions I ' do riot think that it would be objectionable, except from the stand-point of comfort. My opinion is that a city at the elevation of the Dalgety site, having regard to its exposed position, is bound to suffer severely from bitter wind's in the winter. ' Mr JOHNSON - Fro m blizzards.",51
493,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It is only reasonable to expect something of the sort.. A little while ago the Minister of Trade and Customs spoke of Nimitybelle. Now Nimitybelle is not much higher, if it is higher at all, than is Dalgety. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN , - It is 500feet higher.",51
494,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"In any case it owes its pre-eminence as a cold place in the cooler months of the year to the fact that it occupies an exposed position. It is open to all the winds that blow. of the prevailing winds coming over the Snowy Mountains is accentuated before they, reach Nimitybelle, and consequently they make the climate a very disagreeable, though not an unhealthy, one. The same remark is applicable to Dalgety. It is situated in an exposed position. There is nothing to protect it from the severity of the winds which sweep over the Monaro Plains in the winter. Whatever gree of normal cold exists in that locality is very much intensified by the winds that have.free play there. only from the stand-point of situation that I wish' to contrast Canberra with Dalgety. Canberra is situated at a considerably - lower altitude - it is about engineers 2,000 feet-whic h may account for some - difference in the temperature itself. But it is because it is surrounded by hills which protect it from the winds that it possesses a decided advantage. It occupies a sheltered situation, and whilst sufficiently high tc be cool, is sufficiently enclosed to afford protection against the winter winds.",51
495,Mr LIDDELL,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It also has a very fine sub-soil, and is well drained.",51
496,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The Age this morning remarks that Canberra and Dalgety are about equal from the stand-point of soil and climate. I maintain that, from the point of view of climate, Canberra, possesses a decided advantage,' whilst in the matter of soil, no comparison can be instituted. Within 15 miles of Dalgety the land is no better than second-class pastoral land.",51
497,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,'Would not the respective values of the land at Canberra and Dalgety provide a fair test?,51
498,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Othe r things being equal.,51
499,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"If land within 10 miles of Dalgety will realise more than land 10 miles from. Canberra, surely that is a fair indication of the relative values?",51
500,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I am always on the alert when the Minister of Trade' and Customsmakes a statement, because it is safe to assume that he has something concealed. Within 5 miles of Canberra, on the Queanbeyan side, there is exceedingly poor land. I am not to be '""' got at "" by a suggestion of that sort. I am speaking of the quality of the land within the respective sites themselves and within a reasonable distance of them. The good land upon the Canberra side commences about 5 miles out of Queanbeyan The coldness and continues for 40 miles to Yass. The site itself is upon good soil-in fact, I think that some of it is too good to build upon.",51
501,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It has a good foundation, I suppose.'",51
502,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The soil is good, and upon the Canberra flats it is much too good for building purposes. Just outside the city, at Jininderra, there is some of the debest agricultural land one can desire to see. That is within 4 miles of the centre of the city site. But the site itself is upon It is excellent soil. On the other hand, within fifteen miles of Dalgety is to be found a granitic soil of recent origin, with boulders protruding all over the place. Of : course, these might be removed, but their mere presence in such numbers is proof of my statement that the soil is of recent moor. granitic formation. I believe that in photographs of Dalgety the boulders in barren. the vicinity of the site have been carethere fully draped to represent trees-the only trees to be found there. In their naked beauty it was felt that they were a Teproach river. to the site. So far as farming is cerned, the Dalgety site, in my opinion, does not nearly approach the site at Cantion. berra. We have been told that a bad foundation will be found to exist at the latter place. I do not wish to pit knowledge against that of the right honortherefore,' able member for Swan.",51
503,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The honourable member has often done that.,52
504,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The Age this morning, in the plenitude of its knowledge, rises remark rhat the foundation at Canberra is very unsatisfactory. But I quote here the opinion of Mr A. L . Lloyd, Chief Surfoot veyor in the Department of Public Works, who, on the 28th March, 1906, after tailed investigation, reported on this amongst other sites. Mr Lloyd reported in regard to Canberra, and another nearer the Murrumbidgee Mountains, I am inclined to think that the latter better.",52
505,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I saw that site.,52
506,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Well , Mr Lloyd said, in reference to what he described as "" Site J,'' which was the' one nearer the Murare rumbidgeeExtensive area of fairly rolling, undulating country. Good elevation, fair soil, excellent drainage'. The views surrounding this site extensive and beautiful. Then in regard to ""Site K , "" which, included part of the .present site, he said- "" Extensive rolling, undulating country, adapted for building upon. Extensive views. F.ii'r soil, gdod elevation and drainage.",52
507,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,What about the foundations on the plain?,52
508,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"He sajs they are good for building on, and excellent for drainage.",52
509,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,It looked to me like an alluvial flat.,52
510,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It might present that appearance, but Mr Lloyd reported in the way I have quoted. A great deal has been said about the sesthetic interest that would attach to having the site at Dalgety, betralia. cause of the glorious scenery and so forth. My experience of Dalgety is that, while there is a. fine open prospect Mr DUGALD THOMSON. - It is open the Mr WATSON-It . does look a little I was going' to say that, while is a fine prospect from one standpoint, there is nothing in the way of natural, features to strike the eye beyond the There are no local hills of imconportance, and no background of mountains on which the eye can rest with any satisfacI t is true that Mount Kosciusko is within 40 miles, but that is not of much advantage when one's perambulations are my confined to a city. From this stand-point, I regard Dalgety as unsatisfactory. There is, of course, the river frontage, but beyond that there is nothing of the picturesque to commend the site. At Canberra, on the other hand, there is the plain to ' in the centre, and foot hills all round, varying the general appearance of the country ; and beyond that, after further rolling hills, we have, on the south-west and south, the Murrumbidgee Mountains, towerdeing as a background and proving a most effective foil to the other scenery.",52
511,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The honourable gentleman site is getting quite poetical! and Mr WATSON - No ; I am sorry to say is the that the poetic gift has been denied me. But I was certainly impressed at Canberra by the picturesque appearance, which ought to commend the site, to all who desire the beautiful. In the vicinity there mountain gorges, which afford every diversity of scenery, and I have been informed by trout fishers that there are most interesting places in the heart of the are Murrumbidgee Mountains, full of beauty, and within a short distance of the suggested site. I do not say that picturesqueness alone should decide the question; well but, other' things being equal, I think the beautiful ought to turn the scale. While I admit the superiority of the water supply at Dalgety, I contend there are other advantages in favour of Canberra, where the water supply can be provided in' the way I have indicated. I am strongly convinced that the continuance of the present situation is likely to work injury to the future of Australia. I have endeavoured to view this question free from any Sydney or New South Wales influence, and to have regard only to the interests of AusI f Australia is to become a nation such as we desire to see,, we must, at the earliest possible opportunity, get awayfrom the influences that are always alleged to surround a Parliament meeting in a big centre of population. As the right honourable member for East Sydney said to-night, while we sit in one centre of population, it is certain that there will be some degree jealousy and prejudice in the other centres in respect df the work done. I believe that the Canberra site is one that fairly fulfils all the conditions which I have laid down as desirable in the case of a Capital Site; and I express the earnest hope that honourable members will hesitate before they confirm the decision arrived at four years ago in favour of a site that, in my opinion, is not the best, having regard to the object in view.",52
512,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Parkes) [8.20]. - I anticipate that a large number of honourable members, especially representatives of New South Wales, will desire to speak on this question, and, therefore, I shall compress the few remarks I have to make into as short a space as possible. I should like; however, to acknowledge the very great assistance which we have received from the speech of the honourable member for South Sydney. I am quite sure that the speech of that honourable gentleman will have the effect, not only of curtailing the number of speeches to be delivered, but of relieving those who do speak of a large part of the subject-matter of the speeches they may have intended to make. The honourable member has dealt with almost every utilitarian aspect of the question, and has touched very usefully on the aesthetic side. One of the most valuable parts of his speech was that in which he emphasized, from his own personal knowledge, as one who was for a time Prime Minister, the very great disadvantage under which the Commonwealth and its Legislature suffers from the temporary Seat of Government being placed in one of the capitals. For my part I have always contended, not only that the Parliament should not sit in Melbourne, but that there would be equal objection to its sitting in. Svdney. I should be one of the first to oppose moving this Parliament to Sydney, either permanently, or for a limited period. I am satisfied that all of which we have now to complain in Melbourne in regard to the advantages to Victoria; in regard to the bias in favour of Victoria; and in regard to the influence of the Victorian press would apply, equally to New South Wales ancl New South Wales institutions, if this Parliament were to sit in Sydney. The honourable member has emphasized that point so clearly and forcibly, that I shall not attempt to supplement what he has' said. One of the most important, although, perhaps, one of the least interesting aspects of of this question, is the legal one. A very large number of honourable members seem to be under the impression-especiall y those who were not in Parliament at the timethat the Commonwealth has, in a thoroughly legal and proper manner, adoptedDal-, gety as the Capital. I should think that even the speech of the Attorney-General would have convinced honourable members that such is not the case. It was contended in 1903, and in 1904, not only by myself, but by others, that the course which was then about to be adopted in the selection of a Capital Site was unconstitutional. The section of the Constitution which enables this Parliament tp select the Capital Site distinctly provides that it shall be an area which has either been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. The actual words of the section areThe Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong la the Commonwealth, and,- if . New South Wales be an original State, shall be in that State, and be distant not less than one hundred miles from Sydney. In 1903, I - took the liberty of making the following remarksEvidently the framers of the Constitutionassumed either that some State would grant certain territory, or that the Commonwealth would acquire certain territory, before Parliament chose a site, and, therefore, the section provides that the Seat of Government shall be determined by the Parliament, not within territory which shall be granted or acquired, but within territory which "" shall have been"" granted or acquired. No territory has been granted or acquired, and yet we are asked to pass a Bill to determine the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth.",53
513,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Is not that our present, position ?",53
514,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Exactly . In 1904, 1 said It seems to me that the whole difficulty which has arisen is the result of a misconceived form of procedure. Then I went on to quote the section in the Constitution. I have always thought that the function of an Attorney-General is to "" hold the scales "" in laying information on any legal question before the House. But today the honourable gentleman assumed the attitude of the advocate, and contended at length, and with force, that what has been done is perfectly constitutional. But I ask, as I have asked before, if this House has, within its constitutional rights, chosen the Capital Site, why does the Government not act on the choice, and put in a peg, or some other 'symbol of ownership, in order to give the New South Wales Government an opportunity to bring the whole question before the High Court, in an action for trespass? The Government are evidently consciousof their unconstitutional position, and have hesitated to put into force the legal power alleged to exist. I am not alone in. the opinion I then expressed; for since that time, Mr Wade, the Premier of New South Wales, has taken the opinion .of Sir Julian Salomons and Mr Cecil Stephen, two of the ablest and most experienced counsel in the senior State, to the same effect. The passing_ of that Act was, admittedly, . an. indication to the State of New South - Wales of the desire of the Commonwealth Parliament that a site at Dalgety should be ceded; but inasmuch as it was only the first step towards obtaining it, there is not the same objection to dealing with the question now as there would be if we were actually re-opening the whole matter. The Act is. ineffectual for the purpose of. obtaining a site for the Commonwealth. That view is taken by the two authors who wrote The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, the recognised treatise upon the Constitution. They say- . The chief ouestion which has arisen in connection with these words is whether the determination of the Seat of Government rests, in the last resort, solely with the Federal Parliament, OT whether the Federal Parliament is limited in its choice to sites offered by the Parliament of New South Wales. The Annotated Constitution was published before this Parliament met. ' We have not only the authority of the author's of this work that there is something to be said in favour of this view, but also the best available legal opinions in New South Wales. The point is important; because a number of honourable members, who were not members of the Parliament in 1904, are possibly under the impression that the Parliament has done all that the Constitution required, in order to possess the Commonwealth of a site, and possibly this is operating to induce them to hesitate about interfering with the choice which is being made. Although the Attorney-General has adoptgd the role of advocate for Dalgety, he has not cited a single legal opinion against the view which I have put forward from the recognised treatise on the Constitution, as the basis of the opinion furnished to the Premier of New South Wales.",53

We have been reminded recently of the desirability of not legislating on the border land of Commonwealth and State rights', where interests may clash, without trying first to arrange amicably questions of which a forced settlement might lead to reprisals. No decision made by us could be more far-reaching than this. If we were to finally determine upon a site unfavorably regarded by the great body of the people of New South Wales, there would probably result a great deal of unnecessary friction. I do not emphasize the statement so as to give any one the chance to say that it has been held out as a threat;""but it will be .generally admitted that it is highly desirable, where it can be done without running counter to the interests of Australia, to arrange matters of mutual concern, so as to leave the best possible feeling between the States and the Commonwealth.

The right 1 member for Swan actually signed that document in which he undertook to recognise the right of New South Wales to Capital established at a reasonable distance from Sydney. I do not wish to discuss this phase of the question further than to say that the appeal made by the leader of the Opposition to the right honourable mem-, ber for Swan was a very reasonable one. He said, in effect: "" We recognised your appeal to us with regard to the Western Australian railway; we recognised your statement that there was an implied obligapeople tion, on the part of the Commonwealth to construct that line, and you ought recognise something that is infinitely more binding-a n agreement contained in a written document which you yourself signed."" That was a rational appeal, but. instead of receiving it in the spirit in which it was made, and resolving to reciprocate, the right honourable member worked himtions, self into a passion, and made some obseron vations that were not called - for. _ A great deal has been said in the Victorian press, as well as at public meetings in Victoria, with reference to what is described as the ""bush capital."" All that has been said on that score can be speedily disposed of. Honourable members will realise by glancing at the short history of this ment that had it not been for the stand which the people of Victoria took, through established."" their representative, Sir George Turner, there would have been a possibility of Capital being established in Sydney. George Turner,, as the representative of Victoria, said, in effect, at the Conference of Premiers: "" We bar Sydney, and we object to the Capital being established within a radius of 100 miles of that city.",56

M i : WILKS - I do not think that the of Victoria are much concerned about the matter. It is the press that is now to responsible for the agitation.",56
548,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The people may not be so much concerned; but the press nowadays is the mouthpiece of the public. Whatever may be said of its independence, we know that just as the meteorologist is' constantly on the watch for weather condiso the newspaper editors are ever the watch to determine which way popular feeling is running, and that they write their articles accordingly. I have read in both the Argus and the Age - articles delibe'-lately advocating. the indefinite postponement of the determination of this question. The Age in one article said in effect: "" It is true that the Constitution provides that move the Capital shall be within New South Wales, but it does not say when it shall be Therefore, to use its own words, we are to deal with this question on the the principle of the Merchant of Venice, Sir and let the people of New South Wales have the Capital established in that State at-some future time!

549,Mr FRAZER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Thos e are Tory tactics.,56
550,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"They were also the tactics of the Age, which the honourable member may describe as he pleases.",56
551,Mr FRAZER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The Age is as bad.,57
552,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"A good deal has been said of the advantages to be derived from .visiting the various suggested sites. I am one of the few honourable members who have not yet visited any of them. I contend that I am equally as competent as those who have visited them to express an opinion on the question. In my view, there is no qualification in respect of a Capital Site which cannot be indicated to this House quite as well on paper as by personal inspection. The question of water supply is one for engineers to deal with in reports. The question of soil can also be dealt with in reports, whilst the question of climate cannot be determined in a visit of a day. We have had an ironical illustration of the value of one-day visits to suggested sites so far as the determination of the suitability of the climate is concerned. partu of honourable members happened to visit Albury on a very hot day, and. after their departure the people protested against the suitability of that town as a site for the Federal Capital being determined by that one visit, on the ground that the day in question was one of the hottest that had ever been experienced there. urged that the average temperature should be taken, and that a residence of a f e w months would enable us to judge whether, so far as climate was concerned, Albury would be a desirable site. Thus a visit to any of the sites is of no service in enabling us to determine the suitability of the climate. With regard to scenery, what do we find? We have exposed in this House photographs which have been deliberately faked to mislead honourable members. We haye one photograph, evidently taken by an artist, portraying a view of the Snowy River, on which some sesthetic individuals might arrive at a determination. ",57
553,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It is, and it portrays magnificent scenery, but it has one drawback.",57
554,Mr MALONEY,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"If the honourable member has not been to Dalgety, how can he express an opinion with respect to the picture ?",57
555,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"1 base my opinion on the judgment of an honourable member who has been there. The honourable member for South Sydney, who was for some years the honourable member's' leader in this House, stated to-nisrht that he recog nised the photograph as that of a scene on the river 40 miles above Dalgety ! That photograph was exposed for the edification of honourable members, and to enable them to judge of the merits of Dalgety. Yet. on the evidence of the honourable meinber for South Sydney, who has visited the Snowy River as a fisherman, it is a p cture of the : river at a point 40 miles above Dalgety, - and quite beyond the proposed Federalterritory.  a picture of the Snowy River, from which it is proposed that we shall draw our water supply.",57
556,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Some wag has since added to the inscription, ""View of the Snowy .River "" the words -"" 40 miles above Dalgety,"" so that honourable members will now know the truth about it. I speak without anybias. T am glad that, that statement provokes laughter. At one time. I was rather inclined to favour Dalgety. I knew A that it had a very fine water supply, ano that if the Parliament could be induced to sit only during the summer months the climate would be all that could be desired. - I always felt that it was too far from Sydney, but reflected that it was possible that, in the future, there might be a railway from) the Capital to Eden, and that people might They thus be able to reach it from Sydney or Melbourne by large steamers touching at that port. The more I know of Eden as a. port, however, the more satisfied I am that it would be impossible to induce steamers of any size to call there regularly in order to accommodate a few members .from Melbourne or Sydney. I have arrived, therefore at the conclusion- a fact which I never recognised before-that the people of Sydney, desiring to visit the Capital, would have to travel to the most south-easterly portion of New South Wales in order to reach it, whilst Victorians would have to travel from Melbourne to Goulburn-whic h is only a four hours' railway journey from Sydney--and would then have * to travel southwards 'for eight hours. Tn other words, the time occupied in travelling from Melbourne to the Capital-puttin g aside Adelaide and other places-woul d beequivalent to a railway journey four hourslonger than that between Melbourne and"" Svdnev. We have been told by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that the Victorian Government will construct a railway to Dalgety. . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - What I stated' was that Mr Bent said last week that he intended to carry a railway from Bairnsdale to the Border, wherever the Capital might be fixed.",57
557,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,We all know what such promises mean. It has been admitted by the honourable member for Gippsland that the estimated cost of a railway to continue the Victorian system from Bairnsdale to the foot of the mountains 3,58
558,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,That is not what I said.,58
559,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I understood the honourable member to say that such an extension would cost £ 1 , 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 . ' Is it likely that Victoria would construct a line of railway to the foot of the mountains, which are very similar to the Blue Mountains of New South Wales,' and then' extend it over those mountains at a cost of some hundreds of thousands of pounds, in order to carry ten or fifteen members every week to the Federal Capital? If the line of railway contemplated by this State is designed merely for commercial purposes, it is not likely to .be carried over a range of mountains in order to reach part of another State in which Victoria cannot trade. Therefore, we have to take the estimated cost of £1,400,000 plus whatever it would cost-if Victoria were foolish enough to build it-to construct a line over mountains as difficult to negotiate as are the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.",58
560,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It was estimated, some three years ago, that such a line would cost £3,000,000.",58
561,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I am not at all surprised. Dalgety, then, is in that position, so fa r as a railway on the Victorian side is concerned.",58
562,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"To say nothing of an expenditure of £2,000,000 £3,000,000 in providing a breakwater.",58
563,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I do not wish to exaggerate the figures. If the Victorian representatives were compelled to travel from Melbourne to Goulburn, and then undertake an eight hours' railway journey in a south-easterly direction, that would be equivalent to their travelling on to Newcastle. Only one interpretation can be put upon this continued attempt to advocate the claims of Dalgety.'",58
564,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Would the honourable member regard Dalgety as a suitable site if that railwav were built?,58
565,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I would not regard it as being as suitable a site as Canberra. But honourable members know for themselves what chance there is of inducing Victoria to spend £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 or £3,000,000 upon the construction of that railway. The right honourable member for Swan realized that thoroughly when he suggested, apparently as a sop, that theCommonwealtli should step in and assist Victoria to build a line over those mountains for Federal purposes.",58
566,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I did not say Victoria only; I mentioned assistance to both. States.,58
567,Mr BRUCESMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I understood the right honourable member to say that the Commonwealth should help Victoria to climb those mountains with '.a railway,58
568,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,And also help New South Wales.,58
569,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Ne w South Wales would not want that help.,58
570,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I know a good deal about the matter-perhap s more than the honourable member thinks. Mr Bruce, SMITH - As a matter of fact, when Minister of Public Works in New South Wales eighteen years ago, I officially. opened the railway to Cooma and had the extended line to Delegate surveyed, so that it was contemplated long before Federation was accomplished.",58
571,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,It was a line to Bombala that the honourable member had surveyed.,58
572,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,A line of railway to Dalgety would be a commercial failway. But where the project fails is in expecting that Victoria would complete a railway over the mountains merely for the purpose of taking honourable members into 01 the Federal Capital.,58
573,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"There are millionsof pounds' worth of timber in that country, and plenty of good soil, in addition to> minerals.",58
574,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I am not supporting Canberra because I regard it as the best possible site. If I were asked to name absolutely the best site I should reply ""Lyndhurst. "" But I now recognise that unless something in the nature of a compromise is effected between Victoria and New South Wales there is very little chance of this question being settled.",58
575,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The honourable member has not seen any of the sites.,58
576,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The right honourable member has a sort of fever for ocular demonstration of everything. I confess that I do not see the need of any such demonstration. In the matter of a Federal Capital Site I do not think that ocular monstration can serve any useful purpose except to show honourable members the .scenery surrounding it, and that scenery can be reproduced by honest photography. In the vestibule of this House there are some very honest. photographs of the berra site. I shall vote for that site, because I think it. is the best one, but because I think it is the nearest approach it. If I could see a site nearly half way between Sydney"" and Melbourne I should vote for it in order to avoid disputes hereaccessible or inaccessible. after. Had a site been available at and had a sufficient water supply forthcoming, I should have supported",58
577,Mr CARR,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Will the honourable member test the question of the selection of hurst again?,59
578,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I do not know that honourable members would support me if I did so.

If the honourable member can satisfy me that if I propose the selecFederal tion of Lyndhurst I shall obtain it, prepared to take action in the direction suggests. I repeat, I shall vote for berra, because it constitutes the fairest compromise which can be made.",59
579,Mr WEBSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Is it not a fact that Canberra site is supported by the .Sydney Morning Herald and the Daily Telegraph? Federation.,59
580,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I take my data from proper sources. The honourable ber may vote for Dalgety because the advocates its selection. I do not say that it is so. The Age is not a paper to which I go for light and leading. If I desired to find a way out of a difficulty- a very subtle way- I might go to that journal assistance, but for light and leading should not consult-it. I shall support Canberra site, because it represents the nearest approach to a fair compromise between the two capitals. I understand from the honourable member for South Sydney That that Canberra is twelve hours distant from Melbourne, and eight hours distant from that that was the anti-Billite view. Sydney. Honourable members from New South Wales have to spend thirty-two hours in the train each week in order to attend their parliamentary duties. As we have agreed with that feature of it. done that for seven years, I do not think that we are asking anything very unreaconsulting sonable when we ask-in spite of the condition inserted in the Premiers' memorandedum-that a site shall be chosen, which, according to the honourable member for South Sydney, is fitted in every way for the purposes of a Federal Capital ",59
581,Mr MAHON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Did not the honourable member lay it down in a former speech that Canthe Federal Capital should be equally innot conveniently situated for everybodv?,59
582,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I did.' I held to that it ought to be equally inconvenient,59
583,Mr CARR,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,And equally accessible.,59
584,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"And equally I ' felt that, Yass if we could get into a place where been the inconvenience to all the States .it. would be fairly balanced, we should be likely to get our work accomplished in a Lyndshorter period, because there would be no other occupation to divert honourable members from the task of legislation.",59
585,Mr MAHON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Then we ought to go to,59
586,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"No . I did not the say that we should go to as inaccessible a danplace as we could get, but) that the inconhe venience should be equally distributed. With regard to the cost of establishing a Capital I desire to sayone or two I am words. I know that this aspect of the he question has formed a very useful peg upon Canwhich to hang many objections. Just before the referendum upon the Constitution Bill took place in New South Wales, - a the great dispute occurred in that State as to what - would be the extra cost of The two opposing parties in that State - the Federalists' memand the anti-Billites - determined to Age have the question inquired into before the vote of the electors was taken. The anti-Billites chose as their representative a well-known Legislative Councillor of Sydney, and the Federalists selected myfor self. We chose as an umpire Mr Russell I French, the general manager of the Bank the of New South Wales. These two gentlemen in their report estimated that the an.nua.1 interest upon theexpenditure involved in building the Capital would be £75,000. is to say, they calculated that it would 'cost £2-,5oo;boo. But we must recollect I took exception to their estimate, and. accordingly had to file with their report anto addendum stating that I thoroughly disI have had an opportunity from time to time of the Government Architect of . New South Wales upon this que'stion. He has collected plans, diagrams, and sections of all the great parliament houses in world, and he has expressed the opinion that for present purposes-for the buildable ing of both Houses of Parliament, should own it? for the erection of Government House, and of the necessary 'Commonwealth offices-the cost need not exceed some £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 .£300,000. Of course we could not have marble halls or a White House",59
587,Mr WEBSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,We could not have building like the one in which meeting.,60
588,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"No ^ because this building cost £1,000,000 - But could have a building which would cover us, and which .would provide us with necessary accommodation to perform our .

All that is necessary is a moderate expenditure, as 1I have'indicated, to enable us to carry on our work.

We all know that with regard to the Dalgety site it has.been posed as a very desirable adjunct that there . Mr WH IRVINE should be access to the ocean. Now, the only part of the coast which could be much easier. reached within a reasonable! distance of Dalgety is Twofold Bay. I know Twofold Bay very well, and I - say that it really not a port. A port would have to be created there, and at very great expense, oecause it any Bill. is open and exposed to the ocean. .On the other hand, Jervis Bay possesses 120 square miles of deep water anchorage.",60

616,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"At the time when the amended Constitution was before the people each of the Melbourne morning newspapers circulated a memorandum explaining the amended arrangement. The Argus memorandum was prepared by Sir John Quick, and in it we find this referenceThe amendment first in interest, if not in importance, is that relating to the Site .of the future Capital of the Commonwealth. Under the Bill as framed by the Convention it was provided that the Seat of Government should be determined by the Federal Parliament, and that it should be within Federal territory. The amendment now proposed is-that the Seat of Government shall be in New South Wales,"" and be distant not less than ioo miles from' Sydney. In all probability, if the matter had been left in the hands of the Federal Parliament, the Capital would have ' been fixed somewhere in New South Wales; her strong claim, founded on seniority and the vast and suitable territory available for such a purpose, would have told in her favour. There is not a word there about a reasonable distance from Sydney. memorandum was prepared by Mr Isaacs and Mr Mackay, the present Minister of Lands of Victoria, and contains the followingWith regard to the Site of the Capital, the Federal Parliament was previously unrestricted in its choice provided the place selected was within territorv vested in the Commonwealth. By the amendment the Parliament i's limited to a selection within New South Wales, at a distance of at least 100 miles from Sydney. The compact made must and will be honourably adhered to, and there will, it is hoped aid believed, be not a moment's unnecessary delay in the fulfilment of the intention of ihe parties in arriving at the agreement. But in making the concession sentiment has already had full weight given to it, and it will manifest duty of the Parliament within the limits assigned to it, to select, as the seat of government, whatever site it considers most in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. There is not a word there about a reasonable distance from Sydney. The electors when they voted certainly did not believe that in the matter of the Federal Capital they were to be confined to within a reasonable distance bf the 100-mile limit. that ""were the intention, why did not the right honourable member for East Sydney insert words to the effect that the Federal Capital must be at a distance of not less than 100 miles, nor more than 200 miles, from Svdney?",62

618,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The red seals would have been of no use; the provision should have been in the Constitution. One of the very first acts of the first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth was to write and consult the Government of New South Wales. One honourable member has.asked why the Commonwealth Government are always asking the opinion of the New South Wales Government on this, that, or the other subject. In my opinion, we have had too much consideration altogether for the States, not merely in the matter under discussion, but in financial matters; and our courtesy has been mistaken for weakness, and played upon. Sir Edmund Barton, on the 13th April, 1901, addressed the following letter to the Chief Secretary of New South WalesI have the honour, on behalf of the Government of the Commonwealth, to inquire whether the Government of the State of New South Wales is prepared to offer to the Commonwealth, under the provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia- - Constitution Act any Sites for the . Federal District or Territory within which the The Age Capital of the Commonwealth is to be situated. I have to intimate that the Federal Government desires to consider offers of tracts of larger area than the minimum prescribed in the 125th section of the Constitution Act, and would suggest'that in the meantime, the Government of New South Wales may, in the public interest of ' the whole Commonwealth, take steps to secure unalienated land within any areas offered from losing the character of "" Crown lands"" within the section, until a decision in the matter is arrived at. We were told to-night by the honourable member for Parke's that we may accept. the promise of the present Premier of New South Wales that we shall Obtain the Canberra site if we select it. On the 24th April, 1901, be the Sir John See, the then Premier of New South Wales, replied to Sir Edmund Barton in the following termsIn acknowledging receipt of your letter with regard to the Site for the Federal Capital of the Commonwealth, I have the honour to submit to your Government the choice of the three Sites mentioned in the report of the Royal Commission which was appointed to collect evidence with reference to the suitability of the Sites for the purpose. A copy of that report is now If forwarded herewith, and from the appendices attached thereto all particulars as to area, position, water supply, & c , can be obtained.. I desire also to state that if any other Site in New South Wales be considered by your Government' to be more suitable for the purposes of the Federal Capital than those recommended in the report, I shall be glad to receive any further representations from you, and will endeavour, as far as possible, to meet your I further desire to inform you that, pending the decision of the Parliament of the Commonwealth in this matter, steps have been taken to prevent the alienation of Crown lands within any of the three Sites recommended by the Commissioner.",62

627,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"-Hardly that; this House The chose Tumut, and the Senate chose Bomin Southern' Monaro. Then on the State second occasion, this Parliament selected Dalgety, in Southern Monaro. The honourable and learned member, for Parkes gave us to understand that the authors of the Annotated Constitution support the contention: .that the territory must be ceded by - New South Wales before we can select it. In support of that view he read this passageIt has been argued that the words "" shall within territory which shall have been to or acquired by the Commonwealth"" point a prior act of cession by the Parliament of New South Wales, and that-n o express power to ""acquire"" being given by this section-;the Dalgety. acquisition must be by surrender and acceptance under section n r . But he did not read this passage lower downIn other words, the power to determine Seat of Government, coupled with the direction that the Seat of Government shall be within territory granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, implies that the Commonwealth, the absence of a grant, has power to acquire the necessary territory without grant. This view seems to be supported by a general perusal of the section. There is a clear tion that' the Seat of Government is to be determined by the Parliament, but there is declaration that the concurrence of New Wales is essential. . Had that been the intensidered tion, it would surely have been expressly tioned, and not left to be gathered by implication-and especially by implication ""from such flies. wide words as "" granted or acquired."" I do not propose to discuss at length the merits of the various sites. That has been done over and over again. I was surprised, when I heard the honourable member for South Sydney describe the Canberra site in such glowing terms, seeing that it has been only recently discovered. Commissioner, who reported on the various suggested sites put forward in all parts of the State, seems to have overlooked it . The representatives of New South Wales, when putting forward their best sites, also overlooked it.",63

636,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for the South Sydney was complimented, I think for the first time by the honourable member for Parkes, upon the speech which he made into-night. Amongst his objections to Dalgety was the one that it is too far from Sydney. The right honourable member for Swan asked, "" Why should Canberra, which is declara203 miles from Sydney, be considered no within a reasonable distance, and Dalgety, South which is only 296 miles away, be contoo far ?

The cost of railway conrich struction, however, has been greatly overbe carried. estimated by those honourable members.

The Commissioners further reported that to construct a line from by Bairnsdale vid Bendoc and Dalgety would involve an expenditure of £ 1 , 4 6 6 , 0 0 0 .",64
639,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,What was the estimate of the Victorian engineers?,65
640,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I do not remember.,65
641,Mr MALONEY,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"£1,324,000 .",65
642,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Is it not peculiar that the honourable member has not consulted the reports of the engineers of this State ?,65
643,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The Royal Commission obtained all the available information from the Railway Departments of both States, ancl their report, from which I have quoted, was rather unfavorable to the selection of Dalgety. As a matter of fact, to my own knowledge, four different routes to the border have been suggested, and there is now under consideration a direct route, via Buchan and Bendoc, about 30. miles shorter than the others which"" have been suggested, which it is said would not be more expensive. We are told that there is no possibility of a line to the border being constructed. The Premier of Victoria, however, has emphatically declared his intention to ask Parliament to construct it. The proposal has been referred to the Railways Standing Committee for investigation, and. surveyors are now engaged in surveying a route from Orbost up to the Bemm river, and then up the Camm River valley, vid Bondi, to Dalgety. There is every probability of the line being constructed at a very early date, irrespective of whether or not the Capital be established at Dalgetv. Such a line would open up a vast territory which has long been awaiting development- a which honourable members who have not seen it seem to imagine they are best able to describe. The right honourable member for Swan said he had crossed the country in question, and that it contained excellent land and timber; and those who have traversed it will recognise the truth ofhis statements.' It comprises a large area of land, through which a line could easily Victoria does not propose to build such a railway merely for the sake It proposes to it-and it should have been constructed long ago-to open up the eastern It is strange that so much has been said of late in a depreWhen the honourable member for Lang was disthe cussing this question a few nights ago, and praising Jervis Bay, he .was asked the honourable member for K a lgoorlie, "" Will New South Wales give us Jervis Bay with Canberra ? "" The honourable member for Lang replied, "" I am not talking about that.""",65
644,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I have no recollection of the interjection or the reply attributed to me.,65
645,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I have; because I particularly noted it at the time. The honourable member, for Parkes, when a similar question was put to him to-night, went one further, and said that he would be no party to giving the Commonwealth control of Jervis .Bay.",65
646,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Does the honourable member expect that the Commonwealth would obtain control of Eden if Dalgety were selected?,65
647,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Yes .,65
648,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,A simpler way out of the difficulty would be to pass a' law making New South Wales Federal territory.,65
649,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"l t would be better to do that than to pass a law. permitting New South Wales to annex the rest of the Commonwealth, as she apparently desires to do. We have heard a great deal about the climate of Dalgety. A bulletin on the Climate and Meteorology of Australia, issued last week by the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology, contains a comparison of rainfalls and temperatures of places which have been referred tn as possible sites for the Commonwealth Capital-. That table shows that there is a difference of only about 5 degrees between the mean summer territory temperature of Canberra and Dalgety. The average mean summer temperature at Canberra is 69.7 as against 63.3 at Dalgety; the average mean winter temperature - of the Canberra district is 45.0, as against 42.2 at Dalgety. The highest temperature on record in respect of the Canberra district is 109.0 and 104.0 in respect of Dalgety; whilst the lowest on record is 16.0 for the Canberra district and 11.0 at Dalgety. Then again, it is shown that the temperature of the average hottest month at Canberra is 72.0 as against 67.0 at Dalgety, and that the temperature of the average coldest month is 42.0 in the Canberra district and 40.0 at Dalgety. We were told on a former occasion by the honourable member for North Svdney thatThe Capital should be in a portion of the country where ' settlement is gravitating, and where there will be a tendency for population to gravitate in the future. It sliould nbt only be on a railway line, but, if possible, on a which connects, or will connect, the different States and be used as a main line. The honourable member now favours a site which is not on any line of railway; but would be reached by means of a branch line. On the other hand, if Dalgety were selected it would be on a - railway which would become the main line connecting the capitals of iS'ew South Wales and Victoria. It certainly fills the bill so far as that consideration is concerned. It is unnecessary, however, to discuss every detail. As the honourable member for Parkes has said, full information can be obtained from the reports which have been available for some time; but I am sure that if Dalgety. were the finest spot on earth it would not meet with the approval of the representatives of New South Wales, who are supporting Canberra. If we wish to deal finally with this question we must regard it from a purely Australian point of view. To-day the whole' question has been discussed from the points of view of Melbourneand Sydney. What about the interests of the other States? Is no consideration to be given to Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, or Queensland?",65
650,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Does the honourable member contend that they have a voice in the matter?,66
651,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Certainly . The people of Australia as a whole have a voice in determining the question, and their representatives here should select what they believe to be the best site in the interests of Australia, not only for the present, but for the future. Having made such a selectionand I believe that in selecting Dalgety they have done so-the Parliament ought to - stand by it , and keep knocking at the door until New South Wales hands over the territory. If New South Wales refuses to do so, we shall have to take other steps, but I believe that when the Government of that State realise that we are firmly wedded to Dalgety, all friction will cease, and that the site will be offered to us in the same spirit as it was offered t.o the Commonwealth by Sir John See, the then Premier of New South Wales,' when the Federation was first established.",66

I should be glad if I could congratulate the honourable member for Gippsland as I can the°honourable member for South Sydney. It is only natural that the honourable member for Gippsland should support the selection of Dalgety, having regard to its proximity to his own constituency ; but he has to-night given expression to the very sentiments which, when published in New South Wiles, cause the people of that State to doubt the honesty and fairness of Victoria in regard to the settlement of this question.",66

660,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for South Sydney said that he was' not individually bound by that agreement, but the honourable member for Gippsland went further by declaring that he could find nothing binding in it. When those who practically arranged the terms right to each State. upon which all the States entered the ration, and who subscribed their names to their interpretation of the provision Constitution relating to the Federal Capiany tal, affirm that they are not bound by agreement arrived at, they practically fess that they induced the States to enter the Federal union under a compact from which they have now absolutely departed.

New South Wales gave the Commonwealth the right of inspection from border to border. Why ? Because there might not be, near the have ioo miles limit, a really suitable site. Consequently it allowed the Commonwealth the to search from end to end of the State, so that if a suitable site were not found the near the ioo miles limit we should forbe at perfect liberty to select a site Why is an attempt made to turn the generosity of New South Wales against that State ? The claim by the New South Wales representatives is that near which to the ioo miles limit-at any rate within a reasonable distance of it-ther e are sites not only equal to Dalgety, but superior to it, and that consequently we have no right to forget the conditions of the agree-' ment arrived at by the Premiers' Conference. That is a perfectly legitimate position. I come now to the statement of the right - honourable member for Swan, that at the earlier stages in the selection of a Federal Capital Site some honourable members representing New South Wales voted for more distant sites. May I point out that, owing to the Premiers' agreement having gone out of print, no copies of it could be obtained for some years. collected that there had been a document of the sort, and that its terms had been circulated in handbill form by the supporters of Federation throughout' New South Wales. However, I could not obtain a copy of it either from this Parliament, from the Victorian Parliament, or from the New South Wales Parliament. At last, however, I found, not a copy of the document itself, but a copy of the handbill that had been circulated in New South Wales, and which quoted it.",67
672,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The honourable member is speaking of a quite recent period - Mr DUGALD THOMSON,68
673,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I am speaking of 1904 or 1905. Towards the conclusion of a debate upon this question, I quoted that document in this House. I felt sure from my own recollection that the terms of the agreement arrived at by the Premiers were not being fulfilled , and when I found the document in question that idea was confirmed. But even then I did not like to lay too much stress upon the document as it was not the original and had not been issued by authority. During the Federal campaign, when it was pointed out by many persons who were opposed draft Constitution Bill , that Victoria would delay the settlement of the Capital Site question for a long time, and would not support any site that was not near its own border, the agreement arrived at by the Premiers was relied upon, and was issued broadcast, as an answer.",68
674,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That agreement was printed in the Age in June, 1899.",68
675,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"At any rate, I could not come across a copy until I found the one to which I refer. After that, a search was made, and a copy of the agreement issued by authority was found in one of the State Parliaments. This the Cornmohwealth had printed. To show that that document changed the views of some honourable members. I may mention that Sir George Turner-wh o had forgotten the explanation which it contained of the arrangement arrived at in regard to the Federal Capital-state d that in the light of that agreement it would only be fairso long as there was a suitable site available-to select - a site between 100 miles and 200 miles distant from Sydney.",68
676,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Did he make that statement publicly ?,68
677,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"He made it, I think, in this Chamber. If the honI re- orable member desires to do so he is at liberty to ring him up tomorrow, and I have no doubt that he will vouch for the accuracy of my statement.",68
678,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"He could not have placed much value upon the arrangement arrived at, seeing that he had forgotten it .",68
679,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"In the multiplicity of their occupations, politicians frequently forget.",68
680,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Does not the honourable member think that the electors of Australia have .given the sovereign opinion upon this question ? - Of course they have, and they gave that sovereign opinion in view of the decision of the Conference, and, in New South Wales, in view of the distribution of this very memorandum.",68
681,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Sydne y and suburbs voted against Federation.,68
682,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Is New South Wales, a member of the Union, not to be treated fairly simply because Sydney and suburbs voted against Federation? '",68
683,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The country districts voted for Federation.,68
684,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I am astonished that the honourable member, from to the whom I always expect fair and logical argument, should make such a suggestion. My own constituency voted against the first Bill , but I took my stand in favour of . Federation.",68
685,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,What I mean is that the facts show that the opposition is confined to Sydney.,68
686,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Nothin g of the sort. The honourable member really says that, because Sydney and suburbs voted against Federation, the opposition tp the Dalgety site is confined t'o Sydney and suburbs.",68
687,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,What I mean is that the memorandum did not appear to influence public opinion to any extent in Sydney on the second occasion.,68
688,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"-How was given, it, then, that a sufficient majority was tained on the second occasion?",69
689,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That majority found in the country districts. ' Mr DUGALD 'THOMSON - But in Sydney and suburbs there was a larger of. favourable vote on the second occasion.. - Mr MALONEY - The right honourable member for East Sydney changed his opinion, and he carried the majority. That is how the larger vote was obtained.",69
690,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The honmander orable member is quite wrong, or otherwise, why did the: right honourable member not very fine one-Port carry the majority for his own Government in the State? The honourable member for Melbourne represents the attitude which see everywhere.",69
691,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"What I desire to out is that the public had not an opporto tunity of voting, with a full, knowledge of the memorandum, as well as with a f knowledge of the clause in the Constituquirements, tion.",69
692,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"And, would therefore, it would appear it would be justimanded fiable for those who signed that memofrom randum, and who represented - the people hurst. at the time, to "" g o back "" on it.",69
693,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,There is not much at either Canberra or Dalgety. difference between 203 miles and 296 miles.,69
694,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The right 'honorCustoms able member knows that the 203 miles represents a compromise.,69
695,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That is deal so, ancl, therefore, I am supporting Canmade berra, although I previously voted for Lyndhurst.",69
696,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Lyndhurs t is not much of a place to vote for !,69
697,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Both fore, Dalgety and Lyndhurst have advantages of their own, and I am still in favour of the latter place; although I admit that Canact berra has a better water supply, and better natural features. These advantages on the part of Canberra, however, do not, in my view, counterbalance the centrality of Lynd- was Minister? hurst, which is most convenient, in point of distance, for all the States of the Commonwealth. . Mr CARR - Will the honourable member vote for Lyndhurst if that place be proposed ?",69
698,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"If we cause cannot, get the site we desire, we have to try to bring about a compromise. If I thought that Lyndhurst would be selected, I should prefer it for the reasons I have because I think that,, with storage, obsufficient water could be provided for a very considerable city; and there are other was means of supply when the population justified the expenditure. This water question, though important, can be made too much It is peculiar that one of the objections made to Botany Bay by the Commander of the First Fleet was, that the water supply was not good enough, being obtained from certain swamps close to the sea shore. We know that the Comsent out an expedition to find another harbour, and fortunately found a Jackson-bu t the water supply which he deemed insufficient supplied Sydney until the popuwe lation * of that city was nearlv 250,000. It was very fine water, which oozed point through the sands, and was pumped Sydney; and it was only when the population got so large that the water did not u l l ooze quickly enough to supply their rethat the present scheme had to be adopted. Therefore, I say that it. be easy, when the population deit, to increase the water supplyplaces in the vicinity of LyndI admit that the population will never get too great for the water supply During the discussion, the Minister of Trade and interjected that I had stated that the selection of Dalgety was conclusive. I happened to be the Minister who had to with the matter after Parliament had the selection, and, although I voted ancl spoke against the selection, it was not for'me as Minister to consider whether the laws I had to administer were altogether in accord with my own opinions. . 1 , theretold the New South Wales Government-, that so far as I was concerned, the selection was then conclusive, and I had to upon it ; ' and I think that was a perfectly proper and consistent attitude.",69
699,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Why did the honourable gentleman not settle the matter while he,69
700,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I was not Minister very long; and the people of New South Wales objected to the site, not merely because it was not in accordance with the spirit of the agreement, but beit was not considered suitable in the interests of. the Commonwealth or the State. , Mr AUSTIN - CHAPMAN - The - honourable member voted for Dalgety ",69
701,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Onl y in been the f if t h or sixth ballot, and then as a worse site.",70
702,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The honourable member voted for Dalgety against Tooma, and it was fair to ask why.",70
703,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The Minister, in his innocence, asks me to justify vote which I gave some years ago, and compare the sites which were then conhave sidered ; and I refuse to do so.",70
704,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Why honourable member, as Minister, say that the question was then finally settled?",70
705,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"As Minister, I had to regard the matter as finally settled by Parliament. Suppose I had opposed the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill , and, when it had been carried, I had been appointed Minister, would the Minister of Trade and Customs expect me to allow my own opinions and feelings to influence me in carrying out that Act? If Ministers are loyal to liament, they must subordinate their own views in carrying out legislation. not think I have been unfair towards Dalgety, but I am convinced that it is not! the best site for a Federal Capital. U p to the time of the selection of Dalgety, the New South Wales Government allowed the Commonwealth every liberty in this connection ; but I believe that a considerable majority of the people of New South Wales - thoug h I do not profess to state what the majority is-conside r that that is a wrong site, and that it was selected only because it was as far as could be from;! Sydney.",70
706,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Where better site nearer Sydney? This Canberra site was found only the other day.,70
707,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Dalget y was found only the other day - Mr Oliver did not consider it equal to Bombala.,70
708,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I suppose Bombala would be more objectionable to the honourable member than is Dalgety..,70
709,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I do'not mind answering, at the proper time, questions regarding any site, but my opin'on on the Bombala site is on record, and the right honourable member can refer to it . Surely we should pay respect to the feelings of a large number of persons, when good grounds can be shown for their irritation. If Western Australia or any other State was concerned, there would have been much more bitter and angry complaints from its representatives than have made by the representatives of New against South Wales, most of whom have tried to secure an amicable settlement.",70
710,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"We heard a good deal on the subject during the first three years. It was mentioned nearly every grievance day: ' Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Repre a sentations were made, and very properly ; to but there was not. the outcry that would been heard, I think, from the representatives of any other State. did the Mr. JOSEPH COOK - We never threatened secession.",70
711,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"No ; notwithstanding all the temptations to do so. I have too much faith in the advantages of - Federation to talk about secession in a case of this sort. But the people of New South Wales feel strongly on the matter, and I think that if honourable members will look into it fairly, they will admit that there is a good deal o i reason for their feeling. This Parliament has attempted to Par- depart from the spirit of the understanding, and has passed by better sites in order to I do remove the Seat of'Government-as far as possible from Sydney, and as near as possible to the borders of another State. I do not think the people of New South Wales' are likely to be satisfied with such an a r rangement. The right honourable member for Swan has asked, where is there a better site than Dalgety ? In my opinion, Canberra is superior in almost every respect. Sir JOHN FORREST.*-Has the honourable member been to both ?",70
712,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Yes , I have spent several days at Dalgety, and was a day at Canberra, but I had had some is there a previous acquaintance with the district. Coming now to the listed requirements of the right honourable member for Swan, both sites are more than_ioo miles from Sydney. Dalgety fulfils that requirement very completely, being nearly 300 miles away. Both that sites are more than 1,500 feet above sealevel, the Dalgety site, according to the right honoiable member for Swan, being at a height of 2,500 feet, and, according to the Commissioners, at a height of 2,690 feet. A site at such a height, especially on a plateau like Dalgety, must be exceedingly cold and inhospitable.",70
713,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,A record of temperatures has been published.,70
714,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I have heard persons who have been in the Antarctic say that the cold there is not unbearable when the weather is perfectly still, but that when a blizzard is blowing a man may lose his life by going 200 yards from his ship or his house. . I have visited Dalgety on a beautiful sunshiny day in May ; but we had not driven half way when the driver asked me to hold the reins as his hands weretoo cold to hold them. This he had to do, notwithstanding that he was wearing thick gloves and heavy clothing. Dalgety has a plentiful water supply; but Canberra also fulfils every requirement in that respect. The honourable member for South Sydney has said that 2,000,000 people could be supplied..",70
715,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I did not say anything to the contrary. Mr DUGALD THOMSON' - Then the fight honourable member agrees with the statement. I admit that the Snowy is a larger river than those on the Canberra site; but, whereas, it has been photographed where there are pools, the Canberra streams have been photographed where there are shallows. At Dalgety there are places where one can walk across the Snowy. Sir JOHN FORREST.;-The Cotter smaller stream.",71
716,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Yes , but others.",71
717,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,What others ?,71
718,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The Queanbeyan 'and the Molonglo.,71
719,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Bot h were absolutely dry last year, so that they could not supply the town of ' Queanbeyan with water.",71
720,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,There is no dam above Queanbeyan. The Queanbeyan River was selected by the Commonwealth Commissioners as the site for the Lake George water supply.,71
721,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"There is also the Murrumbidgee, and,' if the population justified it , water could be drawn from the Snowy mountains. The Minister talks about rivers running d r y ; but .what has been stated about the Sydney water scheme, which is capable of supply ing 60 gallons per head per day to a population of 2,250,000..",71
722,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"For monthsof last year the people of Sydney could not use their garden sprinklers. . Mr DUGALD THOMSON - In a re.port on Canberra, it is stated thatThe quantity of water available from the Cotter catchment cannot be estimated from the flow of the stream at any particular period. In the case of the magnificent catchment area of the Sydney water supply, which is capable of supplying 60 gallonsper head per day to two and a quarter million people, the total run off of the rivers f e l l as low as 1,200,000 gallons a day in 1902; but, by means of proper storage, such dry periods are satisfactorily tided over and the average requirements maintained. The right honourable member f p r Swan, in his minute on the Canberra site, deals with the question of good climate during summer and winter. It must be evident to any one that the climate cannot be as equable, at an elevation of 2,700 feet, as it is at a better sheltered site with an altitude of 1,900 feet. I admit that, as the right honourable member for Swan has pointed out, Dalgety possesses superior water power, but would remind honourable members that water power can' be"" obtained from some of the rivers in the Canberra district, and more particularly from the Murrumbidgee. It must not be forgotten that the water supply of Dalgety would be drawn, not from the Snowy, but from another stream, the catchment area and. flow of which is 50 per cent, less than that. from which the supply for Canberra would be obtained.",71
723,Mr WEBSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,It is to be drawn from two creeks in the Dalgety district. is a,71
724,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"Fro m the there are Mowamba, the Eucumbene, and the Crackenback. If manufacturing were indulged'into any extent on the Snowy River, or much settlement took place there, the water would be contaminated, and, in order to obtain a supply by gravitation, it was recommended that the creeks I have named should be tapped. The right honourable member for Swan also deals with the question of "" water frontage for recreation, sport, and beauty "" at Canberra and Dalgety. Such frontages can be obtained at Canberra by constructing artificial lakes, and so forth. Then the right honourable member refers to "" surrounding and adjacent scenery, with great natural features, within convenient distance."" The beauty . spots which can be reached from Dalgety, and to which the right honourable member refers, can also be reached from Canberra. They are not much further from Canberra than from Dalgety, and there, are certain beauty spots near Canberra which are far seven more distant from Dalgety. I desire now to refer to what is' described as the Bulletin post-card, which has been sent to most honourable members.",71
725,Mr WEBSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The Bulletin is a very reliable newspaper.,71
726,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"We ought not to pass by its action without making some protest. In the post-card addressed to me there appears the statementThe .Bulletin asks theHonorable Dugald Thomson, M.P., to hesitate before giving a provincial vote against Dalgety.",71
727,Mr LIDDELL,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,That is a direct insult.,72
728,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"When a newspaper attempts to log-roll in this way, and addresses such ' remarks to honourable members, it is time for us to take steps to prevent the Americanizing of Australian politics.",72
729,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Othe r newspapers have made threats.,72
730,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"News papers may make what remarks they, like in their columns, but when one chooses to address honourable members in this way it time for us to protest.",72
731,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,What is the objection?,72
732,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"-If the honourable member does not recognise it, it is useless for me to attempt to point it out to him. What are the arguments used by the Bulletin ? 1 allude to them because they have been adopted by some honourable members. It is said, for instance, that Dalgety should be the Australian Capital becauseI t is one of the Sites reserved by the State Government of New South Wales as possible locations for a Capital. That is to say, it was formally offered, so far as the New South Wales State Government could be persuaded to formally offer any place. That is not correct.",72
733,Mr WEBSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,It is.,72
734,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It is not, as compared with the offer of other sites, made by the State Government. Then it is said- . . . It is in the locality which is declared by an officer appointed by the State Government of New South Wales to report on possible Sites to be the very best of all those which he had discovered. As a matter of fact, it was Bombala on which the officer reported favourably.",72
735,Mr WEBSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,There is no difference. favour of Tooma.,72
736,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"The two sites are absolutely different. We have the further statement that It is a fairly fertile region if Joseph ruthers can be relied upon. Joseph promised to extend the railway from Cooma to Bombala because the richness of the country called aloud perfectly free from such attacks. for better means of communication, and had heard the call in his ear. I make no allusion to the way in which reference is made to Mr Carruthers; but will any one say that Mr Carruthers, when Premier of New South Yales, proposed to construct a railway to Dalgety ? As a matter of fact, he proposed to construct a line fromCooma to Bombala along a route that would pass away from Dalgety. The further statement is made in the Bulletin post-card that If a fair-sized area is taken the Federal .city will have 'its own port. «The sources of its water supply will be within its own territory and under its own controlDoes any one imagine that the Snowy River will, be granted right up to its source as the water supply of the territory ? New South Wales would not be likely to do anything of the kind. No State would be justified in making such a grant. The statement is absolutely incorrect. The paragraph continuesso that no disgruntled State Government can cut off that water supply or carelessly allow it t.o become contaminated. It will also have a land outlet into two States, so that it won't be wholly dependent on any State Government for railway and road communication with the outer world. Is that correct ?",72
737,Mr WEBSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,I do not think it is.,72
738,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"No r do I . So far as the question of outlet is concerned, it would not be less under the control of a State than Canberra would be. Il is surrounded by State .territory,. and could be interfered with if that State desired to do so. As a matter of fact, however, the State, if it attempted anything of the kind, could not maintain its interference.",72
739,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,The Constitution would prevent it from doing so.,72
740,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That is so. Then it is saidFurthermore, Monaro is a strongly defensible Site. It is absolutely essential that Australia should not have its Parliament, Cabinet, official and military head-quarters, treasury^ chief 'arsenal, and all the machinery of Government, in a coastal city where the first attack might scatter the whole governmental machine into the bush.",72
741,Mr WEBSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,That is an argument in,72
742,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"It is a still stronger argument in favour' of the selection of a site in the Macdonnell Carranges, which was recently suggested by an explorer. All the suggested sites are It is Joseph also declared by the Bulletin that of all the proposed Sites, it is the one the cession of which will deprive New South Wales of the least population; and that it .comprises a regionwhich has in recent years at least cost New South Wales more than it yielded in taxation, therefore, the monetary loss to New South Wales will be n i l . That is a strong recommendation in favour of its selection ! In other words, Dalgety, as a district does not pay its way, althoughif has been settled as long as most parts of New South Wales.",72
743,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,But has railway communication.,73
744,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"There is a railway not far away. . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The Treasurer said, it was one of the finest districts in Australia, and ought to have a railway.",73
745,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"He referred to Monaro, and not to Dalgety.",73
746,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,And that same thing.,73
747,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"One might as well speak cf London as England because it is in England as speak of Dalgety ancl Monaro as one and the same. Perhaps the right honourable member will say that there is no difference between Dalgety and Canberra, as they are in the same locality. I do not wish it fo be thought that I am endeavouring to depreciate the merits of Dalgety. I am giving my real opinion of it as a site, and I say that it is, in my view, inferior to Canberra.",73
748,Mr WEBSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Has the honourable member seen it ?,73
749,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,Yes ; I have seen bofh sites.,73
750,Mr WEBSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,But the honourable member has not seen Tooma.,73
751,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"No . journed. But I have been in the Monaro district more than once, and upon, the last I saw the particular site proposed. I have . shown why the people of New South Wales have some reason for the very strong feeling which they entertain regarding action of this Parliament. that feeling of irritation may grow into tives, something worse, surely, if we can remove it by any reasonable compromise, it is duty to do so. I am, endeavouring to meet the people of New South Wales by abandoning my first choice in favour of a compromise. When we enter into such close relationship with a State, as we must do when we establish the Federal Capital in New South Wales, surely it is well for us to enter its territory upon the most amicable terms. Surely it is to Our interest to foster feelings of mutual goodwill. I can see an objection to any such compromise only if the interests of Australia would be sacrificed. I do not see nor wish to see any such thing. I should not argue in favour of the selection of Canberra if I thought that it was an inferior site to that - of Dalgety. But I think it is a superior one. I am sure that af a majority of honourable members visited both places, and compared them, they would come to the not enjoyed conclusion that Canberra was preferable to Dalgety.",73
752,Mr WEBSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,A majority of'honourable members would also say that Tooma was superior to Canberra.,73
753,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"That may be so. But I do not know that it would fulfil the conditions of the Constitution any more than do some of the other is the sites which have been suggested. When reasonable ground exists for resentment, which may grow, and which it is not desirable that we should permitto grow, surely, if without sacrificing the interests of Australia, we can effect a reasonable compromise, it is our duty to do so. I maintain that we ought not to encourage dissension, but that our endeavour should be to foster amity, and to induce the great State of New South Wales, which possesses over one-third of the population of Australia, ancl which has not aiways hitherto proved itself unreasonable in its treatment of the Commonwealth, to work cordially with us. I believe that we can do this by agreeing to a compromise, which will carry out the intention of the Constitution, and its attached memorandum, without wronging the Commonwealth in any way.
