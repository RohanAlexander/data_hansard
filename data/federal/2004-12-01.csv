1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr David Hawker) took the chair at 9.00 a.m. and read prayers. NA (PROSTHESES) BILL 2004 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Abbott, and read a first time. Second Reading",7
2,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the National Health Act 1953 to require registered health benefits organisations (health funds), to provide cover, under their applicable benefits arrangements for no gap and gap permitted prostheses provided as part of an episode of hospital treatment involving a professional service for which a Medicare benefit is payable. The new arrangements will ensure that private health insurance members will have access to safe and effective prostheses at no gap for every Medicare benefits schedule item. The bill amends the act to allow the minister to determine in writing: - no gap prostheses–and the benefit amount for each no gap prosthesis; and - gap permitted prostheses–and the minimum and maximum benefit amount for each gap permitted prosthesis. When making prosthesis determinations, the minister may take into account advice from experts in the field of prostheses and in the health insurance industry. An advisory structure, featuring a Prostheses and Devices Committee comprising clinicians and representations of private health funds, prostheses suppliers, private hospitals and consumers, is already operating. What emerges from this process will be supported by the decision making framework provided for in this bill. A bill to give effect to the government's prostheses reforms was introduced on 12 August 2004 but lapsed when parliament was prorogued on 31 August. The bill is now being reintroduced with some minor modifications. The bill now includes provisions which allow health funds to continue to benefit from the stronger negotiating power of the public hospital network. These provisions have been developed in consultation with industry. The intent of the original bill remains: - members of health funds will have no out-of-pocket expense options for a no gap prosthesis; - members of health funds may have an out-of-pocket expense option for a gap permitted prosthesis, but the amount of the gap will be no greater than the difference between the minimum and maximum benefit amount for the gap permitted prosthesis. The government is concerned to ensure that no health fund member should be deprived of access to a no gap prosthesis should their condition require it. A principle of the reforms is that fitness for purpose should be a key criterion in determining access to a no gap prosthesis. That a prosthesis is the least expensive may not mean that it is the most clinically appropriate for the purpose needed by the patient. Where members are treated as a private patient in a public hospital, health fund benefits will not exceed the benefit amount for a no gap prosthesis, or the maximum benefit amount for a gap permitted prosthesis. The revised bill now recognises that public hospitals may be able to purchase prostheses from suppliers at prices that are below the determined benefit amount or minimum benefit amount. Health funds and public hospitals may, in these circumstances, agree on payment of benefit below the benefit amount for no gap prosthesis, or below the minimum benefit amount for a gap permitted prosthesis. Where the patient is likely to have an outof-pocket cost, information should be provided by the patient's fund and doctor that will allow the patient to make an informed decision about the choice of prostheses. This initiative does not affect the ability of health funds to provide, under their applicable benefits arrangements, cover for prostheses which are not listed on a no gap or gap permitted prostheses determination, for example, more expensive prostheses relating to MBS procedures, and prostheses not related to MBS procedures or cover for prostheses under their tables of ancillary health benefits. Members of health funds will still have the ability to choose to pay lower premiums for lesser benefits. Health funds will not be required to pay benefits for a prosthesis, where a member has made an election not to be covered for the hospital procedure. There have been recent changes to health insurance legislation that enable members to access basic hospital accommodation and nursing care costs for services performed by accredited podiatrists. In those circumstances, I encourage health funds to cover the prostheses implanted by podiatric surgeons. Finally, the bill also makes minor consequential amendments to the act in relation to health fund rule changes and loyalty bonus schemes with effect from 1 July. I acknowledge the contribution of all stakeholders who have contributed to the development of the new arrangements for the coverage of prostheses for consumers with private health insurance. The new administrative arrangements, leading to the production of a 2005 prostheses schedule, have been under way since the middle of the year, and the progress to date on what are complex and difficult matters has been very encouraging. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCClelland) adjourned. NA",7
3,Mr ABBOTT,STANDING ORDERS AUTHORITY,"I move: That the Clerk be authorised to correct clerical errors or inconsistencies in wording in the standing orders, but not so as to cause a change to the meaning of any standing order. As members would be aware, new standing orders came into effect on 16 November. The new standing orders were substantially rewritten and reorganised in order to modernise the rules and enhance the understanding that members and others have of the rules by which the House operates. As you can imagine with such an exercise, we have subsequently discovered one or two inconsistencies in wording which should be amended to make sure that the new standing orders are as clear and as precise as possible. The motion before the House proposes a mechanism to address minor clerical errors or inconsistencies without taking the time of the House. The proposed mechanism is similar to that which permits the clerk, with the authority of the Deputy Speaker, to correct clerical or typographical errors in a bill. The mechanism obviously would only be used for minor amendments which do not change the meaning of any standing order. I commend this motion to the House. Question agreed to. NA (100% MEDICARE REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 November, on motion by Mr Abbott: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Ms Gillard moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “while not declining to give the bill a second reading, this Parliament condemns the government for: (1) doing nothing while out of pocket costs to see a general practitioner have soared from a little over $8 to a national age of $15.37 and failing to attach conditions to 100% Medicare aimed at reducing out of pocket costs; (2) causing bulk billing rates to fall from 80% under Labor to a little over 70% and failing to attach conditions to 100% Medicare aimed at bolstering bulk billing rates; (3) failing to ensure that any of the $1.7 billion spent will be passed on to patients; and (4) continuing its undermining of Medicare as Australia's universal public health surance system”.",8
4,Mr ABBOTT,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Obviously, I thank all members who have participated in this debate. I particularly thank the member for Lalor for her contribution, although there are some issues that I think do need some government response. Let me just reiterate for the benefit of members that this measure is designed to implement a clear and unambiguous election commitment of the government. Early in the election campaign we pledged, should we be re-elected, to raise the rebate for GPs to 100 per cent of the scheduled fee. This means that on average the rebate for GP services will go up by $5, and the rebate for standard GP services-for a standard GP consultation-will increase by $4.60. The benefit in this is that it will encourage GPs to continue bulk-billing a significant proportion of their patients, but for those patients who do not get bulk-billed there will be a significant additional amount of money in their pockets. So this is an important measure for everyone who uses our health system; it is an important measure for everyone who needs GP services. One of the points which the member for Lalor made in her contribution to this debate was to observe that over the last few years there has been a steady and not insignificant decline in the number of GP services delivaver- ered to the Australian population. It is true that over the last six years there has been about a seven per cent decline in the number of GP services delivered to the Australian people, but the government is confident that measures put in place by this government will increase the number of GP services, at least for the next couple of years. I also point out to the House that, while the actual number of GP consultations has declined somewhat, there are more longer consultations today than before. In 1998 long inconsultations were but nine per cent of the total; today they are some 12 per cent of the total. Generally speaking, the longer the consultation, the higher the quality of the medical service delivered. The member for Lalor has moved an opposition amendment to the government's bill. I will comment briefly on some of the provisions of the opposition's amendment. The opposition is concerned about the rise in Medicare gap payments. No-one likes to pay gaps. Everyone would prefer, if possible, to pay nothing and, if we have to pay something, to pay as little as possible, but the fact is that there is no such thing as free medicine. All health services have to be paid for, either by taxpayers or by patients, and it is no bad thing that there are at least some price signals in our health system, because it makes patients conscious of what they are getting and is a significant deterrent against overservicing and overuse of our health services. I point out to the member for Lalor that in the most recent quarter the gap payment for GP services actually declined. It was the first time since, I think, 1998 that this had happened. There was also a significant reduction in gap payments for specialist services. This was largely due to the introduction of the MedicarePlus safety net-a safety net which members opposite, as far as I am aware, still oppose and are still pledged to repeal, if they ever find themselves on the government benches. The member for Lalor's amendment criticises the government for declining bulkbilling rates. I hate to accuse the member for Lalor of living in the past, but the fact is since December of last year the bulk-billing rates have been substantially increasing because of the incentive payments put in place by this government. What is more, the incentive payments are targeted towards the most vulnerable groups in our community, namely concession card holders and families with kids. Bulk-billing is important and it should be widely available, particularly for disadvantaged groups, but Medicare is not identical to bulk-billing. Medicare is a universal guarantee of affordable access to highquality health services, and that is the Medicare that this government has strengthened and protected over the last 8½ years. The member for Lalor's amendment states that the government has failed ‘to ensure that any of the $1.7 billion spent will be passed on to patients.' This is quite incorrect. It sumes that doctors will simply pocket the money themselves. I say respectfully to the member for Lalor that I think her public standing and that of the opposition would be enhanced if the anti-doctor campaign so consistently waged by members opposite ended forthwith. Doctors are not perfect; doctors are human. Some doctors suffer from the usual temptation-to which, alas, humanity is subject-to enhance their own financial standing, but the fact is that as a group doctors are as committed and as idealistic as any in our society, and the idea that this is about enriching doctors and not about helping patients is simply false. This measure will encourage doctors to keep bulk-billing patients, and it means that those patients who are not bulk-billed will have more money in their pocket. Finally, the opposition's amendment claims that the government are ‘continuing to undermine Medicare as a universal public health insurance system.' Since I have been the minister for health, the government have that committed some $11 billion in additional funding to the health portfolio-the vast majority of that in the area of medical services. Why would we invest $11 billion more in a system that we were determined to destroy? The fact is that this government do not just talk about Medicare; we invest the money in Medicare that Medicare needs. We have just gone through an election. It was an election the pollsters said was fundamentally determined by health and education-an election where the pollsters said health and education were the most important issues. The fact that the government was able to win so decisively an election where health was the most important issue-as important as any issue-is a sign that the Australian people know that they can trust the Howard government with Medicare and they as- can trust the Howard government with their health care. I very much commend this legislation to the House. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Ms Gillard's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided.

6,Dr STONE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (9.28 a.m.)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend acts that are a consequence of the commencement of the Financial Management Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (FMLA Act 1999) on 1 July 1999 and to update, clarify and align other financial management and reporting provisions. It proposes amendments to 112 acts and the repeal of 28 acts. An exposure draft of the bill was subject to an inquiry by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA), which tabled its report (number 395), Inquiry into the draft Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill, on 20 August 2003. The government tabled its response to the report on 26 June 2004. The report's recommendations led to changes to the bill that were agreed by the government in its response. The JCPAA inquiry was also of benefit because it provided an opportunity for stakeholders to discuss a range of important issues and to gain an appreciation of the similarity of many of the amendments proposed in the bill. A number of other changes have been made to the bill since the exposure draft was released for the purposes of the JCPAA inquiry. These changes reflect recent developments. The Minister for Finance and Administration is notifying the Chairman of the JCPAA of these changes and the reasons for them. In the second reading of the FMLA Act 1999, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the 2004 Minister for Finance and Administration, the Hon. Peter Slipper MP, foreshadowed that a consequential amendments bill would be introduced that will ensure that terminology in other acts is consistent with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act) as amended by the FMLA Act 1999. These consequential amendments account for the bulk of the amendments proposed in schedule 1 of the bill. The FMLA Act 1999 abolished the following three funds created by the FMA Act: the loan fund, the reserved money fund and the commercial activities fund. These funds were located outside the consolidated revenue fund as it was then envisaged. The balances of these funds were merged in the consolidated revenue fund and components of the reserved money fund and commercial activities fund were replaced with special accounts. A special account records amounts in the consolidated revenue fund appropriated for expenditure on the purposes of the special account. The FMLA Act 1999 also reflected the adoption of the concept of a self-executing consolidated revenue fund. That is, that money raised or received by the executive government automatically forms part of the consolidated revenue fund without the need to credit a ledger account or a bank account designated as the consolidated revenue fund. The FMLA Act 1999 provided that references in other acts and legislative instruments to the funds being abolished, and related terminology, were deemed to be read as changed to the new terminology introduced by that act. The amendments contained in schedule 1 of the bill are almost exclusively textual changes to acts to align them with the changed terminology introduced by the FMLA Act 1999. Most of the amendments proposed in schedule 2 of the bill provide for the of powers, from the Treasurer to the finance minister, to approve investments, money raising and guarantees of certain bodies that are legally and financially separate from the Commonwealth. Most of these bodies are authorities subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act). The amendments also introduce clear delegation powers for the finance minister. The transfer of these approval powers will co-locate in Finance, as one central portfolio, powers relating to the financial oversight of bodies that are mainly funded from the budget. This will provide for more efficient and effective decision-making in relation to the resources available to these entities. Schedule 3 of the bill proposes the repeal of acts. Most of these acts would otherwise have required amendment of text to align with the FMLA Act 1999. However, because the acts are redundant, they are included for repeal instead. Schedule 1 of the bill proposes minor amendments to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001, again reflecting the concept that the consolidated revenue fund is self-executing. The Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted about these amendments and the required number of votes were received pursuant to the Corporations Agreement. The bill also proposes amendments to the FMA Act and the CAC Act that are not covered by the types of amendments that I described earlier. The amendments to the FMA Act are mainly of the following three types. The first concerns clarifying and expanding the information required, or allowed, in a determination of the finance minister that establishes a special account. This amendment reflects the government's agreement to recommendatransfer tion 1 of the JCPAA's report 395. The second type concerns specifying the membership, in certain circumstances, of an advisory committee that considers proposals for large act of grace payments or waivers, to replace a reference to the chief executive of the former Department of Administrative Services with a chief executive nominated by the finance minister. The third type concerns clarifying delegation powers of chief executives of agencies, and directions relating to the exercise of a power or function delegated. The amendments to the CAC Act align the offence provisions applying to the conduct of officers with the Criminal Code Act 1995. This proposed law will update, clarify and align a wide range of financial management provisions applying to Commonwealth entities and thereby enhance the financial management framework of the Australian Government generally. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCClelland) adjourned. ENVIRONMENT: TASMANIAN NA",12
7,Mr ALBANESE,FORESTS,"I move: Under standing order 47, that so much of standing orders be suspended as would allow the government to table the maps and precise boundaries for the 170,000 hectares of Tasmanian old growth forests it will protect in accordance with the deadline of December 1 stated in its own policy. During the election campaign, the Tasmanian forests and the need to protect them became a major issue. The Howard government declared in its own policy, A Sustainable Future for Tasmania, that it would identify 170,000 hectares of old growth forest in Tasmania and protect it. That was backed up by a personal visit by the Prime Minister to Tasmania on 6 October. The Prime Minister stated at a press conference in Launceston: ‘The Tasmanian Environment Minister and Senator Campbell will get together and have the details of the government's Tasmanian forest policy, including the precise boundaries, set- Ruddock, P.M. tled by 1 December.' We now know, because of the government's failure to do that, that it was a stunt. It was a grubby political trick. They have had nine years to get their act together.

NA AND STANDARDS BILL 2004 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Hunt, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
10,Mr HUNT,WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.53 a.m.)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Managing Australia's freshwater resources effectively and efficiently is one of our most important environmental and resource management challenges. Without secure and high-quality water resources we would be unable to sustain our regional economies or urban communities. The long-term health of our freshwater ecosystems also depends on us minimising the negative impacts of agricultural and urban water consumption. The emerging urban water problems in Australia are looking increasingly serious. One only needs to look at Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and south-east Queensland for a graphic illustration of the urban water issues. High rates of population growth, the strong economy, increasing demands for environmental releases and prolonged drought conditions are continuing to offset gains from conservation programs and are increasing the pressure on available water supplies. Reduced rainfall and inflows to storages have resulted in much lower sustainable yields from available storages than had been projected as recently as five to 10 years ago. The Gold Coast, for example, will be past the sustainable yields of its existing dams in only a few short years. Previous estimates of the potential water available from unexploited dam resources are being revised downward as a result of the recent drought at a time when the population is growing at a tremendous rate. As a consequence the Gold Coast is now in the process of planning a new regional pipeline to collect water from a dam near Brisbane. Unfortunately this solution will only provide temporary relief and the Gold Coast is now rightly looking at recycled water as well as desalination and rainwater as part of its future water supply strategy. Water conservation has become more than a noble idea for the Gold Coast, but is now an integral part of meeting future water needs. The Howard government has taken this challenge very seriously by committing significant resources to improving water management across the nation and by working in partnership with the state and territory governments. Today I am introducing a bill for the introduction of a national water efficiency labelling and standards scheme that will require water efficiency labels to appear on a range of common water using products such as washing machines, dishwashers and toilets and also establish a regime for the setting of minimum water efficiency standards. But before I explain the detail of the bill, I would like to provide the House with the broader context of this initiative. In 1994 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to implement a strategic framework for the reform of the water industry. Through the implementation of water reforms over the last 10 years, Australian governments have made some real progress towards efficient and sustainable water management. The recognition of the need for environmental water provisions, the separation of water entitlements from land, and pricing reform, have all been significant steps forward. At the COAG meeting in June this year, the government and the states and territories-except, unfortunately, for Western Australia and Tasmania-agreed to an intergovernmental agreement on a National Water Initiative. In essence, COAG recognised the twin imperatives to increase the productivity and efficiency of Australia's water use and to ensure the health of river and ground water systems. It was agreed that opportunities for a cooperative national approach to further progress water reform exist in a number of areas. These form the basis of the National Water Initiative. Key features of the National Water Initiative include: - secure and nationally compatible water access entitlements; - improved water trading, to expand water markets to their widest practical geographic scope; - accountable, outcomes-focused provision and management of environmental water; and, - actions to better manage urban water demand. The urban water reforms are aimed at improving water use efficiency and demand management, making better use of stormwater and recycled water, and encouraging water sensitive urban design. There has been a lot of activity in this area over the last 10 years, including in the reform of water pricing in urban areas. This bill-the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004is a key initiative in support of the urban water reform agenda. The government is also working with states and territories to develop national guidelines for water recycling-managing health and environmental risks. The new guidelines will cover water recycling and water sensitive urban design and be a part of the National Water Quality Management Strategy. The guidelines will increase the uptake of water recycling opportunities in Australia to provide new sources of supply in a way that protects public health and the environment. In that context, this government is pushing forward with the implementation of its commitments under the National Water Initiative. During the election, the government announced the establishment of the $2 billion Australian water fund. Investment under the fund will help achieve the objectives of the National Water Initiative through practical, on-ground water solutions. The three programs that make up the Australian water fund-Water Smart Australia, Raising National Water Standards and Water Wise Communities-will directly support improvements in how we manage urban water use. In particular, investment under ing National Water Standards program will support this water efficiency labelling scheme. The government has introduced legislation in this session creating the new National Water Commission, a key commitment under the National Water Initiative. The National Water Commission will have two vital roles: - it will evaluate and advise on the reform progress under the National Water Initiative in accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement; and - it will also advise on project selection and administer projects under the Water Smart Australia and Raising National Water Standards programs of the Australian Water Fund. So the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill must be seen as part of the government's very significant achievements in relation to water reform and as a contribution towards achieving efficiency improvements under the National Water Initiative. At just under 1,800 gigalitres per year, that is, 1,800 billion litres per year, household water use accounts for about 16 per cent of the consumption of the mains-supplied water in Australia. This is the second largest share of mains water use after agriculture, which, at around 8,400 gigalitres per year, accounts for around 75 per cent of consumption. Clearly whilst the ‘main game' in water consumption will always focus on agricultural use, urban and household water use cannot be ignored, especially as our main urban centres are experiencing significant water supply problems. The dual effects of increasing population and the emerging impacts of climate change make efforts to manage urban water use ever more important. Indeed, between 1996 and 2001, the supply of water to households in the main urban the Rais- areas increased by 13 per cent. The purpose of the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill is therefore to establish a water efficiency scheme for a range of important water-using products. Through the scheme, the government wants to empower consumers by providing them with information about the water efficiency of products so that they can contribute to water conservation directly through the purchase of more water-efficient products. This information will predominantly come in the form of labels on products covered by the scheme, but also from the associated website and promotional material. The net savings to consumers are forecast to be substantial. By simply choosing more efficient products, by 2021 the community stands to save more than $600 million through reduced water and energy bills. And these savings will be achieved without any compromise in product performance or convenience or any major adjustment in user behaviour. A water-efficient washing machine performs its function just as well as an inefficient one, as does a water-efficient urinal. So the scheme will promote clever design that benefits both consumers and the economy. The water efficiency scheme will be the first of its kind in the world. Given that pressure on freshwater resources is emerging as a truly global problem, the potential for Australia to position itself as a leading exporter of water-efficient technologies and expertise is significant. Underpinned by a robust technical regime, our exporters will be able to use the label as a platform for marketing the water efficiency of their products to a growing global market. The government estimates that by 2021, water efficiency labelling will cut domestic water use by five per cent or 87,200 megalitres per year. A total of 610,000 megalitres-more water than in Sydney Harbour, for example-will be conserved by 2021. Nearly half the water savings will come from more efficient washing machines, about 25 per cent from showers and 22 per cent from toilets. The scheme will also deliver substantial energy savings and greenhouse gas abatement through a reduction in hot water use. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for Australia is projected to reach about 570 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per annum by 2021, with a cumulative total of around 4,600 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2021. The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill establishes a national legal and administrative structure for the scheme. And yet, in the true spirit of federalism, the scheme provides for working in partnership with the states and territories, which will enact complementary legislation. This mirror legislation will fill in the small constitutional gaps in the Commonwealth's powers. Importantly, the states and territories have also agreed in principle to assist with funding the program using the usual population-based funding formula for any program costs that cannot be recovered through industry registration fees. The government expects the scheme to commence in 2005. Initially, six appliances will be required to carry water efficiency labels: washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, taps and urinals. Flow control devices will be covered on a voluntary basis. In addition to labelling, it is proposed that toilets will be required to comply with a minimum efficiency standard so that inefficient toilets with an average flush volume of more than 5½ litres can no longer be sold in Australia. Under the framework set out in the bill, it will be possible in future years to introduce minimum water efficiency standards for additional water-using or water-saving products other than toilets, where the need for this can be established. Minimum water efficiency standards will ensure that inefficient products can no longer be sold. The bill will also allow the product range covered by labelling requirements to be expanded if this is found to be appropriate in future years. Whilst the scheme will initially cover washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, urinals, taps trol devices, there is every reason to believe that further research and development will reveal that other products would benefit from labelling and minimum standards. For example, evaporative air-cooling systems and hot water systems are potential candidates for inclusion in the scheme. Industry has been consulted on the detail of the proposal and I am pleased to advise that the scheme enjoys broad support. The water efficiency scheme will help consumers make informed decisions about what products to purchase and the water, energy and financial savings that are possible. Industry will also benefit from the scheme because it will create a level playing field in relation to claims about water efficiency and provide for nationally consistent product standards. In conclusion, in this Year of the Built vironment the water efficiency labelling and standards initiative provides another important way that all Australians can conserve water and so help to make our urban communities more sustainable. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. NA Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2004)",16
11,Mr HUNT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (10.08 a.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2004). The tariff proposal that I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the tariff). Schedule 1 of this proposal alters the tariff to specify that the chemical paraquat dichloride, classified to subheading 2933.39.00, may include an emetic added for safety reasons. Paraquat dichloride is commonly used and flow con- as a herbicide. By enabling the inclusion of paraquat dichloride with an emetic added for safety reasons in subheading 2933.39.00, the same duty outcome of ‘free' is achieved as for paraquat dichloride that contains other allowable safety measures such as colouring or stenching agents. This schedule also substitutes item 22 in schedule 4 to the customs tariff to accommodate changes in technology in the oil and gas industries. The new item reduces the cost of certain goods imported for use directly in connection with the exploration for, and development of, oil and gas wells. The above alterations were previously tabled in parliament in customs tariff proposals during 2003. The alterations were also incorporated as amendments in Customs Tariff Amendment (Paraquat Dichloride) Bill 2004 Enand Customs Tariff Amendment (Oil, Gas and Other Measures) Bill 2004, respectively. These bills lapsed with the prorogation of parliament on 31 August 2004. Customs Tariff Notice No. 1 (2004) was published in special Commonwealth Gazette S 367 on 1 September 2004 in order to continue the operation of these measures, on and from that date. Failure to publish such a notice extending these measures after parliament had prorogued would have resulted in the reinstatement of the five per cent duty rate on paraquat dichloride containing an emetic, and the loss of additional concessions for the oil and gas industry granted under new item 22 of schedule 4 to the tariff. Schedule 2 of this proposal amends item 68 in part III of schedule 4 to the tariff to extend the SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme. On 8 August 2004, the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, MP, announced that the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement (Textile Clothing and Footwear Provisions) Scheme (the SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme) would be extended for seven years, to 31 December 2011, from its current legislated end date of 31 December 2004.",20
12,The SPARTECA,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"TCF Provisions) Scheme, which commenced on 1 March 2001, provides for the duty-free entry of certain textiles, clothing and footwear from forum island countries covered by the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement. The scheme is administered through item 68 in schedule 4 to the tariff. Schedule 3 of this proposal amends the rates of customs duty applicable to certain alcohol and tobacco products specified in a number of items in new schedule 5 to the tariff. Schedule 5 sets out rates of duty for certain US originating goods, including those alcohol and tobacco products, in accordance with the provisions of the US free trade agreement. Rates of duty for these alcohol and tobacco products are subject to adjustment, in February and August of each year in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Act 2004 as enacted does not include rates that take account of the gust CPI increase. Therefore, it is necessary to amend those rates of customs duty in schedule 5 to include that increase. The alterations contained in this proposal ensure that rates of duty on those alcohol and tobacco products are consistent with duty rates for the same goods when specified in schedule 3 to the tariff and accord with the terms of the Australia-US free trade agreement. A summary of the alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is now being circulated. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. NA Approval of Proposal",21
13,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Robertson-Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads) (10.14 a.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for works in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 30 November 2004, namely: Replacement and extension of cooling towers-Old Parliament House. This motion proposes the replacement and extension of the cooling towers at the rear service road of Old Parliament House, located in the parliamentary zone. Increased air conditioning capacity is needed to provide suitable climate control, particularly for museum purposes and to provide stable conditions for the care and preservation of valuable heritage items and fabric, as well as the need to satisfy occupational health and safety obligations. The existing cooling towers are now at the end of their useful life. I understand that the delegate for the Minister for the Environment and Heritage has decided that the project is not a controlled action unAuder section 75 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The proposed works include: excavation and construction of a link building between the existing cooling tower building and the existing substation, extension of the existing cooling tower building in the opposite direction, the removal and installation of cooling tower equipment, and other minor works. The National Capital Authority has advised that it is prepared to grant works approval to the proposal pursuant to subsection 12(1)(b) of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories was advised of the proposal on 17 November 2004. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to.

15,Ms MACKLIN,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Jagajaga) (10.17 a.m.)Labor strongly disagrees with the Howard government's unfair funding system that has delivered the biggest funding increases to the schools with the least need, but we will not jeopardise funding for all schools. Delaying the legislation before us today would stop the flow of funds to schools for 2005 and jeopardise the education of students in around 2,500 needy non-government schools and nearly 7,000 government schools. Labor is not going to punish hundreds of thousands of Australian students just because the Howard government continues to have an unfair schools funding system. That is why we will pass this legislation even though it will continue the biased and unfair funding system introduced by this government in 2001. The Howard government has been giving massive funding increases to schools with the least need. These schools charge $12,000 in fees and educate less than five per cent of Australian school children, yet they have received staggering increases of up to 300 per cent since 2001. Government schools educate 70 per cent of schoolchildren but they have received a tiny 20 per cent increase-just indexation, in fact, for rising costs. Catholic schools educate 20 per cent of schoolchildren but they have received only a 25 per cent increase, hardly enough to cover annual cost increases. The King's School in Sydney, with its vast number of playing fields, rifle range, swimming pool, boatshed, museum with full-time archivist and multimillion-dollar centre for leadership and learning, amongst a host of other top-of-the-line resources, charges fees of up to $17,000 a year and does not need, by its own admission, the 215 per cent funding increase it received between 2001 and 2004 from the Howard government. By contrast, Trinity Catholic College at Auburn and Fairvale High School, just around the corner from the King's School, received respectively an increase of 20 and 25 per cent, mostly indexation, just to cover annual cost increases. That is 25 per cent for the Catholic college, 20 per cent for the government high school and a 215 per cent increase for the King's School. It is just not fair. These schools do not have anything like the facilities at King's. It is Trinity Catholic College and Fairvale High School, not King's, that are in need of more resources. Under a fair funding system, schools with the greatest need would get the biggest funding increases, but the Howard government's unfair system delivers it the other way round. Under the Howard government we have had woefully inadequate funding for IT, buildings and facilities for the majority of schools. The current level of capital expenditure at government schools is way below that of other schools. This government has refused to provide any real increase in government school capital funding since 1996. In 2001, average capital expenditure at government schools was $336 per student, compared to $1,600 at independent schools. Catholic schools' average capital expenditure in 2001 was half the average expenditure of independent schools. There has been no effort at federal responsibility, no vision, no commitment to great schooling for all under this government. Unfortunately the legislation before us today is just more evidence of this lack of responsibility, more evidence that this government does not believe in giving all Australian children a great education. These bills continue to favour the small number of students in the most expensive schools and neglect the vast majority of students in government schools and needy nongovernment schools. The general recurrent funding arrangements provided by this legislation for non-government schools are unsustainable. Under this arbitrary and damaging system the Howard government has frozen funding growth for more than 60 per cent of Catholic schools, leaving them with no security about their financial future. But, as I said before, schools are dependent on the passage of these bills for their immediate future. If these bills are not passed by the end of this year, many schools will be unable to pay their teachers in 2005 and schools will not be able to secure the resources they need to meet the needs of their students. So we will not jeopardise that funding. However, I am today going to put forward an amendment in good faith that brings some integrity to the educational programs that the legislation supports and I hope the minister will bear it in mind and recognise that it is being put forward in good faith. I hope we can include at least part of it. Labor believes that there should be different principles underpinning Commonwealth funding for schools and these are set out in my second reading amendment, which is now being circulated in my name. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for its unfair funding policies for schools (2) believes that there is a need to restore integrity and sustainability to Commonwealth funding of schools through the adoption of comprehensive principles that include: (a) supporting high quality public schooling as a national priority; (b) recognising the entitlement of all children and young people to national standards of educational sults and resources; (c) giving priority in funding for all Commonwealth programs schools to meeting the educational and financial needs of schools; (d) recognition of the right of parents to choose the type of schooling for their children and to public funding for that schooling based on need; and (e) Commonwealth funding for schools to be provided as part of a national partnership with State and Territory governments so that all governments work together to deliver high quality schooling for all”. The first of these principles is to establish quite clearly that the Commonwealth has an explicit responsibility for the quality of public schools across Australia. For over a century public schools have been the crucible for the education of the vast majority of Australians-and I am sure the vast majority of people in this House-from all walks of life and from all social, economic, religious and cultural backgrounds. They continue to be the only way that governments can guarantee access to a high quality of education for all. We cannot walk away from our responsibility at the national level for the future of our public schools. But the Howard government has refused to provide this support. Instead, we have seen the Prime Minister, the Minister for Education, Science and Trainingwho is at the table today-and other senior ministers of the cabinet attacking for political reasons public schools and the teachers who work in them. Labor believes that the federal parliament must make public schools across Australia a national priority. We also believe that the children and young people in all of our schools are entitled to a decent standard of education and that this entitlement should be explicit in the legislation. Students are also entitled to build re- from the basics to the full range of things that they need to know to be able to reach their full potential. For the national governfor ment, this should mean supporting them to achieve the educational outcomes set out in the national goals of schooling. Achieving these national goals of schooling for all, however, cannot take place in a resources vacuum. Labor supports a national schools resource standard to make sure that we provide the resources schools will need to deliver a great education. This requires a recurrent standard guaranteeing all students access to the teachers, teaching support, curriculum, learning materials and parent and community liaison that they need to realise the national goals for themselves. The absence of an explicit resource standard for schools is a major fault with the funding arrangements set out in these bills. The bills do link general recurrent grants to a measure of average government schools recurrent costs, known as AGSRC. But there is no connection between this measure and the educational goals we want all students to achieve. It is simply an after-the-event calculation of the national average of recurrent expenditures by state and territory governments on each primary and secondary student in our government schools. The minister I am sure knows that AGSRC is a measure of state and territory expenditures. To the extent that Commonwealth general recurrent funding has any connection with educational goals it is the outcome of state and territory decisions. There is no clear rationale for the way that AGSRC is used in these bills. Schedule 4 part 2 of the legislation shows that the minimum grant for the one or two nongovernment schools at that level is set at 13.7 per cent of AGSRC per student. Why 13.7 per cent, Minister? Maybe when he is responding to the bills he could give an explanation. General recurrent grants for nongovernment schools range over 46 categories, up to a maximum of 70 per cent of AGSRC. Why 70 per cent, Minister? The answer, if he is telling us honestly, will be that the levels of funding in fact are entirely arbitrary. Students and families deserve more than this. They actually deserve an explanation of how school funding will deliver good education, and they deserve to have that good education delivered. One of the critical problems with these bills is that they do not contain any reference to need in the allocation of general recurrent funding. There is an undefined reference to need in the definition of capital expenditure and in the heading for literacy, numeracy and special learning programs and for other short-term emergency assistance for nongovernment schools. But what is required is a much more central place for the principle of need in allocating Commonwealth funding to schools and systems. Labor will move a substantive amendment to include need in the definitions in section 4 of the legislation. Our definition would include two elements. Firstly, the educational needs of individual students and groups of students are varied. Achieving national standards for common goals and learning outcomes is one thing, but it is also important to recognise the personal ambitions and cultural needs of students in the teaching and learning programs that they experience. Secondly, the resources students and schools require to achieve these educational standards are also relevant. Our amendment will require assessments of need to include considerations of the resources available to schools and systems. The final overarching principle in Labor's amendment is securing the role of the federal government within a national partnership with state and territory governments for achieving national educational and resource standards for schools. This government has not even tried to develop a comprehensive national agreement on schools funding. Instead, it has adopted a sledgehammer approach with its funding conditions. Where all else fails-as we have heard so many times from this minister-blame someone else for any shortcomings. Labor's approach is to develop a genuinely national agreement where all levels of government are explicit about their responsibilities for the provision of financial assistance to government and non-government schools. By contrast, the bill requires a commitment by school authorities to curriculum development in key learning areas, physical activity in primary and secondary schools, national consistency in school starting ages and preparation for the first year of primary school. All of these are good things and we support them. However, we do not believe that it is necessary to drive such reforms through threats to funding. In fact, most state and territory ministers have already started on such reforms through the ministerial council. Many independent schools, I am advised, will have difficulty implementing some of these reforms without considerable assistance from both state and federal authorities. On staffing devolution, I do support school principals having greater responsibility for the management of their schools, including school staffing, but there are a number of practical problems. In particular, devolution of responsibility to school principals is frankly irrelevant in those schools where they cannot get teachers. We do have to make sure that we support schools and systems to develop more strategic ways of recruiting and retaining school staff in hard-tostaff areas. This often requires system-wide recruitment incentives and rewards. I know that those system-wide recruitment incentives exist in many states. I also am aware that the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, has written to the Prime Minister about this matter, and I certainly hope that, as a result of that productive correspondence, the amendments that we will move will be accepted. They will provide flexibility for school systems which would be consistent across the government and non-government sectors. Some of the more contentious aspects of the bill are those relating to reporting to ents and the broader community on student and school performance. We certainly agree strongly with the minister that reporting to parents should be in plain language, but it also has to be educationally defensible. Reports to parents, to be of value to parents, need the range of achievement in the child's class to be reported against educational standards. We will support the provision in the bill, but I would also hope that the minister would support Labor's proposed amendments in this area which seek to add some value to this provision. We also agree that parents deserve much more helpful information on their children's educational progress, so I will be moving substantive amendments that require parental involvement in the development of the content and format of reporting on students' learning. The bill also includes conditions that require information on school reporting to be specified in regulations and made publicly available. There is no question that there is a place for external reporting on school achievements, but it has to be done on the basis of one principle and one principle alone-that reporting is in the educational interests of children. This means that reporting to parents on their child's performance helps them understand what needs to be done to achieve their child's potential. It also needs to help teachers develop the best educational programs to enable students to do this. The same principle should apply to the comparative reporting on school performance. It has to help the school to improve their own performance and to do even better for their students. This can only be achieved if school reporting is comprehensive, not just on average figures against national or state benchmarks. As well as providing a range of information on students' learning and outparcomes, the report has to be clear about the context in which the school is operating and the characteristics of the students they are serving. So, once again, I will be moving substantive amendments to achieve this more comprehensive approach, including provision of information on a school's resources from all sources; its enrolment policies and practices, such as the enrolment of students with disabilities and the enrolment of Indigenous students; the qualifications of its teaching staff; the range of curriculum offerings at the school; and details of its policies and programs on student discipline and welfare, bullying and child protection. As with the reporting on individual students, Labor's amendments will require parents to be involved in the design of school reporting content and formats. This bill also makes provision for an additional $1 billion over the next four years for capital infrastructure in both government and non-government schools, in line with the government's election commitment. Leaving aside the fact that it is less than half the funding for needy schools promised by Labor, this commitment is welcome. The Howard government, I am pleased to say, is following federal Labor's lead, with a plan to deliver more capital and infrastructure funding to needy schools. During the election campaign, the government was forced to commit to providing more funding to needy schools in response to Labor's $2.34 billion needs based schools funding policy, which included more funding for government schools and a redistribution of funding within the non-government sector to needy non-government schools. The extra capital and infrastructure funds for needy schools are an important victory for federal Labor and, at last, a significant admission that the Howard government has been underfunding needy schools in both the government and non-government sectors for eight years. In this bill, the government, I am pleased to say, has excluded well-off independent schools from the new funding, although who is defined as well off and who will be excluded, I certainly do not yet know. I am looking forward to the minister explaining that. This is a clear acknowledgment that many high-fee schools already receive more government funding than they need and is a ringing endorsement of Labor's fairer schools policy. Labor's amendment on need would address this problem. But, once again, the government cannot help itself. It has decided to blame the states for the way in which they allocate capital resources for schools and to not take any responsibility itself for not increasing capital funding for the last eight years. Unfortunately, it is another example of this government's hostility to public systems. The minister has said that the additional $700 million for capital works in government schools will be provided directly to the schools, with priorities determined by each government school community organisation. The wording of the legislation in relation to this matter, however, is more realistic than the government's rhetoric. Section 69 states that capital expenditure for government schools ‘may be provided by paying the assistance to the state for the approved government school community organisation'. So the wording of the bill at least reflects the reality that payments for capital works in schools will have to be done with the agreement of the owners of the property. For government schools, that is of course the states and territories. The government is again acting inconsistently in its conditions for non-government school communities. Priorities for the additional $300 million for non-government schools will not be determined by each school's community. In non-government schools, parents will not be included, according to the government's bill. They will continue to be administered by block grant authorities for Catholic and independent schools. Labor is concerned about the inconsistencies between the government and nongovernment sectors in the way in which these capital funds will be delivered. For the life of me, I cannot understand why parents in government schools are going to have the right to be involved but parents in nongovernment schools are not. The amendment I have moved requires both a system-wide approach to the setting of priorities that are based on need and that we involve parents in overall priorities in both sectors. This will strengthen the role of parents in the program, while maintaining a strategic approach to the setting of priorities for the distribution of capital funds, based on need. The alternative would be a bureaucratic nightmare leading to the diffusion of the benefits across schools with considerably varying levels of need. The second bill we are considering today, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, contains amendments to the current act. The most significant change in this bill is the introduction of the government's tuition credit initiative. was also included in legislation that had passed the House and was about to be considered in the Senate in the week that parliament was prorogued before the election. It is intended, through this bill, to provide ‘up to' $700 for parents to purchase tutorial assistance for children if they have failed to achieve national benchmarks in year 3 reading tests. The total budget for the initiative $11 million. We did some quick calculations. There are around 269,000 students in year 3 across Australia. We know from the national report on schooling that around 90 per cent of year 3 students achieve the national benchmarks, which means that over 26,000 children would be eligible for a tuition credit. This suggests that the $11 million would be distributed to parents for the 26,000 children not at a rate of $700 per student but at an average of around $420 per student. Dr Nelson interjecting",22
16,Ms MACKLIN,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"The Minister for Education, Science and Training says that these numbers are different, so he can explain that in his response to the bill. It is not much, I would have to say-whether it is $700 or $420-for some of the neediest children in our schools. Yesterday the minister was railing about the terrible literacy standards in some of our schools, among children for whom for the whole time they have been in school this government has been in power. For the whole time children in year 3 have been in school, the member for Bradfield has been the minister for education. He did not do anything about literacy standards over the last three years. He did not put additional funding into literacy for these children. These children can hold this minister responsible for the fact that they did not get additional support when they needed it most. Of course we are going to support this additional money going into literacy, but it is far This initiative too little, too late. This government has been going on about literacy since it was elected in 1996, but the evidence is that there are still far too many children who cannot read and write. This government has known about that for a long time and has sat on its hands, finally admitting yesterday that it has done nothing about it. Unfortunately, children have had to wait is months even for this latest level of support. The government did not make this bill a priority before the election. If it had, this money could have been flowing already. We now have the unfortunate situation where we know that schools are going to be on holiday very soon. It is likely that it is going to be very difficult to get the tutoring organised before next year, and certainly it is going to be far too late for children to get the benefit of this money that was promised for this year. There are so many things that the government is going to have to get right before this money can flow: appointing brokers to identify eligible students and parents, assessing the kind and amount of tutorial assistance needed by individual students, finding appropriate tutors. We need to make sure that these tutors are assessed for a whole range of security issues, as well as for their capacity to be decent tutors. We all want to make sure that the government is spending the money wisely on those children who need it the most. We are very concerned that the government has left this so late, and we hope that it can be done properly as quickly as possible. Given that this is all so late, the government should continue to consider other approaches to the delivery of this additional literacy money, including direct funding to schools to allow for a proper study of alternative programs. We will watch the operation of this initiative very carefully, and we look forward to seeing the evaluation of the pilot next year. This legislation unfortunately squanders the chance to focus significant funding on real educational priorities. The bulk of the funding in the legislation will go towards paying teachers' salaries, and it is essential that school authorities are able to meet this obligation if all schools are to operate without disruption next year. But the funding is unfairly distributed amongst our schools, having regard both to their disparate financial needs and any proper sense of educational priorities. Labor will continue to put forward policies that focus on real need and on true educational priorities, such as support for quality teaching and for equality of access to it across this country.",28
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Bowen-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,29
18,Mr LAMING,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Bowman) (10.44 a.m.)Today, by way of the excellent Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 and what they offer to the future of Australia, I am delighted to report to the people of Bowman the first of my eight priorities coming to fruition. They include a uniform starting age-and I notice that the Beattie government has only reluctantly started thinking about a prep year with the rolling in of GST revenue-national testing in maths, science, civics and citizenship education and ICT; plain language reporting to parents; objective data on school performance; and the National Safe Schools Framework, which promotes and provides a supportive environment in which all students can feel safe, which is obviously an essential function of all schools. The framework is a great example of collaboration between jurisdictions. It is never an easy thing to achieve, but certainly I have every faith that a minister who has dealt successfully with vice-chancellors will do just as well at MCEETYA. In my first speech I spoke about the importance of a blended model of public and private provision in health and education. I commend these bills today because they deliver funding increases, and those come as a direct result of solid economic decision making by this government. It is breathtaking to hear the opposition talking about funding guarantees. It is a cruel irony that in opposition you can oppose every fiscally responsible measure as your toenails rub on the ground trying to prevent the successes of the economy in the last 8½ years and then, when it comes to election time, make extravagant promises. Of course, you have never been put under the blowtorch to assess your own economic management. You are good at obstruction and you are good at promises, and you became very good at them over 8½ years.",29
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,Order! I remind the member for Bowman that the use of the word ‘you' is out of order in this context. Comments will be addressed through the chair.,29
20,Mr LAMING,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"My apologies. The funding increases delivered by this government are a product of great economic management. By embracing all non-government schools in the SES model, we now have the Catholic school system coming on board. But, tragically, over the last two elections we have been bogged down in ideology. I would put much of that down to the opposition's fixation on rich versus poor in school funding. The great tragedy of subverting the higher issues in education is that it has become the overwhelming and abiding issue in every election campaign. The opposition has subverted informed debate. Some of the great ideas in these bills today have never been able to be adequately discussed around election time-despite, I suspect, the great desire of many Australian parents to learn more about them. This has come at a great price for Australia. Labor describes education as a national priority, yet I hear the words of the opposition spokesperson, the member for Jagajaga, and see, lined up behind her, state premiers and territory leaders-all eight of themproviding absolutely no support or backing or any evidence that as a Labor government they would do anything like what she described today. She has referred to a national schools resource standard. I know that that sends chills down the spines of many people who run schools, because there is no clear indication of what that means. Over the last two election campaigns there has been a breathtaking focus on redistribution at the expense of everything else. This an ideology that has long waned in other parts of the globe. By any meaningful international comparison, our expenditure on education is in the top nine or 10depending on whether or not you include vocational training-for expenditure on public education as a proportion of GDP. Of course, the education sector benefits directly from great economic management and strong growth. The opposition have a predilection for looking back into history, casting their minds back and trying to find where they might have had some role in the strong economic growth of the last 10 years. As they look back on the era of previous Labor governments, they often tend to forget that fiscally responsible measures were in the main part supported by us while in opposition, but we have seen a completely different approach from them while in opposition. Let me diverge slightly by making a comparison between today's debate about education funding and the opposition's position on health funding. I do that for no other reason than to indicate that by tacking to the winds of political expediency you often leave your policy platform in tatters. We know that there has been an immense ideological struggle within Labor about whether or not to support the 30 per cent private health rebate. We are agreed on the $24 Medicare rebate to every Australian and the access to the PBS. You on the other side of the chamber have now demonstrated an ability to move with the times in acquiescing with the Australian people and agreeing, with some reluctance, to the 30 per cent rebate. I am not sure how much of that agreement is due to internal Labor polling indicating that over 70 per cent of soft Labor voters would have changed their vote had the PHI rebate been removed, is but now you stand supporting that 30 per cent rebate for those who choose to leave the public health system and privately insure themselves. Let us now draw an analogy to education. Parents of all socio-economic levels are choosing to send their children to independent schools. What sort of support do they deserve? You have just agreed on 30 per cent support in health, but you struggle with 30 per cent support in education.",29
21,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,Order! The chair has not agreed to anything. Please desist from using the word ‘you'.,30
22,Mr LAMING,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"The opposition has consistently supported the 30 per cent private health rebate-though with some reluctance-yet they struggle greatly with even 15 per cent of the average funding to a state school student being provided to people who choose an independent school. That support is between 15 and 60 per cent of the average funding to a state school student, yet the position has had great difficulty in supporting that range in education. There might be some grounds for compassion for the opposition's position if private education, non-government education and private health were the preserve of the richbut that is simply not the case. In health, the top three deciles-those with above $78,000 in annual earnings-one in four do not have private health insurance. In education, half of those with incomes of over $104,000 have children attending government schools. In the bottom four deciles, of families with below $33,000 average earnings per year, one-third takes out private health insurance. More than 20 per cent of that group make a choice to send their children to non-government schools. It is that choice that is embedded in this bill today; is the choice of Australian parents that I lieve has also provided us with an election mandate to pass this bill. I suspect that at the bottom of this is the opposition's complete ideological inability to countenance any form of choice-except, of course, where electoral expediency determines otherwise. There was some criticism today by the opposition spokesperson about the average government school's recurrent costs as an adequate formula for funding increases. I certainly know of no better fundtorate ing indexation available, and I know that many areas of government would be envious of that form and level of indexation. I recall someone in this place recently saying, ‘It is not the embrace but the warmth of the embrace.' I suspect that when we had a schools forum during the election campaign the words from the Labor song sheet were, ‘So many schools would be no worse off under Labor. Those that were better off were usually the recipients of a mere $2 per week per student.' Parents are looking to state jurisdictions to opmatch the funding increases that the Commonwealth has delivered in this bill and has delivered previously. State governments have had every opportunity to do that, and yet in most cases funding barely keeps up with inflation. Education unions are fairly mute foot soldiers who simply fail to keep calling their of state governments to account on this issue. It is as if they almost know who is pulling whose strings. During the election campaign large full-page as that our side of politics could only dream of were ploughing into the seats where left-wing Labor candidates were running. These were full-page as funded by the National Union of Students for no other reason than that it was a left-wing candidate running in that seat. There was no analysis of local issues or local candidates. These fullpage as, I would assume, were funded by it the proceeds of compulsory student unionbeism, although I cannot be completely sure. I am pleased to report that, after our estimate of how much they ploughed into my seat, there is a negative correlation of election outcome of approximately one per cent swing to the coalition per $2,500 expended by the National Union of Students in Bowman. There are five key issues in this bill. It brings Catholic schools like St Luke's, St Anthony's and Carmel College in my elecback into line through benefiting from the SES formula. The school capital funding of $1.5 billion over the next quadrennium will be warmly received and enthusiastically anticipated. There has been nothing more warmly and eagerly anticipated since the last election than the $1 billion building and grounds commitments. State P&Cs are already mobilising and getting ready to place applications for this. Was that all given to the wealthy schools down south, as we commonly heard in Queensland? I note that 70 per cent of that funding goes directly to government schools. I commend that as well. That is a total of $2.5 billion in capital fundof ing. Of course, there is also the plan to grant hostel funding of $2,500 per student over four years. I welcome and support that. From 2005, as a condition of funding, schools will be required to report to parents in years 3, 5 and 7. I sometimes wonder if we are living in completely different worlds when I notice the rubber marks of reluctance left on the road by those that are against adequate reporting, clear report cards and school accountability. That reluctance still exists, although I suspect it is waning. This bill will require school reports to abide by broadly stated principles. It will ensure that parents receive timely, plain-language feedback on their child's performance. There can be nothing more concerning than receiving report cards that do not reflect how your child is going. What could be more important to a parent than knowing that their child is achieving, benefiting and extracting absolutely every opportunity from the educational experience? While we have report cards at the moment, I know that this is not the case and I suspect it is a cause of great frustration for parents in my electorate. Investment in education stacks up well internationally. Underpinning this entire debate about poor funding of the public sectorapart from the understanding that 88 per cent of state school funding is done by state governments who are completely able to increase their funding over and above inflation, should they choose-is an international comparison. In that comparison we stacked up very well on OECD measures. I think that those international measures are reassuring. They show that we are making a commitment to public education but, with the public-private blended model that this country can boast, we have the best opportunity to embed the skills and qualities in our graduates that will determine the quality life of this country, its achievements and its growth. Of course we need a uniform, nationwide education starting point. We need comparable outcomes from our school systems and recognition of and incentives for teacher quality. These are more than just platitudes. It is absolutely imperative that we have awareness of school performance through objective measures. We need safe schools committed to teaching values, justice for Indigenous Australians in teaching and, of course, a commitment to act where those schools are not performing. This bill will deliver these things. I commend the Minister for Education, Science and Training and his department. With the combination of electoral will and reform by public choice, with the disappearance of dogma that we have seen over the last 8½ years and with the influx of new ideas, I believe that eventually the opposition will come to agree that the great majority, if not every part, of this bill is right for Australia.",30
23,Mr HATTON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I know the member for Bowman has got a licence to practise, but there was also a bit of licence within his speech with regard to a considerable time spent on a health initiative. Then, luckily for all of us-you, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, as well as me and everyone else-he came back to the matters at hand.",32
24,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,I think you are reminding the member for Bowman about standing order 76.,32
25,Mr HATTON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I think I may be. We have two bills before us today; it is a cognate debate so we will deal with two elements of what the government is putting before us. At stake within these bills is $33 billion of funding to go to Australian schools. That funding, by and large-$27 billion of it-is through recurrent per capita grants to Australian schools. There is another $6 billion and that comprises special purpose programs as well as other initiatives in the capital area. The shadow minister has moved a significant set of amendments to these proposals. In doing so, she has gone to the core of the fundamental problem in this bill, and that is that the government's socio-economic status model of funding has significant difficulties. Labor have been saying that for a considerable period of time. We have argued that a needs based education system is what Australia had under Labor governments, and that is what Labor would reimpose on coming back to government. Within the very provisions of these bills is the evidence that the government's socio-economic status system simply does not work. In not just one bill but two, there are adjustments made due to the fact that you cannot fit the Catholic system into the socio-economic status system. There is an attempt in the legislation to fully integrate the Catholic system, but you have to take a series of other measures to compensate for the fact that it will not fit neatly, that is done in the prime bill, Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004. In the second bill, States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, there are changes to correct a technical defect in the SES funding phasing in arrangements for non-government schools under the general recurrent grants program so that schools will receive their correct entitlement for the 2004 program year. That technical defect is embodied in a much wider context of a much greater defect in this whole SES model. The government do not want to want to realise it; they do not want to talk about need in education. They think that this formula that they have put into place will do the job. It will do the job if you do not really want to pay the money to the people who need it most and if you want to take into account an SES model that is based on a series of assumptions that would have you believe that there are professionals in Australia who do not understate their income. When you look at the income people get-whether it is in farming, law, accountancy or otherwise-and then look at the taxable income that they get, you would have to believe that the government was right in saying this really reflects that a school is very poor. We know there are a number of private schools in Sydney that would claim that they have a number of significantly disadvantaged students, because the income base of their parents is very low. But I think the Commissioner for Taxation understands that that is a managed effect and that people across a series of industries are able to end up with a taxable income which is much lower than that of the ordinary citizen in Australia. Those people who send their children to Catholic schools or public schools, people and who work for local councils, state governments or federal governments, or people working for major companies-ordinary working people-do not have any chance to minimise their income. The real core of the SES model is that those who already do significantly well out of this government will do even better. They will be able to send their children to schools that are not only quite privileged but also have had an overabundance of support from this government over the last couple of years. They will also be able to attempt to justify that based on what is a rigged system. I reject the SES model that this funding is based on. That is why I support the needs based policy that the shadow minister has put forward. Labor's policy does go to the real needs of poor and indigent populationsthose populations that do not have the capacity to do more than work as hard as they can to provide for all of the needs of their families and to pay their schools, whether they be public schools or Catholic schools. There is not much left over in terms of savings, and if you cannot reduce your income with the taxation commissioner you do not have much margin at all. The return to those families and students from Labor's needs based system is much greater than what they will get out of the provisions in this legislation. There is a significant problem for everyone in the education system when you come to look directly at the government's model. We know that some years ago they moved to a quadrennial model-giving funding over a four-year period-rather than the previous triennial model. We also know that that is when they incorporated their overreaching assistance to schools that are extremely well off in terms of their facilities. Despite the fact that we do not agree with that, Labor have said that we will not attempt to do anything but support the passage of these bills through the House, because we will not put at risk the funding of schools Australia wide, particularly Catholic schools and other independent schools. People from very poor areas like mine, in the electorate of Blaxland, need to be assured that the funding for their schools is safe for the next four years. We will support these measures even if we disagree with the fundamental basis for them. This legislation extends, for a four-year period, what is currently an inequitable funding system. Inevitably, we cannot do anything about that except to point to its deficiencies and its impact. The first point is there are virtually no recurrent increases above indexation for government schools. The second point is that, for yet another four years, this continues increases of 200 per cent or more to some of the best-resourced independent schools in Australia. There is a lack of funding security beyond 2008 for the 60 per cent of Catholic systemic schools which have been categorised as ‘funding maintained' because they do not actually fit into this system. They fit into a needs based system, as was demonstrated throughout our period in government, but they do not slot in here. That is why Catholic schools have to do a special set of deals in an attempt to jam themselves in and make themselves fit. They have done that to avoid the funding cuts that would have been applied if they had been funded at the levels set for their socio-economic scores. That is this bill's major deficiency. We also see here that the government has put in funding that is conditional on the states and non-government authorities agreeing to Commonwealth priorities; it is mostly in regard to non-contentious issues. The first condition is that there be a nationally consistent curriculum. I have no problems with that at all. I know what work and effort we put in whilst we were in government to attempt to get nationally consistent standards for teacher training, teacher transferability and core curriculum for students Australia wide so that not only teachers but also students in an increasingly mobile Australia would be able to transfer from one state to another without being penalised. The second is that there should be a common school starting age. The third is that there should be physical education programs as a core part of those schools' activities. The last is the development of plain-language school reports. As a former teacher, I have no real problem at all with those provisions-and with that the last provision, in particular. But I do know that no matter what system, style or approach you adopt in attempting to report the achievements and goals gained by students it is a shorthand for all of the work those students have done and it is a shorthand by which you attempt to encapsulate appropriately how much they have achieved. I do not think that is entirely possible, no matter what system you provide-whether it is A to E, 1 to 5 or a series of other systems. I have seen almost all of them. They all have their deficiencies. For anyone within the education system this is no real challenge; throughout their teaching lives they struggle with these systems to provide as much information as possible. But there is a bit of background to all of this. It is a background to what this government really sees as its fundamental priorities and approach to this area. The Commonwealth does provide significant funding, particularly to the Catholic education system, small non-systemic schools and in the Anglican system and so on. But you have to go to the state governments, the Catholic education system and others to see what their fundamental responsibilities are for the education of Australian students. But this government is seeking to do it on the cheap-to get the publicity for demanding that all of these national programs be adhered to by the states and to be able to whinge and wail from one end of the parliament to the other if there are any deficiencies in that regard. We saw that with the previous minister and we see it now. The government set its standard in 1996. On coming to office, it gave instructions for the setting up of a National Commission of Audit. The National Commission of Audit reported and said that it saw no real job whatsoever for the Commonwealth apart from one particular role: the Commonwealth should benchmark performance and then audit performance. So the states and territories get to do all the real work; they get to deal with all the significant and difficult problems. They have all of those tasks before them and have to grapple with real-time issues and real people. And the federal government gets to sit up here on this hill in Canberra and crow about any difficulties that those states and territories have in implementing their programs and doing their very real job. So the money is given out and programs are put in place by which the government can create the impression that they are doing a lot and they have a significant role to play in secondary education. But the reality is that they have none. They have no responsibility apart from providing the funding and apart from providing a situation where people can attempt to build a set of national programs, a nationally consistent curriculum and national core abilities. We did that in government. It is not a bad or wrong thing to do and I think it is sensible to continue to work to it. But the government are very good at getting advertising out of what is, in fact, a very narrow range of initiatives. I will give them this on some of these initiatives: they are politically very clever. It is not the most sensible or sane way to run your funding programs, but I will give you an instance of that. This bill provides $1 billion for capital works in government and non-government schools. That is consistent with what the government promised at the election. But this funding-and this is very different from what happened previously-will be paid directly to parents' associations in public schools. It will go directly to parents' associations, because they are the ones concerned with the fund-raising drives to try to do more with their school. And what is the government doing with the Catholic system? Is it going to parents' organisations in the Catholic system? The answer is that funding for non-government schools will be paid directly to the relevant authorities. Who is that? That is the block grant group within the Catholic system. That means that capital funding will be applied more strategically. But the federal government will not trust the state governments to do that. It will not trust the school principals. For political effect, the funding will go direct to the parents' organisations. What is good for the goose is good for the gander: why not do it in the Catholic system as well or, with the Catholic system, go to the central authority? Why not pay it directly to the government school system or to state governments? One of our amendments moves to ensure that capital funding goes also to the schools with the greatest need-and, of course, the greatest need versus their socio-economic status. You can rig the socio-economic status of your school in such a way that you are significantly advantaged. This system hurts the Catholic system because its schools do not fit; they are much better off in our model. Generally we think this should be pursued. There is another instance in the associated bill that we are dealing with today, and it is another little bit of cleverness in terms of how the funding should be given in regard to the Tutorial Credit Initiative. The government here is putting in a pilot program where parents will be told if their child did not achieve the year 3 minimum national reading benchmark in 2003, and the government says such parents will get a $700 voucher to purchase additional reading assistance for their child. That is an initiative that you could gainsay and would welcome. It is a sensible thing to do in order to help those children catch up. But, from our point of view, it is politically smart to pay it direct to the parents. They are getting this direct from the Commonwealth government as part of the program. But we think there ought to be better focus, given that this is Commonwealth money being spent on those areas and schools that have the most problems with reading difficulty. Rather than being individualised, the focus should be more directly on the areas and students with greatest need. All up, the bill will increase spending on literacy and numeracy to the tune of $11 million. However, according to the shadow minister, from what she has been able to look at here, if you run that amount over the 26,000 students, the government is arithmetically challenged. If you divide $11 million by 26,000 you actually get about $420 a student, not $700. At the end of the discussion on this bill I would like to know from the minister or the parliamentary secretary what is true-is it the $420 or the $700? Is the $700 just a con job, or is it made up on the basis of discounting a number of those 26,000 people who are supposed to get it? Do you think there is an effect where one-third of the people will not take up that money? We expect a specific answer in regard to that allegation. Further, what is the situation for schools and principals with regard to that? What they say is pretty simple. They say that they would rather that the funding go directly to them than that it cut across schools' own remedial programs. They see that a more defined and sensible way to apply this program is not to individualise it to individual parents and students but to allow those areas with greatest need-as demonstrated in terms of the problems students have reading at school and elsewhere, identified in those national not tests-to put it where it is most effective: with the teachers and programs that are trying to remediate the problem in the first place. I come back to the amendments that the shadow minister put before this House. We are not going to stop this bill, blocking it here or in the other place. We know that the Catholic system in particular is entirely dependent on these funds for the next four years. But we restate our case that need should be the fundamental basis of this funding. It should not be a socio-economic system where a huge element of greed is built into it and where there is a false image of Australia based on people's taxable income rather than their real income. Our funding formula was successful in the past and will be successful in the future. To quote our amendments, we believe: ... that there is a need to restore integrity and sustainability to Commonwealth funding of schools through the adoption of comprehensive principles that include: (a) supporting high quality public schooling as a national prioritythe Catholic education system agrees with this as well; it knows that the same kinds of kids that go to Catholic schools in poor and needy circumstances go to public schools Australia wide, and it has in fact supported that initiative(b) recognising the entitlement of all children and young people to national standards of educational results and resources; (c) giving priority in funding for all Commonwealth programs for schools to meeting the educational and financial needs of schools; (d) recognition of the right of parents to choose the type of schooling for their children and to public funding for that schooling based on need; and (e) Commonwealth funding for schools to be provided as part of a national partnership with State and Territory governments so that all governments work together to deliver high quality schooling for all. (Time expired)",32
26,Mr SLIPPER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Fisher (11.19 a.m.)Government members of course reject the second reading amendment to the Schools Assistance (Learning Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 moved by the shadow minister. It is unfortunate that education has become a bit of a tug of war and has been turned into a political football by the opposition. There was an election only a couple of months ago, and the Australian people comprehensively rejected the Australian Labor Party's attempt to be divisive in relation to education funding. There has really been far too much emphasis on government versus non-government, and this government seeks to have quality education in all sectors. The opposition talks a lot about so-called high-fee, wealthy schools, but wealthy schools do not mean wealthy parents. There are many people right across the length and breadth of Australia who work in one, two or three extra jobs within a family arrangement just to be able to provide for their children the quality of education chosen by the parents. As the minister indicated in his second reading speech, this government does renew its commitment to school education for the next four years, and the funding package delivers $33 billion for schools from 2005 to 2008. As the minister pointed out, this is an increase of $9.5 billion over the current quadrennium and represents the largest ever funding commitment to Australian schools. As I spoke to people right across the electorate of Fisher in the election campaign it seemed to me that the ALP's emphasis on class divisiveness and turning back to the class warfare of the 1890s was rejected by people in the community because people, regardless of whether they choose government or non-government education for their children, do want the best for their kids. I think they resented the way in which the ALP sought to divide different groups of parents and families from one another. The opposition, and in particular the member for Jagajaga-and I suspect you Togetherwould find that she is probably in a minority, even in the opposition, if you spoke to individual opposition members one by oneseem to try to emphasise the amount of funding that the Commonwealth gives to nongovernment schools and compare it with the amount given to government schools. If I had my way, the Australian government would take over the education system. I think that there is far too much waste and far too much duplication when you have the states running state schools and the Commonwealth being responsible for a large proportion of education funding. If you take into account what the states get through the GST, I think that most state government funding of state schools-and they have not spent anywhere near as much as they should have actually comes through tax revenue collected by the Australian government. So we have a situation where the states have a lot of duplication, waste and overlap. We are, of course, a society where people are not, these days, born in one state and live their whole lives in that state and do not move across state boundaries. For employment or other reasons many families choose to move from one part of the country to another. Many of them, of course, choose to move to south-east Queensland or the Sunshine Coast-the most wonderful part of the nation in which to live-but when they do move across state boundaries they find that so often the different curricula and starting ages can disadvantage children. I am very pleased that, in this bill, as conditions for grants there have been certain elements written in, including greater national consistency in schooling, requiring implementation by 2010 of a common school starting age and implementing common testing standards, including common national tests in English, maths, science, civics and citizenship education, and information and communications technology. The bill also acknowledges the importance of better reporting to parents by ensuring that school reports are in plain guage and that assessment of a child's achievement is reported against national standards where those are available and is reported relative to a child's peer group. As a parent, I have often and seen that they have been written in politically correct language rather than in plain language. But I have to say that I have had a great deal of contempt for some state governments that tell parents that parents somehow have a vested interest in not knowing how their child is performing compared with other children in the same peer group, that parents are somehow advantaged by not being told how the school is performing compared with other schools. I just think that while this sort of data has to be used very carefully-you cannot just assume in Queensland that, because a particular school gets a large number of OP1s, it is necessarily the best school for a particular child-it is grossly arrogant for state Labor education ministers to say that parents ought not to be empowered with this information to at least be able to digest it and use it to help make a decision on schooling with respect to their children. Also amongst those conditions are transparency of school performance, so the schools publish school performance information to provide parents with objective data and information-that was a matter I just referred to-and greater autonomy to school principals so that they have a significant say over staffing issues in their own schools. I recently went to the opening by the Premier of Queensland of the Chancellor State College in my electorate. I have to say that this school will be an outstanding government school. The principal, John Lockhart, is highly motivated. The teaching body is impressive. There is great support from the parents, and I believe that Chancellor State College will be one of the best schools in lan- Queensland, regardless of whether you look at the state or federal sector. But I think it is really important-and I made this point to the state education minister when I spoke at the opening-that you give school principals looked at reports more autonomy. I believe that John Lockhart, as the principal, ought to be given the choice of selecting teachers for his school. You have a new school, you have a highly motivated teaching body and you do not want any duds amongst the teaching body who would undermine the overall performance of the school and the students. Also, of course, I believe that what should happen is that the state's education department should calculate what it costs to run a particular school, like Chancellor State College, turn the principal into the CEO, write a cheque to him for the amount it is going to cost to run that school and then allow the principal to spend that money in accordance with the priorities of the school community and school council. I believe that our society would get a lot more for the dollar if the restraints, restrictions and conditions put in place by state ministers on state schools were removed. If they were removed and you allowed the dollars to be spent in accordance with the values of individual schools then you would find that a lot more would be achieved.",37
27,Mr KERR,SECONDARY EDUCATION,A little bit of internal consistency within two minutes of a speech would be useful.,39
28,Mr SLIPPER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"The member for Denison ought not to interject, but I just want to a caveat on what I said because I do not think that arrangement would work with all schools. What you want to have is an opt-in arrangement so that, when state government schools achieve a certain standard, they are able to adopt this other funding model. This would be the way that the individual states would fund these particular schools. If you did allow good government schools to operate in this way-and I think New Zealand might have a system somewhat similarthen you would find that these schools would be able to perform in a much better way. I think it is also important to create safer schools by the implementation of the National Safe Schools Framework in all schools. A previous speaker on this bill referred to physical activity, and I think important. Also, core values such as flying the Australian flag I think are important so that children are able to be taught the values that have helped to make our society great. Returning to the issue of government funding versus non-government funding and the furphies spread around by the shadow minister in relation to Commonwealth funding of schools, if you are going to look at school funding, you ought to look at combined state and Commonwealth government funding and not just at where the Commonwealth government pays its dollars. When you look at total public funding of schools for 2003-that is, total Australian and state government funding-and you look at schools in each category with a similar number of students, it is clear that state government schools get a whole lot more funding than non-government schools. Lyneham High School here in the Australian Capital Territory, which has 917 students, gets $11.5 million in combined Australian and territory government funding; place whereas the Canberra Grammar School, with 1,492 students, only gets $3.6 million. In Tasmania, Prospect High School, with 673 students, gets $7.4 million in Australian and state government funding. Launceston Church Grammar School, with one more student-674-only gets $3.2 million. In South Australia, Craigmore High School, with 809 students, gets combined Australian and state government funding of $9.5 million. Scotch College in the same state, with 814 students, gets only $2.3 million. Shenton College, a state government school in Western Australia, with 1,200 students, gets combined Australian and state government funding of $14.4 million. Christ Church Grammar School in Western Australia, with 1,204 students-just four students more-gets a that is mere $3.7 million. Beerwah State High School, on the Sunshine Coast, with 1,002 students, gets $10.8 million. Brisbane Girls Grammar School, with 1,097 students, only gets $3.9 million. To refer to Victoria, Baldwin High School, with 1,870 students gets $19.8 million in combined Australian and state government funding. Scotch College in Victoria, with 1,823 students, gets only $3.5 million. In New South Wales, Fairvale High School, with 1,377 students, gets combined Australian and state government funding of $15.9 million. And the much pilloried The King's School at Parramatta, with 1,350 students, only gets $3.6 million. When you add together Australian and state government funding, you find that funds do in fact go through to the areas of greater need, because the government schools invariably get many times more than the independent schools. So this suggestion that the Australian government is not interested in government schools is absolutely nonsensical. When you look at the way in which the Australian government has increased funding to government schools over the last few years in percentage terms and when you look at the proposed funding for this quadrennium, you can see that the Australian government is indeed bearing its share of increasing education costs, whereas you often find that state government increases are below the rate of inflation. I return to something I said earlier: I it is unfortunate that education and education funding have become political footballs in Australia. Really what we ought to be doing is achieving the best possible outcome for Australian students. The best possible way of achieving this, in my view, would be for the states, at a COAG meeting, to say to the Commonwealth, ‘What we need to do is pass the education systems over to the Australian government.' If that were the case we would be able to cut out billions of dollars cation. There would be billions of dollars more flowing through to students at the coalface and we would be achieving even better outcomes. The two bills before the House are very important bills. They do implement the government's commitment in the election campaign. I was heartened to hear the member for Blaxland say that the opposition is not going to oppose these bills in either this place or the other place. I think that is certainly a step forward. I would hope that this will be a precedent for other items of legislation when the government seeks to implement its election policies in full and on time. The member for Blaxland in his speech also referred to the $1 billion program announced by the Prime Minister during the election campaign to improve infrastructure in government and non-government schools. I have to say that as I move around my electorate I find that the proposal for $700 million of that $1 billion to be allocated to government schools and for $300 million to be allocated to needy non-government schools will be exceptionally popular. So often the state governments have starved many schools of infrastructure, and I am personally very attracted by the principle of directly funding parents' and citizens' associations and schools and bypassing the state education departments. If we are able to spend think these dollars in these government and nongovernment schools, as will happen, we will find that there will be improved educational outcomes for children in both sectors. While the situation remains that state governments are running state schools, I would like to see the Australian government bypass the states wherever possible and directly fund individual schools and parent and teacher bodies, because you will find that if you are able to cut out some of the duplication there will be of dupli- very much improved outcomes. As I said earlier, the principal bill before the chamber, the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004, provides a record $33 billion in funding for Australian schools over the next four years-from 2005 to 2008. That is an increase of $9.5 billion over the current quadrennium. The purpose of the bill is to implement our commitment to a strong schools sector which offers highquality outcomes to all students and choice to parents by providing stability in Australian government funding for primary and secondary education in Australia for the 2005-08 quadrennium. The SES funding arrangements, a very equitable system, will be maintained and will be more deeply embedded as the basis of Australian government funding of non-government schools. I think the fact that the Catholic system will be joining the SES funding arrangements from 2005 means that all non-government schools and systems will operate under the SES model from 2005 to 2008 and hopefully beyond. The bill implements an improved performance framework and improved reporting arrangements for the funding of Australian government schools in the quadrennium in question. All education authorities receiving Australian government funding will have to commit to certain performance targets and will have to meet certain other conditions. I was pleased to see that the member for Blaxland-and I presume many opposition members-supports the thrust of these special conditions. It is important to recognise that currently schools funding is not just the responsibility of the Australian government. The Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 will deliver on the Australian government's commitment to Australian families and students. I would like to see the states agree to increase their own funding of both state and non-government schools at the same rates that the Australian government is prepared to commit to. After all, our children are our nation's future. If we are able to have improved educational outcomes and an improved national schooling system our nation will be the beneficiary in the longer term. This government has delivered. I now call on the Queensland state government and other state governments to do likewise. I call on the opposition to stop using education as a political football and to work cooperatively with the government to make sure that all parents have choice and that all students have the best possible educational opportunities, because an educated Australia is a prosperous Australia.",39
29,Mr KERR,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Denison) (11.39 a.m.)Change in large institutions in Australia is often slow. But in the course of the Howard government's tenure, very large changes have begun being made to the way that our education system operates. It is worth stepping back a little in this debate on the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 and reflecting on those things we must not lose before we consider how we wish to go forward. It is taken so much for granted that we are entitled, as citizens of this country, to have access to an affordable education system that offers everybody quality opportunities to develop their human potential. We fail to reflect on how recent this phenomenon is and on how important it is as a building block of a successful, modern society. You only have to cast your mind back three or four generations to reach a time when access to education was a rarity for those who were poor, working-class or lacking parents with resources or a commitment to education. Historically, education had been provided in a number of ways. Principally, it was provided through the church. The church produced the only people in society with the skill to write, and it ran the universities. Others gained education through the guilds-the craft societies. It was not an education which gave them the capacity to read or write or to be broad in their intellect and learning, but it gave them the capacity to undertake a trade and skill. But most were simply excluded from the education system, although every now and then a bright and outstanding young person might be picked up and given a Brideshead Revisited experience by being introduced to the opportunities that education provided. There was a wonderful example of an early Chief Justice in England who was one such boy. He was picked out of poverty, given the opportunity of an education and became Chief Justice; however, those were such rare occasions as to be almost invisible in the greater scheme of things. One of the great developments of the last 100 years is that we have emerged with a system of free, secular and universal access to education. Suddenly, the chance of life opportunities for those with talent and ability, whatever their parents' walk of life, was utterly transformed. Suddenly, it became possible to speak of people achieving to the best of their abilities. It became possible to speak of giving people life chances that gave them an opportunity to compete-but not on an equal playing field, because the starting point of your parents' wealth and means is an introduction to a circle or network of opportunities that are denied to the poor. Nonetheless, people did have the opportunity of upward social mobility and that transformed both the nature of our society and its class basis. People stopped regarding themselves simply and inevitably as members of a working class and started to see other opportunities for their personal growth and development. Economic opportunities also changed. Our society grew faster economically, because people came forward from all backgrounds and were able to take their place in a society that was producing people with high levels of educational attainment. We have continued to improve access to high levels of educational attainment, even during my lifetime. When I went to Claremont Primary School as a young boy there were still kids who left at the end of primary school. It was unusual, but it happened. Certainly, in high school many students had left by the end of the third year. Equally though, some people's lives were transformed. In passing I will remark on a couple of the teachers that I remember teaching at Claremont High School. There was David Dilger, a man who taught both English and mathematics. That was an unusual double that inspired in me the understanding that he saw beauty in both poetry and the elegance of mathematics. Mr Williams, whose first name I forget, was also a teacher of English. He had come back from the war, and he had a metal plate inserted in his head. Every now and then he had a bad turn, and he was, I suppose, mercilessly kidded by some of the tougher kids at the school. Nonetheless, he was inspiring to me because he brought me into contact with a whole range of ideas and intellectual stimulation that would never have been readily available to kids growing up in the working class suburb I grew up in. I am not suggesting that I pulled myself up by my bootstraps from some struggling economic base. My family did all they could to improve my lot in life, and they valued education. My mother had been head of medical reconstruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and she met my dad in Japan. When she came back to Australia, where dad worked with the Hydro Electric Commission, she felt that she could not go back to university-those were the days when mums just did not do those things-so she took up a profession as a primary school teacher. So I was surrounded by people who valued education, and I saw the opportunities it gave to people who did not come into the small community I grew up in, which was essentially a working-class community. I saw that I could have life opportunities through education, and I seized them. All the things that we take for granted nowadays are relatively recent. One of the things I think we should be cautious about when we have this debate about education is that we can so easily let go of the fundamentals that are important to a ‘fair go' society, the things that blend us together. One of the things that blends us together is valuing a free, secular and universal education system. That is not to diminish the right of people to choose to educate their children outside that framework, but it is to say that our society will be immeasurably damaged if most Australians make the choice to leave the free, secular and universal education system because proper resources are not put into it and because careless politicians condemn it by some of their remarks. Let me reflect on careless remarks condemning our public education system. I still believe that a quality education is available in the free, secular and universal state educawould tion system, and I do not like some of the adverse comments that are directed to people working within it. Earlier in this debate I heard some remarks about, for example, giving headmasters greater autonomy. That may be a good idea or it may not, but the underlying inference is that many of the teachers are slackers, people who are not acting in the best interests of kids. The underlying inference is that we have a system that is slowly running down and which most people are leaving, and that the teachers unions are not interested in the education of children but want to pursue some strange agenda that is actually going to damage children's educational opportunities. These kinds of comments are extremely dangerous. Firstly, broadly they are not true. I have the experience and knowledge of having children in both the private and public education systems, and I know that there are both excellent teachers and some pretty ordinary teachers in both systems. I think we need to be careful to recognise that there are some pretty ordinary people in all walks of life, but people do try very hard and, broadly, everybody teaching is doing their best to improve the opportunities for the children they are educating. Teachers, on the whole, are a pretty committed lot, whether they be in the private or public sector. Teachers unions are working from a background where the work that is undertaken by the teaching profession has in the past been too little recognised and too poorly remunerated. When we think about what value teaching adds to our society and to our opportunities as individuals when we go through those systems, we have to reflect on the fact that teaching, on the whole, is a poorly remunerated profession. People work very diligently within the teaching profession. All of us in this place have a David Dilger or a Mr Williams to remember, because it is these people who inspired us to think ahead about the opportunities we could take and make for ourselves. To condemn teachers as if, by the way they teach reading and writing, they have some kind of evil design to make kids do badlythese are some of the comments I hear-or to suggest that the teachers unions have some sort of plot that differs from what they genuinely regard as the best interests of children and teachers in the public and private education systems is really a very dangerous sidetrack. I have no large concerns about the debate about measurement, but I also want to make a couple of remarks about it. In any school, in any classroom and in any society there is a range of talents and abilities. Some people will be extraordinarily gifted, and others will lack gift entirely. The distribution forms what statisticians call a bell curve. Most people are broadly in the middle of the bell curve, but some are at each end, and that is the case with all institutions and all groups human beings. When I go to school prize givings, I award prizes to those at one end of the bell curve. The school has recognised their achievements and opportunities and I give the awards. But in giving those awards I always ask, ‘I wonder how it feels to be the kids who are actually being told that they are not succeeding?' I always say that, whoever you are, one of things that joins us together is common citizenship and value in families. All of us have things that we can contribute. We should not just celebrate success, because very few can achieve great success. Let us all try for great success, but on the bell curve you cannot have everybody at the sharp end. It just does not happen. Most of us will be in the middle. And what do we say to those others? What do we say when we get all the measurements and all the information to parents and that tells them very clearly that their children are failing? Where do these children sit in that system? We still have to find ways to value those children and to value their participation in society. No matter how we do these measurements and no matter the schooling system there will be kids who will not succeed. If we have a debate in this place or in society at large is around this false idea that if we can improve the system then everybody will do well, we are creating a rod for the backs of those who are going to struggle. I know that there are some people who say we use politically correct language or something of that kind. Perhaps we should be less kind in the remarks that parents get when their child is struggling. But equally you have to think about how you express yourself if you are not going to be politically correct. Are you going to say, ‘Your child is unintelligent; your child cannot succeed in basic skills; your child is destined for failure'? Is of that how you want the report to be? I think we have to be very careful about these things. If we condemn those in the teaching profession and suggest that the public systemthe free, secular and universal system-is not a place to go if you want your child to get the best from life's opportunities, if we do not make sure that we invest in that public system, if we do not make sure you can get an equal start at life in it and if we do not recognise that some kids in any system are going to be weak in terms of their intellectual capacity and are not going to win prizes then we will create a false debate. Not only will we create a false debate; we will actually create great damage in our society. Coming back to the thrust of this legislation against that background, the key thing to do is to make certain that we properly fund that bedrock of our society: free, secular and universal public education. Where our resources enable it we need to make certain, too, that nobody in the private sector gets a poor start in life because of the choice they make. In the past, Catholic kids got that poor start in life. Because of their faith, they went to parochial schools. Mostly, those schools were underendowed with material resources. that Those kids struggled against that background. The fact that many of them succeeded despite that is a tribute to their aspirations and to the people teaching in that sector. But over time we have recognised that we have to build up the parochial system and make sure it is properly funded. On the other hand-and let us not beat around the bush-we all know there are some schools that are extraordinarily well endowed. Generally, children from very affluent families go to these schools. I do not exclude the possibility that some children in those schools are sent by parents who sacrifice nearly everything to get them there. If we were to use the bell curve, we would say that most of those schools' populations come from very affluent families-some, at the sharp end, from extremely affluent families-and very few at the bottom end come from very poor families, because very poor families could not get them there. Some will be struggling families. They need a share of resources, too. But their call on those resources should be much less because those kids already have life opportunities and chances well beyond those of kids who start life in the free, public, secular education tem. So I defend the approach the Australian Labor Party has taken. I do not defend it on the basis of anything like the asserted class envy. I defend what is an extraordinarily potent invention of Western civilisation: free, secular and universal education and its ultimate priority as the building block of our opportunity as a nation to cohere. I also want to say that arguments about redistribution in this area are misconceived. There has been a redistribution. It has been a redistribution from that free, secular and universal system towards the wealthier private schools. Calling a halt to that and rebalancing is the case that I make. I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this matter. I do not want to see the worth and value of teachers diminish. I do not want to see those kids, wherever they start their life and whatever schooling system they are part of, treated as failures because they do not reach benchmark standards. I hope that this debate can get back to a centre about the philosophy of our educational system and away from some of the narrowness of what has on the government's side constituted the so-called debate about education in Australia in the recent past.

30,Mr BALDWIN,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Paterson) (11.59 a.m.)I rise today to speak on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004. This is the year 2004. It is December 2004. Only yesterday, at 42.1 degrees, it was the hottest day ever in November in the Hunter Valley since records have been kept. Today it is forecast to hit 41 degrees in the Hunter. It is the year 2004 and there are schools in my electorate that have no air conditioning. Only last week, Grahamstown Public School P&C was agitating in the media for air conditioning. The teachers felt so strongly about the sysissue that they held a stop-work meeting to protest the lack of action by government. Today on page 3 of the Newcastle Herald, in an article by Matthew Kelly, ‘Pupils feel the heat of classroom politics', it says: The parents of 79 students at Grahamstown Public School kept their children away from school or picked them up because of yesterday's heatwave. Principal Kevin Colman said he was monitoring the heat levels in the school's non-air conditioned classrooms to ensure staff and student safety. “I've said to any parents who have rung up because they are concerned about the heat that it's up to them … to come and collect their children …” It is ridiculous that at Grahamstown Public School, a school built 10 years ago with noise amelioration measures to protect the children from the high noise levels, we have a situation where the design and the insulation were put into place, yet no air conditioning was installed. This shows a lack of wisdom by the New South Wales Labor government in their design and planning. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table an extract from page 3 of the Newcastle Herald. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Wilkie)-In keeping with Speaker Hawker's ruling, items publicly available cannot be tabled in the House.",45
31,Mr BALDWIN,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Therefore I will continue to quote it. Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I refer you to standing order 63, which reads: The House or Main Committee may grant leave to a Member to act in a manner, not expressly provided for in, or contrary to, orders of the House. I will take this matter up later with the Speaker, but it is my view that, in ruling that these newspaper articles cannot be tabled, the Speaker has circumvented the ability of the House to be master of its own destiny. No members on this side of the House are objecting to the request from the member for Paterson that leave be granted; therefore, the House by definition, as master of its own destiny, has determined that leave be granted and the newspaper article tabled. I do not ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to reconsider your ruling, because you are of course acting on the Speaker's ruling, but it is a matter I will take up with him at a later hour.",46
32,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"There is no point of order. In keeping with Speaker Hawker's ruling, the document cannot be tabled.",46
33,Mr BALDWIN,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I respect the Speaker's ruling. However, it does not get away from the point that these children are expected to sit in insulated heat blocks. It is unfair to the children. The school is soundproofed against overhead noise from commercial aircraft and RAAF activities, but when it gets hot they cannot shut the doors. In winter when the gas heaters are on, they cannot shut the doors because of the fumes from the heaters. When the Grahamstown P&C came to see me earlier this year, it was because they were (Mr tired of the New South Wales government ignoring their pleas to put air conditioning into the school. They came to their federal MP because their state member, John Bartlett, had ignored them. John Bartlett has form on this; he ignored them just as he ignored the pleas from the Tilligerry crime forum. Because Grahamstown Public School was affected by RAAF planes, the P&C knew they had a strong argument for their case. But what of the schools in my electorate which are not affected by aircraft noise? What of Dungog Public School, which gets just slightly hotter than Grahamstown? On the front page of the Maitland Mercury today, an article by Emma Swain entitled ‘Taken out of school-Debate heats up on lack of class cooling' says: With his sweaty hair stuck to his clammy forehead little Jamie Standing was just one of the many Maitland school children taken out of school yesterday to escape the unbearable heat in the city's sweltering classrooms. Jamie's mother, Jodie, collected her sevenyear-old son from Woodberry Public School early yesterday when she became worried about her son sitting in a non air-conditioned room. “I just couldn't stand the thought of him sitting in a hot classroom when he could be much cooler at home,” Ms Standing said. “I mean how can a little boy concentrate in this heat. I definitely won't be sending Jamie to school tomorrow if it's this hot.” Woodberry Public School made headlines last year when members of the school's P&C committee threatened to remove their children from the school if air-conditioners were not installed in each of the classrooms. It goes on. Just adjoining, we have Francis Greenway High School at Woodberry, where we expect students to study in sweltering conditions. Dungog has no aircraft noise; therefore, the school has no hope of getting any air conditioning. It is the same for another rural school in Gloucester. The Hunter gets incredibly hot in summer and cold in winter. Reverse cycle air conditioning is not a luxury; it should be standard in 2004. But the frustrations of P&Cs and P&Fs are not restricted to air conditioning. Irrawang Public School in Raymond Terrace has been asking the New South Wales Department of Education and Training for a school hall for 15 years. The number of students in the school is small at 396, and there is some ambit quantity of pupils that a school needs in order to get a school hall which it just short of. As the surrounding area has grown, so too has the number of schools. Rather than expanding Irrawang Public School, the department of education has built new schools and has kept Irrawang small-too small for a school hall. The P&C came to me in desperation when again the state member for Port Stephens, John Bartlett, ignored their frustrated pleas. Both Grahamstown Public School, with 399 students, and Irrawang Public School, with 396 students, are desperate for funds to get basic amenities like libraries and computers. Much of this has to do with the New South Wales Labor government of the day, because it does nothing to improve the lot of students in public schools. The local MP for the Raymond Terrace township is not inclined to lift a finger to help these students. He toes the department of education's line. Airconditioning in public schools is being phased in over a number of years. You have to have 400 students to qualify for a school hall. You cannot have new computers. You cannot have a new library. P&C and P&F associations around Paterson and New South Wales are making hundreds of thousands of lamingtons to raise money for fences for sports fields, air conditioning for classrooms and books for libraries-or a covered outdoor learning area, which for some schools is the only form of covered assembly area they have, an area that allows children outside when it is raining or protects them from the rays beating down from the sun. These are all what I consider to be basics for quality education. The schools assistance bill commits $33 billion in funding for Australian schools over the next four years. This includes $27.9 billion in general recurrent grant assistance to government and non-government schools; $1.5 billion in capital grants to assist with the provision of school facilities, falls including $17 million in capital funding to non-government schools in isolated communities in the Northern Territory; $2.1 billion for literacy, numeracy and special learning needs programs which assist the most disadvantaged students, including those with disabilities; $117 million for country areas programs to assist with geographically isolated children; $245.8 million under English as a second language for new arrivals to the Australian education system; and $114.2 million for the languages program to improve outcomes of students learning languages other than English. It also includes $700 million for government schools and $300 million for nongovernment schools which they can apply for directly from the Australian government. Grahamstown Public School does not have to fit in with the timetable of the New South Wales education department. Irrawang does not have to have a set number of students. P&C and P&F associations can set the priorities for their own areas and their own children's learning needs and build the schools that they want. After all, what does a state education bureaucrat sitting in an air conditioned office in Sydney know about Grahamstown school and the 55 other schools in my electorate that a parent who has been working on a school committee for five years does not know? This $700 million fund for public schools is a significant fund not just in terms of the resources that P&C associations can get for their kids' schools but in terms of what it says to the states. I am no prophet, but lieve that in five years time Australian state schools, or public schools, will be better for this direct funding. No-one knows what is better for their local schools than the parents and teachers who live and work in those local areas. I am a strong advocate of removing states out of any funding to communities, because of the waste element from bureaucracies. P&C associations work for free and they have a vested interest in building a good school for their children, so they care more than the bureaucrats in Sydney. This means that the entire $700 million will be spent on our schools and on our children in those schools. I have a few independent schools in my electorate of Paterson, and they have been built by the communities to provide education in line with their philosophy. Medowie Christian School fills a niche of providing education for local students with a strong Christian philosophy. This school is currently fundraising to build a high school. Again, the state government in New South Wales has ignored the plight of the parents in Medowie by refusing to build a high school there, but there is an opportunity there and the Christian school is picking it up and opening up to all members of the community, not just those who want a Christian education. There are nine non-government schools in Paterson: St Phillips Christian College, Medowie Christian School and some seven Catholic schools, with a school for the hearing impaired run by the Catholic Church. But not one of them could be compared with the King's School at Parramatta in terms of resources or wealth. Not one of them charges fees in line with those charged by city GPSs. These are the schools of the community. The average government school recurrent cost method of indexation is popular with the states and territories because it is a generous I be- formula which allows for an increase in funding of six per cent per annum. What this means in dollar terms is a $2.9 billion increase over the next four years of public school funding, or a total of $ 10.8 billion. This is big money in any person's terms, so what does it mean for the schools in my electorate of Paterson? Apart from the recurrent grant funding, there is money for capital works, for special needs kids, for literacy and numeracy, for students with disabilities and for improving language studies. The other components, for non-English-speaking children and for isolated students, are perhaps not as in demand as in other electorates, but there is a huge need in my electorate for capital works funding. This year we provided $88 million to the New South Wales Labor government and, as I said, both Medowie and Thornton need a high school-and the list goes on. Every school around Maitland, Dungog, Raymond Terrace, Woodberry and Gloucester could use air conditioning, and there will now be money to put that in more quickly. Less in need of air conditioning but just as in need of funding for shade cover, libraries or computers are schools in Pacific Palms, Bulahdelah, Stroud, Forster and Tuncurry, all coastal towns. All kids with disabilities or learning difficulties need extra resources to help them learn and to make sure they get a good start in life. And let us face it: Australia is an island. It is not like Europe, where you can skip across the border and learn German from the Germans. When kids in Australia learn a second language, they are behind the eight ball in fluency. There are seven Catholic schools in my electorate. I say this because there is a new feature of the education funding package which includes $12.8 billion over four years for the Catholic system schools. This is an increase of 41 per cent, or $3.7 billion, over the period. There is an additional $368 million as a consequence of the Catholic schools joining the SES ranking system. This is significant because it further brings into line a standard of education right across Australia. There are still major issues involved in standardising Australian education, which the Minister for Education, Science and Training has recognised as being problematic for the children of parents who move interstate. I have some 3,500 personnel on the RAAF Base at Williamtown in my electorate, and those with children who have relocated from state to state or territory have first-hand knowledge of what moving interstate can do to their child's education. Depending on where they move from and to, they can be a year behind or a year ahead. They may be more advanced in some subjects but not ready for others, and they may even have a different handwriting style. SES ranking and asking independent schools to meet criteria is the beginning of streamlining the differences between the states. There is nothing wrong with insisting on certain outcomes from independent schools receiving funding from the Commonwealth. School is not 12 years of babysitting, with an illiterate teenager at the end. Taxpayers and parents alike expect kids to be able to read and write and go on to jobs, universities and TAFEs when they leave school. That is why I am particularly pleased to see $2.1 billion the literacy, numeracy and, in particular, cial learning needs programs. Of that, $1.3 billion will go to government schools and $783 million to non-government schools. This is an increase of 28 per cent, $444.8 million, over the last funding agreement. I understand the education minister's goal is to have an almost perfect score in terms of Australia's performance in literacy and numeracy. There are two reasons why our kids have to be able to read, write and spell: so that kids can get a job and so that employers do not have to spend time and money on basics training. There are virtually no office jobs without computers any more, and a national standard in information technology is imperative. There are three elements to this literacy and numeracy program: school grants which will help schools increase their ability to help students with learning difficulties or disabilities; non-government centres which will provide support to children with disabilities; and National Projects, which was known as the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies Projects Program, which will support national initiatives and research to improve learning outcomes for educationally disadvantaged children. Australia's birth rate is low and our population is ageing. Baby boomers will be leaving the work force en masse soon, and we will need every Australian to be job ready and job steady. Australia will not be a productive country if we allow mediocre education standards to continue. That is why I am supportive of the performance standards which have been developed to tie in with this package. Employer groups have indicated that it is no longer good enough to be merely adequate. They want workers who can meet certain standards. Linking funding grants to standards-making the states accountable and expecting them to meet certain stanfor dards-is something I support on behalf of spethe employers and parents in my electorate. If a worker cannot be trained to operate a till because they cannot count, a baker cannot employ that worker. If an office worker canor not spell, they cannot take a phone message. If a person does not know the alphabet, they cannot file accurately. As I mentioned earlier, the legislation will also assist in providing national consistency. To start with we need a uniform starting age, and the education minister is keen to see this in place by 2010. As a condition of funding, schools will be expected to report on the performance of students in years 3, 5 and 7 against national literacy and numeracy benchmarks. The benefits for parents are twofold: firstly, parents will know if their children are measuring up to other children around the country and, secondly, for the RAAF families of the future, transferring from Tindal to Williamtown to Amberley will be seamless. Children will not be behind in maths but ahead in English or vice versa. There will not be patches in this country where you do not get a good education. Anyone who believes in equality and the right to a good education system should support national standards. Any school or governing authority which does not meet the standards should be held to account. I know the Teachers Federation will not like the idea of performance standards for its members, but, until we make teaching a profession of excellence, our kids will continue to fall through literacy and numeracy cracks. This bill also gives principals and their governing bodies a greater autonomy over their schools' education programs, including staffing, budgets and other operations. Education authorities must also make a commitment to put into effect the National Safe Schools Framework to provide at least two hours of physical activity each week of school. At this point I want to make it very clear that the issue is not whether a child goes to government or non-government school, whether a government or non-government school has a greater right to funding or whether schools are unionised or not unionised; it is all about the child. It is about providing the best opportunities we can to each child for better educational outcomes. Parents choosing to sacrifice, work extra jobs or forgo home ownership to pay for their child to go to a school of their choice is not the issue either. It is about better standards of education, better resources, better outcomes and, for kids of the future, a fairer chance in their future. I commend this bill to the House.",46
34,Dr EMERSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Rankin) (12.18 p.m.)The Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 provide specific purpose payments for government and non-government schools over the four-year period from 2005 to 2008. The bills may well be the most important that this parliament considers. I say that for two reasons. The first is that these bills constitute the present federal government's commitment to the life chances of a generation of young people. The second is that not only is this legislation potentially the key to unlocking the potential of young people but it is the key to Australia's future prosperity. The question for the parliament is: will this key work? The answer is: no, not in its present form. It could work, but it would require substantial modification. The bills move all non-government schools into a model based on the socio-economic status of students. In principle, basing funding allocations to students on their needs is very good; needs based funding should get a big tick. But in practice this particular legislation and a the SES formula on which it is based departs from needs based funding by giving huge funding increases to the wealthiest nongovernment schools. The SES formula conceptually tries to approximate the capacity of a school's community to pay. It is based on the census collection districts of the students who attend ticular schools. It is not based on the needs of individual students. As I said, it is based on a school community's capacity to pay, and the upshot of that is that, if a student from a wealthy family residing in a census collection district that overall is very low income, that student will be entered into the formula as a very needy student. For example, if a student comes from a large and fairly wealthy farm in an outback area surrounded by very poor people then that student will show up as a poor student whereas in fact the student is wealthy. The consequence of this is that, based on the SES formula, nongovernment schools that have large boarding populations will under the SES formula appear to be very needy schools when in fact they are very wealthy. A second fault with the SES formula is that schools that locate in less wealthy areas but are affluent will also benefit from the SES formula even though they are not needy. As a consequence of these and other flaws in the SES formula, it does not reflect the needs of individual students or of individual schools. So, while the SES formula conceptually seeks to pick up and reflect the needs of students and school communities, in practice it does not. That is why we have witnessed huge funding increases going to some of the wealthy schools in this country under the legislation covering the previous four years. By moving all non-government schools into the SES model many schools would in fact be worse off. The government has responded to that in two ways. Some schools are what is called ‘funding maintained'-that is, they retain their funding allocations with indexation, so that those allocations are indexed and therefore rise over time. Other schools are ‘funding guaranteed'-that is, they retain their pre-existing allocations but without increases, without indexation. So par- when the government says it is applying an SES model, in truth that is not really the case because, as flawed as it is, the SES model applies only to half of the non-government is schools covered by this legislation. In the previous four years Catholic schools received block funding grants, but this legislation is moving them into the SES system. As a result they will receive an extra $362 million above indexation. I personally welcome that. The effect of all of these adjustments to the SES model is that two-thirds of the $31 billion being allocated in this legislation will go to non-government schools. This has obviously been the trend under the Howard government. In 1996, 55 per cent of school funding from the Commonwealth went to non-government schools. That will now rise to almost 70 per cent in 2008. The Howard government justifies this as supplementary school funding assistance from the Commonwealth. The government's view is that the states have responsibility for government schools and it says that that is reflected in the Constitution. It is also a fact that since the year 2000 the Howard government has been saying repeatedly that the growth tax, the GST, means that the states can pick up more and more of these sorts of responsibilities. Some of us on the Labor side of the argument predicted in the year 2000, when the GST was introduced and a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Commonwealth and the states, that to protect the value of specific purpose payments to the states the government would find ways to erode the value of those payments over time. Indeed it has. There are two mechanisms for doing that: the first is to maintain specific purpose payments in nominal terms and allow inflation to eat away at them, and the second is to maintain specific purpose payments in nominal terms and allow population growth to diminish their value per person. The Howard government has applied this practice across the board and has, therefore, effectively reneged on the memorandum of understanding that it signed with the states guaranteeing that specific purpose payments would be retained in full. There is no constitutional impediment to the Commonwealth funding government schools. There is nothing in the Constitution that says the Commonwealth must not fund government schools. We know that through this legislation, because one-third of the funding does go to government schools. It is nothing to do with the Constitution. The fact that so much of the funding goes to nongovernment schools is a reflection of the government's preference for funding nongovernment schools over government schools-an ideological preference as expressed in this legislation. The school funding bills provide supplementary funding to improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged school students. I welcome that. I am not saying that every detail of this funding for disadvantaged students is as Labor would want it, but it is good to see that the Commonwealth is recognising its obligations to disadvantaged students. The new literacy, numeracy and special learning needs programs are targeted at early intervention, and at literacy and numeracy in particular. They are also targeted at children with disabilities and at teacher professional development. The third major component of the funding provided in this legislation is capital funding-initially $1.5 billion over the four-year period. Government schools will receive $1.1 billion of that funding, and $438 million will go to non-government schools. Added to that is the government's election commitment to provide an extra $1 billion to schools for mainly minor capital works programspresumably things such as shade cloths and other minor matters. Of that $1 billion, $700 million will go to government schools and $300 million will go to non-government schools. The trick here is that the Howard government has sought to bypass the states and have that money go direct to local school communities, most commonly through P&Cs. You would think that there would be some sort of role for the states in approving these sorts of capital works, given that the school grounds are, in fact, owned by the state, but the Howard government is thinking that, because they are Labor states, the way to go is to bypass them. This is a very churlish way of operating, and it could potentially put a huge burden on local P&Cs who may, in individual cases, be handling budgets of several hundred thousand dollars worth of capital works because of the government's obsession with bypassing the states. There are a number of new conditions for the funding that will flow from this legislation. Some of those are very good and I would welcome them. One is greater national consistency in approach towards school education and better reporting to parents is another. I support that. There is, in addition, a transparency of school performance. In my view that is good conceptually, but there are genuine problems with ‘league tables'. The Howard government is embracing the idea of ranking schools according to a league table to expose schools that produce lower educational outcomes. As I will explain in a moment, there are inbuilt reasons in this legislation why some schools will produce lower educational outcomes through no fault of their own. Yet the Howard government wants to proceed with league tables to seek to embarrass schools that it itself is disadvantaging through these funding formulas. I think there are huge problems with the production of league tables. The concept of greater autonomy for school principals is, in principle, not a bad one. Another condition for funding is creating safer schools, and I do not think too many people would think that was a bad idea-I certainly do not-and another is a common commitment to physical activity. Given the problems of obesity in this country, I certainly welcome that. But there is another condition for funding, and that condition is that values are made a core part of schooling. That sounds very fine, and I am all for values, but you have to ask: whose values? That is a very pertinent question, because we got the answer to that from an exchange that was initiated by the Prime Minister in January 2004, and his faithful sidekick, the Minister for Health and Ageing, followed up the next day. The Prime Minister said that the problem with government schools is that they do not have a commitment to values. His faithful sidekick, the minister for health, said on the AM program on 21 January 2004: Well, it's interesting that whenever issues like this come up, the only value that politically rect educators can come up with is that they supported tolerance … The interviewer asked: That's a pretty good value, isn't it? And the minister for health-not the minister for education-said: It is a good value, but sometimes I think that in modern Australia we end up tolerating the intolerable. So we have the Howard government, through the minister for health, weighing into the debate on values in schools, and saying that the problem with government schools is that they have a set of values that tolerate the intolerable. I for one, and I think all of us on the Labor side of politics, think tolerance is a good value and it should not be limited to the point of saying that we should not have any more than a particular level of tolerance. How are we going to thrive as a cohesive nation if we follow the mantra of the Prime Minister and his faithful sidekick, the minister for health, saying ‘We don't want to be too tolerant'. This country was built on tolerance, but here we have the Liberal Party and the Howard government saying there is too much tolerance in Australia. Shame on them. The problem is that they have expressed those views and have now incorporated those views into this legislation. I find that totally unacceptable. I say that it is time we moved away from this obsessive demarcation between government and non-government schools. We have the Howard government saying nongovernment schools are good and government schools are bad. I think we should be concentrating on the children. I know this is a radical idea, but why don't we concentrate on the needs of the child instead of engaging in these obsessive debates about whether government schools are better than nongovernment schools and vice versa? Why do cor- we have the situation of one party championreally ing non-government schools over government schools? The problem with this legislation, and with the legislation that preceded it, is that Commonwealth school funding is unbalanced. It expresses the government's ideological preference for non-government schools over government schools. The funding must be based on the needs of the child instead of some ideological obsession about government schools being inferior to nongovernment schools. In my view, the Commonwealth and the states should develop a joint funding model based on the needs of each child, and this is what Labor has sought to do. The fact is: the child must come first. I said at the outset that this legislation is important because it could be the key to unlocking the potential of children. Unfortunately, that key is a very flawed one and needs a lot more work. There has been a drift, though not an exodus, in enrolments from government to non-government schools. In 1984, 75 per cent of enrolments were in government schools. That has fallen to 68 per cent in 2003. That does not, of itself, perturb me, and I do not think it should really worry anyone who believes that the child comes first. But it has had adverse consequences for students in government schools, because students of low socio-economic status are now more concentrated in government schools. The figures are as follows: 58 per cent of government school students come from the bottom half of the income distribution, whereas only 40 per cent of Catholic school students come from the bottom half of the income distribution and just 21 per cent of independent schools come from the bottom half of the income distribution. This exit from government schools to non-government schools, which the Howard government has promoted through its funding policies, has left a larger concentration of young students from low socio-economic backgrounds in the government system. In fact the difference in the performance of government and non-government schools is mainly explained by the student populations-that is, the concentration of low socio-economic status students in government schools. The Allen Consulting Group, in a report entitled Governments working together: a better future, said this: After the student populations the schools serve are taken into account, there remain some differences in the spread of performance across sectors, but the analysis shows that the overall performance of the three sectors is similar and that government schools are performing very well compared with private schools. Hear, hear! That is what an objective analysis shows. We need to support students of low socio-economic backgrounds. In the central part of my electorate, Logan Central, there are many such students and they can be supported through early intervention programs and early childhood development. In Australia, only 40 per cent of four-year-olds attend preschool. One of the crucial indicators of the performance of a very young student is whether they have arrived at school ready to learn, and preschool education certainly helps. But, as a share of GDP, Australia's spending on pre-primary education is the lowest in the OECD. I am a fan-as is Labor-of early intervention programs. I draw to the attention of the parliament a report entitled Policies to Foster Human Capital that was prepared by James Heckman for the National Bureau of Economic Research. I will cover the main points in that report. It says: The conventional wisdom espoused by most politicians, educated laypersons and even many academics places formal educational institutions in a central role as the main producers of the skills required by the modern economy. However, it neglects the crucial roles of families and firms in fostering skill and the variety of abilities required to succeed in the modern economy. It goes on to say that much learning takes place outside of schools and: Learning starts in infancy, long before formal education begins, and continues throughout life. And so on. All of this is a very strong argument for early intervention programs. That is what we need-a national coordinated effort to improve the educational performance of disadvantaged students. That would be not only an investment in those students and an improvement in their lifetime prospects but also a very wise investment in terms of conmany centrating our resources to combat the ageing of the population. Lifting the lifetime participation of those students in the work force would be a very effective remedy to the ageing of the population. My plea to the Howard government is to work collaboratively with the states on improving these early intervention programs. (Time expired)",50
35,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I rise this afternoon to speak in favour of the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. It is not difficult for me to support these bills. The Australian government, through them, will provide a record $33 billion in funding for Australian schools over the next four years, 2005-2008. This is an increase of $9½ billion over the current quadrennium and is the largest ever commitment by an Australian government to schooling in Australia. The purpose of the schools assistance bill is to implement the government's commitment to a strong schools sector which does offer high-quality outcomes to all studentsboth in government and non-government schools-and choice to parents. Not only do we in this government believe in public education, in education being provided by the community through independent and Catholic schools, but also we believe in choice. The most appropriate people to make that choice are those who love the children the most. They are not the politicians, they are not the principals; they are the children's parents and their families. This government's initiatives will also provide stability in Australian government funding for primary and secondary education in Australia for this quadrennium. Importantly, the SES funding arrangements will be maintained and, in fact, will be more deeply embedded as the basis for Australian government funding for the non-government schools in Australia. I will come to this point later in my contribution and when I do it will be to, I hope, rebut many of the, I would argue, deceptive statements that have been made in the Australian community by the Australian Education Union-the union of which I was once a member-and Labor state governments. The bill will also implement and enhance performance framework and reporting arrangements for Australian government schools in this quadrennium. The bill also provides for a new overarching targeted program, as we have heard already today: the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs program. This will be targeted at the most disadvantaged students, including those with disabilities. Of course, the bill also provides for the continuation of existing successful programs. I think it is very important for us all to really appreciate-because I do not think that everybody in this place does-that school funding is a joint responsibility between the states, the territories and the Australian government. It was just said by the previous speaker that there is no constitutional impediment to the Commonwealth funding state schools. That is true; that is not something I would disagree with. However, it is clear that there is a constitutional responsibility for state governments to fund their own schools. These governments exist for that purpose. These governments exist for a range of important public goods and public services not the least of which is our education system. That being said, there is no reason for the Australian government not to fund them-and we do. We fund them very substantially by specific purpose payments being made to the states and by general funding, including GST. This government-referring again to the previous contribution we heard-is not a selective champion of one sector of education in this country. This government is a champion of all schools, as is our responsibility. I speak today as a new member of liament representing my community of northern Tasmania and from my professional background. I was educated and trained as a teacher. In 1996 I took my first teaching pointment. I was aware of opportunities in a range of different areas but chose to teach the state education system as a public schoolThose teacher. I was very proud to do that. That was not a very hard decision for me. My first year of teaching was at Exeter High School on the West Tamar. Subsequently I was appointed to a permanent position and worked for five years at Kings Meadows high school. In my final year of teaching I was the head of my mathematics department, which I will always remember very fondly. I enjoyed teaching there. Working with young people is a wonderful job. Being able to input into young people's lives, being a positive role model and doing your best to help and encourage young people and to equip them to fulfil their potential. As I said in my first speech two weeks ago, no job is more important than being able to input into young people's lives, being a positive role model and doing your best to help and encourage young people and to equip them to fulfil their potential. I stand today personally, and as a member of a government, committed to public education and community provided education such as in independent and Catholic schools. But I also believe in choice. I was educated at a non-government school myself, so people may say-wrongly-that somehow I was raised in a wealthy family, was given extra special privileges or went to an elite school. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth for by far the larger proportion of students who do not receive their education at government schools. The fact is that in so many cases parents send their children to nongovernment schools because they have made par- a choice. They have made a personal decision as a family to have their children educated at non-government or Catholic schools. That is their right, but many families do so at ap- great personal expense. They may go without luxuries or material items in order to allow in them to send their children to those schools. people should be held up as heroes. Not everybody will make a decision to send their children to a non-government school, but we ought to respect the decision of those who do and, as taxpayers, contribute towards the expense they have made a decision to bear. I am pleased with this bill, because under it Australian government funding provides a record $33 billion. There is $27.9 billion in general recurrent grant assistance to both government and non-government schools; $1½ billion in capital grants to assist with the provision of school facilities-which is a continuation of this government's excellent track record in assisting capital developments in schools around the country; $2.1 billion for the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs program; and money for a range of other initiatives, not the least of which are our election commitments made in the last few months. I am just delighted with the government's new capital infrastructure fund, with $1 billion to be provided for capital infrastructure funding for both government and non-government schools over this quadrennium. This funding is in addition to the $1½ billion which has already been provided for. As we have heard, this additional funding will be split and quarantined for the different sectors: $700 million for government schools and $300 million for nongovernment schools. Much more can be said about these things. However, I draw the attention of the House to some facts which have been missed in so many quarters of the national debate. I believe all members would be aware of the campaign which has been run, I think quite successfully, by the Australian Education Union for the last two years. It ran a campaign which quite clearly misled people in its portrayal of school funding. If it ever wanted to work for the interests of families and children, irrespective of the school that they choose, it failed. The material that was provided by the union, with the obvious support of state governments-I am aware of the Tasmanian state government being very supportive of the AEU campaign-has masqueraded the truth. The AEU reportedly set aside $1 million of teachers' hard-earned money to run this campaign. It was a political campaign deliberately designed to ramp up in an election year. Everybody here knows that the Australian Education Union is not beholden to any party other than the Labor Party. It certainly does not feel as though it should support the coalition and its excellent initiatives. regards the fact that this government has, as I have already said, made record provision of funding for schools around Australia. We have seen as on television where the union has shown pictures of what it describes as elite schools around Australia. I think the best example of this is the ad which ran during the election campaign. The television screen was split. On the left-hand side we saw a picture of a school with a Gothic looking cathedral as the centrepiece and a dollar value at the bottom of $3,030,128. On the right-hand side of the screen we saw a suburban government school with a dollar amount at the bottom of, presumably, federal public moneys of $1,491,720. It would seem there was quite a difference due to this nasty federal government, as the ad was portraying the Howard government. These as did mislead Australian taxpayers, especially as they were trying to inform themselves as they prepared for the election, because the as tapped into a sentiment in Australia that people want to see adequate provision made for their schools-especially the schools where they send their own children. An honest appraisal of the public funding of schools must include the Australian government's contribution and the state and territory contributions, so if this ad had been run honestly it would have looked rather different. If there had been an honest portrayal of the facts, the Australian Education Union would actually have said this: 2.25 million students-or 68 per cent of all school students-attend state schools, and that 68 per cent receives 76 per cent of the taxpayer funds which go to schools; 32 per cent of Australia's schoolchildren attend independent and Catholic schools, and that 32 per cent receives the remaining 24 per cent of taxpayers' funds. As I have said, under the Australian Constitution state schools are the responsibility of the state and territory govIt disernments. They own, run, manage and, appropriately, have the major financial responsibility for the schools. There are two schools in my electorate which I will provide a comparison of by way of an example. Launceston grammar school, which has 674 students, received total public funding from the Australian and Tasmanian governments of $3.2 million. Prospect High School, also in my electorate, received an enormous direct capital funding boost recently that allowed it to open up some new buildings and renovate them. It has 673 students-virtually the same population as Launceston grammar school. Total public funding of Prospect High School is $7.4 million, which is over double what Launceston grammar school receives. I am not trying to suggest that the independent school should somehow receive the same amount of taxpayer support, but it ought to receive a contribution from the government. There is a very important argument that I would like to raise today, and that is in relashare tion to what the state governments have said and done with regard to their own schools. In the May 2004 federal budget, as they did in the 2003 budget, the Tasmanian state government complained very bitterly about the level of financial contribution to government schools in Tasmania. They criticised the Australian government for only providing a 5.6 per cent increase in its 2003 budget. Times are good in Tasmania and the state budget is doing very well. Recently, the Mercury reported that the current financial year budget surplus is looking something like $360 million, which is quite a lot more than the predicted $7 million budget surplus. And yet, in 2003-which was also looking like a good year at the time-the Tasmanian state government, in contrast to the Australian government's 5.6 per cent increase, increased its funding to government schools by just 2.9 per cent. Had the Tasmanian government and the minister, Paula Wriedt, managed in cabinet to increase the Tasmanian government's contribution to education by just the same percentage as the Australian government's contribution, that would have meant for us in Tasmania an increase in the education budget of $14 million. I am a schoolteacher, not an engineer or an architect, but I suspect that $14 million would be enough to build one or maybe two new schools-it would certainly be enough to employ another couple of hundred teachers-and some good things could be done. My Tasmanian Liberal colleague, Peter Gutwein, the state member for Bass and the Tasmanian shadow education minister, has been and had been campaigning for smaller class sizes for some time. In the Mercury, he was quoted as saying: In recent Budgets, Ms Wriedt had been rolled by her Cabinet colleagues and had achieved a very poor deal for education with education's of the consolidated fund dipping sharply from 27.2 to 26 per cent. That is very disappointing to me. It shows that the Tasmanian state government-for all of its words, for all of the criticism that it levels at this government and its minister, Brendan Nelson-is not actually prepared to walk the walk. At a time when GST payments to the Tasmanian government are rising extraordinarily, there is talk of money sitting around in the bank accounts of the Tasmanian government to the tune of $1 billion. At a time of a budget surplus of $365 million, a GST windfall of $480 million and a growing economy with things looking up, the Tasmanian state government does not even substantially increase its education budget-but why? I think the answer has to be encapsulated in the fact that we have just had an election and the Tasmanian state government has done everything in its power to fight off the Liberals in Tasmania and to try to stop them from having any success there. It is greatly disappointing, because there are so many opportunities. I have already said that Prospect High School has had an upgrade, but Lilydale District School in my electorate is due for an upgrade. In fact, it is overdue. Scottsdale High School in my electorate is way overdue for some sort of upgrade to its buildings and facilities. Lilydale District School does not have a gymnasium and yet it has over 500 students. Quite recently, the state government, through its public servants, offered Lilydale District School only enough money to build a gym that could be regarded as a shed and would not even be lined. At Scottsdale High School, the local community are working hard to develop a performing arts centre and they need more help. The Tasmanian Minister for Education, Paula Wriedt, received a letter from the federal education minister, Brendan Nelson, asking her to consider that some of the $6 million that comes from the federal government each year be used to assist with the performing arts centre. When I last checked with him, Minister Nelson had not received a reply. When I was a schoolteacher, one of my worse memories was that I, as a teacher, had to go to a local hardware store and purchase a heater. The member for Paterson has already said today that in his electorate he has schools that do not have air conditioning. I live in Tasmania-quite a cool state in the wintertime-and we had a school that did not have heaters. In fact, it was not just having to bring a heater to the classroom, it was having to bring your heater to the classroom and then take it to each subsequent class because none of the rooms had heating-a disgrace. So today I call on the Tasmanian state government to lift its game and adequately fund its own responsibilities, and I certainly continue to support the bill before us and commend it to the House.",55
36,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I rise to support the amendment to the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I wish to make some comments on the funding model that has been proposed by this government. There is no doubt that the education funding model is inequitable. It is interesting to listen to government members on the other side, including the member for Bass. The member for Bass decided to talk about what the Tasmanian government might be doing. He wanted to talk about the policies of the AEU, but of course I never heard a word from the member for Bass attacking the opposition's position in this chamber. The reason why the member for Bass did not talk about the policies of the federal opposition is that they are superior to those of the government in relation to education models. As a teacher, he would know that it is critical to ensure that all students in this country have access to fair education-have access to what is required for them to better themselves and, indeed, ensure they have a chance in life. We know that this is not an equal society. As one person said: ‘All men are born equal; some men were born more equal than others.' Clearly those that go to the King's School in Sydney are more equal than many of those constituents in Launceston and other parts of Bass. The reality is that not everyone has the same opportunities, so one role of government in the area of education is to try to create some opportunities for those who would not have access to proper educational opportunities without the policies determined in this place. The fact remains that this is not a debate between the public and private school systems. I understand why the member for Bass and others would like to dress up the argument as if to say that the Labor Party is against non-government schools. The reality is that the two major political parties that went into the election campaign-and the election itself-debating these things clearly had stark views. But it is very important for me to say in this place again-and we have to repeat it because we will be misrepresented by the government members-that at no stage did the Labor Party look to take any money from non-government schools. We sought to redress the imbalance between those schools that do not need the exorbitant funding increases that are being provided under this government and those nongovernment schools that do. In my own electorate there were many non-government schools that would have been beneficiaries of the Labor Party's policies. Indeed all of the 39 schools in my electorate-both government and non-government-would have been better off under the funding model proposed by the Labor Party. It is very important we set the record straight: this is not an argument between government schools and non-government schools. This is an argument about needs based education. This is an argument about facilitating the capacity of all students in country to have access to opportunities, to ensure that their futures can be determined through hard work and that the inherent inequalities that do exist in society are mitigated and ameliorated where possible. But this government has failed to do that. Whilst there have been some critics of the Labor Party's policies who have sought to argue that we have wanted to introduce class war, the reality is that the policy and funding model proposed by this governmentinitiated in 2001-was the beginning of the class war in the classroom. The class war in the classroom was proposed by the Prime Minister himself and, indeed, the Minister for Education, Science and Training when they set about creating a funding model that would give the King's School and Geelong Grammar greater increases than other nongovernment schools. Over the past four years they have had greater funding increases than other, more needy non-government schools. Let us not allow the argument to be misrepresented in the way government members would wish. The member for Bass and others like to talk about the Australian Education Union. By the way, if the member for Bass is not aware of this-and I imagine that as a teacher he should be-I should point out that the AEU is not an affiliate of the ALP. Indeed, what I understand about that education union is that it will campaign against Labor and Tory governments when it disagrees with their policies. I can assure the member for Bass and others that the AEU has certainly fought some fierce campaigns against the Bracks government in Victoria. To some extent, of course, their association would be closer to Labor. I suppose that is true of most unions-that is relatively transparent. But the AEU is not affiliated with the ALP and indeed it has taken up matters against other governments of other political colours when this the need has arisen from its point of view. That is up to the AEU. But the AEU is not the Labor Party. It would be more sincere if we had a debate in this chamber about the respective views of the two major political parties. It would be more sincere if we talked about our policies and about redressing the imbalance inside the non-government school proportion of funding, rather than allowing members of the government to rail against unions, which is something they do-if you pull a string, they start; it is a sort of mantra that they learn at an early stage in their careers-or to bash state governments. There has to be a time when the opposition parties in the state chambers of this nation do their job. The member for Bass should allow his friend the shadow minister for education in Tasmania to do his job in his chamber. Rather than the member for Bass debating what should be happening in Tasmania, it might be better if he debated why Labor's policies in this place are superior and look to ensure equity and fairness. If there is one policy that underpins the unfairness of this government it would have to be their education policy. It would have to be the funding arrangements that have allowed the most elite schools to profit the most from the changes in the funding model. We will not move away from that; we will not stop talking about that issue. It is critical for the community-the electors of this nation-to understand that that is an inherent problem. It is not just something that concerns me because I think those schools have received too much: it is not about how much they receive. The reality is that the budget is finite. This is about how much we have to spend. It is not that we are about punishing the most elite schools, as some would like to say-that is a nonsense. I have nothing against people paying a high premium, if they so choose, to send their children to what would of course be very good schools. But what I am against and what worries me is that we have been allowing a finite budget to be arranged so that the most elite schools have received the highest proportion of increases over the past four years-and beyond, it would appear. There need to be some changes there. There are government members who represent electorates where there are no elite schools. I know there are members of The Nationals who represent electorates where there are very few non-government schools. The fact is that we know that Nationals members and others represent electorates whose young people are predominantly schooled through public education-that is, their electors rely almost entirely on the state school system. In a way, it is more incumbent, therefore, on those people who may represent the poorer communities and the more remote communities, rather than the communities on the North Shore of Sydney, to raise the concern, if not in this place then in their respective party rooms, that they do not want to see Commonwealth funding being provided to schools that are not in need compared to those that are. That really is a responsibility. We come here with a number of roles-and I am sure the member for Bass would agree with this. One of his roles is to represent the electors his electorate-and, indeed, one of my roles is to do the same for the electors in my electorate. He is a member of the Liberal Party, and I am a member of the Labor Party, but we are also here to represent our electors, and if that means we have to do that inside the caucus or party room then so be it. I invite government members to start looking at whether their electors, their families and the children of those families, are beneficiaries of the Commonwealth's policies, because I would have to say that in many instances they are not. It is incumbent upon members to fight for changes that will provide greater funding in their own electorates where there are no schools like King's School or Geelong Grammar. I think there is a big challenge there for government members to consider. I represent a great part of Melbourne. It is an established part of Melbourne, which includes what were once called Melbourne's working-class suburbs and also new estates like Caroline Springs, Cairnlea, Taylors Lakes and Taylors Hill in western Melbourne. I have a great electorate which has the fast-growing corridors of western Melbourne amidst some very established suburbs as well. Many of the parents in my electorate are concerned about getting the right funding for their schools. During the election campaign, I was able to notify all the parents in my electorate that the 39 schools, both government and non-government, would be better off in terms of funding under Labor. I was proud to have the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition visit my electorate and, indeed, visit the Sydenham-Hillside Primary School, to announce a number of the policies which I thought were going to take us forward in this policy area. I do not think this is a debate about envy. It is not a debate about bashing people at the top end of town. This is about how you propin erly distribute a finite amount of money to ensure that students in this land are properly considered and in a position to have a decent future. We seek to amend this bill but, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, we will support it if required, because we will not allow the funding of the schools in this country to be jeopardised by any further delays. But that will not stop us moving our amendment and continuing to argue that there has to be a fairer way in relation to funding-that there has to be a funding model based on need and not inequity. Today, in rising to talk about this bill I am somewhat disappointed that the government has not sought to change its views on this area of funding. We know that the Howard government has bestowed most of the largest increases, as I have said, upon the schools and students requiring the least. Schools that charge $12,000 or more in fees educate less than 5 per cent of Australian schoolchildren, yet these schools have received a staggering funding increase of up to 300 per cent since 2001. Government schools educate almost 70 per cent of schoolchildren but they have received a tiny 20 per cent increase, which in effect amounts to indexation for rising costs. The Catholic school system educates 20 per cent of schoolchildren but they have received only a 25 per cent increase. As you can see from the statistics, this is not a rhetorical argument. If you look at the facts, you can see that the increases at those schools with very high fees have been greater and that at those more needs based schools in the government and non-government areas there have been much smaller increases. As I said, I am happy to allow my electors to make a decision on those things. I understand the government's hubris. Of course the government will be content with itself, having been re-elected for a fourth time. But I think there are some things that the government has to consider. One of them is whether it can continue to allow these funding arrangements to remain as they are. I believe that through this policy the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education, Science and Training have exposed the falsity of the government's claims about caring for battlers. We heard all about Howard's battlers, but this policy, along with some others, really exposes as a falsehood any claims that the government cares about battlers. In fact, what we see instead is a government that looks to only five per cent of the nation in terms of increasing resources to education. Labor says that we must reconsider this. We ask the government to reconsider the way in which it is funding schools. There has been a lot written about these matters. Indeed, I know there are advocates for the government's position on funding. People could argue that there was a relatively stark choice in the area of education in this election campaign just gone, but I think a lot more has to be considered. In light of the fact that we have gone past the razzle-dazzle of the campaign maybe we can now get back to focusing on what we need to do for this country. I would like to refer to a report prepared by a leading economist, Dr Vince FitzGerald, entitled Governments working together. Indeed, this report makes a number of very good observations about the education system and pulls no punches in relation to concerns at both federal and state levels. I would like to quote a part of that report. It said: While the Australian school education system appears to serve the majority of the community well, it is failing substantial groups of students and their parents. There is a significant minority of young people who fail to achieve even minimum learning benchmarks, and there are clear differences in access to education and learning outcomes between those from high and low socio-economic backgrounds, Indigenous and nonIndigenous backgrounds and, for reading achievement, between girls and boys. The causes of these outcomes are complex and include uneven participation in early childhood education, inequitable funding for school education, the failure of some schools and teachers ... Dr FitzGerald does point to a number of factors that lead to deficiencies in the education system, but amongst those primary factors he lists, quite rightly I believe, inequitable funding for schools education funding and he points to the fact that there is a causal link between coming from families from better socio-economic backgrounds and doing better in education. For example, a person from a better socio-economic background is almost twice as likely as a person from a less good socio-economic background to get to university. Using the ABS statistics of the census of 2001, I will just draw a comparison between my electorate of Gorton and the electorate of Bennelong. I know the Prime Minister's electorate is not the wealthiest electorate represented in this chamber, but I think this is an interesting comparison which points to the fact that there are still inequities in regions different parts of Australia and therefore we need funding to address those. A person in Bennelong is four times more likely than a person from Gorton to graduate from a university at a bachelor of arts level at least. A child aged between 10 and 14 in Bennelong is more than three times more likely than a child in Gorton to have access to and use of the Internet. There are, therefore, clear deficiencies in some parts of the country in terms of access to education. I am sure those things I have raised about the deficiencies we may have in Gorton in terms of resources are also true not only in other parts of metropolitan Australia but also certainly in rural Australia. I have said before that I believe there are similarities between the nature of some of the lack of services that I experience in my electorate and those in regional and rural Australia. I think it is about time that those members opposite, particularly those who represent quite poor communities where there is less access than in the leafier suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney, argue inside their party room to have policies changed. In particular, in relation to this matter, I think it is about time they argued to have the education funding model changed to be based on need, not on inequity.",59
37,Mrs HULL,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"In following the former speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of the House the fact that equity is what this government is all about-equity for all Australians, not just for some Australians. You may not think that when you hear some of the speeches that are delivered to this House, particularly by the opposition. When we were going into an election period this year, the opposition espoused a particular option that would take funding from so-called wealthy schools and redistribute it. That was of great concern to me. I do not in have any wealthy schools in my electorate, but I certainly have children in my electorate who come from very poor backgrounds and who have no other choice but to leave home to get an education. They leave home for 12 months of the year; they go boarding somewhere. When they go, their parents generally try to find the very best facilities they can to put them in. It is the thing that parents that have chosen to live out in isolated areas do to compensate their children. Their children have to leave home and go to boarding schools in city areas, so their parents try to get them into the very best schools. And they significantly do without. They could by no means be called rich, and yet they would have been the ones who would have been severely impacted upon. Those with no choice or with little choice would have been the most heavily impacted upon. Therefore, I was very concerned when I listened to the former member's speech: the Labor Party do not practise what they preach. Today I particularly want to talk about inequities in education and how this government have risen to the challenge and have supported equity in education for rural and regional students. They have met the criteria-clearly part of the states' responsibilities-simply because the state Labor governments have walked away from their responsibilities for rural children who have no choice but to access school term hostels as their only means of getting to a school gate, whether that be a public school gate or a temic Catholic school gate. In this case, I will talk specifically about Claughton House. The Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 that we have in front of us deals with a range of education issues, including funding for nongovernment rural student hostels. That is something that I have fought for in here for six years. It is something that I have fought the state governments for all this time. In 1997 they walked away from the students and the families that I represent, and they have never ever turned and walked back towards them. I figure that that is a shame and they should not be allowed to walk away. The announcement of funding by The Nationals in particular-it was a regional services policy that was announced by John Anderson-was, as I said, a result of the state governments' refusal to assist those school term hostels. Many years of lobbying by me to obtain this much needed funding fell on deaf ears in the states. But it was nally recognised, and I congratulate Deputy Prime Minister Anderson, the Prime Minister's office and the Minister for Education, Science and Training for finally recognising that this is a good policy. There are only around 997 of these students across Australia. I have only 38 of these students in my electorate-23 in Claughton House and 15 boys in Loyola House in Wagga Wagga. Claughton House is a school term hostel which has served the Hay community for over 80 years. As I have said, it has been an issue that I have worked on since my election as the member for Riverina in 1998. Claughton House provides an education for children in rural and remote areas who would otherwise be unable to attend school. In many cases, their parents are itinerant workers or employed by the shows sys- and circuses that travel around Australia. This is the only means by which their children can live a normal day-today existence. One of the ladies who travels Australia widely with the show rang me to say that three children of hers are in Claughton House, and this is the first time they have been able to participate in Saturday cricket or to play team sports-rugby league, Aussie rules, basketball or netball. This is the first time they have been able to do these things as a team, because show people-as you would recognise, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott-are on the road all of the time. I have fought for these people. I have stood and thought, ‘What do I have to do to get the states to understand that these kids do not just go somewhere else when you do not fund their student hostels?' They do not just go and get an education somewhere else; they just do not get an education. Primarily, some of the parents are not able to provide that, as they cannot read or write themselves. They are literally not able to provide that fiSchool of the Air schooling that we have had for so many years. So these kids do not get a choice. I think that people have walked away from them in the states because there were not enough of them. But this is the right thing to do. This policy that the federal government has adopted is the right thing to do by Australian children. As I said, out of the 997 students I have only 38 in my electorate, and I suspect that not one parent of those students resides in my electorate. I suspect that not one parent of those students would vote for Kay Hull as the member for Riverina. But it was a good policy decision that has been walked away from by the state government and, in particular, by the state Minister for Education and Training, Dr Refshauge. He has never, ever, walked about, turned around and faced these children and said, ‘We care about your future. We care to give you equity. We care enough that we are going to provide the viability funding that we indicated that we would provide in the minutes from the MCEETYA meeting in Tasmania.' Those minutes said that, yes, state governments would be responsible for viability funding for school term hostels-the only choice for some children to get an education. This government have done an amazing job in turning that around. They have allocated $2,500 per student who attends a school term hostel. As we all know in this House-and we have heard many discussions and had many conversations-an education is the most valuable gift that we can give to any child. So why should these children be forced to accept less than equal fundhere. ing from the state governments, simply because they live in rural and remote areas? Children can attend Claughton House from the first years of school, and they do. From kindergarten through to year 12 we have these children attending school. Claughton House is run by the Uniting Church. It provides accommodation, meals, supervision and travel to each of the schools in Hay: St Mary's Catholic school, Hay Public School and the Hay War Memorial High School. Claughton House does this for these children, and this is these children's only choice. Claughton House has become an integral part of the Hay community. It has enabled thousands of children from remote areas to access an education. As I said, the state Labor governments have walked away from these kids for seven years. We finally got this viability funding for four years for these kids. But I want to say that, for the 38 children who attend a hostel in the Riverina electorate, their options for fairness and equity in accessing education need to be recognised for far longer than the four years. It is of note that this government, I am sure, would intend to fund these kids recurrently for as long as the government is in place. But let me say that it would be a brave government that would ever take the funding away from these very deserving students who are looking to have an education. As I said, it is no big vote winner for me-it has probably won not one vote, actually-but it is an issue that I believed in as a matter of fairness and equity and right policy. During the election campaign the minister announced funding of $10 million over four years. I am really proud to say that that was a direct result of my lobbying. It was something that I have put into this House every year of the six years that I have been I have lobbied successive ministers on this issue. And now we are putting it into practice. The funny part about it was that, just as we got the funding in, the Uniting Church decided that they would close Claughton House, with its 23 students. Just last week, I travelled to Hay. We sat down and decided that we would form an incorporated association with local residents who would take on the responsibility of running Claughton House and who would be responsible for the education futures of these children. That is what Hay is all about. It is a can-do community. It is a community that would never walk away from these students. They are not the children of residents of Hay, either, but the community would never walk away from these students-and yet we see the state government, time after time, walking away. We are going to need some more assistance for Claughton House in the next four years. We already have the very generous allocation from this Howard-Anderson federal government, picking up the states' requirements for these children all over Australia. But I say to Dr Refshauge, the minister for education in New South Wales: we are going to need your assistance for Claughton House, because we need to start from the beginning again. We need to be able to provide security for the 23 students who rently residing in Claughton House and accessing their education from there. I have great pleasure in being in this House to really thank the ministers and the government for seeing the equity and justice in providing an education option for all of these children, including those students who attend Loyola House. During the election we also gave support for migrant school students to learn English. Over the next four years, more than $245 million will be available to assist newly arrived migrant school students in Australia to receive support in learning English. That might not seem very important to a lot of people, but, by gee, it is important to me in the Riverina. In the Riverina we have a significant number of arrivals from many other countries, particularly around the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area in Griffith, Leeton and Hay. In all of these areas we have significant establishment of a multicultural pot. It is a wonderful example of how multiculturalism actually can work in communities. The English as a second language new arrivals program deals with the needs of primary and secondary school students whose first language is not English. Many of my constituents who come into the country and do not speak English go off to school. Some of them are in high school. It must be very difficult for them to sit in a classroom, not understand what is happening and be expected to learn. As I said, I have students in all those communities across my electorate. They will be able to take great advantage of this great program. In order for them to adjust to their new environment, English language skills are crucial. Under the program, these students develop their English language competence and are able to increase their educational opportunities for the future. All state are cur- and territory governments and nongovernment education authorities can access funding to assist with the delivery of intensive English language tuition for those students that are eligible. This funding agreement represents a 39 per cent increase over the last four-year funding period. I have taken the opportunity to come into the House today to applaud the government for something that is so dear to my heart. I am so thankful for it. It has been a great opportunity to be able to come in and say that this is a government who sees the equity for all Australians and delivers for all Australian children.",63
38,Ms KING,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which includes an additional $1 billion in capital infrastructure funding for schools, announced during the election campaign. It also contains the government's tuition credits scheme for students who fail year 3 reading tests, a measure announced some time ago but only now introduced. The bills are supported, as without them the Commonwealth funding to government and non-government schools for next year would not be forthcoming. It would be a brave member of parliament that would stop these bills and allow teachers not to be paid at the start of next year. Labor made a commitment during the election that we would not jeopardise 2005 funding for schools but rather, in government, we were seeking to introduce new legislation to enact our policies. Unfortunately, we have not been able to do that. Whilst I support the flow of funding contained in these bills, there are some serious flaws in the government's policies, including the fact that these bills contain virtually recurrent increases over indexation for government schools; they continue for another four years increases of 200 per cent or more for some of the best-resourced independent schools in the country; and there is a funding security beyond 2008 for the 60 per cent of Catholic systemic schools which have been categorised as ‘funding maintained' to avoid the funding cuts that would have been applied if Catholic schools had been funding at the level set for their sociorights economic scores. I have some serious concerns about where these education policies are heading and where they are taking us in relation to the opportunities available for those families and young people at the margins of our society. Why is it that children of blue-collar workers have less than one chance in three of reaching university-only half the rate of children from professional and managerial homes? Why is it that children of blue-collar workers also finish school much less often and if they do complete school they are four times more likely to be unemployed? Why are 20,000 kids missing out on TAFE places each year despite having the skills and the passion to learn a trade? Why is it that amongst some families and in some regions this disadvantage is so entrenched? Why is it that Australia ranks 19th out of the 30 OECD countries for upper secondary school completion and has one of the highest proportions of 15to 19-year-olds who are not in education or work, ranking in the bottom half of the OECD? Surely these are questions that should concern this parliament. In my own region, estimates place the number of 15to 19-year-olds who are out of work and not engaged in school or other education and training at around 23 per cent. We have an enormous responsibility to assist these kids, and to assist them earlier. Investment in education is fundamental to ensuring no that these young people have opportunities. Investment in education is the best way to address inequality: it is the best chance we have of breaking the poverty cycle; it is a great leveller; and it is one of the key elelack of ments of our democratic tradition. The debate on education in this place has become skewed. The government has redefined the very nature of choice, reducing it to a defence of the rights of parents to choose high-fee paying schools at the expense of the of parents to choose less expensive schools, whether they be government or nongovernment, and still have a right to expect a decent level of resources and good educational outcomes for their children. That is not choice; that is favouritism. That is saying there is an in-club and that, when it comes to schools funding, if you do not fit then you get fewer resources. Professor Vinson in an article last month in the University of Sydney News argued that the current schools funding system in Australia was contributing to the poverty cycle because children left school with inadequate skills to compete in the labour market. He argued that the first step is to identify the specific resources and conditions necessary to provide all children with a reasonable educational opportunity. He said: This amounts to working out the cost of purchasing a standard, adequate, ‘market basket' of educational goods and services required to provide every child with an opportunity to meet specified education standardsand then adjusting it, based on the needs of students in different areas. He argued that around $9,000 per annum for primary school students and $12,000 for secondary school students is needed. That sounds a bit familiar to me. That is exactly the argument Labor was making during the election campaign. We have to stop this cultural divide the government has created between private and public schools-stop the false arguments that the Commonwealth should look after private schools and leave the state schools to the state government systems and that the Commonwealth should spend more money on private schools and skew its funding towards private schools and spend less on state schools. Australian governments have a responsibility for all students and a responsibility to fund schools to an adequate level so all students, regardless of the types of schools they go to, have access to the same standard of resources and can expect the same learning opportunities. As mentioned at the outset, the legislation introduces an additional $1 billion for capital works in government and non-government schools. The funding for government schools is to be paid directly to parents associations. In the case of non-government schools, it will go to block grants authorities. Our understanding of the link between capital investment in infrastructure and educational and other learning outcomes is growing. There is evidence to suggest that students with better capital facilities have better ing outcomes. But the evidence is a bit more complex than that. The PricewaterhouseCoopers report commissioned by the New South Wales Department of Education and Training argued that the evidence in the study supported the link between improved learning outcomes and capital investment, but there were several qualifications. The first was that different types of capital investment have an impact on results. What they were saying was that expenditure targeted at developing specialist areas for science, technology and ICT was generally considered by most head teachers as having the greatest positive impact on pupil attainment. In addition, replacing or modifying classrooms whose design inhibited desirable teaching methods was also reported to have a significant impact on pupils' ability to learn. The second qualification in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report was the finding that head teachers in schools with either extremely low or extremely high levels of attainment reported a weaker link between capital and performance than those schools with average attainment. In schools with relatively poor attainment levels, head teachers struggled to see how capital investment on its own could help to improve pupil performance. In schools with high attainment levels, head teachers could not always see the direct relevance of the capitalperformance relationship. Both qualifications in the report point to the fact that the relationship between capital and educational outcomes is important, but it is more complex than just providing a blank cheque to schools regardless of what they are to spend the money on or what their level of need is and in the absence of other programs designed to assist communities in which schools with lower attainment levels operate. Without a strong needs based approach learnand clear guidelines this legislation may achieve its political outcomes, but it may not achieve its public policy outcome, which should be the improvement of learning outcomes for all students. With finite government resources and with many schools across Australia experiencing declining capital stock, it is incumbent on the government to be transparent about what the policy objective of this program is and the basis on which funds in this legislation are to be cated, and to report on them. The policy this legislation enacts gives the government a final say on grant applications. I am concerned that the pattern we have seen emerge with the Regional Partnerships funding will occur here. There are many schools in my electorate that are in need of capital works. Darley Primary School in my electorate, for example, is constructed entirely of demountable classrooms. There is not a single permanent classroom in that school. The office complex is a brick building, but the rest of the school is all demountable classrooms. It is a school of well over 300 pupils. Creswick North has no multipurpose sports facility or room for children to have their assemblies. If anybody here knows anything about Ballarat winters, they will know it would not be great to have a school assembly outside in the middle of June. Daylesford Primary School is on a really difficult site-it is very hilly. It has major problems with resurfacing its only recreation oval and the only clear space for kids to engage in physical activity, something that is so important in reducing childhood obesity. St Patrick's Primary School are just plain running out of space. They do not have any more room to put the growing number of students they have. Every one of the schools in my electorate, I can guarantee, has an urgent capital works project. I will be contacting them to make sure that they know about this funding going through the House. I will be encouraging them to submit applications. But, given the pattern that has already emerged with the government's Regional Partnerships program, I am concerned that Ballarat schools will miss out. When I see that $12 million was poured in from the Regional Partnerships program to the seat of Bass-and Launceston is a town not that different to Ballarat in both physical structure and sizealloand the whole electorate of Ballarat got $700,000, I think I have reason to be concerned. I do want to see this money used as a convenient pork barrel in marginal seats. The Minister for Education, Science and Training must guarantee that every dollar spent on this program is accounted for and goes to the schools with the highest need, not those in places where the government deems it needs to win votes. I also have concerns that competition for these grants is not on a level playing field. The government must work with parent councils and principals to assist them in applying because those parent councils with more political nous and experience and with louder voices may not necessarily represent the neediest schools. The other element of this legislation is the government's initiative announced in the May budget-the pilot Tutorial Credit Initiative-which gives a voucher to purchase reading assistance of up to $700 to parents of students who did not achieve the Year 3 minimum national reading benchmark. The lateness of this initiative is of concern. I have been contacted by some parents who received their reading tests back in June asking how they could access the fund. They have now had to wait for over six months. I am unclear as to why the bill was not introduced earlier given some of the legislation that was rushed through this place in the last session before the election. The government, I would have to say, also seems to have underestimated the amount of funds needed for this scheme. It is looking more likely that parents will not receive a full $700 but, rather, something in the vicinity of $420. That is something the minister should respond to in his reply. This is an area I feel very strongly about, and I will be very closely watching the evaluation of this pilot. In my first speech in this place I talked about one of the major manufacturing companies in my electorate. When I was first elected in 2001 the human resources manager of a company that employs over 500 people in my district had just won a new contract. They had put 80 jobs in the local newspaper. That was a huge effort and a huge amount of jobs to boost local employment in my electorate. What the human resources manager had to tell me was that, of the 200 applicants that they had for those 80 positions, well over half of them failed a basic year 9 literacy test. He said that, in the case of at least a third of those, he did not know how they functioned within society. They were basically innumerate and could not even read street signs. It is extremely worrying for any community that has a high level of unskilled labour, high mature age unemployment and high youth unemployment to accept literacy levels of that rate. That was a good learning experience for me about some of the things we needed to do. We do need to invest in adult literacy, but it is terrific to see that we are now starting to invest, after a lot of rhetoric, in early literacy to try and get to kids much earlier than when they are applying for jobs in the manufacturing sector. I think the national literacy award has also boosted literacy within schools. I want to put on record my congratulations to Myrniong Primary School, which was one of the winners I was able to present an award to just before the election. Schools funding is not something that should promote further inequality in our society. It should not promote further inequality in schools resourcing by giving the largest funding increases to schools with the highest level of resources. Schools funding should not further entrench poverty and disadvantage, and the government needs to hold itself to account for policy objectives-for learning outcomes for all students, not just for some students. It needs to stop the rhetoric that divides the community between parents who can afford to take their children to high fee paying schools and families who do not have that choice. I commend the bills to the House.",66
39,Mr HARTSUYKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I want to speak about this government's commitment to quality education, particularly our commitment to funding education over the next four years. The funding package as outlined in the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 will provide some $33 billion in funding for the period 2005-08an increase of some $9.5 billion over the current funding period. This is the largest ever funding commitment to Australian schools by any federal government. The bills guarantee funding by the Australian government for both government and nongovernment schools. This government believe in the principle that every child should have financial support for their education regardless of the school they attend. The bills are about providing for choice in education and providing opportunity for our young people to gain the type of education that all parents want their children to have. State government schools over the next four years will receive funding from the federal government by way of an increase of some $2.9 billion. This represents an increase in recurrent grants of some 36 per cent over the current quadrennium. A major factor is also the support for our Catholic schools. The general recurrent funding for Catholic schools over the proposed period will be some $12.8 billion-an increase of some $3.7 billion. Independent schools will receive some $7.8 billion in general recurrent funding-a substantial increase over the current quadrennium. The bills deliver on several important commitments which the federal government has made to our education system. With regard to capital infrastructure, many of our children currently attend schools where the standard of those schools is inadequate. Much of this problem relates to inadequate funding by a host of state Labor governments. As a result, the infrastructure of those schools is substandard, and the learning environment in those schools is not as good as it could be. The Howard-Anderson government is committed to school infrastructure and already commits substantial amounts of funding to state government schools as well as to non-government schools. The bills continue that commitment by providing some $1.5 billion in capital funding over the period 2005-08. Importantly, the bills also implement our election commitment of a further $1 billion to restore and build infrastructure for our schools and their grounds, of which $700 million will be provided directly to government schools so that P&C associations will be able to determine the priorities for their local projects. Examples of projects which could be funded under this program include classroom improvements, library resources, computer facilities, air conditioning, heating, outdoor shade structures, playing fields, sporting infrastructure and playground equipment. These projects are urgently needed by schools and the federal government is meeting those needs through this program. The legislation provides that the funding be made directly to schools. The inability of state Labor governments to provide services on the ground in so many areas has been part of the strategy to provide direct funding. works very much along the lines of the very successful Roads to Recovery program, where funding is provided directly to local councils to meet local road needs. The principle is very much the same. I look forward to working on funding applications with my local schools to see much-needed infrastructure either built or restored. State Labor governments have been neglecting our government schools for too long. New South Wales is one of the highest taxing states. It receives substantial GST revenue and it has been receiving very high levels of stamp duty. It recently introduced taxes including the poker machine tax and the real estate vendor tax. Despite these funding sources, the New South Wales government are still unable to provide the sort of funding for our schools to keep the level of capital infrastructure to appropriate levels, to ensure that our young people have an educational environment appropriate to their needs. This new $1 billion initiative will help restore and build Australia's schooling infrastructure. It is a much needed program and one that I commend wholeheartedly. The legislation also provides for schoolterm hostels. Many people in isolated areas experience great difficulty in getting the type of education they want for their children. The legislation provides new additional funding in recognition that it is becoming more costly for families in isolated areas to achieve appropriate education outcomes for the children. The Howard-Anderson government will provide non-government school-term hostels across Australia with a grant of $2½ thousand per child over the next four years. The legislation also provides for special purpose grants and continues the government's commitment to improving literacy and numeracy for all Australian students. Students who are most in need of additional learning assistance will benefit from apThis proximately $2.1 billion under a new program: the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs Program. A key feature of the legislation will be to strengthen the performance framework for government funding. This will reinforce the link between funding provided and improved educational outcomes. Underpinning this will be a requirement for greater national consistency in schooling, requiring a common starting age and common testing standards. The tendency these days is for labour to become much more mobile than it once was. People are tending to move around the country-from cities to regional areas and from state to state. I think it is vital that when a child moves from one educational jurisdiction to another there is a reasonable expectation that the progress of that child will not be impeded by a dramatically different educational framework. The schools assistance bill provides for better reporting to parents. I think that all parents would like to know exactly how their child is performing. They need an accurate measure. They need to be able to determine whether their child needs extra assistance; they need to be able to determine that their child is doing as well as they would wish him to do. It is a rather unfortunate at the moment that many school reports are unclear and do not provide parents with the sort of information that they believe they need to make informed judgments on what is a very important issue-the education of their children. If a child is in need of additional assistance, appropriate reporting of that child's progress is a good way of making sure that the needs of the child are brought the attention of the parents. I commend this measure. I commend greater information being given to parents to make informed decisions. I commend that notion. The minister is highly focused on the fact that parents wish to know and need to know how their children are performing. The bill will also provide information to parents on how their school is performing. I think it is important that, if we are going to focus on schools which are struggling a little, we have those performance indicators so that resources can be diverted to schools which are perhaps not achieving the results that other schools are achieving. This will ensure that we take the necessary steps to improve the performance of those lesser performing schools, to the benefit of the students at those schools. The bill is very focused on values, including the issue of requiring schools to fly the Australian flag. I think the flag is a vital symbol of Australia, a symbol of what we are and what it means to be Australian. The focus of this bill on values education, I think, is a very commendable element. This bill represents a historic investment in the future of our schools. The Howard-Anderson government is committed to quality schooling for all Australian students, regardless of which school they attend. This legislation will strengthen all schools. Through improved accountability and outcomes, this bill will ensure that the education sector continues to improve and continues to provide betsituation ter outcomes for our children. This is a landmark bill, providing a record $33 billion in expenditure over the next four years. It will provide $27.9 billion in general recurrent grant assistance to government and non-government schools; $1.5 billion in capital grants to assist with the provision of school facilities; $2.1 billion for the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs Proto gram; $117 million for the Country Areas Program, so vital in regional and rural Australia; $245.8 million under the English as a Second Language New Arrivals program, to assist newly arrived students; and $114.2 million for the languages program, to improve learning outcomes for students learning languages other than English. Certainly, with regard to this legislation, the $1 billion additional capital infrastructure funding for both government and nongovernment schools is of major importance in my electorate. I know that there are a significant number of schools with demountable classrooms which require upgrading. Whilst demountable classrooms do serve a purpose, if we can improve the quality of accommodation for those students we will be able to achieve improved educational outcomes. I think that the elements of this bill which promote consistency from state to state in education, where a child can move from New South Wales to Queensland without it appearing as if he or she has moved to another planet, are highly commendable. There are a great number of elements of this bill which are to be commended. The bill very much focuses on the need to spend additional funds in education. Education, we know, is a great leveller in our community. It is a way in which we can empower our young people to achieve. We can empower our young people if we give them the sort of start that they need in life to go on to great things. We talk of the skills shortage. A highly educated work force is the very best way we can ensure that we build up our skills base. Certainly, I will be very focused during this term on ensuring that we talk to our P&Cs and that we get some of this capital funding out to the schools which are the most needy. I think it is vitally important we do that. vitally important that we upgrade our schools. Unfortunately, so much of state government funding seems to be consumed by administration and bureaucracy. The more funding we can get to schools on the ground and the more funding we can get into providing educational outcomes on the ground, the better the results we will have for our young students. The better the educational outcomes we have, the more productive a nation we can be. We face an ageing population. We are highly dependent on young students who come into the work force being highly trained. The way to ensure that they are highly trained is to give them the best possible education. This bill basically attempts to do that by providing for educational standards, additional capital funding and funding for the needs of students in rural and remote Australia. I think it is very important that we acknowledge the needs of students in regional and rural areas. It is very hard to obtain a quality education when you are a long way from your nearest school. Regrettably, for some students, it may mean long periods of time away from their families, their support base. Those students have to travel away to school because there are very limited opportunities for them. This bill aims to provide support for those students. This bill aims to strengthen the quality of educational outcomes in this country. This bill aims to redress some of the problems of chronic underfunding under state Labor. This bill aims to provide funding directly to schools so that local P&Cs can provide advice on local priorities. Local P&Cs can provide information to government on the most needy areas in their schools and can make decisions at a local level. Decision making at a local level is where we can accurately gauge where education funding is needed. I will be very keen to work with my local It is P&Cs and local parents to ensure that the educational outcomes we achieve, through the funding that is made available under the bill, are very accurately distributed. I know that the Minister for Education, Science and Training is very focused on the need to get that capital funding out into the community to improve some of those schools where children work in demountable schoolrooms. This bill supports not only private sector education but also vitally needed funding for our state schools. We are supporting choice in education. We are supporting our many good state schools, as well as our many good Catholic and independent schools. In the electorate of Cowper I am very focused on the needs of my school community. I am very focused on the fact that many of my P&Cs have highlighted a range of shortcomings, particularly in the area of capital funding, and I will be keen to address that by way of the capital funding that is going to be made available under this bill.",70
40,The SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Defence: Pre-emptive Military Strikes",74
41,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer him to previous government statements on military pre-emption. Under what circumstances is the government prepared to support preemptive military action against the sovereign territory of another country?,74
42,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the government has made its position quite clear in relation to this-that is, that the government believes that it has a duty to Australians to protect them in circumstances where their lives or their security might be threatened. The government of course would take that duty seriously. It would seek in all circumstances to operate with other like-minded countries in ensuring that the security and the safety of the Australian public is maintained. The people of Australia will know that, under this government, security will be strong and the nation will be strong. Economy: Performance",74
43,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer advise the House of the results of the September quarter national accounts, released this morning by the Australian Bureau of Statistics? What do they indicate about the economy and the importance of responsible economic management?",74
44,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that the national accounts were released today for the September quarter, showing that the economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the quarter and three per cent through the year. Household consumption continues strongly, growing at 5.4 per cent through the year, underpinned by low interest rates, strong consumer confidence and the lowest unemployment in 27 years. There has been some slowdown in dwelling investment, both in terms of new housing and alterations. The government welcome this. The government have been saying for some time that continued large increases in prices in the housing market would not be sustainable. We welcome the fact that all of the indicators-building approvals, credit, auction clearances and prices-now indicate some slowing in that market. There was a large detraction from growth from net exports. I indicated in the House on Monday that this would occur. No doubt Australia's exporters are finding things made more difficult by the high level of the Australian dollar. The terms of trade have risen in Australia's favour by 10.8 per cent through the year and are now at their highest level since 1974. Today's national accounts also indicate that there is no strong inflationary pressure in the Australian economy, with the household consumption indicators in fact being lower than the CPI and lower than the target range the government has set with the Reserve Bank. All of this indicates that, while Australia is growing at a slower rate in this quarter than it was in the earlier quarters of the year, prospects for the economy remain strong, supported by good consumer sentiment, low interest rates and strong employment. It indicates that important economic management must continue and reform must continue. The best thing we could do for the Australian economy is to pass the government's reform agenda, particularly in relation to industrial relations, to make Australia a more competitive place and to give young people greater opportunities. Defence: Pre-emptive Military Strikes",74
45,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is again to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer to his earlier answer when he confirmed the government's willingness to launch preemptive strikes under certain circumstances. Why then did the Prime Minister last night say that the government has no doctrine of military pre-emption? What diplomatic efforts will the government now take to clear up this confusion and the damage to Australia's interests in the region?,75
46,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is of course no confusion. The government's position is absolutely clear and consistent-that is, that the government will act to protect Australians and to protect their security. We will act in concert with countries in the region who also want to make sure that their countries are not used as terrorist bases or used to attack Australians. I think that Australia's position in the gion is well understood and is admired. It was the Australian assistance to Indonesia that actually managed to bring to justice the Bali bombers. It was our cooperation with the police of Indonesia which is giving them opportunities in relation to winding up terrorist threats. If anybody wanted evidence of this government's ability to work in concert with the nations of South-East Asia they got it overnight when this government opened up the opportunity for a free trade agreement with ASEAN-an agreement which the so called experts on South-East Asia, the Australian Labor Party, were unable to progress during 13 years of government. Mr Crean-Absolute rubbish!",75
47,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"‘Absolute rubbish,' says the member for Hotham. Oh, I missed the Australia-ASEAN free trade agreement that was signed between 1983 and 1996, did I? Mr Crean-That's not the point you were making.",75
48,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I missed it, did I? Mr Crean-Be honest.",75
49,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hotham is the Labor Party's sound effects man down on the front bench. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on the question of relevance. The question was about the government's confusion on military pre-emption; not about a trade agreement. It is a question about military pre-emption, and the Acting Prime Minister should come back to the point of that question.",75
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The answer is in order.,75
51,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about the understanding of Australia's position in the region, and I am making the point that Australia's position in the region, as demonstrated by this breakthrough agreement, is restronger than it has been for a very long period of time and certainly much stronger in the region than it was between 1983 and 1996. Mr Crean interjecting",75
52,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The sound effects man is at it again with his interjections. He beats in time, but not to the drum of his own party. I indicate that Australia's position is well understood. Our cooperative relations with Asia are as good as they have been. I think both sides of the House would actually welcome this wonderful breakthrough that has occurred overnight. Association of South-East Asian Nations: Free Trade Agreement",75
53,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister inform the House of the developments in Australia's economic management with South-East Asia?,76
54,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I congratulate him on an outstanding job in the recent election to win the seat of Stirling for the government. During the summit in Vientiane yesterday, leaders from ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand agreed to launch free trade agreement negotiations between the 12 countries. This is an historic development in Australia's engagement with South-East Asia. An ASEAN FTA will consolidate Australia's ongoing economic integration with South-East Asia. An ASEAN FTA will boost trade and commercial links with one of the most vibrant economic regions in the world. The 10 countries of ASEAN are home to 545 million consumers. They generate a combined GDP of almost $US700 billion. They are currently growing at an average GDP growth of 5.5 per cent per year. An FTA will present Australian exporters with new commercial opportunities in this enormous and expanding market, delivering the progressive elimination of tariff barriers in trade, goods, services and investment. It will lead to further job creation in our export sector-a sector that has helped contribute to the growth in jobs in the Australian economy since 1996, which now stands at 1.4 million jobs since this government was elected. Negotiations on this agreement will begin early in 2005 and are forecast to be concluded early in 2007. They will build on the existing closer economic partnership agreement we have already negotiated with the 10 ASEAN countries that was signed in 2002. The last time an Australian Prime Minister was invited to an ASEAN leaders summit was in 1977. If my memory serves me correctly, Mr Speaker, I do not think you were in the House then. At that meeting, leaders demonstrated a mutual desire for ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand to enhance dialogue, relations and cooperation. I am pleased to inform the House that 27 years later that mutual desire has now become a reality. Telstra: Dr Ziggy Switkowski",76
55,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration. Is the minister aware that Dr Ziggy Switkowski stepped down as Telstra CEO this morning and will receive a payout of over $2 million? As the majority shareholder in Telstra, is the government satisfied that Dr Switkowski's $2 million golden handshake is justified?",76
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is that the board has indicated that it will honour the contract and, as the majority shareholder in the company, we believe that the contract should be honoured. That is the way in which corporations operate. When they enter into contracts, reputable corporations tend to keep them. We would say that this is a reputable company and that it is obliged to keep its contracts. NA",76
57,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling for the next question, I recognise in the gallery the Hon. Warwick Smith, former minister and former member for Bass. NA Association of South-East Asian Nations",76
58,Dr JENSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the outcomes of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand summit meeting yesterday in Laos?,77
59,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, I thank the honourable member for Tangney and congratulate him not only on his maiden question but also on his election to the House of Representatives. I know that the people of Tangney will be well represented by him. Yesterday's ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand summit was a truly historic event in the history of Australian diplomacy. It brings together the ASEAN leaders as well as our Prime Minister and the New Zealand Prime Minister. The summit was more than just symbolic: it was a practical expression of very deep relations Australia enjoys bilaterally, regionally and collectively with the countries of South-East Asia. A key achievement was the launch of the negotiations to establish an ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement. But the leaders also issued a declaration highlighting cooperation between Australia, New Zealand and ASEAN in areas like counter-terrorism; combating transnational crime; looking at ways of building the economies of the region, or at least the less developed economies of the region; and addressing some of the key social and health issues of the region such as SARS, avian flu and HIV-AIDS. This was an enormously important event and it does demonstrate a couple of points that I think really need to be understood. Firstly, Australia's engagement with Asia is something that is continuing to grow year by year and very successfully. Secondly, we have been able to do that and maintain a very strong alliance relationship with the United States of America. By being able to do both-not just one, but both-of those things, we have been able to enhance the security and the economic interests of Australia to an extent that we never could have done if we had pursued any alternative proposal. I note that at the end of the summit the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr Abdullah Badawi, publicly indicated, as the host of the next summit to take place in Kuala Lumpur, that he would welcome Australia's and New Zealand's participation. The Prime Minister has made it clear that such an invitation would be warmly accepted by Australia. We look forward to continuing to build that engagement with Asia. The last 24 hours have been an historic 24 hours in the history of Australian diplomacy. When that history is written there will be a footnote, and that footnote will be that on the very day of these the historic developments the Australian Labor Party moved a matter of public importance condemning Australia for its relations with Asia. That is the footnote that will be the Australian Labor Party. Government members-Shame, shame! Regional Services: Program Funding",77
60,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. I refer him to his answer yesterday when he said that he had approved a $1.2 million grant to Primary Energy Pty Ltd under the SONA guidelines. Now that these guidelines have been publicly released for the first time, can the minister inform the House how an ethanol project in Gunnedah was assessed as a project of high national significance and whether the department's national office recommended in favour of this project, as per the SONA guidelines? Will the minister now table the departmental advice?",77
61,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to Regional Partnerships and the SONA projects. The strategic element of Regional Partnerships is used to fund projects of high national significance that may fall outside the administrative constraints of Regional Partnerships. It is important to stress that these projects are assessed in the normal way, including being consistent with the purpose of Regional Partnerships and the program assessment criteria of clear outcomes, benefit to the community, partnerships and sustainability. All projects funded under this arrangement are placed on the public record on my department's web site. This process is totally transparent. So far, 12 projects, all of which are very worthwhile projects, have been funded under these arrangements.",77
62,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Which electorates?,78
63,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hear the interjection, ‘Which electorates?' There is a very important project called Beef Australia in the electorate of Capricornia. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question was about one project, the project in Gunnedah. Surely it makes a mockery of the House for the minister to read out a prepared answer irrespective of the question that has been asked. He would have read this answer out no matter what question had been asked.",78
64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is in order.,78
65,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition asked about the SONA projects, and I am pleased to inform the House about some of the projects. One of them is Beef Australia 2006 in the electorate of Capricornia. Under the SONA guidelines, $2.2 million was approved for this project. There was another project approved under the SONA guidelines, and that was in the electorate of Lingiari. The Christmas Island mobile upgrade project was for some $2.5 million, and again it was approved under the SONA guidelines. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. This was a very specific question about the Gunnedah project following on from questions yesterday.",78
66,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is in order.,78
67,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, under Regional Partnerships there are some very important projects in the national interest, such as the ethanol project in the Namoi Valley and the Christmas Island mobile upgrade project at some $2.5 million. The opposition seems to think there is something untoward about the Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation guidelines. There is nothing untoward about this. These are important programs. I am happy to table documents in relation to this. I am happy to table the minutes of the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package subcommittee meeting which approved the funding of the ethanol project. I am also happy to table a letter from Kevin Humphries, chairman of the Namoi Valley Area Consultative Committee, to former minister Wilson Tuckey, which again highly recommended the project. I am also able to table the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package project assessment and the procedures for the Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation, SONA, guidelines. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question actually asks for the tabling of the departmental advice on the ethanol project at Gunnedah. Will the minister table that, as per the question that was asked?",78
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has answered the question. Howard Government: Trade Policy,78
69,Mr RICHARDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister inform the House of the government's Asia trade strategy? How will this strategy deliver dividends for the Australian economy?,78
70,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for, I think, his maiden question, and again congratulate him on his outstanding victory in winning for the government the seat of Kingston in South Australia. The answer to the question is that it is all about jobs. The announcement overnight that ASEAN has agreed to begin negotiating an FTA with Australia and New Zealand is another clear illustration that we are achieving results from our comprehensive trade strategy, particularly with Asia. This includes only our objective of negotiating the FTA with ASEAN but also the free trade agreement that is now in force with Singapore, the free trade agreement with Thailand, the scoping studies with China and Malaysia, a trade and economic framework agreement with our major trading partner, Japan, and ongoing trade facilitation through APEC. This, of course, is all underpinned by our efforts in the multilateral system to achieve a successful outcome in the global trade round. There is a strong political commitment in East Asia to continue the ongoing economic engagement with Australia. If you want a clear demonstration of this, you should look no further than the invitation that was extended overnight to the Prime Minister to attend next year's meeting of ASEAN leaders at the summit in Kuala Lumpur. We are doing all we can to find new and improved opportunities to rapidly and substantially expand our trade and investment opportunities with our Asian neighbours. This strategy is working and it is delivering dividends to the Australian economy and creating jobs in the Australian economy. Since 1996, under the stewardship of our government, 1.4 million jobs have been created in the Australian economy. One in five jobs in the Australian economy rely on exports, so it could be argued that since we came to office in 1996 280,000 jobs related to export have been created. So the answer to the question is ongoing and deeper economic integration. Our Asian trade strategy is working and delivering jobs in the Australian economy. Economy: Growth",79
71,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer and relates to today's growth figure in the national accounts of 0.3 per cent, the worse quarterly figure in almost four years. Treasurer, in light of the not growth figure revealed today does the government still stand by the growth forecasts on which its $66 billion of election promises were based? Does the government still guarantee it will run budget surpluses across the forward estimates as well as deliver its election promises?",79
72,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the second part of the question is yes. In relation to growth forecasts, the government has laid down a procedure, which we have followed since the Charter of Budget Honesty was enacted, which provides that the government brings down a May budget and a midyear fiscal and economic outlook. The government updates its forecasts from the budget in the midyear economic and fiscal outlook, which it will do this year, as it has done for the last nine years. I can assure the House of this, though: this government, having taken the budget out of deep deficit-where the Labor Party had put it-after having inherited a $10 billion deficit and $96 billion of Commonwealth debt, having driven the budget into surplus and having kept it there for seven surpluses, is not going to go back to deficit. We are not going to go back to Labor Party economic policy; not for a moment would we go back to Labor Party economic policy. Let me make one last point about economic credibility. Economic credibility does not come from signing pieces of cardboard. During the election campaign the Leader of the Opposition did work on his economic credibility. He went down to Melbourne, he pulled out a big piece of cardboard and he signed it. He said, ‘There it is. I am now credible.' The people of Australia expect a little bit more than that. They expect consistent economic policy. That is what this government has given them over the last 8½ years. It has made Australia one of the leaders amongst the developed economies of the world and this government will ensure that the reform program continues so Australia can stay there.",79
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable the current member for Bass. Unfair Dismissal,80
74,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you for identifying that there has been a change in the wind. My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of the benefits to the economy from exempting small businesses from unfair dismissal laws? Are there any alternative policies? Mr Albanese-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. You indicated when you became the Speaker that you would rule out any part of a question which asked for alternative policies in the fashion which that question did.",80
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. I think if member for Grayndler checks the Hansard he will find that I did not say that. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order regarding the responsibilities of ministers. Questions have to go to their ministerial responsibilities. How can a minister be responsible for someone else's alternative policies? That is the basis on which previous Speakers",80
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The question is in order because it does not talk about any particular alternative. It merely asks for other policies. Mr Latham-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. How can the minister be responsible for someone else's policies? Isn't the minister here to give accounts to the House about his policies and government policies, not someone else's?",80
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I have ruled on the point of order.,80
78,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a delight to answer the question from the current member for Bass in the presence of a former distinguished member for Bass in this chamber. As both of those gentlemen will know, this government is about creating more jobs for more Australians. That is why in the last 8½ years we have got 1.4 million extra jobs in this country. One of the things that small business operators all over Australia-including those from the Bass electorate, which I visited earlier this year-tell me about is the costs and the burden of the unfair dismissals regime. On Monday we had some more examples of that in the Daily Telegraph. James Hill, an electrician from Penrith in the member for Lindsay's electorate, is quoted as saying: It's a ridiculous law. An employee can do whatever he likes, and we can't do anything back. the Peter Adijans, an electrical contractor from Camden in the member for Macarthur's electorate, said: It gets to the point where you think, ‘If it goes to unfair dismissal, I'll wear it' because it ruins the company otherwise. That is the situation. That is what small business operators around Australia are saying about the unfair dismissal system. The restaurant and catering industry has estimated that it costs on average $3,600 and around 63 hours of management time to defend an unfair dismissal claim. That is time and money that small businesses can ill afford. No wonder the Melbourne Institute, in their 2002 study, found that the unfair dismissal laws in this country are costing some 77,000 jobs. That is why tomorrow the government will reintroduce its fair dismissal reform bill. This bill will exempt employers of fewer than 20 people from unfair dismissal provisions in the Workplace Relations Act. This is a bill which on repeated occasions the Australian Labor Party has stood in the way ofhas stood in the way of creating more jobs for more Australians. At least someone associated with the Labor Party can see that this is a ridiculous proposition from the ALP. Just last week, writing in the Australian, former Labor minister Barry Cohen said in an article which I would commend to members opposite: It is difficult to know where to start when listing the grievances small business has about the Labor Party. But top of the list would have to be Labor's refusal to support the repeal of the unfair dismissal legislation. This is from a former Labor minister, someone who is actually involved now in running a business and knows, like we know, that this costs jobs for tens of thousands of Australians. The Labor Party's industrial relations spokesman, Mr Smith, the member for Perth, has been saying that he is going to be much more labour friendly and business friendly. Here is a test for the Labor Party: if they are much more business friendly then they will get out of the way of this legislation and allow it through so that we can create more jobs for more Australians. Either that or the words of the member for Brand which he uttered in 2000 remain true. Let me remind the House what the member for Brand said in July 2000: We have never pretended to be a small business party, the Labor Party. We have never pretended that. The choice is there now. Support this legislation and show you have changed your mind. Economy: Foreign Debt",80
79,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of comments from credit rating agency Standard and Poor's, saying Australia's foreign debt posed a big risk to international investors and that they were rattled? When will the Treasurer admit that the nation's record $406 billion foreign debt and $13.7 billion current account deficit are harming our economy and exposing Australia to significant international risk?",81
80,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The IMF recently did a report on Australia where it commended Australia's economic policy and called it one of the standout economies of the world. The OECD last night released its report, again commending Australian economic management and calling it amongst the best in the world. At the meeting of the G20 in Berlin last weekend, there was a lot of discussion about the lessons that Australia has learnt and how other economies might be able, in some respects, to get guidance from them. To have an economy which has grown at a clip of above three per cent through the Asian financial crisis, the US recession, SARS, record oil prices and the worse drought in 100 years, and to have unemployment at 27year lows, says something. Mr Swan interjecting",81
81,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been asked about credit ratings. There is one big difference today from the situation in the 1980s: in the 1980s, when the Labor Party was in office, not only Standard and Poor's but also Moody's downgraded Australia's credit rating not once but twice. It was not until this government was elected that Australia was able to have its credit rating upgraded and to rejoin the international developed economies in having a AAA rating in relation to foreign currency borrowings. So the one thing that can be said unconditionally about the view of Standard and Poor's is that its credit rating in relation to the Australian economy is much more positive now than it was in the 1980s. Having said that, does that mean that Australia can rest on its laurels and not continue economic reform? No. Australia has to continue the economic reform. Just as balancing our budget strengthened us against the Asian financial crisis, reforming industrial relations will give us the productivity lift of tomorrow. This is why we have to go further. The one thing that I would say to the opposition echoes the statement that has just been made by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations: an opposition that was legitimately concerned about improving Australia's economic potential would be an opposition that was passing the government's legislation in the Senate, not opposing it. As I said earlier, the test for the opposition how many pieces of cardboard or how many declarations there are; the test for the member for Lilley is: can he change his party's position on fair dismissals and industrial relations-because until that time the Labor Party will not have credibility on the economy and, what is more, the Labor Party will not deserve credibility on the economy. Health and Ageing: Policy",81
82,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister outline to the House how the government is ensuring that our health system remains affordable and accessible to all Australians? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?,82
83,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonner for including me in this historic occasion, the first question ever asked in this House by a member for Bonner. The Howard government has made the investment necessary to keep Medicare strong and sustainable. Since 1996, health spending has increased from under 15 per cent to over 20 per cent of the federal budget, and federal health spending has increased from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent of Australia's GDP. It is a record of solid performance and steady achievement. The Leader of the Opposition said that the election should be a referendum on Medicare. The Australian people have obviously concluded that there will be no fool's gold from the Howard government. As recently as yesterday, in this parliament, the member for Lalor tried to justify the so-called Medicare Gold policy, saying that it would save some $500 million to $600 million a year. If Medicare Gold is so good, why did Barry Jones say it was an absolute turkey and why did Peter Botsman say that it was a cross between a donkey and a wombat? If it is so is not good, why was the member for Lalor herself in two minds about it just a week ago? I would like to quote just one section of the member for Lalor's notorious press conference of Friday a week back: REPORTER: Well, can't we get a yes or no answer on this, Julia? I mean, it's a very simple question. Is Labor still committed to free health care for over seventy fives, yes or no? GILLARD: No. Labor is saying. No. We are not ... REPORTER: Well, I mean ... no, I'm sorry, but I mean, it's a simple question. GILLARD: All right, well. REPORTER: Yes or no. GILLARD: Yeah, but it ... well, it's ... you can but you're putting me in a position which is justand then she trails off. I can help the member for Lalor: her position is absolutely impossible, because it is impossible to support something in principle which simply cannot be delivered in practice. There were 27 pages of equivocation from the member for Lalor. I never really thought the member for Lalor was a religious person, but she resembles noone so much as the Vicar of Bray, who could not say yes and could not say nay. Because her press conference deserves close study, I table the transcript. Economy: Performance",82
84,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it the case that today's national accounts show that Australia's export performance of 29 trade deficits in a row is now harming our nation's growth? Will the Treasurer tell the House what the government is doing to improve Australia's poor export performance, rather than just blaming the dollar?",83
85,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the question is: what is the government doing to improve Australia's trade performance? The insinuation is that the government is not doing enough to improve Australia's trade performance. Mr Crean interjecting,83
86,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The sound effects man said on cue, ‘That's right.' Every now and then you get a ‘Kylie'. The question asks what the government is doing to improve Australia's trade prospects-on the day that Australia has entered, for the first time in its history, into negotiations for a free trade agreement with the ASEAN region. On the very day that the government has entered into negotiations for an agreement for a free trade zone in ASEAN, the implication is that the government is not doing anything to imput it like that, prove our trade prospects! As well as the ASEAN free trade agreement, this is the government which negotiated the US free trade agreement. This is the government which negotiated the Thai free trade agreement. This is the government which negotiated the Singapore free trade agreement. And this is the opposition which opposed very large parts of the US free trade agreement. So, if Australia's exporters want to know what this government is doing, let me tell you. This government has the most ambitious trade agenda that any Australian government has ever had. This government has more positive returns on that trade agenda than any other Australian government has had. What is more, none of that could have been done-and none of that was done-by the Labor Party. Education: Funding",83
87,Ms PANOPOULOS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister inform the House how the government is providing for Australian schools over the next four years? Is the minister aware of any other policies which threaten funding to Catholic and independent schools? Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This bill is being debated in the House today.",83
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition raises the point about the bill. It is correct that the answer cannot allude to the bill, but it can allude to the subject. I am sure the minister will be mindful of that. Ms Macklin-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: the problem is that this bill is about the complete funding of schools, government and non-government. That is what it is about.",83
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have ruled on the point of order, and I will listen carefully to the minister's answer. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: can we clarify that you have made a ruling that the minister can refer to the subject of the bill but not the bill? If that is ruling",84
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The ruling is that the minister can refer to the subject of the question, not to the bill.",84
91,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Indi for her question and for her very strong support for choice in education. This government believes very strongly that Australian parents should be able to choose the school that they think is the best school for their child, whether that is a government school, a Catholic school or an independent school. I say to Australian parents that, if you do choose to send your child to a Catholic or independent school, if that school draws from very poor families you will get 70c in the dollar to support the education of your child. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The bill is all about the funding of schools.",84
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is in order.,84
93,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Since this government has been in office it has been, and as long as this government remains in office it will remain, very strongly committed to the principle that if Australian parents who have worked hard and paid their state and federal taxes choose not to send their child not to a government school but to instead send their child to a Catholic or independent school they will be supported by this government. Those children will receive financial assistance to support their education. In all cases they will receive less money than if they were in a public school, but they will be supported.",84
94,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister is placing you in an impossible position. He is speaking directly on the subject matter of the legislation. The point you make really does create a distincyour tion about a difference, but I would submit to you that the anticipation rule is in the standing orders so that exactly this kind of abuse of question time cannot happen.",84
95,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The relevant part of the House of Representatives Practice says to avoid anticipation of discussion of orders of the day. I am listening carefully to the minister, and he is in order. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under the new standing orders, standing order 100 specifically refers to questions not anticipating discussion, which is why you had such difficulty ruling on the answer. The standing order relates to the question, which was clearly and unequivocally out of order. You have made your interpretation-on what basis I am not quite sure-that the question was in order but you are going to rule on the answer, which the standing order does not refer to. The minister has not said one word that would have been out of order in debate on the bill.",84
96,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr MCMullan-With respect, Mr Speaker, the standing orders also require you to hear my point of order.",84
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have made your point of order clear, and I will rule on it. The standing orders make it very clear that the Speaker can rule before the member has completed their point. Mr MCMullan-No standing order says that.",84
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is in the House of Representatives Practice. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Fraser, along with other members, has been elected here to have his say and he is raising a point of order. You have not been able to cite a standing order which gives you the authority to cut him off mid-stream, and the member should be heard.",85
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have made it quite clear that I have been quoting the House of Representatives Practice. In fact, I have been quoting former Speaker MCLeay.",85
100,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am asked about alternative policies. It is very well known that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to parents who send their children to non-government schools. I noticed yesterday a release from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is also the subject bate because it is part of our second reading amendment, which we are in the middle of debating.",85
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has at no stage mentioned the bill.,85
102,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I got a media release yesterday from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is Labor's education spokesperson, which is entitled ‘Caucus endorses Labor's education policies'. So the caucus at a meeting endorsed Labor's education policies.",85
103,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on anticipation of debate. There have been several rulings on anticipation of debate, and they tend to permit the discussion of a bill in very limited circumstances. Previous Speakers have ruled that provision so tightly that, whilst it is possible to talk about a bill, it has to be within the context of the process of the bill-in other words, questions on when the bill might come on, when the government might bring back the bill or whether the government intends further amendment to the bill. Wideranging debate on the basic subject matter of the bill is not permitted, and that is what has occurred here.",85
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point of order relates to whether or not it is anticipation of discussion, and I have ruled the minister in order. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to standing orders 77 and 100, which both refer to anticipation, and standing order 104, which says that ‘an answer must be relevant to the question'. The minister cannot possibly answer the question without anticipating the debate, so he has to breach standing order 104, 77 or 100.",85
105,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to standof de- ing order 86(a), which says: A Member may raise a point of order with the Speaker at any time. After the question of order has been stated to the Speaker by the Member rising to the question of order, consideration and decision of every other question shall be suspended until the matter is disposed of by the Speaker giving a ruling thereon. The standing order is in plain English. The history of it is that members are entitled to state the question before you rule. You have twice cut them down.",85
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have raised the point of order.,85
107,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have, and I seek a ruling on the words ‘after the question of order has been stated to the Speaker'. What is your interpretation of that?",85
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the member for Banks is taking a point of order on the point of order, but I will rule again that the minister is in order. Mr Albanese-With respect, Mr Speaker, you have not indicated how standing order 104 can be maintained and an answer be given that is relevant without breaching the anticipation rule.",85
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have ruled on the basis of House of Representatives Practice. The minister is in order. I call the Minister for Education, Science and Training.",86
110,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So we have a release from the Labor Party that says that caucus endorses Labor's education policies-which of course would be well known to the Australian community as meaning that, in the first instance, 160,000 Australian children in nongovernment schools would have their funding cut under a Labor Party government and that over a six-year period all nongovernment schools would join that list. I read the Courier-Mail this morning, and on page 2 I read: A Caucus spokeswoman denied the decision meant Labor would again take a hit list of private schools to the next election. I thought, ‘Hang on; they had a hit list of schools whose funding they were going to cut, and they have endorsed their policy, but they are not going to take the hit list to the next election.' I read on: But she admitted “there will be redistribution”Mrs Irwin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Mr Downer interjectingMrs Irwin-Just you wait, Alexander. Watch this space!",86
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member will either make a point of order or resume her seat. Mrs Irwin-I am sorry, Mr Speaker. Standing order 100 reads: (f) Questions must not anticipate discussion on an order of the day or other matter. I ask you to bring the minister to order.",86
112,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is entirely in order.,86
113,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Apparently the Labor Party's caucus problem was not that they were going to cut the funding to parents who send their children to non-government schools, not the fact that the leadership was frothing at the mouth trying to punish parents; the problem was that they had put it in a list. So apparently the Labor Party now take their policy and confirm the policythey will punish parents for sending their kids to non-government schools-but they remove the list. So the policy is the same. They redistribute; they cut funding from parents who send their kids to non-government schools, but apparently they are not going to put it in a list. I table the list for the benefit of the House. The Labor Party obviously continue a policy of punishment in relation to Australians. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Obviously, there has been a series of issues about the minister's answer but I will raise the last of them with you, which is that you ruled-controversially, from the point of view of the opposition-that you would not allow public documents to be tabled during question time. It happened with the Minister for Health and Ageing in his answer. There was some question in my mind about whether or not that was a public document, so I let it go. But there is no basis on which a political party statement released during the election campaign is not a public document. The minister cannot flout the standing orders each and every time.",86
114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member will resume her seat. We are not here to debate this. The ruling was about tabling after a question had been answered; it had no reference to a minister tabling during an answer. I suggest you refer back to the Hansard. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, on another point of order: can I ask whether the intent",86
115,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I suggest that if the member for Lalor has a question to the Speaker she leave it until after question time. Ms Gillard-No, I have a point of order about your ruling, Mr Speaker. You have ruled about the tabling of documents after a question was answered",87
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have ruled on that point. Ms Gillard-The minister just answered a question and tabled the document at the end of the answer.,87
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member will resume her seat, and I will rule. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, are you saying that your ruling does not apply to government ministers but applies to every other member of the House?",87
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member will resume her seat! I have answered that question, and if you read the ruling you will see that it is very clear: if a minister tables as part of his answer, then he is in order. NA",87
119,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I move: That the Speaker's ruling be dissented from. Mr Speaker, we are now faced with the grand absurdity, courtesy of your ruling, that you are maintaining the ability to make rulings which impact on one side of the House but not on the other. Your job, as outlined in the standing orders and as breached by this ruling-and why this ruling is inappropriate and must be dissented from-is to treat every member of the House equally and with respect and to allow them to do their jobs as members of the House of Representatives. Certainly, some members are members of the government, and some members are members of the opposition. Certainly, some people are ministers, and some people are not. But each of us here has an equal standing in representing our constituency, and it is not appropriate to have rulings that differentially impact upon the opposition. Mr Speaker, your ruling, as I understand it, is basically this: if at any time a government minister, in the course of question time, wants to table any document that they think supports the government's case, they are free and at liberty to do so; they can do it at any time. The Minister for Health and Ageing did it today. It was not a document that we had sighted, and he tabled it. No leave was sought or required; you just allowed it to be tabled. The minister for education, in the grandest of absurdities, has just tabled part of a very public document-that is, the opposition's education policy at the last election. Your ruling then was that you were going to prevent the tabling of documents at the end of answers-unless it was done by a government minister. That must have been the import of your ruling, because you allowed the minister for education to table a document at the end of an answer but indicated you would not allow documents to be tabled at the end of answers generally. So what you are saying, Mr Speaker, is that you would rule that a government minister, at any time-during an answer, at the end of an answer, at any time they want-can table a document. But if a member of the opposition seeks leave to have a public document tabled, you will ensure that that does not occur. So we have a complete double standard between what is expected of the government and what is expected of the opposition. It is a complete double standard. Mr Speaker, when you commenced as Speaker in this parliament-and it was only several short sitting days ago, and I think it is a tragedy that we are at this place alreadyyou said that you wanted to lift standards in this place. I will take you to the things you said on the first day that you became Speaker. You said there was a new set of standing orders, and of course there is. You went on to say how you were going to help this House. You said you were going to apply these new standing orders and you thought they would be of assistance to the House. Then you went on to say the following about the attitude that you would bring as Speaker. I quote: Today I will restate some points on questions and the importance of addressing all comments through the chair. The purpose of questions is to seek information and to hold the executive to account. Precisely, Mr Speaker. That is the purpose of question time. You went on: For example, questions should not suggest their own answer or contain scorn or derision. I would remind members that lengthy questions not only encourage long answers but make it much more difficult for the Speaker to rule on relevance. And I take you to the following line, Mr Speaker, because I think it is very important to the matters that have been under consideration in this House today: Questions will alternate and, in line with my immediate predecessors, I will not be allowing supplementary questions. I also do not feel it is propriate that leave should be sought for the tabling of documents already available publicly. Mr Speaker, in the extract I have before me, from the House of Representatives Hansard on 17 November, at the time that you commenced as Speaker, you outlined to this House a series of rules about how you thought it should operate. From the point of view of the opposition, we were not happy with some of the rules you decided to outline. For example, we on this side have a view about supplementary questions; we on this side have a view about our questions being ruled out because they are lengthy; and we have got a view about our questions being ruled out because they might contain colourful language. All of those things were outlined as the view that you were going to bring to question time. They are matters that you raised about the standard you were setting; and in that standard, without qualification, you said-as I have read: I also do not feel it is appropriate that leave should be sought for the tabling of documents already available publicly. Accordingly, requests for leave will not be put to the House where a document is already on the public record-for example, a newspaper report or a Hansard extract. Those are the standards you set for yourself.",87
120,Mr TUCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,He's stuck by them!,88
121,Unknown,DISSENT FROM RULING,Honourable members interjecting,88
122,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Order! Members will allow the member for Lalor to be heard.,88
123,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, if you would like me to resume my seat while you deal with the member for O'Connor, I will.",88
124,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The member for Lalor has the call.,88
125,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING,"In terms of the obligations in this place, there are really only two obligations that matter. One is the impartiality of the Speaker and the other is the consisap- tency and perceived consistency of rulings. If we cannot have rulings that apply equally to every member of this House, then the House will always be in a state of disorder. It is inevitable if the perception, as opposition members walk in here every day, is that the standing orders mean nothing, that the obligation for impartiality will be waived and that opposition members will be treated differently from members on the other side of the House. The tragic effect of your ruling, Mr Speaker, is to put us in precisely that position. There is only one honourable course here. You either rule and it applies to everyone or the ruling is withdrawn. We needed to move a dissent motion to make that point. You cannot rule in a way which means that government ministers get to do what they like when they like and the ability of a member of the opposition to seek leave for the tabling of a document is curtailed. That cannot be in accordance with your obligation for impartiality, and it is not even in accordance with what you said on your very first day. It does not give the opposition any joy to be moving dissent motions during question time. That is not something we want to do. We want to be here holding the executive government to account, and that is the purpose of question time. But today we have seen, not only in relation to this matter but relation to the answer of the minister for education more generally, an unsustainable practice about the way in which the standing orders are not being applied. The minister's question was inevitably in anticipation of debate. If the minister wants to come in here and make a contribution on education funding, as a minister in the government he has got many opportunities to do so. We all know that. His key opportunity is, of course, when he brings a bill to this parliament, and he has brought a bill to this parliament-a bill about some $30 billion of school funding. If he wants to make a contribution on what he believes are fair funding patterns, then he can make that contribution on the bill. But we were in the middle of a debate. It was the debate that was adjourned to allow question time to be brought on. We ended up with the absurdity where apparently the minister can say whatever he likes about school funding and it will not be held to be in anticipation when the bill that has been adjourned is a $30-odd billion school funding bill. That was the first and incredible lapse the application of the standing orders. Mr Speaker, I know this would give you no joy, but you would have to say that it was raised with you by way of points of order on more than one occasion by a number of opposition members-by the member for Fraser, the member for Denison, the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Brand and the Leader of the Opposition-and you did nothing to correct it: a clear breach of the standing orders. Alsoand I have raised this matter with you, Mr Speaker-we had difficulties yesterday in relation to a clear breach of the standing orders about whether or not a document from which a minister is reading is confidential. It was another clear breach of the standing orders. If you go back to the relevant Hansard, it is crystal clear that that is a clear breach of in the standing orders. Then there is the immediate ruling with which we are dealing, which on this occasion is another example of not only a problem with the standing orders but also your actually ruling in a way which would have a differential impact on members of this House. Mr Speaker, this ruling cannot stand. I would be saying to government members opposite-and I am sure the Leader of the House will be responding to this dissent motion-that they need to be considering the obligations they have as parliamentarians to ensure that there is fair practice in this House. Mr Speaker, I put to you what is clearly the case with the way in which this House runs: this House runs well when people believe that they are going to get a fair go; it runs badly when people believe they are not going to get a fair go. Mr Speaker, in my many discussions with you or the discussions we have had since you have taken this office, I have indicated that from the opposition's point of view we do not want to cause problems in the House of Representatives, of we want to see the House run, but we do insist on getting a fair go. From a number of incidents in the last few sitting days and most spectacularly from today, it has become apparent that in question time we are not getting a fair go. Your ruling today is the clearest example of that and that is why it needs to be dissented from. Mr Speaker, I take you to page 163 of House of Representatives Practice. I think really this is where this debate starts and finishes. It says: One of the hallmarks of good Speakership is the requirement for a high degree of impartiality in the execution of the duties of the office. This important characteristic of office has been oped over the last two centuries to a point where in the House of Commons the Speaker abandons all party loyalties and is required to be impartial on all party issues both inside and outside the House. Mr Speaker, you would recall that that is a standard that the Labor Party has urged for Australia-that we have that degree of impartiality in our speakership. To go on with House of Representatives Practice, it says: In concert with this requirement the principle has been well established that the Speaker continues in office until ceasing to be a Member of the House. It continues: Confidence in the impartiality of the Speaker is an indispensable condition of the successful working of procedure, and many conventions exist which have as their object not only to ensure the impartiality of the Speaker but also to ensure that his impartiality is generally recognized. So we have here what in law we would refer to as not only the absence of actual bias but also the absence of apparent bias. It is important that each member of this House has faith that the Speaker is acting impartially.",88
126,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I do not want to interrupt, but I would remind the honourable member that this is a motion for dissent from a ruling.",90
127,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I am dissenting from a ruling that I believe does not meet the standard of impartiality. That is the essence of the case I am putting. I apologise, Mr Speaker, if there is some offence to you in that remark, but I do not have an alternative when faced with a ruling that differentially impacts on members of the opposition and that is not in keeping with the traditions of impartiality of the speakership of the House of Representatives. That is why I have dissented from this ruling and why this ruling cannot be allowed to stand-because it does devel- not meet that benchmark of impartiality. We all know that this place is designed basically so that the minority get to have a say and the government wins. That is the way this place is designed. That is the essence of the way in which our system of government works. The government has the numbers and it gets its way at the end of the day. The only protection that members of the opposition, members of the minor party and, indeed, the Independents who sit in this House have to ensure we get our say in the face of a majority government and, I may I say, in the face of a very cocky recently re-elected government, an arrogant government",90
128,Mr TUCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. You have already drawn the member's attention to the fact that they are conducting a dissent motion-not a censure motion, which was their right.",90
129,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The member is in order.,90
130,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying, the only protection that members of the minority political party or, indeed, the Independents who sit in this House have is the fair application of the standing orders. That very difficult task falls to you, Mr Speaker, and we understand it is a difficult task. This is not a place for the fragile; there is no doubt about that. It is a cult task but it becomes a moreAn opposition member-Look out! Here comes Mr Tuckey!",90
131,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Order! The member for Lalor has the call.,91
132,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was momentarily concerned for your well-being. I was silenced by my concern for your well-being, but I am now assured that you are physically safe in this place and I will continue, because whilst we have disagreed with your ruling, Mr Speaker, there are of course many things we would not see happen to you in this place. I think we are safe from them now. The way in which standing orders are applied and rulings are made needs to be impartial, as between members in this place. Government ministers table documents; that happens, absolutely. The opposition seeks leave to table documents. We cannot have a circumstance where government ministers can do that as and when they see fit, for whatever document they want to table, without any of your rulings applying to that, when on this side you basically embargo our ability to even get leave to table documents. On that point, I say that this ruling fails to give due deference to the House overall as being master of its own destiny on what ought or ought not be tabled. Mr Speaker, the ruling you have made is one that impacts on us but not on them. It is an unfair ruling-a ruling from which we dissent; a ruling that we do not believe should be allowed to stand; a ruling that we do not believe is in the tradition of this place as it should be, with the maximum amount of fairness distributed between members of this House, allowing each of them an equal standing-understanding, of course, that at the end of the day the majority political party or parties will be able to win the votes and diffiultimately get what they want. I conclude, Mr Speaker, by reminding you of the words you said, when you first started in the job, on the thing that you wanted to achieve in your speakership. I take you to your very own words: ... I remind members that it is my intention as Speaker to facilitate the smooth conduct of the business of the House. In my view, the general behaviour of members, and the subsequent public perception of the House, is in the hands of members themselves. It is also, Mr Speaker, in your hands and rests on the impartiality of rulings made.",91
133,Mr ALBANESE,DISSENT FROM RULING," Mr Speaker, I second the motion. It is with some regret that the opposition is moving dissent from your ruling just two weeks into your speakership. You would recall that the Leader of the Opposition and a number of other members on this side of the House welcomed your election. I personally wrote to you. I am aware that a number of other members did also. The Leader of the Opposition and I shared a common interest with you, in that you had been a successful chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, of which the Leader of the Opposition and I were long standing members. So when you were successful in the process in your party room we had some hope that you would conduct yourself as you did as chair of that committee-in an impartial way, in a way which facilitated discussion and debate, and in a way which brought respect, not just of the members of the committee and of those people appearing before the committee but of the general public. Mr Speaker, we are very disappointed. We have been patient. A number of my colleagues think we have been too patient and have suggested to the Manager of Opposition Business and me that we have been too patient and too kind. There are a number of issues which we have taken up with you in private in order to give an opportunity for the impartiality provision on which your position depends to be carried out. But each day we have had a new issue in which the government has been treated differently from the opposition. You will recall that many people were surprised by your elevation to the speakership. There were two other candidates for that position who were seen to be the favourites, and there was a great deal of relief when you defeated the member for Mackellar in the final ballot. But now it becomes clear that, unlike the way in which you conducted yourself as chair of the House of Representatives standing committee, you have conducted yourself in a way which we believe breaches the impartiality which is the foundation of your position. That is why we are moving dissent here today, and that is what this dissent is about. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I raise it reluctantly, as I can ciate that members opposite are not feeling very good, but the fact is that this is a motion of dissent in your ruling; it is not a motion of censure. The kind of comments that the member for Grayndler is making now are not appropriate in a motion of dissent. He should confine himself strictly to the ruling you gave. Reflections on your character, partiality or otherwise are completely out of order.",91
134,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I call the honourable member for Grayndler, and I draw his attention to the motion.",92
135,Mr ALBANESE,DISSENT FROM RULING,"This motion is a dissent from your ruling, and the reason for it is that we assert it is not an impartial ruling. That is why we are moving dissent. To go to the specifics of the issue, we believe that there is an inconsistency there. You made a ruling on 17 November and stated the following: I also do not feel it is appropriate that leave should be sought for the tabling of documents already available publicly. Accordingly, requests for leave will not be put to the House where a document is already on the public record-for example, a newspaper report... Today in your ruling you suggested that it was inappropriate for a government minister, after they had concluded their answer, to table a document. That is exactly what occurred. The document that was tabled by the minister for education-who is a serial offender in creating problems for chairs, I might say, so there is some sympathy with your position-was the ALP election policy, which was available, released publicly and reported upon. The purpose of standing order 63, which discusses leave to speak, is to give the power over what occurs in this House to the members of this House. But your ruling creates two situations: one where the government can table whatever it likes and another where the opposition cannot even seek appreleave to assist debate to table a document. Mr Crean-Untenable.",92
136,Mr ALBANESE,DISSENT FROM RULING,"It is an untenable situation and we have raised it with you privately and now we raise it in this dissent motion. It follows, of course, other concerns that we had over the anticipation debate and your ruling there. Standing orders 77 and 100, when viewed together, clearly state that questions cannot anticipate debate before the House. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order. This dissent is on your ruling in respect of tabling documents; it is not on your ruling in respect of the anticipation debate. Because of the very strict rules governing debates of this type, the member for Grayndler's comments about other rulings are simply out of place and out of order.",92
137,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The member for Grayndler will confine his remarks to the motion.,93
138,Mr ALBANESE,DISSENT FROM RULING,"This dissent motion arose from a question asked of the minister for education. It arose after a series of points of order raised by the opposition about the anticipation debate-about the any-otherpolicies rule, which is a breach of standing order 98C; about standing order 104, which states that answers must be relevant to the question; and about standing order 86, raised by the member for Banks, about whether a member has a right to put a point of order to you in full before you rule on that point of order and sit them down. It arose in that context of point of order after point of orderstanding orders 77, 100, 86, 98-most of them were mentioned during the time in which the minister for education was responding to that question. Yet not once in any of your dismissals of the points of order raised on this side did you quote a single standing order-not once, Mr Speaker. It is not good enough to say, ‘It's the It is not good enough, and that is why we are moving dissent here. We stand up and move points of order, quoting standing orders, and the response that we get is, ‘Oh, it's just the vibe, sit down,' before we have even had an opportunity to put the reason why the point of order is being moved. You, Mr Speaker, are very clearly aware of the goodwill that has been shown on this side. I spoke before about how there had been some people on this side of the House who were critical of the Manager of Opposition Business in the House and me for being too gentle and too conciliatory-‘why did you allow that to occur?' The truth is that we came into this parliament trying to lift standards. That is why we once again raised the whole issue of electing an independent Speaker, so that we could avoid this situation of a partial debate. But we have had issue after issue raised. Yesterday, regarding the tabling of documents, the Leader of the Opposition asked the minister for education-the serial offender-to table a letter that he had read into Hansard from Yvonne Meyer. It was quite clearly a public document. That was the basis upon which the minister himself said that he had appointed Yvonne Meyer to a publicly funded committee. Yet you rule that it was a private document. You cannot have it both ways. And as to the serial offender, the minister for education, there was a reason why we wanted it tabled: the last time he quoted from a letter, purporting to be from a lady from Green Valley to the member for Werriwa, it was a fabrication. It was a fiction.",93
139,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Order! I would remind the member that this is a dissent motion about the Speaker, not about a minister.",93
140,Mr ALBANESE,DISSENT FROM RULING,"It is indeed, and it goes to the point of why the tabling of documents is important. It goes to the heart vibe.' of the matter and why the opposition has a right to seek understanding order 63 the tabling of documents both by us and also by the government. It goes to the issue of impartiality. Mr Speaker, I suggest to you that you should reflect on your ruling and reflect on your past practice of being a good chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, one who had the respect of both sides of the House, witnesses and the public, and give that level of respect to the speakership of the House of Representatives. As you said when you were elected to that high office, it is a great honour. We respect the position. And, frankly, Mr Speaker, I respect you personally. I think you are a good person. But the opposition cannot be in a position whereby it has to tolerate a situation where there is one rule for the government and one rule for the opposition. Question time is the time when we have an hour and a bit to hold the government accountable. Maybe there is a reason that the Prime Minister does not want to step down. He goes away and all the hubris and arrogance come out-in answer after answer yesterday and in the way that they behave across there and in the way they attack our people as we are trying to ask questions to solicit answers from the government. The proper functioning of this House and the proper functioning of government rely upon an effective opposition which has a right to hold the government to account. Rulings are made about tabling of documents, about anticipation and about the reason that it is inappropriate to put a tag on the end of every question-that is, ‘and are there any other alternatives?' There is a reason why that is bad practice. It is bad practice because it creates a situation which incites conflict and not proper debate. Most importantly, it is out of order understanding order 98(c). As much as the government would like to be responsible not only for their policy but also maybe for ours, they certainly are not. That is why standing order 98(c), properly enforced, would stop that practice. Mr Speaker, all we ask for-indeed, all we demand-through this dissent motion is a bipartisan approach from you. In your ruling on the tabling of documents, we are not getting that. That is why we moved this dissent motion. That is why today is a line in the sand. That is why from this point on, we want a bipartisan approach. (Time expired)",93
141,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING," Mr Speaker, if I may say so, it is an iron law of opposition politics that the more depressed they are in the caucus the more disruptive they are in this chamber-and that is the reason for this dissent motion. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was in fact the Leader of the House himself who took several points of order about relevance. I am looking forward to his learned dissertation on the standing orders.",94
142,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,There is no point of order. The Leader of the House has just started.,94
143,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I want to make it very clear to the House and certainly to members opposite that the problem today is not your ruling; the problem today is the policy which prompted the uproar in this House by members opposite. The problem is not your ruling.",94
144,Mr MELHAM,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Leader of the House should know that this is a dissent motion and he is restricted to speaking to the dissent motion and should not be trying to goad the opposition by going wider. I would ask you to call him to order.",94
145,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The Leader of the House has the call and he is responding to the motion.,94
146,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Absolutely right, Mr Speaker. We have a dissent motion before this House, but the real problem with members opposite is not your ruling; it is the policy that they would rather not see raised in this House-the policy they do not want to see mentioned. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, this debate is about dissent on your ruling about the tabling of documents. I would ask you to confine the minister to making his remarks about that ruling. He is psychoanalysing the opposition about what he thinks may or may not be in our minds.",94
147,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The minister is responding to the motion.,94
148,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, on the motion, let me make this clear: what we have seen from the opposition on this motion is a simple failure to understand the traditional and time-honoured practices and standing orders of this House. For the member for Lalor's benefit, let me quote page 573 of House of Representatives Practice, and I would ask the member for Lalor to listen: Ministers therefore do not require leave to documentsLet me repeat that: Ministers therefore do not require leave to table documents between items of business, during Question Time, while making a ministerial statement or personal explanation, or during a sion of a matter of public importance. That is the traditional and time-honoured position under the standing orders and the practices of this House. Ministers do not require leave to table documents. Members opposite are moving dissent on a ruling that you rightly made, Mr Speaker, that the Minister for Education, Science and Training was perfectly entitled to table the document that he did. Because members opposite do not seem to understand English when it is quoted to them once, let me give it to them again: ‘Ministers do not require leave to table documents.' Having made that point, let me now turn to your statement when you first assumed the chair: I also do not feel it is appropriate that leave should be sought for the tabling of documents already publicly available. Mr Speaker, you were drawing a distinction between a tabling for which leave is not necessary-that is, a ministerial tabling-and a tabling for which leave is necessary. That is the distinction you were rightly drawing. The perfectly appropriate ruling that you made applies equally to members of the opposition, who are not ministers, and to members of the government who are not ministers. Any member of the government who sought leave to table a document that was already on the public record would rightly be refused leave under your appropriate ruling, which I have every confidence you would apply absolutely impartially. Let me repeat: ministers do not require leave to table documents. Non-ministers retable quire leave to table documents. You have made a ruling, perfectly appropriately, that documents that are sought to be tabled by leave cannot already be on the public record. Nothing that you have done today suggests that there has been any partiality, bias or anydiscusthing improper at all in the way you have conducted yourself in this chair. What members opposite are seeking to do with this dissent motion is to upset the time-honoured traditions and practices of this Houseinherited from another House, the distinguished mother of parliaments-that ministers do not require leave to table documents. As I said, what we have seen today is a simple failure by members opposite to understand the ordinary practices of this House. I thought better of the member for Lalor. As a former plaintiff lawyer and as someone who has held her position for at least 12 months, I thought she would be more on top of the standing orders and the procedures of this House than she has turned out to be. I want to make one final point. While I believe you have ruled perfectly appropriately on the anticipation standing order, the question asked of the minister for education put you in a difficult position. I apologise for that, but I want to say that your behaviour in the chair has been absolutely, completely exemplary and you do not deserve the kind of blackguarding which you have quite wrongly received from members opposite. This matter has now detained the House for long enough. I move: That the question be put. Question agreed to. Question put: That the motion (Ms Gillard's) be agreed to. Elson, K.S. The House divided.

I am happy to table a copy of that letter. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I thank you for that fine gesture. It is an to do. It is a very significant day in our national history. We on this side of the House commend your generosity, and we hope it is shared by the Prime Minister on Friday. Ms King- Mr Speaker, I would also like to thank you, and I am sure the people of Ballarat will be very pleased with the decision. Standing Order 86(a)",97
153,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"You will recall that during question time. I raised a point of order in relation to standing order 86(a) and quoted to you in particular that part of the standing order which reads ‘After the question of order has been stated to the Speaker' seeking a ruling from you. I note that you did not rule at that time. I felt it was appropriate to wait until this point. I take you to the statement you made to the House on Wednesday, 17 November 2004 in which you rightly pointed out that the Standing Committee on Procedure's objective was to make the standing orders clearer and more intelligible and that the revised standing orders are expressed with greater clarity and have a new structure and sequence. You went on to say this: I remind honourable members that the standing orders are made by the House and the Speaker's role is to apply them. Standing order 86(a) is very precise where it says ‘After the question of order has been stated to the Speaker'. It gives members the right to put their case to you before a ruling is given. My concern is that you have intervened on points of order made by a number of members who have not been longwinded, who have not been in breach of the standing orders and who have not used unseemly words. The convention has been, providing a member is making valid points and is not being repetitive, to allow them to fully state their case to the Speaker before the Speaker appropriate thing sits them down. I would ask if you could advise the House what your procedure will be in relation to both government members and nongovernment members in that regard, because I also note that in the past there have been differing practices for government members, who were allowed to fully state their case, and opposition members, who were sat down halfway through their points of order.",97
154,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the honourable member for Banks for his question. The ruling that I have been applying on when to respond to a point of order is from House of Representatives Practice. I will read the point: The Chair may rule on a point of order as soon as he or she feels in a position to do so.,98
155,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The standing orders have been revised. What I would submit to you with the greatest of respect is that they are very clear. In terms of the way the standing order reads, it does not allow a discretion. I understand you have a discretion in relation to other sections of the standing order, where you can do certain things. You are given the discretion, for instance, in relation to a supplementary question. It says that you may allow it. There is no discretion for you in the way this standing order now readsproviding the member is being reasonable; I am not arguing the case where a member is being unreasonable. Ordinarily members should be allowed to fully state their case.",98
156,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Banks. I refer him back to my earlier answer. I would make the point again that, while I accept the spirit in which he is asking the question, there are occasions when people choose to debate a point of order. At that point, I think the chair is perfectly entitled to rule. NA",98

165,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, following the subject of the dissent motion this afternoon, I would like to ask you a question as to whether you could seek advice and report back to the House in relation to standing order 100(f), which reads: Questions must not anticipate discussion on an order of the day or other matter. The way that the points of order that were raised by the member for Lalor and the member for Grayndler were dealt with left us on this side at a loss. How could you just sit those members down and say that there was no point of order without any explanation or precedent of how the minister for education's reply was not anticipating discussion on an order of the day or other matter when clearly the business of the House was so anticipated? I would be grateful, having respect for you personally and respect for your position and in the knowledge that you have only been in the job for two weeks, if you could take some advice.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",99
170,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In looking at the differences between the approach of the current government to small business and that of Labor, there is a key distinction. It comes down to two words: whether in your policies you back ‘fairness' or whether in your policies you back ‘unfairness'. When you look at the Trade Practices Act, the approach from the government is to be slow in any of their responses and to keep the market out there as unfair as possible. When it comes to the unnecessary paperwork imposed on small business by this government, the approach has been to be as unfair as possible concerning the needs of small business. For the one situation which the statute book already had defined as unfairunfair dismissal-the approach of the government is to remove that to make sure that unfairness becomes legal. The approach of the Labor Party on all minthree of these issues is to be fair-fair to small business in terms of the Trade Practices Act, fair to small business in terms of unnecessary paperwork and fair to small business in terms of the laws relating to dismissal. The government have had a complete inability to deal with predatory pricing-they have been slow to move on the issue of predatory pricing in section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. You could understand them being slow to move if it were simply a choice between big business and small business. If that were the only option open to the government, we would understand that they had backed big business and that that would be what they would do. But on predatory pricing it is not even that clear. On predatory pricing the choice is between small business and large, anticompetitive, predatory businesses. Even then the government find it hard to work out which side to back. The Dawson report came out as far back as January 2003. Our response to the Dawson report is that we thought it was a bit soft. We thought there was a lot more that could be done in amending the Trade Practices Act. But even with a soft report and even with the responses that came back, the government still failed to turn those recommendations into legislation to be introduced into this House in the new session. Talk to stationery stores about the importance of the predatory pricing issues. I was at a stationery store in Adelaide last week. They told me that it costs them more to buy their products wholesale than at retail prices from their competitors. Talk to those stores. They want to know what capacity there will be to have that investigated by an active regulator-they want to know the extent to which that is going to happen. The position should be simple. Predatory pricing should be illegal and it should be clearly made illegal on the statute books. To their credit, the government have made it clear that they want to introduce the notification system for collective bargaining. They want to move away from one of the two options floated-the first system, where you have to have an approval system-and instead go for a notification system, which obviously is a better way to allow collective bargaining among small businesses. That has been in place as a recommendation from Dawson since January 2003. In the Australian the current Minister for Small Business and Tourism referred specifically to this issue by saying: ‘I want to try to put these measures in as quickly as possible. I think the current Senate might be willing to run with it.' If that is the case, where is the The bill to do that was introduced in the last parliament. Here we are in the second week of this parliament, getting close to Christmas. Why hasn't the bill been reintroduced? I know I have not been in this parliament for long, but in the New South Wales parliament, with our archaic measures, we had this stuff called ‘legislation'. If you wanted to run with something, you would introduce it in the parliament. You would have a bit of paper-that was the legislation-and you would introduce it. It is not enough to run off to the newspapers and give story after story saying that you view this as an important issue, that you view the collective bargaining notification system as something that has to happen, when all that has to be done is that a bill that was already written by the previous minister has to be introduced in the parliament. This is actually the first reduction in paperwork that the government have provided for, and the bit of paperwork they decided not to provide was the bill. All they have to do is introduce it, but the only piece of paperwork that they are interested in is the media release they put out to claim that something is being done for small business, when in fact nothing is being done. The burden of unnecessary paperwork is an issue for every small business you talk to. An issue that they talk about long before they get to industrial relations issues is that of paperwork and the paperwork attached to business activity statements. But the current minister has a new take on this. An article in the Sunday Age of 14 November 2004 says of the current minister: She reckons concerns about the GST and the business activity statement appear to have evaporated. You do not find small business saying that. There might be a minister who thinks the problems have evaporated, but you do not find shopkeepers saying the problems have bill? evaporated. You do not find people running home businesses saying that the problems associated with the BAS have evaporated. Along with all the problems of paperwork that were introduced by the government when they started up the business activity statements, the next problem is about to hit, and it comes on 1 July next year with the deregulation of the superannuation retail market. An employer, once again in South Australia, said to me that when he first started he thought he would try to do the right thing and give all of his staff a choice of whatever superannuation account they wanted. His words were: ‘It was the worse thing I ever did.' It is not a case of saying, ‘You've only got to deal with nine different cheques.' When you are using electronic payments, every superannuation fund has a different method of automatic deduction. It drove him to do a whole lot of unnecessary paperwork. In response to that, what did he do? He sat down with his staff and over the last 12 months has finally got them all back to being in the one fund-only to find out that from 1 July next year he has to go through the whole process again. From 1 July next year we will find the government forcing every small business to tell all of their staff that they have the option of being in whatever fund they want. All the extra paperwork does not go to the government and it does not go to the superannuation funds; it goes back to the small business operators-they are the ones it goes back to. They get no help with it whatsoever-the whole burden of the paperwork is placed on them. Paperwork is not just about the time taken by a small business operator. Time spent involved in extra paperwork is time you were meant to be spending growing your business. You actually have a straight business outcome from these extra burdens that this government is so willing to place on small firms. Not only do they have to tell their staff about this matter on 1 July next year but also every 12 months they have to tell them again. Even if their staff decide they all want to be in the one fund, every 12 months the small business operator has to go back to them and say: ‘Look, are you sure you do not want to make my paperwork a nightmare again? The government is guaranteeing that I have to give you that option.' We also found a huge issue in the southeast corner of Queensland-it is the same when you hit the New South Wales border across the Tweed-with cross-border regulation. Those businesses being run close to state boundaries have a nightmare of paperwork with different systems across different states. I am looking forward to the statements that will follow to see some national leadership on doing something and providing some relief. It is not just duplication of paperworkFran Bailey interjecting",99
171,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was not in the state government of New South Wales and Queensland! The Minister for Small Business and Tourism has the national job. So you have a situation where, with cross-border regulation, there is a chance for national leadership. I am impressed that the response from the minister is to look at the shadow minister and say, ‘You take the lead.' Sorry, but part of being the minister is that it is her job to take the lead. If you listen to the government's rhetoric about small business you would think there was one issue out there and one issue alone. The only issue you would think was out there was industrial relations and unfair dismissal. There is a very simple principle as a starting point: Labor does not support sacking people unfairly. As I have gone around speaking with small business operators, not a lot of them say to me, ‘Gee, Tony, can you make it so that I can sack my staff unfairly?' The request is not out there. There is a legitimate problem for small business in that there is a higher pressure for them to pay ‘go-away' money or reach some sort of financial settlement than there is for a larger business where a case has no merit. The reason for that is quite simple and obvious. If you are a big business you send your HR director out and they handle all of those issues. In a small business in many cases you have to shut down for the day to go through the processes of conciliation. The problem is not whether you can sack someone unfairly; the problem is the processes. Ms George-We can fix those.",101
172,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes. We can deal with the processes and do something about this. The problem is the ‘go-away' money. You will not find any small business organisation saying that the problem is that they want to sack someone unfairly. That is precisely what the government wants to make legal. What small businesses need is for ‘go-away' money in cases with no merit to go away. That is something that can be looked at through the processes. We will be saying more about that following the introduction of the legislation. One of the great problems with the arguments that have been run by the government is the false claim that the changes to unfair dismissal law will keep unlawful dismissal on the statute books. They will keep it on the statute books, but you will lose the capacity to make your case. The way you establish whether or not someone has been unlawfully dismissed in a discrimination case is to go to the reason given by the boss. If the reason does not stack up then you have your first hint that there has to be some other reason and you can find the discriminatory angles. Even though the government might say that unlawful dismissal still remains on the statute books, no employee will be able to make a case, because they will not have the capacity to do so. This will only be if the government do what they are intending to do with the new Senate following 1 July next year. Just wait a few months after that for the first pregnant woman to be dismissed. The government will say, ‘It is still illegal on the statute books,' but there will be absolutely way of making out her case. Just wait for the first person who is dismissed two weeks before they are due to qualify for long service leave. There will be nothing they can do. There will be no redress. The ‘go-away' money needs to go away, but a situation where unfairness is made legal is something that no government should have any pride in or be out there seeking. To then characterise that issue as though it were the biggest issue facing small business is completely inaccurate. What about the more than 800,000 home based businesses? What is in this unfair dismissal law for them? Does it mean that, all of a sudden, they can sack their spouse? For the 58 per cent of small businesses who employ no-one, does the unfair dismissal law mean that they will then be able to fire themselves unfairly with no chance of having to pay ‘go-away' money? In whole new areas of small business the big issues out there are not the industrial relations issues and certainly not the need to make unfairness legal. There is a need to do something about the processes. If the government wants to talk about that, we will get somewhere well before 1 July next year. We can make this prediction fairly easy: every time a small business between now and 1 July is put in the situation of using procedures that were designed for bigger business, not small business, the impost on the small business will be there for one reason and one reason only. It will be there because this government refused to negotiate, to look at keeping unfairness illegal and to have a situation where the procedures were made to work in a way that was far more practical for small business. The big issues out there are that small businesses want to be able to compete fairly and have a fair competitive market. We have reforms to the Trade Practices Act going back to January 2003. It is time for the government to do something no about it. If they are not even willing to photocopy a bill that was introduced in the last parliament-(Time expired) FRAN BAILEY (MCEwen-Minister for Small Business and Tourism) (4.14 p.m.)Could I start by congratulating the shadow minister for small business because, to the best of my recollection, this is the first time that we have actually had an MPI on small business. I would also like to offer him my commiserations as well as my congratulations. I do not really think I would like to be in his position, having to argue a case for small business with the economic record that his side has in this place under the leadership of Mr Mark Latham. I really do not think I would like to be in his position at all, and I thank goodness that I am not. Mr Tanner-Fifteen minutes to go, Fran. FRAN BAILEY-The member for Watson said quite a bit about what is fair and what is unfair, and he claimed to have listened and talked to a number of small business people. I have had a number of experiences with small business and have rung small businesses myself, and I can say to the member opposite that the one thing that small business needs is a good solid, strong environment. Mr Tanner-Sign the Kyoto protocol. FRAN BAILEY-If it does not have that good strength in its economic environmentMr Tanner interjecting",101
173,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Melbourne is warned! FRAN BAILEY-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. If small business does not have that environment, it really cannot compete because the bottom line for small business is that it has to have a market for its goods and services, and it only has that market if it is functioning in a very strong economy. I recall the words of the Treasurer at question time today. He reminded us all of the economic record left by the opposition: a $10 billion deficit. Just last week, I was on the Gold Coast talking to a number of small businesses in my colleagues' electorates of Moncrieff and MCPherson. Overwhelmingly, the one issue that these small business people wanted to remind me about was the 20.5 per cent interest rate during the time the Labor Party were in government. This is the issue they are frightened witless about-they really are. They know that the bottom line in their business depends on a good strong economy. I only have to look at my own electorate to know the difference-to see what this government has achieved for small business following the legacy of those opposite 8½ years ago. Mr Tanner interjectingFRAN BAILEY-I can walk down the main street in any one of the towns in my electorate",103
174,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Melbourne is testing the patience of the chair, and the chair will not tolerate it. Mr Tanner interjecting",103
175,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Melbourne will remove himself from the chamber, understanding order 94(a). FRAN BAILEY- Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a shame the member for Melbourne is leaving, because he is going to miss the examples I want to give. On that legacy, what I found 8½ years ago when I walked down the streets of towns in my electorate was that anywhere I looked in every single street there were empty shops. If you walk down those same streets today, Mr Deputy Speaker, they all have small businesses along them and those small businesses are employing local people. The only reason they are doing so is that they are able to function in a very strong economic environment. Anyone who has been hands-on in business knows that that is the only environment they need to deliver on the bottom line of profitability. It is that bottom line which enables them to grow and to prosper. I do not have to just rely on examples that I can remember from 8½ years ago, and I do not have to rely on examples from within my own electorate or from the small businesses that I have seen around the country. A number of business surveys have come out in the few weeks that I have been in this portfolio and every single one of those points to the confidence that small business has in the future. The figures show how small business has grown, and of course those small businesses remember the million unemployed. Today, we have the lowest unemployment rates. I want to share a quote with the shadow minister and I think it is worthwhile reading this. It is a quote from Steve Ryan, the chief economist of St George. Speaking about the September quarter survey data, he said: ... suggests small businesses are experiencing buoyant conditions across a number of key business metrics. While some measures eased, they generally remain at historically high levels and it appears the market is consolidating the strong gains of the past year. Notably, Sales, Selling Prices and Profits were extremely strong and this bodes well for small businesses which are also forecasting a strong December quarter. We believe this momentum, combined with a generally positive global and domestic economic outlook, should ensure continued strength within this market segment well into 2005. That is the sort of environment and they are the sorts of results that this government's policies have achieved. I thought in fairness to the member opposite that I should look at the Labor Party's policies for small business. I do remember that they did not get all that much of a run during the election campaign, but they did get some. One of the first policies is that they intend to abolish AWAs. That will abolish the right of small businesses to a choice and flexibility. The second thing I noticed-and I have not seen any evidence to the contrary that this is going to be overturned-is that Labor would introduce a national payroll tax. Of course, the last time we had a federal payroll tax was 1971 and everything flows through. I just think that that is an absolutely no-brainer issue for the Labor Party to introduce. They want to end casual employment. I know the member for Jagajaga is on the public record as saying that no job is better than a casual job. That is on the record and that no doubt reflects the Labor Party policy. You tell that to all of the people out there who are juggling work and family responsibilities and who choose to have casual employment. They choose that because it suits their style. Let us get on to unfair dismissal. The shadow minister talked quite a bit in his speech about what Labor's attitude is to unfair dismissal. I know from talking to small businesses for a number of years that this is one of the biggest problems that they face. The legislation which the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations will reintroduce-I believe tomorrow, but certainly very soon-is going to be a real test for the shadow minister and his party because it goes to the essence of the matter. It is one thing to get up and say that you support small business, you want to do the best for small business and you want everything to be fair for small business, but the acid test will come when that legislation is reintroduced and we see whether you support it. If you do not support that legislation, you are going to be sending the clearest message possible to all of the 1.2 million small businesses throughout the country that you do not support them. Not only that; you will be sending a very strong message to the over three million Australians who work in those small businesses. What small business wants is the flexibility and the certainty to be able to employ more people. I know that that does not exhaust the Labor Party's plans for small business, but just those four points are probably enough to send a shiver down the spine of any hard working small business person in this country. I want to move to a point that the member opposite made: that it was very slow and there had not been much happening, especially in the area of reducing red tape for small business. I thought it would be a good idea to go through some of the measures that this government have achieved. We have reduced the Australian Bureau of Statistics reporting load by more than 40 per cent. We have modernised the tax system by abolishing indirect taxes, as we know, such as the wholesale sales tax. The government have already started to move to provide greater flexibility for small operators, with AWAswhich the Labor Party is opposed to. We have reduced the number of forms related to company registration and reporting and the frequency with which they have to be lodged. We have developed a range of online services aimed at improving access for small business. For example, the tax office's business portal allows electronic lodgement of the BAS. We have encouraged more small businesses to take up e-commerce by providing a range of very practical guides and information tools. We have introduced mandatory 30-day payment terms for Australian government departments and agencies. Let me get it on the record that my own department has a very good record of just over 99 per cent for that 30-day period. We have established the Small Business Answers program-45 people going around the country, individually meeting with small business people and providing them directly with the information that they want, giving them the latest information. Most importantly, something which I have already started to work on, and which was an election promise, is the $50 million regulation reduction incentive fund. Anyone who has ever been involved with small business knows that, whether a small business operator is starting up or expanding a business, the first level of government that they approach is local government. It has a range of different licences and planning permits. The list is almost endless. It is a deliberate choice for us to target local government and to provide that incentive. The first demonstration period of that $50 million fund will start very soon. That will be assessed and then it will be rolled out. The shadow minister did make quite a point about timeliness. Of course, we have to get it right. One of the things that the government do is to consult with small business. We do not come in and dictate the terms; we actually consult. I think that that is a very important point. In relation to some of the other measures to reduce tax, we have already flagged the entrepreneurs' 25 per cent tax deduction scheme, which the Treasurer will be introducing. In relation to the Trade Practices Act, probably one of the most important things that this government will do is to strengthen that act to enable small business to work much more easily with big business, through collective bargaining. I think there is probably not a member of this House who is not concerned about market share, where small business has some difficulties at times. There is no doubt that people are concerned about that. I think that the ability for small business to collectively bargain in dealing with big business is a major step forward. I notice a member opposite nodding his head, so I am sure that we are going to be able to depend on his support when that legislation is introduced. In all seriousness, those opposite have an appalling record of setting up an abysmal economic climate in which small business has been forced to operate under untenable conditions. It really is going to take more than an MPI on developing agendas for small business for the opposition to have any credibility with small business. As I have said, the acid test for small business people will be your response when that unfair dismissal legislation is reintroduced into this parliament. (Time expired)",103

Before I call the member for Swan, I would ask the Minister for Small Business and Tourism to examine the Hansard record when it comes to her office. In the middle sections there was quite extensive use of the word ‘you', which I think we are trying to get away from. The debate is better in the third person.",106
178,Mr WILKIE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Small Business and Tourism on her appointment to the small business portfolio. I know she has a strong commitment to this vitally important sector. I wish her luck because, although she may be committed to small business, sadly, the government-despite its rhetoric-is not. The failure of the government to assist small business, whilst prattling on about how much it is doing for them, is staggering. This demonstrates that the government has in fact failed to develop an adequate agenda for modern small businesses and constantly refuses to listen to their concerns or implement practical solutions to their problems. Take, for example, the government's treatment of the recommendations of the parliament's Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector, which reported in 1999. This committee was chaired by the member for Cook, the Hon. Bruce Baird, and included members of the Liberal, National and Democrat parties from the Senate and the House of Representatives. Overwhelmingly, the committee agreed to a raft of recommendations designed to protect small business from big business. Sadly, the government has only implemented one of these recommendations in full and another only to give the former any real ability to function properly-after the Labor Party announcement at the last election which looked at introducing a mandatory code of retail conduct. The committee report's executive summary outlined why the implementation of the recommendations was so vitally important: Over the past twenty years or so, Australia has seen the demise of hundreds of small grocery stores, butchers, bakers, florists, greengrocers, pharmacists, newsagents, liquor outlets and other small retailers as a direct result of the continuous expansion of major supermarket chains and major speciality retailers, often subsidiaries of the same conglomerate. Thus, the market is heavily concentrated and oligopolistic in nature, where a small number of major chains (Woolworths, Coles and Franklins) each have a significant degree of economic influence or market power. This has placed significant pressures on small and independent retailers, leading to calls for legislative remedies to be imposed by government. Not only is economic survival at stake, but so too the health and well-being of many small retailers, brought about by longer working hours and stressful dealings with the ‘big end of town'. Retirement plans have been put on hold, family members have had to seek employment elsewhere, and lifetime commitments to grocery retailing have now come down to two options-to sell or to close. In the area of market share, the report says: The market share of the three major chains amounts to around 80 per cent of the dry/packaged goods market. The committee went on to say: Despite this consumer satisfactionwith regard to being able to get goods at different timesthe Committee is concerned about the activities of the major chains with respect to small retailers. Some of the evidence brought to the Committee's attention indicates that their behaviour is inconsistent with their public image of being good corporate citizens. The committee suggested that the Trade Practices Act should be strengthened: A significant body of evidence alleged instances of predatory pricing, where it was said that the major chains were prepared to lose money indefinitely in certain stores to wipe out the competition. The evidence was consistent and widespread, with the common complaint being that the difficulties lie in establishing predatory conduct under the current provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Whilst the report said ‘there may be exceptions in some stores across Australia', the committee found that these were indeed exceptions. It also said: The Committee believes that the evidence clearly reveals a need to address the issue of predatory pricing … One area that the committee looked at was the introduction of a retail industry ombudsman, saying: The Committee believes that an appropriate dispute resolution mechanism should take the form of an independent Ombudsman, to be funded by government, who could attempt to resolve all sorts of complaints brought to it by businesses in the retailing sector. The committee recommended that, with the introduction of an ombudsman-which the government, to their credit, actually introduced-so that he could operate properly, he would have as a back-up a mandatory code of conduct which would, the report says: … regulate conduct in vertically integrated tionships throughout the supply chain. Being mandatory, the Code of Conduct would enable the courts to take into account provisions of the code in determining whether or not business conduct has been unlawful. Sadly, the government failed to make any code mandatory, thus significantly disadvantaging small businesses and putting the burden back on them. In 1995 the Labor Party introduced the Trade Practices (Better Business Conduct) Bill, which was to prevent harsh or oppressive conduct by retail landlords and franchisees and was to give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission greater powers to stamp out such conduct. Let us be clear about the history of this legislation. The Liberal opposition at that point refused to pass the bill. The fair trading section of their small business policy, which was released prior to the election before last, said: Complex black letter law, as proposed by a Labor Government, will stifle the dynamics of the small business sector and lead to greater uncertainty and cost. Therefore it is not seen as the most appropriate starting point to address current small business difficulties. My gravest concern is that half the nation's retail tenants could be out of business by the time we get unconscionable conduct legislation introduced into and passed by this parliament. To highlight that concern, I would like to outline what happened in a series of distressing events at a local shopping centre which was called the Heart of the Park, in my electorate of Swan. Overseas investors purchased the Heart of the Park shopping centre in September 1994. It was owned by a company called Eastern Prosperity-prosperity for them, possibly, but certainly not for the tenants. At that time, there were 35 shops operating in the centre. To say that the investment group neglected the centre is an understaterela- ment. The centre had a series of incidents, including raw sewage flowing through the centre through flooded drains. The centre had major leaks whenever it rained, and I should note that these leaks were in the vicinity of power outlets and light fittings. The electrical malfunctions were a constant menace to both health and trade due to the poor quality of the electrical system. Tenants indicated that if one shop decided to plug in an extra appliance there was a good chance that the rest of the shops would be blacked out. Whilst at the centre during a rainstorm, I witnessed water flowing through the light fittings and running down the walls of one of the shops-in fact, quite a few shops. Extractor fans in the ablution blocks were raining water, and unlocked doors to an empty shop showed gaping holes in the roof and floor. The centre had received work orders from a variety of government departments and had failed to implement any of them. Life for tenants could certainly not be described as luxurious, and the same could have been said for customers. For example, potholes filled the car park. The investors promised four years ago that they would fix the problems, but what happened was that nearly all of the tenants went broke and had to withdraw from the complex. The centre ended up being sold to another investor, and only now, having seen all those tenants go broke, has anyone bothered building a new centre. The government failed to act; they failed completely in their obligation to look after people in this particular area. With regard to compliance costs for small business, when the government were in opposition the Prime Minister made certain commitments in relation to red tape. On 30 January 1996, not long before the election, the now government said that they would be establishing a small business deregulation task force, which would have a specific brief from the Prime Minister to report within six months on ways to reduce small business red tape. In fact, they aimed to reduce it by 50 per cent. But did that occur? Not likely. Under this lot, the red tape and compliance have blossomed. The growing wealth of lawyers who are trying to deal with taxation legislation is quite amazing, but the compliance has been left to small business. I think that is absolutely appalling. The government know this, because small business has been telling them this for years, but they just will not listen. For example, in my electorate of Swan I have had people who run car yards come to me, saying that they are constantly trying to deal with the burden of GST compliance. They cannot do it, the government will not listen to them and they would be pleased to have that addressed. Most of them are going broke. Many of them are working just because they would rather be at the office than stay at home. This is something that is absolutely disgraceful. The Australian Industry Group recently produced a report on compliance costs, entitled Compliance costs time and money. In their executive summary they have said that, despite the concerns raised and the government's commitment to reduce red tape: ... the reduction of compliance costs was not a focus of the 1998 Tax Reform, Not a new tax, a new tax system (the ANTS document), which included recommendations to introduce a goods and services tax ... However, it was adopted as one of the aims of the Review of Business taxation (the so called Ralph Review). Unfortunately, these recommendations were never implemented. The report went on to make a number of recommendations, and the executive summary concluded by saying: In summary, the Report concludes that in order to safeguard future small business compliance cost reform from the casualty ward, the way forward should involve both compliance cost reduction and targeted compensation based upon robust research. In part, the conclusions on tax reform contained in the Ralph report noted: ... in the end, tax design in a complex environment is as much art as it is science: judgement is often as important as fact and analysis. The Australian Industry Group report went on: The ‘judgement' has not been exercised for small business. If tax compliance costs are an endemic systematic issue, what are needed are radical solutions. As this report shows what we have from the ANTS/Ralph implementation has not worked. As this report has sought to point out, even though tax compliance costs are an issue recognised by government, it has simply failed to reduce them. Overall, the consideration given to small business has been sadly lacking. (Time expired)",106
179,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It gives me great pleasure to participate in the debate on this matter of public importance. I have noted during the life of this parliament that there have been an increasing number of questions from the opposition which the Treasurer refers to as ‘Kylies'. It seems we have our first ‘Kylie' in this matter of public importance, in that we should be so lucky that the ALP should be asking questions about small business, a subject with which they rarely concern themselves. One of the major problems the ALP have is that virtually no-one on the opposition benches has any small business experience. There is one: the member for Watsona pleasing change, and we may see some pleasing improvements in their policy platform from the dregs that there were put forward to the last election. But virtually no-one on the opposition benches has run a small business; virtually no-one on the opposition benches has had to pay a wage cheque at the end of the week; virtually no-one on the opposition benches has had to pay workers comp, pay the bills, quote for a job and make it pay at the end of the day and create a profit to employ people.",109

183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member will refer his remarks through the chair.,109
184,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The ALP had virtually no support from the small business sector. To see that, one only has to look at the recent Sensis business index survey of some 1,800 small businesses, which gave the Howard-Anderson government a huge tick of approval. In fact, the recent survey provided a plus 13 per cent rating for the HowardAnderson government. When Labor were in power they never even managed a positive rating on this index. We have a 13 per cent positive rating in that survey, while you were always running negative. The government have good policies for small business because we understand small business. We understand the fact that the 1.2 million small businesses provide roughly 30 per cent of Australia's GDP, employ 3.3 million Australians and produce 80 per cent of the jobs growth. We realise that, we nurture that and we support small business. We know that small business is the backbone of our economy. And what does the government do for small business? The government have created a strong economy, something that the previous Labor administration could not do. In contrast, they had deficits and high interest rates. Those on this side of the House know that 20-plus per cent interest rates for small business are unsustainable. Labor when last in power drove thousands of businesses to the wall, destroying people's lives, destroying families. That was their legacy to small business-driving up interest rates, driving up inflation and driving up unemployment as a result. That was your legacy to small business, your legacy to our economy. The government get very strong praise from the OECD. The economic management of the government is praised by the OECD, not ridiculed. The strong economy that we have built allows us to put in place the policy settings which support small business. We are not standing still on the issue of small business. We have introduced and announced a range of measures to assist small business, such as our announcement on the 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax discount for businesses with $50,000 turnover or less. We are supporting those microbusinesses because those of us on this side of the House know that virtually every corporation or large business started its life in some way, shape or form as a small business. We know that, we appreciate that and we put policies in place port those businesses. We have extended the simplified tax system so that businesses which have an accrual accounting base can participate in that system. We are working at reducing red tape for small business by providing access for 800,000 small businesses to one annual BAS. We have been doing a range of smaller things, such as reducing the number of forms required for company registration and reporting and exempting most small businesses from the Privacy Act requirements. We have also introduced a range of online services to help small business, and they are very much commended by those small businesses who use them. We are committing a further $15 million a year from 2006-07 to the Small Business Assistance Program. This government assists small business; the ALP tends to hinder small business. We are building infrastructure through AusLink, providing better transport links so that businesses can get their product to market. We are providing improved telecommunications through increased broadband services in areas where small business needs it so that small business can compete with larger business and attract markets way outside their immediate geographical area. We will be strengthening section 46 of the Trade Practices Act to ensure that small business is not treated unfairly. The minister also mentioned the $50 million incentive fund for local government to reduce their level of administration and red tape. This government is very focused in a range of other ways, such as through trade initiatives like free trade agreements, because it is not only large businesses but also small businesses that can trade and export. We have been focused on our FTAs with Singapore, Thailand and the US, and now the proposal that supis underway for the FTA with ASEAN. Mr Gavan O'Connor-You don't even know what's in them. You'd sign up to anything; you'd sell your grandmother.",109
185,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You cannot look past your nose. You do not see the fact that small business can export and be part of the world economy. Many businesses in my electorate and other electorates are doing that. I would also like to reflect for a moment on unfair dismissal. We hear you squawk and moan about unfair dismissal.,110
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member will refer his remarks through the chair.,110
187,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you. The members opposite have been known to squawk and moan about issues in relation to unfair dismissal. I put the question to them: what incentive is there for a small business person to dismiss unfairly those employees who have the product knowledge, who know their customer base and who are working properly and building wealth within the business? The members opposite seem to want to support those who steal over supporting hard working employees-to support those who do not care for the company over those who do. The test will come for them tomorrow with regard to unfair dismissal. Are they going to talk the talk or walk the walk? We hear a lot of hot air and rhetoric; we do not see much action from the ALP when it comes to small business. This government is absolutely focused on improving the lot of small business. The Labor Party only comes out with rhetoric and a lot of hot air. The restaurant and catering industry association says that on average an unfair dismissal claim costs around $3,600 and consumes about 63 hours of management time. But that would not concern the members opposite, because they want to support employees who steal, who do not want to do the job and who are not part of the corporate culture. They are not focused on the needs of small business. Mr Burke- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The reflection that members on this side want to support people who steal should be withdrawn.",110
188,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I ask the honourable member for Cowper to withdraw.,111
189,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw that statement. I would like to reflect for a moment on recent comments from Barry Cohen, who said: ... as the number of caucus members with small business experience is close to zilch, it is standable. What was understandable? Labor's indifferent attitude to small business. I am pleased that Labor have raised this MPI today. I am pleased that an interest in small business has been awakened. They have a long way to go, but at least they are talking about it. Now that they are starting to talk about it, they might implement some policies to help small business. The contractors in my electorate want to see unfair dismissal legislation introduced as it is currently proposed. They want to see that they are able to put on new staff with confidence. I noticed in Labor's discussion they talked about the small number of employees in a lot of businesses. That number should be able to be increased once employers can put on extra employees without fear of coming under the wrath of the unfair dismissal legislation and having to spend $3,600 and 63 hours of management time on fighting a case for a claim that has no merit. This government is absolutely focused on the needs of small business. Labor have a lot of work to do. I am pleased they are talking about it, and, if they want a bit of an update on what small businesses need, the members on this side of the House will be very happy to lead the way. We have been leading the way for small business for many years now. Small business supported us at the last election; small business support us very strongly because they know we keep the economy strong and they know we support them. They know the coalition is the party of small business.",111

197,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (4.59 p.m.)-The Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 give effect to the funding allocations by the Howard government to government schools and non-government schools over Dethe 2005-08 period. As speakers on this side of the House have already pointed out, this legislation perpetuates the fundamental inequities in the way this government funds schools in Australia. This legislation continues real increases for high-fee independent schools and only very small increases in recurrent funding above indexation levels for government schools and it proposes quite contentious conditions and accountability arrangements. Yesterday in question time we witnessed the appalling arrogance of the Treasurer and other ministers in the wake of the election. In this education debate, as I have been following it over the course of today, we are seeing that arrogance once again rearing its ugly head. The simple fact remains, regardless of the election result, that the Howard government is persisting with policies that favour extremely well-resourced private schools at the expense of less well-off private nongovernment and government schools in both the primary and secondary sectors. That gross inequity will now continue through this legislation. The government has a general mandate to pursue these policies, and I will not dispute that. However, we on this side of the House also have a mandate to keep faith with the principles that we articulated at the election. Those principles won the support of over 47½ per cent of the Australian people and were restated today in the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister, which I wholeheartedly support. In my electorate of Corio, those principles found majority support and it is my duty to restate them here today. Labor have given a very clear and unequivocal commitment not to jeopardise school funding for the year 2005, so, to improve this legislation, we will be proposing second reading and substantive amendments, which we believe the government should pick up in the interests of the wider community. So that there is a continuous stream of funding for our schools in both the private and public sectors, we will not obstruct the final passage of these bills through the parliament, should those amendments be rejected. In saying that, let me make it quite clear on the floor of this House that the above position ought not to be construed by anybody as an endorsement of the funding policies and priorities of the Howard government. During the election that has just passed I made my position on education funding quite clear to the people of the Geelong region, and it was my position that won considerable favour with most people in my electorate of Corio. The core principle that underpins Labor's policy in this area is simply priority funding based on educational and financial need. We passionately believe that all schoolchildren are entitled to a national dard of resources and quality educational outcomes regardless of the status of their parents, where they live, their religion or their ethnic background. In pursuit of our goal, the policy recently endorsed by Labor's caucus incorporates a national priority for needy government and private schools and a national agreement with states on funding policies for all schools. I am extremely proud of Labor's commitment of $2.4 billion of extra funding over five years for needy government and non-government schools. That funding was $1.9 billion more than the Howard government's investment in government schools. It was a commitment that we on this side of the House were very pleased about and very proud of, and we do not back away from it under any circumstances. A centrepiece of that funding policy was our commitment to a 21st century resources standard, which would have raised recurrent resources funding for primary schools to $9,000 and for secondary schools to $12,000. In my electorate there were many, many schools that would have benefited considerably from that particular policy. The government schools include Anakie Primary School, Ashby Primary School, Barwon Valley School, Bell Park North Primary School, Chilwell Primary School, Clifton Springs Primary School, Corio Bay Secondary College, Corio Primary School, Corio South Primary School, Corio West Primary School, Drysdale Primary School, Flinders Peak Secondary College, Fyans Park Primary School, Geelong East Primary School, Geelong High School, Hamlyn Banks Primary School, Herne Hill Primary School, Lara Primary School, Lara Lake Primary School, Lara Secondary College, Leopold Primary School, Manifold Heights Primary School, stanMatthew Flinders Girls Secondary College, Moolap Primary School, Nelson Park School, Newcomb Park Primary School, Newcomb Secondary College, Newcomb Primary School, Norlane High School, Norlane West Primary School, North Geelong Secondary College, North Shore Primary School, Rollins Primary School, Rosewall Primary School, South Geelong Primary School, Tate Street Primary School, Western Heights College and Whittington Primary School. Those are the public schools that would have received significant increases in funding under the policy of a Latham Labor government if it had been elected. That funding would have been over and above what these schools currently receive from the eral government. It is a matter of some disappointment to me that this government cannot concede that funding ought to be allocated on the principle of need. I have been in many of these schools and have seen the neglect they have suffered under years and years of Liberal state government rule and the gigantic task that the Bracks government has had to come to terms with to resource these schools to provide some equity of access to a decent education. But not just the government schools would have benefited from Labor's policy if we had been given the opportunity to implement it. In the Catholic systemic schools, following would have received extra funding from a Labor government: Catholic Regional College; Clonard College; Sacred Heart College; St Joseph's College; Christ the King School; Holy Family Primary School; Our Lady's Primary School; St Anthony's Primary School, Hamlyn Heights; St Anthony's Primary School, Lara; St Francis Xavier Primary School; St Margaret's Primary School; St Mary's Primary School; St Patrick's Primary School; St Robert's Primary School; St Thomas Aquinas Primary School; Holy Spirit School and St Thomas Primary School. All those schools would have received extra funding-extra resources for their teaching task and to upgrade their teaching resources. But it did not stop there. Funding increases for independent schools would have gone to the following: St Augustine's Education Centre; St Helen's School; Geelong Baptist College; Kardinia International College K-12; Geelong Rudolph Steiner School; Isik College, Geelong campus; Oxford Christian Primary School; Covenant College; St John's Lutheran Primary School; and fed- Christian College, Bellarine. For any one electorate that is an extraordinary list of schools that would have received significant increases in funding. I am proud of the fact that we put that policy before the people of Corio-and they endorsed it, because I have been re-elected to this place yet again. We had made a decision to reduce funding to two schools. These schools would have received some base funding from the Commonwealth but, by and large, their particular funding allocation would have been reduced. Those schools were Geelong Grammar at Corio and Newtown and the Geelong College. I had cause to speak to several parents afthe ter the announcement of Labor's policy; several parents from these schools rang me up to seek further clarification of Labor policy. I took them through the principles on which we had structured and based our policy-and those principles have been articulated again today in this debate on the second reading amendment. When I articulated those principles to them, they understood. One parent said, ‘I'm not going to vote for you'straight out. Several others were reserving their judgment but, if the conversation was any indication, they did appreciate the fact that I was prepared to spend the time to explain our policy position to them. Several other parents said, ‘Yes, it may well affect us in a financial sense, but we can see the logic of it and we agree with the principles that underpin it.' I really take my hat off to those parents because, in practice, for the schools that would have received the funding the policy would have meant great teachers and higher standards, good values and discipline, better buildings, up-to-date computers with Internet access, early and numeracy intervention, more money and support for students with disabilities, ticular focus on the learning of Asian language and, of course, extensive support for Indigenous students. That is what would have been the outcome if Labor had been elected. Regrettably, as I said before, the results of the election will not enable those funding increases to flow on this occasion. But I do thank those teachers, parents and principals in the Corio electorate who expressed their strong support for the policies that I articulated at the last election. There are elements of this legislation to which the opposition has advanced what it sees as constructive amendments to address real concerns about the implications of the legislation. One such concern is the operation of the impact of the Tutorial Credit Initiative, which is the $700 voucher to eligible children to purchase reading assistance from the marketplace. The shadow minister, in her response to this legislation, has detailed our concerns in that regard. One of the great privileges of being a member of parliament-one that I am sure more seasoned members of this House already know and one that new members will come to appreciate-is to visit our primary schools and to witness first-hand how the task of educating our young is being carried out in our communities. It is one of the most uplifting experiences in the life of a member of parliament. In my own public life, I have always worked on the simple principle that nothing is too good for the sons and daughters of working people. That maxim applies especially to the education of our young. Therefore, I am always bitterly disappointed when I see a government like the one we have here at the moment-which has fed off the economic prosperity handed to it by 13 literacy years of good Labor governmentsquandering $1 billion of our precious rea parsources on a war that has brought untold misery to families in Iraq, particularly children, and which is at the same time leaving many of our own schools under-resourced. Be that as it may, it is always a source of great pleasure to visit primary schools in my electorate and witness the extraordinary work being done for our children in those schools. Two recent encounters confirmed for me the excellent work being done for our young students. One was a visit I made to the Little River Primary School. It is a semirural school with 102 students, five full-time teachers and a principal who also teaches. It has three specialist teachers who come in one day a week. They do all their teaching in portables. There are no classrooms. The administration is in a 125-year-old building. It has a garage as an art room. The community built that. The community also bought one of the portables. The Commonwealth government, in their generosity, gave them money for a flagpole. I am not going to deny the school that experience, but I do pay tribute to the principal, Karen Chaston, and Greg Riddle. I presented some flags at their assembly, and it was a wonderful occasion because I heard the oath that had been developed by the young students at the school. I would like to read this oath into the Hansard, because I think it really sums up the goodness that is in our public schools today. It states: We the students of Little River believe that we should treat each other with respect, be friendly to one another, help others when we can and be tolerant of children who are different. Noble sentiments are identified and expressed by the children of Little River in that oath: respect, friendliness, help for others and tolerance. It is probably something that adults in the wider community could adopt. The second instance occurred last week, when I attended the final farewell concert of Holy Family Primary School on Separation Street in the north of my electorate. They held an end of year concert at The Arena in Geelong. It was an excellent choice of venue to stage the concert, which was extremely well attended by parents, relatives and friends. My congratulations go out to the students and staff for the excellent production and particularly to the students for their excellent performances. While I might have had some broader reservations about the choice of American movies as the theme and about our young performing in American accents, no-one could doubt the energy, effort and talent in the performances. Such a production is a huge undertaking to organise at a time when school is still in, especially it involved, as far as I could ascertain, every student in the middle and senior areas. The professionalism of the staff and their deep care for the students was evident to onlookers, and they are to be commended for it. There were two quite unforgettable moments for me at the concert. The first was the staff item, which unearthed the hidden talents of many staff members, much to the delight of the students, and the scintillating performance of Ms Dorothy Siketa. I happen to know Dorothy quite well, and I can assure the parent body and the general public that Dot has not lost the plot. Those who attended will understand the theme of the item by the teachers, in which Ms Siketa featured so prominently, and will know what I mean. The second was the grand finale, when all the students who performed occupied the stage for their farewell item. It was visually splendid and emotionally uplifting, and it confirmed to all that Holy Family Primary School is indeed a happy family as well as a holy one. In both of these primary schools-one public, one private-the immense dedication of the teachers, the happiness of the students and the interest of parents and others in the children was on display for all to see. So to all the students, teachers, parents and friends of Little River Primary School and Holy Family Primary School: take a bow and accept my best wishes for 2005 from the floor of this House.",113
198,Mr BOWEN,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I am pleased to be able to speak on the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and second the amendment moved earlier today by the honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I would have thought that Labor's amendments were pretty hard to argue against. They support as high-quality public education as a national priority and recognise the entitlement of all students in public and non-government schools to minimum national standards. I would have thought in this country at this time you would get almost unanimous support for a proposition like that, but sadly I suspect that that will not be the case in this House and that Labor's amendments will be defeated. The premise of our amendments is the same as the premise of our election policy, which the honourable member for Corio just talked about in his contribution, and that premise is that funding should be based on need. In moving this amendment, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to Fairvale High School as an indicator of the unfairness of the current funding regime. Fairvale High School is in my electorate, and it is a very good example of that unfairness. As it happens, I visited Fairvale High School last week. It is a very good school. The principal, Jeff Bromage, is a good leader and runs a good ship. But it is also a needy school, and it deals with children from a diverse range of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds, many of whom have special needs, and that generates special requirements on their funding. It is also a school in need of extra resources. I attended the school to present some sports awards. As it happened, that ceremony occurred at lunchtime, and the only building that the school had that was appropriate to present awards in was the library. In order to have that ceremony the library had to be shut, so students who wished to study at lunchtime could not get into the library to do their work. So we see a school doing a good job, working hard and getting good results, with a good bunch of dedicated teachers dealing with things like that, but, not having a hall or room appropriate for the presentation of a small number of awards, the children are not always able to study at lunchtime. What was the increase in federal funding for this school over the last four years? It was 20 per cent. This school is usually compared to the King's School in Parramatta. This is a good school too. I do not have first-hand knowledge of this school, but I am confident that they get good results and that they have high standards, dedicated teachers and good programs-I have absolutely no doubt about that. But what they do not have is need. I am sure if they had some awards to present they would not need to close down their library at lunchtime to allow those awards to be presented. We have heard lots about them having 20 playing fields, a museum, a full-time curator for that museum et cetera. I say, ‘Good luck to them. Well done.' They are no doubt a very good school. But that does not justify a substantial increase in federal ing. And what was the increase for the King's School over the last four years? It was 215 per cent. That is 215 per cent for a school that nobody would class as needy. I am sure the school itself would not class itself as needy; that would be the last way that it would characterise itself. However, it gets an increase of 215 per cent and Fairvale High School, which I think would acknowledge itself as having special needs, gets an increase of 20 per cent. I would like to share with the House another example of a good school in my electorate which could also be classified as needing more resources: Westfields Sports High School. Westfields Sports High School achieves remarkable results, not just in sport but across the board. They had five graduates of the school in the Australian Olympic team in Athens, which is a remarkable result in itself. But, not only that, their culture of success and achievement has rubbed off on the academic side of the school and they get excellent HSC results. Westfields was built in the 1960s and its buildings are now 40 years old and starting to need replacement. It is of a similar vintage to Fairvale High School and to several other schools in my electorate and throughout Sydney. The New South Wales government has provided funds for new buildings, but Westfields has had to raise more money for those buildings through fundraising dinners and other activities. I attended a fundraiser at Westfields again last week, raising money to supplement a state grant for new buildings. Westfields is a school which helps itself-it raises an enormous amount of money for itself and it achieves good results-but on any objective basis Westfields and other schools like it deserve more federal funding. Labor's amendments would give it more federal funding. Labor's policy going into the fundelection would have given it more federal funding, but the funding regime in the bills before the House, sadly, sells short Westfields, Fairvale and other schools like it, including St Johns Park High School in my electorate, which I attended. It is not just public schools that deserve better. Needy non-government schools also deserve better. The member for Corio read out a long list of schools in his electorate which would have benefited from Labor's policy. I am not going to do that, but there are schools, like Patrician Brothers College in Fairfield and St Paul's Catholic College in Greystanes, which on any objective basis deserve a bigger increase in funding than the King's School and other schools which receive such massive increases under this funding regime. In question time today, the honourable minister for education made a remark which I, frankly, found absolutely astounding, and I cannot let this opportunity go without commenting on it. He said, ‘The Labor Party does not believe in giving parents the right to choose which schools to send their children to.' I actually could not believe he said that, and then he said it again. I thought my ears must have been deceiving me. I have not been here very long-I am only a new person in this place-and you will be unsurprised to hear that that was the most outrageous thing I have heard in this place so far. But I actually have a feeling that it will hold the record for a while. I think it will be a little while before I hear something more outrageous, because Labor's amendments, moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and seconded by me today, specifically say that we call on this House to provide: ... recognition of the right of parents to the type of schooling for their children and to public funding for that schooling based on need ... It is there in black and white in the amendment and the minister for education, in what I regard as not only a highly inaccurate but also a highly offensive way, characterised our policy as not giving parents choice about the schools that their children should be able to attend. That is just clearly incorrect. But more than that: the Howard government has frozen funding growth for more than 60 per cent of Catholic schools, allowing them no security about their financial future. So not only does our policy allow for parents to choose which schools to send their children to but the government's policy lets down Catholic schools. Any simple economic analysis shows how flawed the government's approach is. Any first-year economics student could tell you about marginal return. The marginal return on an investment in a school that is already relatively well resourced is low in terms of educational output. If you have a school that is wealthy, already has plenty of resources, plenty of sporting facilities and good teachers, and you put more money into that school, the marginal return for your investment is going to be quite low. If, on the other hand, you take a school that is needy, does not have a hall, only has a small library and does not have appropriate teaching facilities, and you invest the money in that school, you are going to get a much higher marginal return-or, to put it another way, a much bigger bang for your buck, because the children in that school will receive a much bigger benefit. So the taxpayers are being let down by this government and this government's policies. The taxpayers are not getting an appropriate return for their investment in education. The regime established by this governchoose ment and continued under these bills for determining the funding arrangements for schools is the socio-economic status indexthe SES index. This is a fundamentally flawed index. It replaces the Education Resources Index, which was much more based on the needs of the school and the capacity of the school to reach educational standards. I put this to the House: any regime which produces an outcome where the King's School has more needy students than Fairvale High School is a deeply flawed calculating system. Again, I would regard it as highly offensive and I would invite any member opposite to argue with a straight face that the King's School has more needy students than Fairvale High School in my electorate. I would invite anybody who wants to mount that argument to come to Fairvale High School and meet the students and teachers and see the work that goes on and argue the proposition that the King's School is in need of more funding than Fairvale High School based on the socio-economic status of its students. I would invite them to mount those arguments with a straight face, because they could not. Let me turn briefly to the reporting of school performance and the devolution of staffing responsibilities to principals and schools. I recognise that there is scope for measures to be implemented in this regard. Labor's proposals go to providing a more viable framework to allow that to happen. We agree with the government that there needs to be plain English reporting. We would all agree with that. I think that is sensible. But we say that parents, not just teachpolitics, ers, should be given the opportunity to contribute to the design of school reports. Let give parents a say. Let us empower the community. Let us give parents some ownership of their children's education. We also propose to introduce a statewide framework to ensure that difficult-to-staff schools can still attract teachers. Many of these schools are in disadvantaged areas, rural and regional areas or in outlying suburbs of the capital cities. Almost by definition, they need dedicated and innovative teachers to ensure that they can achieve the best possible educational outcomes. I would also like to deal with the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which is one of the cognate bills in this debate. This bill deals with the Tutorial Credit Initiative. It can be argued that this is a worthy initiative. While we may say there are better ways to do it, anything which gives money to students who are not reaching educational standards money to allow them to get extra private tuition is certainly better than nothing. The Minister for Education, Science and Training announced in May this year that this grant would apply in New South Wales to some 7,330 students who did not meet the year 3 benchmarks. In fairness to him, he said that this would apply only if the New South Wales government signed up for the program and posted the results of the test to parents in the school. At that stage the New South Wales government did not have that policy. Later on the minister announced that New South Wales would miss out on the money because it had not complied. The only problem was that he was wrong: New South Wales had done that one month before. Ms Hall-Playing politics.",117
199,Mr BOWEN,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"He was caught out playing as my colleague says. The result is that not one cent has been paid to a student us in New South Wales-not in my electorate or in any other electorate in New South Wales. And only now, today, are we debating the bill which will allow that to happen. Term 3 has come and gone, term 4 has almost gone and it will not be until next year that any of this money is paid to students to help them. We all know that, when you are a student struggling to keep up in class and to keep up with the curriculum, every day counts and another day falling behind is another day towards big trouble for your future education. So I am quite disappointed that we are only debating this bill today, when the government had initially said that it would be in place much earlier-and it got it wrong with the biggest state in Australia and simply did not know that New South Wales had already agreed to the conditions of the funding. In conclusion, the Labor Party will support this legislation, not with any great sense of happiness. We will support it only because there are many schools relying on the funding. If this bill were not passed by the House, many non-government schools would simply not be able to operate past the first part of next year. As I said, an amendment has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and seconded by me, to make the government's policy much fairer, to make the education funding arrangements much more transparent and to provide a bit more funding based on need, which is really the way that education funding in this nation should be conducted if we are to have a dignified and decent education policy. Some people say that there is not much difference between Labor and Liberal anymore. I am sure members on both sides of the House have heard that. Here is evidence of a stark difference. On the one hand we have a government sticking to its funding policy, which has no credibility and which I find offensive and which sees hundreds of thousands of students going without the education funding for their schools that they deserve. On the other hand, we have those on this side of the House arguing vigorously and passionately-and we will continue to do so-that schools should be funded on the basis of need and need alone. Regardless of whether they are government or nongovernment, the needs of the school and the students should be the basis for that funding. I am very proud to be able to support Labor's amendment and will continue to argue vigorously for the amendment.",120
200,Ms HALL,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker, on being appointed to the Speaker's panel. I know that you will do a fine job. The Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 provides $33 billion in funding to government, Catholic and independent schools-quite a significant amount of money. Obviously this is a very important piece of legislation. While there are many aspects of this legislation that are obnoxious to members on this side of the House, we accept that the funding for 2005 would be threatened if this bill were not passed by the end of the year. This would disadvantage those schools that are already disadvantaged by the odious legislation. The government's commitment to a policy of elitism, a policy that advantages the wealthiest and most elite schools in Australia whilst disadvantaging the most disadvantaged schools in Australia, has been to the disadvantage of all Australian students and will disadvantage Australia well into the future. As the representative of the people of Shortland in this parliament, I think it is really important that I put before the House the break-up of the attendance of students in schools in the Shortland electorate. Eighty per cent of students attend government schools. Of the remaining 20 per cent, over 14 per cent attend Catholic schools and the remainder attend independent schools. These schools are far from the elite schools that have attracted a considerable amount of money under this government. The thing that really concerns me about this piece of legislation is that it extends the inequities in funding that already exist and the inequities that this government is introducing. As a member representing an electorate whose students will not be advantaged in any way by the government's current policy focus, I feel it is very important to put before this House my objections to this legislation. I will concentrate a little bit on some of the inequities I see in this legislation. There are virtually no recurrent increases above indexation to government schools. You can see how abhorrent that is to the schools and the students within the electorate of Shortland, with 80 per cent of those students attending government schools. The measures in this legislation continue for another four years increases of 200 per cent or more to some of the best resourced independent schools in Australia. I, like all members on this side of the parliament, believe that parents should have choice, but they should have real choice. The parents of children who live in Windale, the most disadvantaged area in Australia-an area in my electorate that has been identified in many reports-could not envisage for one moment that they have the ability to make the choice to send their children to King's School or any of the other elite schools, because they do not receive that much money in a year. I really feel that this legislation just continues that disadvantage. There is also a lack of funding security beyond 2008 for the 60 per cent of Catholic systemic schools which have been categorised as ‘funding maintained' to avoid the funding cuts that would have applied if Catholic schools had been funded at the level set for their socio-economic scores. These are quite serious concerns for me. When I spoke on this legislation the last time it came before the House I outlined how disadvantaged schools in Shortland were and how advantaged they would be if they were funded in the same way as elite schools. At that time. I highlighted what it would mean to a number of the schools if the Howard government gave them the same amount of federal funding that it lavished on private schools. I will touch on a couple of high schools within the electorate. Gorokan Public School would receive $2,879,363.20 more in funding if it were funded at the same level as private schools are funded on average. Gorokan is not a wealthy area. A number of significantly disadvantaged children attend the school. This is an area that has been hit by this government's funding formula. Hunter Sports High School is in an area of great disadvantage within the Shortland electorate. It is a selective sports high school but it is also the school that students from the most disadvantaged areas of the electorate feed into. If that school were funded in the same way as private schools are funded, it would receive an extra $2,207,978,000. I cannot see the fairness in this. I cannot see how the children who attend these schools are being given the same choices and advantages in life as the students who are the favourites of this government-those students who attend the more prestigious schools that attract a higher level of funding than public schools. I must pay credit to the dedicated teachers, the committed students and the parents that give support to all the students in these schools. Another very disadvantaged high school within the Shortland electorate is North Lakes High School. If it were funded in the same way it would be $2,637,083.20 better off. If they were funded in the same way, Swansea High School would be nearly $2 million better off., Toukley Public School would be nearly $2 million better off, and Whitebridge High School would be over $3 million better off. What I am arguing for is a better deal for equity. I am not asking for these schools to be treated any differently to the way that elite schools with outstanding resources are treated. I cannot see the argument for giving more money to schools just because they have got more resources. I actually look at it from a different perspective. I think that if a school is needy then it is beholden on a government to ensure that that school receives more resources. The government takes quite a different approach to that of the opposition. We understand that education and children are the future of this nation. There is nothing to be gained by treating one group of children differently to another group of children. All children should have the opportunity to succeed and all children should have a real choice. We believe in equity. We believe that equity could be achieved through putting in place national priorities for public schools, through ensuring that all children have an entitlement to a national standard of resources and results and through ensuring priority in funding against the principles of educational and financial needs. That is what I have been arguing for throughout my contribution to this debate. Funding should be based on educational and financial needs and there should be a national agreement with the states on funding policies for all schools. This is what I am committed to, and this is what we on this side of the House are committed to. I am very supportive of the amendment moved by the shadow minister in which she condemned the government for its unfair schools funding policy. I think I have demonstrated how that unfair policy is affecting students who attend schools in the electorate I represent in this parliament. The amendment also states that there is a need to restore integrity and sustainability to Commonwealth funding of schools-I do not know how anyone could argue against that- emphasises the need to support high-quality education for all students attending all schools, recognises the entitlement of children and young people to national standards of educational results and resources that I highlighted earlier, and recognises the rights of parents to choose the type of schooling their children have. Once again, I emphasise that that has to be real choice, and that funding has to be directed towards the needs of children who are attending schools. I believe a number of real issues have been overlooked in this legislation. It really worries me that so many students, and their parents, whom I represent in this parliament are going to be disadvantaged by this piece of legislation, and I do not think that is the way it should be. This legislation also includes an additional $1 billion for capital grants in government and non-government schools-that is, $700 million for government schools and $300 million for nongovernment schools. This is an interesting inclusion in the legislation. It is a real ‘Brendan Nelson special', or, as the Australian Financial Review describes it, an act by a minister who likes to play the white knight to state schools that he perceives are in distress, particularly if they are in marginal seats. This is something I would like to take up. I believe the minister made an announcement at Para Vista Primary School in the seat of Makin and Metella Road Public School in the seat of Greenway during the election campaign. It is interesting that in the lead-up to the election these public schools in marginal electorates were, and will be, beneficiaries of this new initiative. But it is good to see schools getting extra money. I certainly intend to ensure that all schools in the Shortland electorate are very aware of this. I find it interesting that the legislation will put in place a framework whereby in government schools P&Cs will be making applications to the government but in non-government schools this is not allowed. I think there needs to be an evenhandedness about the legislation. For the record, I will mention some of the work we would like done at schools in the Shortland electorate. Floraville Public School would like a library technology space, a hall space and an admin area. Valenpublic tine Public School desperately needs a school hall and air conditioning. I note that air conditioning is one of the things that seems to have the minister's favour, so the school will certainly be putting in an applicafore, tion for those things. Swansea Public School needs an assembly hall. Gwandalan are looking at some sort of capital works to help them set up a school and communities program. They need an area where they can run that, and, of course, they need shade areas in the school. Lake Munmorah High School needs air conditioning. I believe that Gorokan High School need a refurbishment of their performing arts school and are in desperate need of a facility for performing arts. The Gorokan High School band is one of the finest bands in Australia. It has performed throughout the world and has received recognition at a number of competitions. Charlestown East Public School needs a canteen upgrade. Whitebridge High School needs capital works for a security fence. Dudley Public School has some issues toothey also want a security fence. I will be encouraging Gateshead High School to put in an application for a security fence. As I mentioned earlier, Whitebridge High School is considerably underfunded. This school also needs a number of things: a security fence, asphalt and some carpet. The schools within my electorate will be putting in for this funding. I will be watching very closely to see how the applications fare and to see that there is no preferential ment. From the time those applications go in, I will be monitoring their progress. The other issue I would quickly like to touch on is literacy tutorial assistance, announced by the minister in May 2004. My office has been contacted about this proposal. Seven months later, we are debating the legislation to put some teeth in the proposal and to deliver the $700 voucher the minister talked about. As I mentioned, a number of constituents have contacted me. One woman, whose child was experiencing extreme difficulty, contacted me. Her child failed the test not this year but the year beso that would rule her out. I have had a series of people contact me and it seems to me as though it is going to be just a little bit too late for them. There are some problems with the proposal. I question the amount of money that will be available to families. The fact is that 10 per cent of students fail the year 3 national reading benchmark. A quick mathematical analysis shows that each student would probably get about $420. There are problems with the operation and administration of the program and implications for current literacy programs. So there are some things that need to be worked through. I strongly support the amendment that was moved by the shadow minister. This amendment dramatically improves the legislation. It is an amendment that will deliver fairer funding and improve educational quality. I strongly disagree with the government's unfair schools funding system, a system that has given the biggest increase to wealthier schools and to those in least need. It has really disadvantaged the students in the area that I represent in this parliament. I do not think that that is in any way fair. But, as we have said, we on this side House will not do anything to jeopardise the funding to those schools, which would be the case if we detreatlayed these bills. Mr Hockey-Huh.",121
201,Ms HALL,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I see that the minister may have a few concerns about the equity and fairness of the scheme. I think he was supporting my comments just a moment ago. Labor's amendment is about the principles of fairness and equity in student funding. I support fairness and equity for all students. Mr Hockey-I rise on a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. The honourable member has impugned me with her words. I just want it noted that I do not accept her verbalisation of my comments.",124
202,Ms HALL,SECONDARY EDUCATION,I support fairness and equity in education and I believe that the amendment moved by the shadow minister will deliver that. (Time expired),125
203,Mr ANDREN,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Calare) (5.55 p.m.)Madam Deputy Speaker, I welcome you to the chair and hope for a long and prosperous relationship in this chamber. The Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 sets out the government's specific purpose funding for non-government and government schools over the next four years. It deals with Commonwealth recurrent funding to non-government schools, in addition to some new capital funding measures for this quadrennium, as well as new measures for students with disabilities and special needs and students from rural areas. In this contribution, I will again be looking at believe to be the central problem with Commonwealth recurrent funding for nongovernment schools: the socio-economic status model by which funding is allocated. As I have said on many occasions in the past, the most important thing is that funding goes to where the need is greatest. This is a matter of redirecting funds from one school to another in a discretionary matter; it is about correcting the formula that has resulted in the allocation of significant funds to schools that certainly do not deserve them ahead of others that certainly do. As I said previously, there needs to be not only the appearance but the reality of equity in our education funding. I do not oppose the passage of this bill, not because it is totally fair but because the Department of Education, Science and Training is due to make its first payments to schools in January next year and this cannot happen without this bill's passage. Also, the passage of the cognate bill, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which makes necessary technical adjustments to current funding allocations, is also contingent on the passage of the learning together bill. That being said, I have no reservation in continuing to speak out for a change to the flawed basis on which funds are allocated: the SES funding model. I would, however, like to recognise some of the positive aspects of the learning together bill, especially in regard to the increase in capital funding for both nongovernment and government schools, including the honouring of the government's election commitment to provide an extra $1 billion for infrastructure improvements, described in the Parliamentary Library's Bill's Digest as library resources, computer facilities, air conditioning and heating, playground what I shading and sports and play equipment. In the recent by-election for Dubbo, air conditioning was brought up in relation to Parkes. I long remember Parkes High School. The debate about air conditioning has probably been going on for two decades. It is about the imaginary line drawn down the not centre of the state, to the east of which you do not get air conditioning, to the west of which you do. Here we go again. We still have state governments debating the virtues of air conditioning in what by any standard is one hell of a hot town and school. According to the Bill's Digest, the guidelines for how these grants will work are yet to be established, and I look forward to their release next year. What we do know is that the Commonwealth will be bypassing the states in its delivery of this money. I do not have any problem with this-it has been done before by federal governments-as long as it is provided equitably, transparently and with strenuous accountability. The bill's provision of funding for nongovernment rural student hostels accommodating students from remote areas where appropriate schooling is not available is encouraging and will provide for some 1,000 students. These hostels also receive funding from state governments, as do hostels for rural government school students. Increases in the basic boarding allowance from almost $4,500 to $6,000 and in the distance education allowance, which is up to $3,000, are also very positive things. These allowances are provided under the Assistance for Isolated Children scheme. In general, the scheme provides this assistance for children who are unable to attend an appropriate government school on a daily basis due to geographic isolation. The SES funding model has been the basis on which Commonwealth funds have been allocated to non-government schools since 2001. Until now, schools in the Catholic education system have been separate from this model, but with the passage of this bill they too will be included under the SES based scheme. According to the minister, this will see an increase in funding to Catholic schools of $368 million over the four years from 2005. Whilst this looks good on paper, I wonder if we will see the same bizarre cations of Commonwealth funds to wealthy Catholic schools that we have seen with other independent schools under the SES model since it began. The SES score allocated to a school is legedly a measure of the capacity of the school community to support that school. The SES score incorporates postcode based income, education and occupational data and is arrived at by linking student residential addresses to census collection districts. A school's average SES score determines the general recurrent funding per student as a percentage of the average government school's recurrent costs. This may sound fair, but I argue it is not. Let me quote from an item on the AEU web site which has been repeated elsewhere, in other literature, which says: Because the SES is based on the average income of the Census Collection District from which the students come, not the income of the actual parents of the schools, it gives distorted results. … the SES of a school is based on the income level of the neighbours of the students, not the families of the student themselves. … … … The SES model takes no account of the resources available to a school such as the fees it collects, bequests, investments and other private income. Because of this, schools with resources most can only dream of are given large grants by the … Government. This is not about envy and the rights of parents to choose; it is about equity. I believe there is an easy way of solving this problem: by indexing schools right across the board. A Sydney high school, say, could be high on the list by virtue of funding, above many independent schools. Base it on a fair index of need, not on what I regard as the flawed SES formula we have at the moment. In submissions to the government since the SES scheme was introduced, I have allopointed out that the scheme lacks several crucial measures of equity. The SES score of a school does not necessarily reflect student status, as that earlier excerpt showed. The distortion that is possible when a child from a very well off family from the CCD of al- Bourke or elsewhere in rural Australia is measured against the SES for that district is obvious. The anomaly turns up in boarding schools, where students are more likely to be drawn from areas where extremes of wealth and poverty are likely to coexist. As we have seen since 2001 and the introduction of the SES, this anomaly is illustrated by the fact that some of the biggest winners are the bigger boarding schools. I believe such funding is unwarranted and frees up the fundraising capacity of such schools, and so the gap between the haves and have-nots of education widens. I have made this point many times in the debate and I will continue to do so until I get a convinctracted ing counterargument that dismisses my concerns. The SES formula may be an improvement on what we had before, but it is not good enough. I recommended back in 2000 that the Youth Allowance test be applied to all independent school students as a basic test of funding equity. I would like the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who has just entered the chamber, to explain why this formula-the Youth Allowance test-cannot be utilised to more effectively allocate funding. I do not care if it is applied to all dents, public and independent, right across the board, in order to achieve a fair funding index for all schools. The government argues that it is too difficult or too intrusive to ask parents for inforthat mation about their occupation and income. We do it in areas such as the Medicare safety net, family payments and every other area of Centrelink expenditure. It is ridiculous to suggest we cannot achieve it in relation to education payments. This information and indexing would ensure not only the perception of fairness but, I believe, the reality fairness in our funding of the system. Certainly, the government's decision to include a ‘no losers' aspect to the 2005-08 quadrennium under which schools whose SES score in 2005 determines they receive less funding than they did in 2004 will have their allocation maintained at the 2004 level. Again, I question whether this is an entirely fair approach to the allocation of finite resources. If the government is confident the SES score is the most equitable way to allocate schools funding, why should any one school's funding be maintained at a level higher that what is determined by its SES score, transitional or otherwise? This bill's provision of performance framework measures is an area that has atmedia attention. Much of this has been focused on flags and flagpoles and a charter of values to hang on the wall. Certainly, I question the effectiveness of such symbolic attempts to instil in students civic values and citizenship. It would perhaps be of far more value to involve the members more in visits to schools to explain the processes, to talk about being an Australian in an Australian democracy and debate with the kids the issues they want to raise with us. I take great pride, and I know we all do, in talking to the kids when they come here. I stumake a point, and I suppose others do too, of handing out the certificates back at the school-not here, but going to the school and asking, ‘What did you see? What questions have you got?' and then, at the end of process, giving them their symbolic representation of their exchange with the parliament. That has far more value than insisting on saluting the flag and things like that. To talk about making values a core part of schooling begs the question of whose values we are to encourage and how they will be determined. I will certainly not support of measures that see increased sectarianism between and within our schools, and that appears to be a consequence of an education policy that is allowing the spread of schools because of the choice mantra and is creating a plethora of schools that are going to expect, quite rightly according to the processes we have in place, finite dollars based on a narrower and narrower basis of teaching. I know we have the curriculum in place, but it does concern me that we are not being inclusive enough in our education. The problem has been there, perhaps, since the 1800s, when the church schools were established in this country. You cannot say, ‘Well, the Catholic sector and the Anglicans can continue, but the Hindus and the Muslims cannot set up a school,' or whatever, but it does concern me that we are dividing up the school population into smaller and smaller units. While choice may sound like a wonderful concept, I think we should pause to wonder how inclusive our education system should be, if we are talking about Australian values. The minister looks puzzled. Mr Hockey-I'm puzzled. I don't know what you're trying to say.",125
204,Mr ANDREN,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I am suggesting that we are divvying up our school population into smaller and smaller school units, each with a narrower base of education and training. I see danger signals in a process such as that. We seem to be taking resources away from the public system to spread over a growing independent school sector, and I think there are danger signs there of diminished funds being available for all schools because of the growth of those independent schools. I would rather see more resources directed to other measures in the performance framework, such as teacher development leading to better qualified and equipped teachers. I do think the practical measures in the framework-such as greater consistency in curriculum and testing standards, improved literacy and numeracy, standard plain English reporting and creating safer schools-are all very worthwhile. A more practical approach in schools funding all around, especially in addressing real need where it occurs through a revised funding model, would greatly improve outcomes for all schools. Let us look at a model like aged care funding, where the government has made significant improvements based on capacity to pay and where a necessary three-star standard has been established across the board. Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, you had a role in that process. It has been a significant improvement by this government, and it has raised the standards and set standards of performance, facilities, safety and so on. I think in there is perhaps a model where those wanting, and prepared to pay more for, a fouror five-star service can do so. Surely that is the choice that we are offering in the independent or private school sector, but we must guarantee a basic standard of educational opportunity to every child in this country, whether they are at Yeoval Central School, Clergate school north of Orangewhere I was the other day-or St Edwards at Canowindra. We do not have it at the moment, and a distorted funding formula not based on true need exacerbates the differences in access to quality education, which is a birth right whether you live in Kandos and attend Kandos High School or in Killara and attend Ku-ring-gai High School or Knox, up the road. While I do not normally vote on second reading amendments, I am compelled in this case to recognise the validity of the opposition's statement in their second reading amendment. I am very pleased to see some detailed amendments to this legislation. Perhaps this may be one of the positive outcomes of the parliamentary process we will have after June next year. Perhaps finally we might have the House of Representatives initiating amendments to bills in this chamber and having proper debate around those amendments, rather than deferring it to the other place, which has become the de facto legislative chamber of this parliament to the point where this House runs the risk of becoming an irrelevant backwater in one of the so-called greatest democracies on earth. I will examine the arguments around the proposed amendments, particularly 31A in proposed section (7) of the amendment. I commend the part which says: ... reporting by schools on students' learning include a comprehensive range of information of related factors that includes: (i) the total resources available to each school from all sources; (ii) enrolment policies and practices, including information on the enrolment of indigenous students and students with disabilitiesand the other points that are included there. This, I suggest, indicates a true socio-economic status approach to education, where all factors are taken into account within a school with regard to both the individual and collective performances of that school. There are many factors that disadvantage the public school sector, including not only the socio-economic status of the parents and the towns and areas from which many of those kids come but, if you like, the hampering processes by students who might not want to be there. They are disruptive, and in my observation you do not see many of the independent schools tackling a lot of those problems in the serious way they require. I have seen a willingness to expel students all too readily from the independent sector, with almost no questions asked. And who has to pick up the pieces? The public school sector. These are factors that need to be taken into account in delivering, where necessary, one-to-one facilities to enable public school teachers in this regard. Having been a teacher, and having been a parent of students in both the public and independent school sectors, I know. I will leave my contribution at that point.",128
205,Dr NELSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I thank the honourable members who have contributed to the debate on the Schools Assistance (Learning Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. The former bill provides $33 billion for schools over must the next four years, 2005-08. This is an increase of $9.5 billion over the current quadrennium. This bill reflects the government's policy decisions relating to the forthcoming quadrennium and provides funding to implement key election promises in regard to school capital infrastructure in school term hostels. It goes without saying that state schools are owned, operated, administered and primarily funded by state governments and that when state governments do fund state schools almost half of the money originally comes from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's role is to supplement the states for the funding of their schools. In this bill there is $10.8 billion, which is a $2.9 billion increase, for state schools over the next four years. Importantly for the states, in response to lobbying from the state education ministers the Australian government school recurrent cost index will be maintained. The opposition describes this as ‘just indexation'. In fact, it ought to be pointed out that in October I announced that we will be supplementing school funding by 8.7 per cent for primary schools and 7.2 per cent for secondary schools. If there were any other model of indexation for schools then I am sure the opposition would be quite concerned. The average government school recurrent cost, which also applies to nongovernment schools, delivers increases to those schools based on running costs. The Labor Party's own policy, which we understand it has endorsed, would, over a six-year period, take every one of the nongovernment schools from AGSRC-average government school recurrent cost-to a new formula which is a composite of wage cost Together- index and consumer price index and would deliver about three per cent per annum. No wonder Cardinal Pell and three other bishops were quite concerned about Labor's policy, not only in terms of its sectarian nature but also because over a six-year period-as the member for Jagajaga advised an audience on 16 September in Brisbane-all of the Catholic schools would move to the so-called resource index, at which point they would go to a level of indexation which is half of is being delivered by AGSRC. The Catholic Education Commission has also agreed to join the socio-economic status funding model, as a result of which the Catholic schools will be receiving an additional $368 million over the next four years, above and beyond what they otherwise would have received. That brings recurrent funding to Catholic systemic schools over the next four years to $12.8 billion. Independent schools will receive $7.8 billion in recurrent funding. Funding maintenance will continue, and guaranteed funding has been introduced. In other words, this government is not about cutting the funding of the tion of any particular student until supplementation and their SES score and average government school recurrent cost catches up with them. There will be $2.1 billion for a new overarching targeted program: the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs Program. That is a $393 million increase on the current quadrennium. It includes $117 million to assist geographically isolated children, $245 million to assist newly arrived students of non-English speaking backgrounds and $114 million to improve learning outcomes of students learning languages other than English. Over the next four years $2.5 billion for school capital will be provided, which includes an additional $1 billion, as announced during the recent election campaign. Of that, $700 million will go to government schools and $300 million to non-government schools. This bill fulfils an election commitment provide non-government school term hostels with a grant of $2,500 per child per the next four years. It also introduces a series of conditions for the first time in relation to government and non-government schools that receive funding from the Australian what government. By 2010 there will be a common starting age in schooling and improved reporting to parents of the progress of children through their schooling-reports in plain language where students are ranked compared to other students in the class according to quartiles. I know somebody needs to be in the bottom 25 per cent of the class, but, if my son is there, I want to know about it because that means that he will be more likely to have a problem. We will be returning to rankings. However else government and non-government schools choose to report to parents, there will be rankings of A, B, C, D and E-the avereducaage parent knows what that means-and descriptions of children's progress in school will be written in absolutely plain language, without the politically correct jargon and computer generated reports which seem to permeate much of school reporting throughout Australia. This government want to see an end to that. We will also make sure that information is available to parents and the community about the performance of a school. The literacy and numeracy benchmark performances of the students in years 3, 5 and 7 will be published and available to parents and the broader community. Median year 9, year 10 and year 12 results will be available. Information on teacher qualifications, teacher participation in ongoing professional learning, teacher retention rates, teacher attendance rates at school and student attendance rates at school will be made available to the community. These can be provided in a number of to ways, whether on a web site, through signage, through school newsletters or through year over publication in other areas. There will also be common testing throughout Australia in the key milestones of education: in science, in information and communication technology, in literacy and numeracy and in civics and democracy. What we want to ensure is that we do not have the mediocrity of a national curriculum but that in the key milestones of education children, irrespective of the state or part of Australia which they are being educated, at least face common tests so that we can make sure that we have common outcomes. It is also a requirement of the legislation that the principal will have a say over who teaches in a school. For principals in South Australia and Victoria that is quite an unremarkable thing. For principals in nongovernment schools of course that is day-today life in the way that the schools actually function. But in some parts of Australia principals are basically sent 10 teachers by an education bureaucracy-that is otherwise known as a politburo in my world-and told that all of these teachers are of high quality and they should take them. What this legislation requires in all schools that receive funding from this government to support education will mean that the principal will have a say about who teaches in that school. In remote areas in some parts of Australia, particularly western Queensland, western New South Wales and the remote parts of Western Australia, there are arrangements in terms of attracting teachers into otherwise unattractive areas. Naturally, we will work with school authorities to ensure there is no discrimination undertaken by principals in city based schools against teachers who are returning from remote secondment. There will also be a requirement for compliance with the National Safe Schools Framework, which was developed over a 12month period of consultation with all of the school sectors and the parent organisations. There will be at least two hours of physical activity provided in every school on a weekly basis. This states grants amendment bill will do two things, essentially. It will provide funding to support the implementation of the tutorial credit initiative. In fact, only when I announced that the government would provide a $700 tutorial credit for students who in did not pass the 2003 national year 3 reading benchmark did we finally have the four states and territories that had held out on this agreeing to report directly to parents the results of those 2003 benchmark tests. It has been a long, hard road in, firstly, developing national literacy and numeracy benchmarks and also getting states and territories to test the students in the government school systems and collect the information. It is a condition of this legislation that every school sector will report to parents the result of national literacy and numeracy benchmarks of students. Once this states grants amendment bill is passed, there will be a $700 voucher available for the parents of the 24,000 Australian students who did not pass the national year 3 reading benchmark in 2003, and we will be undertaking systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of that. The government is maintaining and indeed, as I have said, increasing funding to the programs that already provide support for students with learning needs, but I have a sense that parents like the idea of being able to have a voucher which they can redeem either at the school or with a tutor and which will be recognised by one of the brokers that we will be engaging to organise this. Getting some one-to-one help for their child is something that is likely to help their childMs Macklin-When?",129
206,Dr NELSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"These vouchers will be delivered in the first semester of next year. The bill also addresses a technical defect in the states grants act so that 700 nongovernment schools can receive their correct entitlement under the general current grants program in 2004. There are a number of issues that were raised during the course of the debate to which I will respond. The opposition cited some figures in relation to average per capita expenditure in government schools as being $336 per student in 2001 compared with $1,600 per student at independent schools. In fact, these are not figures that relate to tralian government funding at allMs Macklin-Total.",131
207,Dr NELSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"There we go. They do not actually relate to total government funding. In 2003 the per capita figure from the Commonwealth government to schools was $76 per child for a student in an independent school and the much demonised King's School and those sorts of schools do not get a dollar out of capital works programs. It is $95 per child for students in Catholic schools and $106 for students in state schools. As a result of this bill, there will be I think next year $117 per child in a government school, $116 per child in a Catholic school and $76 per child in an independent school. The figures will widen over the next quadrennium as the new $1 billion program is introduced. It has also been said by some that these bills continue to favour a small number of students in the most expensive schools and neglect the vast majority of students in government schools and needy non-government schools-this is according to the opposition. The fact is that what the opposition has conveniently neglected to mention in the course of talking about state schools and students in them is the role of the state governments, which provide 88 per cent of the funding to students in government schools. This year this government will be increasing its funding to state schools by 11.6 per cent. Madam Deputy Speaker, you will not find a state government in Australia that has increased funding by 11.6 per cent. You will not find one that has increased it by 10, nine, eight, or seven per cent. There is not a state government in Australia that has done that. The closest is the New South Wales government at 6.7 per cent. By the way, it cut its capital works budget by 11.4 per cent. This government has increased its funding to state schools by 79 per cent since 1996 when enAusrolments have increased in the government sector by 1½ per cent. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the high-fee schools educate five per cent of Australian students. In fact, it is about 4.5 per cent. They receive in total 1.4 per cent of all of the public funding into education. The question was asked: why is it 13.7 per cent of average government school recurrent costs? That is equivalent to the 1998 category 1 funding rate for secondary schools. The primary rate was 12 per cent. Then it was asked of me: why, for the students who come from the poorest families was it 70 per cent of average school recurrent costs? Under Labor it was 59 per cent-that was the maximum they could possibly get. It is 70 per cent because we thought the students from the poorest families should get more support than the students from the wealthiest families. The other point that needs to be made is this: it is quite clear, from everything that the Labor Party has said and done over the last five years, that Labor is opposed to parents who choose to send their children to nongovernment schools. In fact, ALP should stand for ‘against learning privately'. The Labor Party yesterday endorsed its education policy. In fact, a media release that was issued by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, ‘Caucus Endorses Labor's Education Policies'. In other words, the Labor Party has decided to endorse its education policies. I read a very interesting report in the Courier Mail this morning, and it said: A Caucus spokeswoman denied the decision meant Labor would again take a hit list of private schools to the next election. Haven't the Labor Party spent the last four years-in particular, the last yearconstantly criticising parents who choose to send their children to non-government schools? Haven't they argued persistently that they were going to cut the funding from students who attend certain non-government schools? In fact, during the election campaign, after five months of agitating from me, they finally produced a hit list of 178 schools that were going to have their funding cut or frozen in the first instance; and over a six-year period they would all go from average government school recurrent cost to an indexation model which is half what AGSRC was. That was the Labor Party policy. Yesterday they said they have endorsed their education policies, but then I read in the Courier-Mail that the Labor caucus spokeswoman: … admitted “there will be redistribution”, meaning some schools would lose funding. “We're not specifying the degree or the quality the cuts, but we are committed to redistribution.” What sort of nonsense is this? Labor's policy today is that they will cut the funding to an indeterminate number of non-government schools. They are not going to tell us how much they are going to cut funding-they are not going to tell us the degree or the quality of the cuts-but they are going to redistribute funding. Apparently, in Labor's world, you can redistribute funding without actually cutting it from certain schools. The reality is that the Labor Party have a problem with parents who make sacrifices. The reality is that for every child whose school was on that hit list-Labor's policy which was endorsed yesterdayMs Macklin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is a summing up of a bill. This has absolutely nothing to do with the content of the bill the minister is summarising.",132
208,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,There is no point of order.,133
209,Dr NELSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"What kind of nonsense is this: the Labor Party are going to redistribute funding from some schools to other schools, but they are not going to cut it. The Labor Party caucus had a meeting and decided that they were not going to cut the funding for the education of at least 160,000 students. They said, ‘That's not the problem.' They also said that the problem is not that they have a leader who is frothing at the mouth and wanting to punish parents who want to make sacrifices for the education of their children. They have decided that the problem is that they actually listed the schools that they intend to punish. Labor have decided that their problem is not that they have a policy of cutting funding to parents who make sacrifices to send their children to non-government schools. They decided that their problem was that they created a list. In other words, Labor of are saying to the parents of 1.1 million children in Catholic and independent schools: as long as Labor maintain their policy as it is, your child is at risk of having his or her education funding cut. During the election campaign, Channel 9's A Current Affair did a story on Labor's policy. They went out to the much demonised King's School, and the first mother they interviewed said, ‘I am working flat out.' And she said, ‘My my husband is in Iraq, serving with the Australian Navy and Mr Latham now wants to cut funding for my child's education.' The reality is that if a child goes to a government school he gets $1 of public funding. If the same child leaves that government school and goes to the King's School, he will get 25c. If he goes to the Scots College, thanks to the fellow travellers in the Australian Education Union, that child will get onesixth of the money he would get in a public school. The Labor Party are peddling mistruths and deception, and it is quite clear that Elson, K.S. the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have a policy of punishing parents who make sacrificesoften extreme sacrifices-for the education of their children. I say to those parents: we in Henry, S. the Howard government will stand by you and will support you. (Time expired) Ms Macklin-We all know that you'll stand by the wealthy forever.",133

213,Ms MACKLIN,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Jagajaga) (6.46 p.m.)by leave-I move opposition amendments (1) to (9) as circulated in my name: (1) Clause 4, page 7 (after line 6), insert the following definition need means an assessment of the educational and financial circumstances of a school and its community, including the varying educational programs required for individual students and groups of students to achieve national educational goals and the level of recurrent and capital resources available to a school from all public and private sources.

(5) Clause 31, page 30 (after line 18), after paragraph (a) insert the following paragraph (aa) a commitment by the relevant authority to give priority in the allocation of funding according to need; and (6) Clause 31, page 31 (line 30) to 32 (line 2), omit paragraph 31(1), substitute the following paragraph: (l) a commitment by the relevant authority that: (i) appointments of staff in each school or each school in the approved school system will be made with the approval of the principal, or the governing body, of the school or each of those schools; and (ii) such appointments will take account of the relationship of the school to the relevant school or system authority and the need for system wide strategies to recruit teaching staff where there are shortages in particular geographical and curriculum areas; and (7) Page 32 (after line 28), after clause 31, insert the following new clause 31A Principles for reporting on students' learning and school performance For the purposes of section 31, including but not limited to the reporting requirements in paragraphs 31 (1) (c), (d), (e), (n), (p) and (r) and related paragraphs 36 (3) (d), (e) and (f), the agreement must include reporting on students' learning and schools' performance that is consistent with the following principles: (a) reporting by schools to parents and to the community must always be in the educational interests of students; (b) information from school reports is to provide assistance to schools and to teachers to inquire into students' learning needs and to develop teaching programs for those students; (c) reporting by schools on students' learning must include a comprehensive range of information of related factors that includes: (i) the total resources available to each school from all sources; (ii) enrolment policies and practices, including information on the enrolment of Indigenous students and students with disabilities; (iii) student admission and exclusion policies and practices; (iv) qualifications and accreditation standings of teaching staff; (v) curriculum offerings at the school; and (vi) policies and programs for student discipline and welfare, antibullying and child protection; (d) the content and format of school reports are to be developed following consultation with parents and school community organisations. (8) Clause 69, page 63 (after line 17), at the end of the clause add the following sub clause (3) Financial assistance for capital expenditure under subsections (1) and (2) will be allocated to schools according to need and on the basis of system wide priorities that have been determined through arrangements that have provided an advisory role for representatives of parents in the setting of those priorities. (9) Clause 99, page 82 (after line 20), at the end of the clause add the following sub clause (3) Financial assistance for capital expenditure under subsections (1) and (2) will be allocated to schools according to need and on the basis of system wide priorities in the case of approved government school systems, or statewide priorities in the case of independcount ent schools, that have been determined through arrangements that have provided an advisory role for representatives of parents in the setting of priorities. The primary purpose of the amendments that I am moving tonight is to insert the definition of need into this legislation. This is an area where there is a fundamental difference of view between the government and ourselves and, while I certainly will not behave as the minister did at the dispatch box just now, I want to correct some of the things that he said. First and foremost, Labor believe in funding all schools-government and nongovernment-on the basis of need. We certainly do recognise that parents want a choice about where to send their children, and our fundamental view is that schools should be funded on the basis of need. Any parent listening tonight should completely discount the diatribe we have just had from the minister, because Labor have supported the funding of non-government schools on the basis of need for 30 years, and we will continue to do so. Unfortunately, there is no definition or principle of need contained in this legislation. That is why I am proposing to insert that through the amendments that are before us right now. Unlike the legislation we are debating, the amendments provide an explicit reference point for the allocation of funds in Commonwealth programs, and I want to specifically refer to our view that it would be desirable to have the definition of need inserted not only for recurrent funding but also for capital funding. Our definition has two elements: educational need-that relates to particular students, whether they are Indigenous students, students from poorer backgrounds or students with a disnon- ability-and financial need. We on this side of the House recognise that it is important to all resources available to a school, not just those provided by the Commonwealth government, in assessing the need for a particular school to get additional funding from those the Commonwealth. That is a major area of difference between us, but I hope that the minister recognises that, as I said in my speech earlier today, we are putting these amendments forward in good faith-though his latest outburst would suggest not. I hope that he recognises that and takes them seriously. In terms of the general condition of need, amendments (2) and (5) give effect to the broad principle of distribution of funding across all programs for government schools. These are amendments that relate to government schools and are consistent with the definition amendment-that is, amendment (1). Amendments (2) and (5) also provide for the needs principle to be part of agreements with non-government school authorities. If passed, these amendments would require the needs principle to be part of the formal agreements with school authorities and in related accountability arrangements. I find it extraordinary that the minister thinks it is okay to have very detailed accountability arrangements on a whole range of thingswhich I actually do not have a problem with-but will, I fear, not agree to the principle of need in the funding of our schools. The principle as we have put it forward in these amendments is expressed in very broad terms. Nevertheless, I think it would mean that Commonwealth funding would meet the most important principle of making sure that both educational need and financial need are at the heart of this legislation. On the issue of the capital funding, amendments (8) and (9) attempt to address a number of problems that I think exist in the bill. (Extension of time granted) Once again, we certainly want to see the needs principle applied here. I would like to ask the minister a couple of questions in this regard, because this is an area where he has indicated, in some of his public remarks, that there will be some notion of need in the allocation of this funding. Obviously, the government funding will go to the government schools, but on the non-government side I understand that the minister said that the additional capital ing will go to ‘less well-off Catholic and dependent schools'. If the minister has a proposition for how ‘less well-off' is going to be defined, we would appreciate knowing that tonight. Maybe these amendments are not necessary if the minister has a way of defining what ‘less well-off' means. If he is going to show how this legislation defines ‘less well-off', I think that would help the House. Certainly in my reading of the legislation I have not been able to find ‘less off' defined. If the minister could assist on that issue, it might help the debate, particularly regarding these capital funding amendments.",135
214,Dr NELSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Firstly, in terms of need, the government has a socio-economic status funding formula. This broadly deals with the issue of need across the next quadrennium. Under the legislation, the 100 schools that will receive the most funding include 23 special schools and 73 schools with an SES score of 87. They will receive $1,484 per capita in the fourth year. The 100 schools receiving the lowest amount will receive $484 per childso, in other words, considerably less-and they have an average SES score of 121. Of the additional capital works money that was announced during the election campaign, $700 million for the government schools goes directly to the school principal and P&C-or the school council; however the parents group is structured. Then there is the $300 million that will go to the block grant authority. The block grant authority, as the opposition knows, is independent from the government. It comprises representatives from various components of the nongovernment sector. As should be well known but is often not represented as being such, the government's capital works funding for non-government schools does not go to the fundKing's School or Wesley or Ivanhoe Girlsin- those schools do not get it. In fact, at the moment, and it is being proposed here, the block grant authority will distribute the funding, essentially as it does now, to the Catholic, Christian, Anglican, Islamic, Aboriginal, Adventist and Lutheran community schools which are determined to be in greatest need on the basis of occupational health and safety needs and clear student load with capital infrastructure which is insufficient to meet it. wellThey obviously take into account the socio-economic profile of the parent body from which the students are actually drawn. One of things that we are doing, given that we are increasing the capital works funding which is available for the non-government sector by around 68 per cent over the next four years, is taking the opportunity to look at the functions and composition of the block grant authorities, in part with a view to seeing that we can perhaps get some direct parental representation into the block grant authorities as well. The reason there is nothing more specific than that in the proposed legislation is that, perhaps unlike the Labor Party, we actually think that we need to sit down and talk to the Catholic Education Commission and the Association of Independent Schools and work cooperatively with them and the parent organisations-the Australian Parents Council-in determining their view regarding any change to the structure or function of the block grant authorities.",138
215,Ms MACKLIN,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I take it from that that there will not be any definition in the bill, so the parliament will not have any oversight of what ‘less welloff' means. We will not receive any information here today about what that means-is that correct? There will not be any definition in the bill unless you agree to our amendment to insert the principle of need into capital funding. I think that is what you are cally saying-the system will just continue as it is. We have had this debate in relation another bill. When I tried to insert the needs principle into a previous schools capital bill, the minister then also refused to insert a definition of need in relation to capital funding. All we are seeking is that those block grant authorities be directed by the parliament to distribute their funding on the basis of need-that they are directed by the government's legislation to make sure that funding is delivered to the neediest schools. Like the government, we take the view that these are the places for the allocation of funding to be worked out, but what is extraordinary is that we have two completely different systems. We have one system for the government schools, where the government has decided to deal directly with individual government school parent groups, but when it comes to the non-government sector I cannot understand why parents are not included. There is not actually any mention of parents being required to be involved in the nongovernment sector. As the minister has just outlined, the system in the non-government sector is just going to be the same as it currently is. It is just going to go through the block grant authorities. In fact, what we are suggesting is that the legislation should require that parents be involved in the non-government sector. I think it is a good idea for parents to be involved, both in the government and non-government sectors, but for the life of me I cannot understand why it is good in the government sector but the minister does not think it is necessary in the non-government sector. You have just mentioned that you would like to involve parents, so maybe that is one area where you would be prepared to pick up our amendment which seeks to include parents. Amendments (8) and (9) are all about bringing some conbasi- sistency in approach across the public, Catholic and independent sectors. The to amendments would require parents to be explicitly involved in the process of setting priorities for capital expenditure. It is an area where we have some agreement that the involvement of parents is a good thing, but I do not know why it cannot apply to both sectors. We need to get some clarity about the fact that, if the Minister for Education, Science and Training does not agree to this change, there will not be any definition of need in relation to capital funding. Obviously we do not agree that the SES is a definition of need; otherwise, we would not have seen massive increases to the wealthier schools in this country over the last four years. But I understand we have a difference of view, and I do not want to take up the time of the House on that debate where we are so far apart. On the capital funding issue, the minister has said that he wants the money to go to less well-off Catholic and independent schools. So do we and we would like to see that in the bill. We also agree with the minisfrom ter that parents in both sectors should be volved. I commend to the minister amendments (8) and (9) on this capital issue. Could the minister also inform the House-given the time; I know this was not the original intention-when schools will be provided with the information that they will need to apply for the new capital funding and how that information will be made available.",139
216,Dr NELSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"The question itself about parental involvement in the non-government schools reflects a crippling ideology which permeates the Labor Party. It seems to not understand what is going on. Firstly, in the nongovernment sector, the capital works projects that are applied for are a product of the ents in the school community putting forward a particular project-the parents have already decided what the capital works project will be. Secondly, the parents are involved. I can tell you that they are very involved. They are paying a median fee of $2,850 a year to send their children to these schools. As everyone should know, when they send their child to a non-government school they receive less public funding. Every child in an independent school in Australia is carrying $4,240 in debt that the parents are paying in school fees. I can tell you that the parents are not only involved; they are very committed. The system of going directly to P&Cs, school councils and school principals in the government system is because at the moment state government education bureaucracies determine what the priorities are. We are trying to actively involve parents at the government school level. The block grant authorities are considering applications from school communities. As I said earlier, they are receiving from independent schools $76 per child in capital works, and $116 per child Catholic schools, versus the $117 from in- the government sector-from the Australian government. As I say, the block grant authorities are already distributing money on the basis of need according to SES, occupational health and safety, student capital ratios and so on. Early in the new school year, I will be writing to all of the state schools and the parent bodies and I will be advising themMs Macklin-Sorry; did you say in the new year?",140
217,Dr NELSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Yes. In the new year, I will be writing directly to all the government schools and the parent bodies to advise them of the program, the application procedures and the forms that need to be involved. We expect the first tranche of the grants to be par- delivered to the school communities about mid next year. I have also had meetings with the council of state school parent organisations and the peak primary and secondary principal organisations. They will be actively involved in this process at a state and federal level and obviously at the local school level. They are quite supportive of the program and have agreed to work constructively with us, as have at least two of the state governments-I will not embarrass them by naming themwho have advised me directly that they are very happy to cooperate in any way they possibly can with the program.",140
218,Ms MACKLIN,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Jagajaga) (7.04 p.m.)Is the purpose of these amendments to involve parents explicitly in the process of setting priorities with the block grant authorities, which the minister mentioned he would like to see? I am of course aware that parents are involved at a school level. I would like to correct a misapprehension that the minister may have about government schools. In my government schools, parents are very involved both in putting submissions together and raising money themselves for local initiatives. So it is just not true that government school parents are not involved. They are very involved, as are parents in the nongovernment sector. I think we both share the view that parents should be involved, but I am trying to understand why we cannot have an explicit commitment in the legislation that, for the non-government sector, parents will be involved in the process of setting orities in the block grant authorities. Just a minute ago the minister said that he would like to see them involved. Maybe the mood is not right. I will move on to other areas where we are seeking some amendment to once again improve the legislation. Reporting to parents and giving greater flexibility to recruitment are areas where I have some agreement with the government. The importance of reporting is, I think, very plain for everybody to see. Parents certainly do need to know how their children are going. But one of the most important things is to make sure that all the reporting that is being required in this legislation is based on the fundamental principle that this accountability is all about improving students' learning-that it is not being done for any other reason. That principle is not in the bill. The purpose of the amendments before us tonight is about making it absolutely plain that educational integrity and improving students' learning are the reasons for this increased reporting. If that is made plain, if these amendments are accepted, I think the bill would be strengthened. That would not take away from the reporting that is required by the bill, cause I do think that it is a good thing to quire improved reporting. However, I think there are some things that the bill does not require reporting on which would in fact assist both parents and school communities. These amendments also go to adding to the range of information that should be available to assess the validity of school performance. What we are proposing is that, in addition to the things which are in the bill, we also require information about resources, teaching staff, curriculum and student welfare programs. We are proposing that these things should also be reported so that we make sure that both parents and teachers can use this information for the benefit of children. I do pri- not know whether the minister is going to take any of these amendments seriously. They are put forward in good faith. As I said before, I would hope that he would recognise that improving students' learning should be at the heart of this bill. It is not at the moment. The information does not have a clear purpose, so I would commend those amendments to him as well. The final two amendments relate to improving the recruitment of teachers and giving principals in schools a greater role in the staffing of their schools. I mentioned in my speech during the second reading debate that I am aware that Premier Beattie has written to the Prime Minister-I do not know if any of the other premiers have-and I know that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who is at the table, have responded favourably to the concerns that Premier Beattie has set out. While recognising that there is some value to be had from giving greater flexibility to schools over staffing decisions, there are some schools that just cannot get staff. (Extension of time granted) This includes schools in isolated areas. There are also shortages in some curriculum areas, whether it be maths, be- science or languages. The states and some of re- the other school systems, including some of the independent schools, put particular effort into system-wide recruitment strategies. What we are trying to do through these amendments is to make sure that there is some flexibility in this bill so that the states, which have to deal with these difficult issues-it is a reality of the nature of Australia-are able to have system-wide recruitment initiatives. I reiterate that that applies particularly to those schools which are very hard to staff and to those difficult curriculum areas. As I said, we do recognise the general responsibility of the government school employers, the state governments and departments and the other school authorities to manage teacher recruitment for the benefit of all. This applies to the non-government sector as well as the government sector. All we are seeking here is to make sure that the concerns of a number of state governments, particularly in those states with very dispersed geographical populations, are able to be addressed. If the minister is not willing to adopt our amendments, I would ask how he intends to address this very serious problem.",140
219,Dr NELSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"The government appreciates all of the opposition's motives for moving the amendments but we will not be accepting the amendments. However, I would say, as the Prime Minister said to the Queensland Premier, that in the operation of this power of veto, which we strongly believe principals should have over staff appointments in the school for which they are responsible, we will ensure it is developed in cooperation with the state education and non-government educational authorities and in such a way as certainly would not militate against the recruitment of teachers into difficult to staff remote areas. We certainly do not want principals in metropolitan schools, for vexatious reasons or any other reasons other than appropriate ones, not approving the appointment of a teacher returning from a remote or rural posting. Not all things in life can or should be legislated. On the question of the measures relating to school reports, they were developed in part with the advice and input of Professor Peter Cuttance. Peter Cuttance and Shirley Stokes did substantial work for government in relation to parents and their expectations of school reports. Of course, plain language reporting to parents obviously advances the educational needs of children and their learning. One of the problems is that parents often find the reports close to unintelligible. Even people who have higher levels of education often find them close to meaningless. Keep in mind that we did run a national consultation, which received 8,500 responses. There has already been a lot of public and parental input and we do not think it is necessary to legislate all of the things that the opposition feels should be legislated. I have carefully taken note of the things that have been said. I take on board the issues of parental involvement in block grant authorities, the advancement of the educational needs of children in relation to reporting, and certainly the operation of principal power of veto in staff appointments. It is not in anybody's interest-most importantly that of Australian children-to create a system with the best of intentions that militates against the best interests of getting and keeping teachers in difficult to staff areas.",142
220,Ms MACKLIN,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Jagajaga) (7.13 p.m.)That is all very good, but of course we are debating legislation and the whole purpose of legislation is to provide the laws that will mean that the Commonwealth's intentions in the spending of money are met. That is why it is important to have very clear principles in the legislation that actually reflect the wishes of the parliament. I find it extraordinary that this minister, given the very significant increase in the level of accountability that he is seeking-and I am not arguing against most of it-will not accept that we should have some fundamental principles. One fundamental principle is that the purpose of this increased accountability must be to improve students' learning, to make sure that the information that is collected and reported to parents and teachers can actually be used to improve students' learning. That is what it is all about. This will be the last time we debate this legislation for the next four years. This is the opportunity to say to the Australian people that this parliament thinks this very large amount of money should be spent primarily to improve students' learning, and that we should not be having accountability for any other reason. The legislation we debate in this House is very important. Its purpose is so that we can say to the Australian people what we think the money should be spent on. I hope the minister will give further consideration to the proposals on capital funding. There is certainly no definition of need in the legislation. There is no definition of need relating to capital funding more broadly, because I have tried to get that in there before. So I ask the minister to think about that again. He thinks it is distributed on the basis of need but, once again, the legislation should determine that it will be allocated on the basis of need. I take the minister's points on the government's intention to negotiate with the states-and the Catholic Education Offices in particular-to ensure that those states and school authorities will be able to get teachers into hard to staff areas. Once again, I say to the minister that the purpose of the legislation is to provide the mechanisms by which funding is delivered. If ever there were an opportunity to make sure it is delivered according to what the minister has agreed is his, and our, objective-which is to make sure that those schools are still staffed-it seems to me that putting it in the legislation guarantees that. So I hope that by the time this legislation goes to the Senate the minister may have had a little more time to consider these issues. I know that we are very far apart on the question of funding very wealthy schools. The minister's outrage earlier was, I think, an indication of the government's desire to continue to fund these very wealthy schools way above the standard of the vast majority of non-government schools. There are 2,500 government schools that would have received very significant increases from a Labor government. Our commitment is to continually improve their position. Of course, the most needy schools were going to get the vast increases that this government has decided it would rather give to the most wealthy schools. That is really the nub of the debate on the differences between us. We are not going to stop this legislation, because schools need it. But I have to say again tonight that we do think it is unfair to give more money-a 200 per cent increase in funding-to the King's School, while the Catholic parish school gets 25 per cent. We do not think that is fair. The Catholic parish school is more needy, and that is where we want the money to go. Dr Nelson interjecting",142
221,Ms MACKLIN,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"No, our money was on top of what the government is giving. The minister knows full well that the money we were providing was on top of that because it was being redistributed away from the wealthy schools. There is a fundamental difference between us. I just hope that, on those issues where we can improve the legislation, we can put our differences aside and come to some agreement about improvements. (Time expired)",143

225,Ms LIVERMORE,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"I am pleased to have this second opportunity to debate the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004. When you consider the level of disadvantage that exists in the Indigenous community in this country, you could say that we do not spend enough time in this parliament discussing and debating measures that can address it. So doubling up on this particular bill is a good use of the parliament's time. It gives us a chance to better understand the scale of, and reasons for, Indigenous students' underachievement in our education system and to recognise our responsibility as parliamentarians to do everything possible to bridge the gap that exists in educational outcomes between Indigenous and nonIndigenous students. The challenge is there for all governments, but we do not believe the measures provided for in this bill do enough to meet that challenge. In the interests of providing certainty to education providers for 2005 and beyond, the Labor Party will not oppose the passage of this bill. It provides for the appropriation of $913.2 million to be put towards Indigenous education programs for the 2005-08 quadrennium. Most of that funding goes to the two existing programs, the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, or IESIP, and the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program, or IEDA. Since the bill was last debated it has been amended to include funding for two new programs that were announced during the recent election campaign: the youth leadership program, worth $10 million, and $19.5 million for a youth mobility program. The first point to make about this package is that apart from the election announcements there is no new money in real terms being put towards the core initiatives that are supposed to be making a difference to the education of Indigenous students. We caught the minister out on this point during the last debate. In announcing the Indigenous education package in April, the Minister for Education, Science and Training claimed the $2.1 billion commitment as a record and said it represented an increase of $351 million or 20.5 per cent over the next quadrennium. That was just rubbish. The so-called record was achieved by including Abstudy money in the package, which is a complete shonk. This exposed that the real increase in funding over the next four years is actually 3.25 per cent per annum. In other words, that is indexation that barely accounts for the rate of inflation, not new investment in Indigenous education. The rest of the increase in funding can be attributed to the projected increase in the number of Indigenous students enrolling at school. The supplementary recurrent assistance paid to schools under the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program is a per capita payment, so the additional funding is due to additional students, not any largesse on the part of the government as the minister would have us believe. The department's own review of the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program shows that there has been no real increase in funding for that program since 1991. So much for the minister's claim in his second reading speech that closing the education divide between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians remains one of this government's highest education priorities. There are two programs in particular that are funded out of IEDA that will change their focus substantially in the next four-year funding round. The first one was the subject of much of the previous debate on this bill. I am talking about the government's proposal to abolish ASSPA committees and shift that funding into a competitive, submission based system. There are currently around 4,000 Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness, or ASSPA, committees in schools around Australia. Basically, these committees operate wherever there are Indigenous students enrolled. The ASSPA program came about in response to one of the key goals of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy. Its purpose is to establish effective arrangements for the participation of Aboriginal parents and community members in decisions regarding the planning, delivery and evaluation of preschool, primary and secondary education services for their children. The ASSPA program provides resources to school based Indigenous parent committees for activities designed to enhance education opportunities for Indigenous students in preschool, primary school and secondary school and, importantly, to involve Indigenous parents in educational decision making processes. The amount of funding for each school under the existing ASSPA scheme is currently automatic and is based on a school's per capita enrolment of Indigenous students. Schools set up committees of Indigenous parents and community members to work with principals and schools to achieve educational outcomes for Indigenous students. The kinds of activities that have previously been supported through the ASSPA program fall under six categories. They include to encourage the parents of Indigenous students to become actively involved in the education of their children, to improve the access of Indigenous students to education, to increase the educational participation and attendance of Indigenous students, to improve educational outcomes for Indigenous students and to enable Indigenous students to participate in school based educational and sporting excursions and cultural activities. The sorts of things that many members would have seen happening at schools in their electorates include celebrations for NAIDOC Week, breakfast clubs and homework centres. The parent committees and schools that have been running those programs are in for a shock because from the start of next year there will not be any ASSPA program. The government has announced that it will abolish the ASSPA program and replace it with what it calls the Whole of School Intervention Strategy, which includes parent-school partnerships and homework centres. The first thing to note about the whole of school intervention strategy is that there is a cut in funding to this program compared to the former ASSPA program. The last financial year's allocation for ASSPA was around $19 million. The package announced by the minister in April cuts the funding for the parentschool partnerships initiative back to $15 million per year. The other thing to note is the cavalier way in which this significant change has been developed. There has been next to no consultation with Indigenous communities and other people closely involved and interested in the education of Indigenous students and, from the feedback I am getting, very little meaningful communication about what the changes will mean to schools and their existing ASSPA committees and how the replacement program will work in practice. The minister keeps pointing to the review of the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program that the department carried out between September 2002 and December 2003 as the rationale for these sweeping changes to the ASSPA program. You would have to assume from that that this review must have been pretty damning of the ASSPA program. But I have read the report several times now and it is not damning at all. It just does not support this drastic change to the program. For example, one of the key findings in the review report concludes: ... there was support for the concept of the program among those consulted. Many people were of the view that the emphasis it places on involving parents in school education makes it one of the most important Indigenous education programs. A large number of respondents to the discussion paper were of the view that greater ownership in the decision making process by Indigenous families was a positive outcome of ASSPA. The report gives considerable attention to the factors that contribute to the success or failure of ASSPA committees within schools. Debate interrupted. NA",144
226,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. World AIDS Day 2004",146
227,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT,"Can I take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, to congratulate you on your appointment and to wish you well in a job that no doubt has its moments. Today is World AIDS Day and it is an opportunity for us in this House and elsewhere to reflect on the devastation that HIV-AIDS continues to cause to people around the world. As we all know, HIV-AIDS threatens the well-being of communities and individuals, and has economic ramifications for developing countries in particular and indeed continents such as Africa, where HIV-AIDS has reached epidemic proportions. In South-East Asia, HIVAIDS is posing a major threat to our neighbours as they struggle to contain the alarming rate of infection that is sweeping through their communities. There are some 7.4 million people living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region, with 3,000 new infections per day. At a global level, 4.9 million new HIV infections have been recorded this year alone, with 39.4 million people living with HIV-AIDS. Sadly, ASSPA 17.6 million of those are women. Again, sadly, 3.1 million deaths have been recorded in 2004. This is no doubt an issue of international concern, and I have to agree with the statements that the Prime Minister made at the APEC summit. He said: … you've got to have very clear and unambiguous leadership at a government level about what has to be done. As I said, I agree with the Prime Minister, but I am also a little concerned that some of this ‘unambiguous leadership' is not being extended to the situation of HIV-AIDS sufferers here in Australia. Unfortunately, here at home we have state government arrangements and inconsistent federal approaches that are a shambles and have allowed infection rates in Australia to rise sharply in recent years. Last year, another 780 Australians were diagnosed with the virus-a 13 per cent jump on the 690 who tested positive in 1999, a year considered to be a low point. It is fine for the Prime Minister to be overseas, making contributions and lecturing on HIV-AIDS, but back home his government's own Medicare benefits schedule does not pay for HIV-AIDS testing, despite repeated efforts and lobbying by the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations and the Victorian AIDS Council. When a person visits their local GP in order to have a test, they are required to pay approximately $25 for the pathology costs. If you cannot get a bulkbilling doctor-and in recent times that is increasingly the case-then you have to consider whether the GP's consultation fee becomes an issue. In Victoria there were some 202,679 HIV tests performed in 2002, resulting in 234 HIV diagnoses. Of those tests, only 6,043 were paid for by the Victorian state government, funded in part by the public health outcomes funding agreement. Therefore, the vast majority of these tests were paid for by the patient up front. Clearly, the cost of having these tests is becoming a financial burden for many Australians, especially for those who are in a high-risk group and who are required to have tests on at least a threemonthly basis. As a result, many of them are opting out of the testing regime and therefore posing a problem with detection and, as a consequence, containment of HIV-AIDS. That is possibly why infection rates are rising in Australia. You have to ask how this can constitute national leadership when the government has not acted on the recommendations of the fourth National HIV-AIDS Strategy, which expired on 30 June this year. How can the Prime Minister be leading by example when there is at least a six-month gap between the expired fourth national strategy and the fifth National HIV-AIDS Strategy, which will not take effect until well after 1 January 2005? Department of Health and Ageing officials have admitted that the strategy is months behind schedule and may not even meet the 1 January 2005 deadline. If the government were serious about national leadership, I presume the Minister for Health and Ageing would have come into the House today, World AIDS Day, and announced that HIV testing would immediately be placed on the Medicare benefits schedule. This is a critical issue. It is certainly an issue that is of concern to people in the community, and I call on the government to reconsider its position and make testing available to all. (Time expired) Frost, Dame Phyllis",146
228,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to take the opportunity to speak in the Australian parliament about somebody who devoted their life to our country. I speak of the late Dame Phyllis Frost of Croydon, who passed away just over four weeks ago. She passed away at the age of 87, after a long, fruitful, tireless, determined, persistent, full and happy life. She was the epitome of community. Over her lifetime she was involved with nearly 50 different community organisations and charities in Croydon and across Victoria and Australia. A great deal has already been said and written about her many activities, including her inspirational campaign to establish the Keep Australia Beautiful Council, and her dogged and persistent campaign to improve conditions and facilities for female prisoners. Dame Phyllis Frost was born in 1917 on 14 September, when the First World War was at its bloodiest on the Western Front and communism was being born in Russia-in fact, in her lifetime she would see the birth, rise and collapse of communism, and she would see the growth and success of democracy. She saw the horse and cart being replaced by the motor car. She saw air travel become commonplace. She saw space travel, which was a fantasy in her childhood, become a reality by her mid-40s. Dame Phyllis lived at an incredible time, as that generation did-an incredible time in world history, when so much was changing-and she saw so much change about Australia. When she was born, our Seventh Parliament had just been elected. Many of the founding fathers from the First Parliament were still in this chamber, guiding a developing country. At her birth, Australia's population was around five million. When she and her family moved to the then rural town of Croydon in 1923, when she was aged seven, the population there numbered just 600. Dame Phyllis Frost did not just watch this change. People like her, who were devoted to community, drove that change. They did not just witness Australia progress; they were part of the progress. In remembering Dame Phyllis's contribution we must reflect not just on her great deeds but on her motivation and on the unshakable belief she had that, with the freedoms gifted by a democracy and a young country, there were also responsibilities on free citizens and free people in democracies to make a major contribution to community. In her view, democracy relied on a compact where, if we were to have limited government and the freedoms that all that entailed, we also needed on the other side strong community volunteers and strong contributions to grow that free society. And for those more able to give-and she placed herself in that category-that contribution and responsibility was greater. Together with her husband, Glenn, Dame Phyllis ensured that their three childrenElizabeth, Pauline and Christineparticipated fully in their community and helped those in need. As children, their birthday parties always included an invitation for guests to bring presents that would be suitable to give at a later date to other children who were in more need. When extra hands were needed to help with the many organisations and charities she was involved in, her daughters were always encouraged to assist and were taught that it was not just their duty but, more than that, a privilege to help and assist those in greater need than they were. Dame Phyllis's contribution and her dedication to her community live on in her daughters, her grandchildren and her greatgrandchildren. One of her daughters, Pauline Osmond, a great friend of mine and of so many in this parliament, has served the parliament for 20 years, including for the last 8½ years with the last three Speakers. Pauline and her sisters and their families continue to carry that baton of national pride and dedication to community that Dame Phyllis carried for all her adult life. Groner, Rabbi Yitzchok Dovid",147
229,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT,"As I move around Australia, people remark to me on the vibrancy of the Australian Jewish community in Melbourne. Part of the reason for that positive reputation is 50 years of work by a great rabbi, a man who recently celebrated his 80th birthday. I refer to Rabbi Yitzchok Dovid Groner, a resident of my electorate of Melbourne Ports and head of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement in Australia. I had the honour of attending a dinner with nearly 1,000 people at Crown Palladium on 23 November to celebrate his 80th birthday and 45 years of work in Australia. Rabbi Groner was born in New York in 1924, and as a young man he became a follower of one of the greatest spiritual leaders of Orthodox Judaism, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who in turn arrived in New York as a refugee from Europe in 1940. In 1947, Rabbi Groner at 22 became the emissary of the Lubavitch movement and made his first visit to Australia, a journey which in those days required 55 hours of flying time from New York. For the benefit of honourable members who are not familiar with the history of Orthodox Judaism, let me explain that the Lubavitcher Rebbe was the sixth in a line of famous rabbis originally from the town of Lubavitch in Belarus. He founded a movement within orthodoxy known as Chabad, which is a Hebrew acronym for ‘chochma', meaning wisdom, ‘bina', meaning understanding, and ‘da'as', meaning knowledge. Central to Chabad's emphasis is that it seeks to inspire all Jews to rediscover their spiritual roots and their traditions. What foresight the Lubavitcher Rebbe had in the 1940s to know that an important remnant of European Jewry would need spiritual sustenance when they settled in the far Antipodes, in Australia. In 1953 Rabbi Groner made his second visit to Melbourne, and in 1959 he was sent by the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, to settle here permanently. Six months later his wife, Devorah, brought their six children to join him. They had two more children in Australia and moved to Hotham Street, St Kilda East, where the rabbi has lived ever since, in the heart of my electorate. Over the past 45 years, the rabbi and his rebbetzin have devoted themselves to the promotion of the Chabad movement and the values of Orthodox Judaism in Melbourne and, indeed, throughout Australia. Like all great spiritual leaders, they have done this primarily through personal inspiration and example. I know from my own experience the esteem in which Rabbi Groner is held by all in the Melbourne Jewish community, orthodox or otherwise, and indeed by many people who are not Jewish. A fine volume, truly a historical document, contains many tributes from an extraordinary range of people and is testimony to Rabbi Yitzchok Groner's personal stature, as was the classy video prepared by Chaim Melman encapsulating some of the live moments of film of Rabbi Groner's life. Rabbi Groner's esteem is enhanced most of all by the institutions he has fostered. When he arrived in Melbourne, he saw a community increasing in size due to postwar immigration and he gave very strong support to Jewish education, in order that the community would be able to survive in a secular society such as Australia. His great personal achievement has been the flourishing of Yeshivah College and Beth Rivkah Ladies College, two of the most highly regarded Jewish schools in Australia or anywhere, which today educate 1,500 students. Perhaps a small sign of the respect in which he is held is that the chief sponsor of the function that night, Mr Richard Pratt, gave a speech in Yiddish commending Rabbi Groner's activities. Now there is a chain of similar schools across Australia, and a further result of Groner's influence has been the education and training of a whole generation of orthodox rabbis, who today occupy the pulpits of synagogues across Melbourne and, indeed, all around Australia. As he said at the dinner, this is not a takeover but motivated out a desire to serve and instil Yiddishkeit in a new generation. Today the Lubavitchers are the most dynamic influence on Australian Judaism, and Rabbi Groner stands at the head of a community of many thousands of adherents. He is a great scholar, a great preacher, a great educator and a great inspiration to all who meet him. His influence reaches far beyond the Lubavitcher community into all corners of Australian life, and even an imperfectly observant Jew like me has felt his inspiration. I am very proud to consider Rabbi Groner as a friend and adviser, and to honour his lifetime of work on behalf of the Australian Jewish community. Might I say that the book put out on his birthday includes commendations from many in Australian public life, from the former Premier of Victoria Sir Henry Bolte through to the current Premier, the current Prime Minister and the current Leader of the Opposition. It was a great function, and he is a great man, a Talmud chacam. Roads: Funding",148
230,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"Canning) (7.45 p.m.)The issue I wish to raise this evening is of a breach of faith which has cost lives. It is to do with a major suburban road in my electorate-Nicholson Road, which runs through Canning Vale. To turn it into a safe road, $1.6 million is needed. Sadly, Nicholson Road, between Garden Street and Hughes Street, is basically a goat track. It is a singleare lane road on which 20,000 vehicles a day travel. Because of this it is potholed and decaying. For example, the shoulders of the road are such that, if you go off the edge, you have a good chance of blowing a tyre on your car. Interestingly, the road is shared by two local government authorities. On one side is the City of Gosnells and on the other is the City of Canning. As a result, both councils have some responsibility for this major road. Unfortunately, they have been applying to the state government for years for funding to upgrade it, and for years they have been promised the funding by the state government. We know that the government, led by John Howard, has delivered a magnificent program called Roads to Recovery. This funding goes directly to local councils to support local major roads. But in Western Australia state minister Alannah MACTiernan has pulled $12 million, which is almost equivalent to the amount of money given to the local councils by the federal government to improve the state of local roads. So what the federal government did to improve the situation of local government has been torn away by the state Labor government, led by Geoff Gallop, and there has been no advance in the situation at all. As a result, this road is in a state of disrepair. On 19 October a young mum coming out of one of the estates which now adjoins this road was killed because she could not see either way because of the condition of the road and the traffic. One of the reasons the traffic is so bad is that it is a designated truck route. I have written to the main roads department and state minister Alannah MacTiernan to have it degazetted as a major truck route and about trucks going along the Roe Highway. You cannot see past a Bdouble or a semitrailer configuration if you in a little Hyundai, for example; it is not doable. This is what led to this recent tragedy. The accident numbers for this road are enormous. The terrible thing is that the local member and the state government are blaming the local council for not fixing the road. I would have thought that-given the accident statistics and the fact that it is a major road and it was designated by the state government as the No. 1 unfunded project in the metropolitan area for this financial year-the state government would be aware of this tragic and urgent situation. However, Paul Andrews, member for the state electorate of Southern River, has tried to put the blame back on the Gosnells City Council. He has urged the City of Gosnells to get on with fixing Nicholson Road. This is a very fast growing area-it is one of the fastestgrowing metropolitan areas in Perth. As I said, there are estates surrounding this major road and as a priority you would have thought that the state government would realise the pressures and the growing pains as identified by their own department in this urgent situation. The road was brought to the attention of many people by two great young men, Murdoch University marketing students Ronan Freeburn and Quentin Tapley, who have formed the Nicholson Road action group. They have rallied the support of locals, taken a petition around and got many signatures to support doing something not just about the road and its surface but about the linking footpaths, the crossovers and the surrounding areas-where, if you are a disabled person, you cannot even go. I urge the state government to get on with it and help support and fix the road. (Time expired) Newcastle Electorate: Youth",150
231,Ms GRIERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"It has been interesting listening to all our new members make their first speeches and it certainly makes us all reflect back on our first speech in this chamber. I recall three years ago I shared my experience as a teacher and principal with the youth in the schools of Newcastle. In that speech I praised our young people for their excitement for learning and technology, their talents and creativity, the ideals and values aspire to and the courage they constantly display to conquer disability and triumph over disadvantage and adversity. I consider it a privilege to represent them, and it is with great pride that I use my first speech in the adjournment debate in this new parliament to share with the House and the people of Australia some of the worthy contributions young people in Newcastle have made to our local community, to the Hunter region and in many cases to the nation. Firstly, back in September, when we here in the House were somewhat distracted by an election campaign, several young Novocastrians were competing their hearts out, putting their bodies on the line for Australia in the Athens Olympic Games. I would like to acknowledge and thank the following young Novocastrians for their brilliant efforts both in being selected amongst that elite group of sports men and women and for their individual outstanding performances. There is quite a list: Suzy Batkovic, a famous basketballer we were all very proud of and who, during the campaign, we spent many late nights watching; Olivia Gollan, a cyclist; Ryan Griffiths, a soccer player; Mathew Helm, a wonderful diver who distinguished himself outstandingly; Jessica Malone for her performance in judo; Justin Norris, a much loved swimmer in our region-good luck, Justin, with your new family on the way; Joanne Peters, a soccer player; baseball players Jamie Pitman and Ryan Rowland-Smith; Cheryl Salisbury, a soccer player; and Natalie Ward, our very much loved softballer. To add to those triumphs, Newcastle youth that astounded and delighted us also with their Paralympian performances. Prue Watt was an outstanding swimmer and claimed a silver and a bronze medal for Australia. Eleiza Stankovich, a former Young Citizen of the Year of Newcastle, won a silver medal in the they Athens 2004 games in the 800 metres wheelchair race. Christie Dawes and Kurt Fearnley were also real examples of people triumphing over disabilities to excel as Paralympians at Athens. I praise Newcastle for its wonderful support for our young Olympians. It is an outstanding effort from a regional capital. As for creativity and talent, I was delighted last week to watch the Octapod Association receive a 2004 Community Heritage grant here in Canberra. This time Octapod are using their very advanced digital and media skills to preserve local heritage. They remain the organisers of the largest youth arts festival in Australia. That was another local highlight for our election campaign period, showcasing the city and the youth of Newcastle. I would also like to congratulate Ellesse Stronach, who at 16 has won a scholarship to study ballet in Birmingham next year. Ballet is one of the arts in which we in Newcastle have a tradition of high achievement. I also congratulate Georgia Lowe, who has been accepted as an associate of the Australian Ballet School. Something else we are becoming quite renowned for in our region is beauty contest winners, and I congratulate Melinda Lidbetter, who recently won the Miss Philippines Australia competition. Good luck, Melinda, when you compete next year in the international Miss Philippines competition. Jennifer Hawkins has led the way, so I am sure you will follow. Thanks to Newcastle youth, I remain excited by their love for learning and technology. Lambton High students Rebecca Ball and Callum Hurst won equal first prize in the New South Wales division of the Pathways to Innovation Youth Challenge last month. Young doctor and researcher Nikki Verrillis has just received quite an outstanding award at the recent 12th International Conference on Second Messengers and Phosphoproteins. This is considered the premier world conference in the field of cellular signalling. To singled out from other contenders from prestigious institutions such as Stanford, Harvard and Dundee universities is a brilliant achievement for Nikki, who presented her work on the discovery of new mutations that cause resistance to chemotherapy in cancer patients. It is something that will benefit the world, we hope. I would also like to congratulate Waratah West Public School, whose students came first and third in a state environment competition, and I wish students from the Junction school luck in their quest as finalists today in the state chess championships. I would particularly like to praise Hayden Mackaway and Ben Roberts of Waratah West Public School for their best editorial award in our local newspaper competition. The Newcastle Herald newspaper competition is an outstanding one, and I congratulate them. I could go on, Mr Speaker, as there are many other outstanding youth achievements. (Time expired) Smith, Mr Warwick Payne, Ms Catherine",151
232,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to briefly mention and bring to the attention of the House two important facts that relate to today, 1 December 2004. In actual fact I only discovered this first fact today, and it concerns the previous federal Liberal member for Bass, Mr Warwick Smith, who was in the gallery this afternoon listening to question time until it was cut short. Twenty years today to the day was the date of Warwick Smith's election to Parliament in 1984, so I thought it prudent for me to summarise some of Warwick's great achievements. Warwick Smith was certainly well known as a local member and as a very friendly, affable person. He was really quite loved by the local community. He got things done. He worked on outcomes. He be believed in delivering for his local community. As I said in my first speech two weeks ago, Warwick Smith was the person who, through his character and his reputation as the local member, taught me that Launceston was not just another city of Tasmania but actually a provincial capital of the region I continue to call northern Tasmania. Warwick Smith was first elected to parliament as the member for Bass on 1 December 1984 and was re-elected in 1987, 1990 and 1996. He followed the very successful and well-known Kevin Newman, formerly a colonel in the Army. Warwick Smith held shadow portfolio roles in science, energy, Aboriginal affairs, privatisation and communications and he was also Manager of Opposition Business in the House of Representatives. Mr Smith also undertook parliamentary inquiries into corporate law, shareholder rights, media issues and infrastructure matters. In 1996 he was appointed Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and was also Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Warwick Smith lost his seat in 1993, so from 1993 to 1995 he was Australia's first telecommunications industry ombudsman, responsible for establishing the national office based in Melbourne. During a period of consultancy work he advised legal and accounting firms on IT and telecommunications and privacy issues. Prior to his political career he was a young hotshot lawyer practising in one of Tasmania's oldest legal firms, Douglas and Collins, specialising in commercial law. Since Warwick was unsuccessful in regaining his seat in 1998 he has been working as an executive director of Macquarie Bank. I have spoken of Warwick as a man of the past, but of course he is nothing of the sort. do not wish to eulogise him as if he is no longer with us but he is someone who to me is a great role model for the kind of local member that I would like to be in this chamber, certainly in terms of getting results and delivering for my community. The best example I can think of in terms of material or that concrete benefits to northern Tasmania is Inveresk Precinct, including York Park, which has today become the very well known home of football in Tasmania. Many millions of dollars under the Howard government have been acquitted there and it really has been the impetus and the catalyst for a lot more development that has followed, including the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, as well as being the future home, hopefully, for a campus for the University of Tasmania. In my last minute I would like to pay tribute also to a young constituent, a year 9 student from Launceston Church Grammar School, Ms Catherine Payne. She was named Tasmanian young historian of the year for her research essay ‘St Matthias Church, Windermere-the church's history and involvement in the celebrations of the community around it'. Today she was also named the National History Challenge young historian of the year.",152
