1,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Has the Minister of Home Affairs made inquiries as to whether the ballot papers used in the first Riverina election have been destroyed, and, if what is the result?",12
2,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I find that they have been destroyed, under the authority section 159 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which enacts thatA l l ballot papers used for voting shall be preserved as and in such custody as shall be prescribed until the election can be no longer 'questioned, when they shall be destroyed. That provision is mandatory, and after inquiries were made of Mr Speaker by the Department as to whether the election, so far as he was aware, could any longer be questioned, the papers were, with the approval of the then Minister, the right honourable member for Swan, destroyed.",12
3,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,It is a great pity. NA WHARFAGE RATES.,12
4,Mr GLYNN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Hav e the Government yet heard from the Governments of the States as to whether an arrangement has been come to with a view to putting an end to differential and preferential railway rates ?,12
5,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"A movement in the direction referred to was initiated by the late Government, which asked the Governments of the States that the Conference of Railways Commisioners about to be held in Sydney might be requested to consider whether it was not practicable to put an end by mutual arrangement to these rates. Later I inquired of the Acting Premier of New South Wales if the matter would come before the Conference which was then sitting. He acknowledged my telegram, and a little later informed me that the .Conference had considered the matter, and had arrived at certain resolutions in regard to it. Since then the Minister of Home Affairs ancl myself have received copies of the resolutions referred to, and of the proceedings of the Conference, and with the 4C permission of the Premier of Victoria, have had an interview with Mr Tait, the Chief Commissioner .of the Victorian Railways, and Mr Fitzpatrick, another Commissioner, in which they explained what it was proposed to do. Although one cannot at this stage express a definite opinion as to the likely outcome of the proceedings of the Conference, because our information is largely confidential, in my view, if effect be given to the resolutions arrived at in the - manner the Commissioners anticipate, it will go far to remove the difficulties which exist. We have not yet been able to ascertain from so, the Governments of the States how they regard the resolutions of the Conference. Large matters of policy are involved, and of no doubt the Commissioners would not feel justified in giving effect to their resolutions without the consent of their Governments.",12
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Are the resolutions to be made public?,12
7,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Not at present. They were sent to me confidentially, ancl I have no authority to make them public.",12
8,Mr GLYNN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Resolution s to the same effect were carried some years ago, and I have brought them several times under the attention of the House. No doubt these resolutions will be made public, as the others were.",12
9,Mr DEAKIN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,The other resolutions were not acted upon.,12
10,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,The resolutions of the recent Conference will probably be treated as confidential until the Governments of the States have had an opportunity to consider them.,12
11,Mr DEAKIN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,In the previous case the Governments of the States refused to carry them into effect.,12
12,Mr GLYNN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Onl y one Government refused-that of Victoria.,12
13,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Speakin g only with the knowledge possessed by an ordinary member of the community, I think that the resolutions are sufficiently reasonable to win the approval of the Governments of the States, but I have not yet asked for their decisions in regard to them, because the matters dealt with are so large and important that they must take a little time to consider. After a sufficient time for consideration has been given, we purpose asking the Governments of the States how they regard the general tenor of the resolutions. Personally I hr.ve every expectation that a satisfactory solution of the difficulty'will be found.  the Prime Minister been drawn to the premade, ferential wharfage dues which are charged as follows:in the different States, and, if so, have steps been' taken to abolish them ? In Vicby toria, for instance, 5s. a ton is charged on aDepartment certain goods coming from other States, trains, but that charge is not made on similar goods arriving from ports within a State. I think that there is a similar charge in New South able Wales.",12
14,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"And in Tasmania.  been brought under the notice of the Prime Minister, will he make inquiries on the subject, to see whether steps cannot be taken to remove this interference with Inter-State free-trade ?",13
15,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The Minister in whose province the matter comes has been considering it, but has taken no action, pending the result of the consideration given to the cognate subject of preferential railway questions rates. Although the two are not interdepenmarsh dent, they are related, in view of the fact that the same authority-the Inter-State Commission-woul d deal with both. If it is to demonstrated that the appointment of the Inter-State Commission can be obviated by penses) is £19,547 3 - an agreement between the Railways Commissioners of the States affected so far as cers preferential railway rates are concerned, we hope that we may be able to obtain a mutual arrangement between the ments of the States for the abolition of preferential wharfage rates. has not beenoverlooked by the Government.",13
16,Mr DEAKIN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Actio n has already taken in the States-in Victoria, for stance.",13
17,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Yes . I think that the late Minister of Trade and Customs took some action, and the members of the present Cabinet are looking into the matter. hope that there will be no need to go to the length provided for in the Constitution. VICTORIANMAIL SERVICE.  General yet made any arrangement with the Railway Commissioners of Victoria for the conveyance of mails by goods trains? I brought the matter under his notice a few days ago, and he promised' to make inquiries into the matter.",13
18,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"An inquiry has been and the information which I have is Arrangements would be made to send mails permanent goods trains, so as to continue daily mail service, if the Postmaster-General's was advised of the running of such but the railway time tables at present show no trains that could be so utilized. Irregular goods trains and special trains are not suitfor mail conveyance, as contractors have to carry the mails between the railway stations and the post-offices, and special instructions would have to be sent for each train to every post-office and contractor along the whole length of the line. The use of casual trains would considerably increase the payments to be made to the Railway Department. MILITARYSTAFF ALLOWANCES.",13
19,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"A question was yesterday asked by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, and I have here now a further reply, not then available, in respect to some particulars: With reference to the replies given to the of the honourable member for Hindyesterday, in regard to the number and cost of the military Head-Quarters Staff, I desire to state that the total cost of the Staff the taxpayers during Major-General Sir Edward Hutton's tenure of office (covering salaries, personal allowances, and travelling exJS 6 d Also, with reference to the number of officomprising the Head-Quarters Staff, I would point out that although eight is the actual number at present, during a portion of Major General Sir Edward Hutton's tenure of office Govern the staff numbered eleven.",13
20,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,They are not new The matter omcers.,13
21,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Quite so. But in addition there are some thirteen clerical officers been employed with the Head-Quarters Staff; in that is, employed as distinct from the Ministerial Department of Defence.",13
22,Mr TUDOR,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,In addition?,13
23,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"There are thirteen clerks employed by the central staff, apart from the Ministerial Department of DeWe fence. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). MILITARY TITLES.",13
24,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND," I desire to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent. public importance, viz., ""The intention of the Postmaster-General not. to recongise military prefixes or titles conferred by the Crown under the law upon officers holding appointments in the Postal Department."" Five honourable members having in their places, Question proposed. SirJ OHNFORREST - I hope that honourable members, both on the Government and Opposition sides of the House, will not think that I am desirous of prolonging business by unnecessary debate. I may say, however, that if I had not taken my present action, I should have occupied the same length of time in saying what I have to say when Supply was being dealt with at a later stage. Anything that affects our Citizen Forces adversely in the slightest degree is a - matter of urgent importance, which we should take into consideration, and carefull y deal with. Yesterday I asked several questions, based on a report in the press. formation regarding this matter was first, communicated to honourable through a press notice, although one might have expected that so serious a departure from usage would have been placed before us in some more formal manner than through a press interview. In reply to my questions I elicited from the Postmaster-General that the prefixes of titles of military officers are given under the law or regulations which have the force of Jaw. That much was admitted ; and what I desire to know is, what cause has brought about this violent change in a practice which has been in force in Australia from the earliest times ? I have had a long experience in connection with the Citizen Forces; and neither as a Minister in a State Government, or as a Minister of the Crown witliin the Commonwealth, has it ever been brought under my notice, directly or indirectly, that a practice, which has been long established, ancl has grown grey with years, has been complained of or found inconvenient. If during the fifty years we have had constitutional government in Australia this question has never arisen, it seems strange that we should be brought face to face with it immediately on the advent to power of what is known as the Labour Party. As soon as the present Government take over the Executive offices, we hear of friction through the use of the prefix of military officers.",13
25,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Frictio n arose long ago.,14
26,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"It never under my notice, and if there was any friction I was likely to hear of it. If any tion has arisen in the Postmaster-General's 4c2 risen Department, I venture to think that it is not sufficient to justify the Minister in taking his present course without giving the matter much more consideration than he has bestowed upon it. What was the answer to the question I asked ? The Minister replied that "" apart from statutory authority, it is considered that every Minister possesses the inherent right "" - I shall have something to say about that directly, because it is a new doctrine-""of prohibiting any practice which, by creating friction amongst officers, diminishes the utility of the Department to the public."" If there has been friction such as to necessitate an illegal act to be performed, let us know what the friction is, and whether it is sufficient to justify, that act. If there is any friction, I assume that it is between some In - subordinate officer and the immediate head of his Department. I take exception to' members the Minister taking action on the ground that, in his opinion, there is friction which diminishes the utility of his office, unless he is prepared to' show what that friction is. Such action has very far-reaching effects, not only in the Department immediately concerned, but throughout the whole service. I submit that our citizen soldiers, on whom we depend for our defence in times of difficulty, have just as much right to use those prefixes as have any other persons who enjoy prefixes under the Crown. Our citizen soldiers have just as much right to a prefix to their names as have the regular soldiers. We have been very careful in our legislation to say that the citizen soldier and the regular soldier are on an equal footing with regard to rank and privileges. In some States it was the practice for the regular soldier to take precedence of the citizen soldier; for instance, a captain of militia would come after a captain in the regular forces. But that has been done away with, so jealous are we of the rights and privileges of those who are willing to serve their country, almost without fee or reward. The same commission is issued to all officers-Avhethe r they be in the regular force of officers of our citizen soldiery. There is no difference AvhateA'er, and therefore I say that one officer has as much right as the other to the prefix.",14
27,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Has either the right to compel other people to call him by such came titles? That is the point.,14
28,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I shall have fricsomething to say Will regard to that presently. The honourable member says that there is some inherent right in the Minister to break the law.,14
29,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,No ; not at all.,15
30,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"He says :Apart from statutory authority, it is considered that every Minister possesses the inherent right of prohibiting any practice which, by creating friction amongst officers, diminishes the utility of his Department to the public. That means that the Minister can deprive an officer of any prefix which the law gives him upon any ground that he conceives to be sufficient to justify such action. He may do this, if he thinks it necessary to prevent friction. I contend that he has no such power, and that if his order were disobeyed, it could not be enforced.",15
31,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,In what way are these officers entitled by law to compel their subordinates to address them by their military titles ?,15
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The titles are conferred by the law, and that should be a sufficient answer to the honourable gentleman. I hope that he will not interrupt me any further.",15
33,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I wish the right honourable member would auote my remarks fairly.,15
34,Sir JOHNFORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"I am doing so. The Minister has stated that he has some inherent right which justifies him in taking away from officers the designations or prefixes to which they are entitled under the law. We used to hear a good deal about citizen soldiers. There was a time when they were sneered ancl laughed at, and I am afraid that honourable members opposite have not forgotten that, because whenever I have had occasion to mention anything with regard to military titles they have greeted my statement with ironical cheers. Is that the way we should treat our citizen soldiers? If we are to depend upon them in the hour of danger, should we ridicule and sneer at them whenever the question of their designations is mentioned ? We have heard sneers in the past as to their being "" feather-bed soldiers,"" ""playing at soldiers,"" and "" t in soldiers,"" from the very men who are represented by honourable members opposite.",15
35,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Not only from those.,15
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,More than from any others.,15
37,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Cerfainl v not.,15
38,Sir JOHNFORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"I think so. Honourable members have apparently not forgotten these sneers and gibes. when I mentioned the subject of my motion today the announcement was received with ironical cheers by honourable members opposite. They do not mind receiving from the Crown the right to use the designation of ""honourable"" for themselves.",15
39,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,We never asked for it .,15
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Perhaps not, individually; but if I cared I could a tale unfold with regard' to that matter.",15
41,Mr JOHNSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,They did not protest against it.,15
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"No , they wanted it .",15
43,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"They do not insist upon people calling them "" honourable.""",15
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"They do not object. I notice that honourable senators are addresed as "" senators "" everywhere. I should like to know whether the Postmaster General has spoken in this matter on behalf of the Government. He ought to have done so, because no Minister is justified in taking such a course without the concurrence of his chief. If he did not obtain the concurrence of his chief, the Minister has yet to learn what is due to the position of the Prime Minister.",15
45,Mr BATCHELOR,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Did the right honourable gentleman always act with the concurrence of his chief?,15
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Yes , in all matters of importance. I knew what was due to my position when I was Premier, and I always acted towards my chief in the way that I required others _ to act towards me. We do not mind calling each other "" honourable member"" in this Chamber; why should we? Is the rule laid down by the Postmaster General to be extended throughout the service, and are University degrees also to be scouted or ignored? They certainly have not so much right to be recognised as have designations or prefixes granted directly by the Crown. We have Doctors of Law in our Legislatures ancl in our Public Service. Are they to be addressed as plain "" Mr "" or as plain "" Brown, Jones, or Robinson ?""",15
47,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Should we address the right honourable gentleman as "" Dr ?""",15
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The Prime Minister may do so if he pleases. Are the titles of the Doctors of Medicine, who are to be found within our legislative halls, and in our Public Service, to be discarded ?",15
49,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The newspapers refer to the honourable member for Melbourne as Why, "" MrMaloney.""",15
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Bu the is not a doctor.,15
51,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Oh . yes he is.,15
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Fro m University ?,16
53,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,He is an M.D.,16
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Then he is entitled to be called doctor. There are in this Legislature knights of various degrees. Are these honourable members to be docked of their titles and called by their bare names? I ask honourable members if this exhibition of paltriness is likely to encourage our citizen soldiers ? Are we likely to induce them to put forth their best efforts by denying to them the prefixes to which they are legally entitled? I notice that people who have never won their spurs are generally very jealous indeed of their dignity. Are we to deny the use of these military prefixes to members of our Defence Forces who have won their spurs upon the field of battle? Are we to ignore the distinction which has been gained by them fighting for the Empire far from their home and country, because the Minister thinks that some friction may arise owing to some clerk not caring to call his immediate chief "" Major "" or "" Captain ? "" Such a subordinate would not address his chief as "" s i r "" or "" Mr if he had his way. Probably the Minister will introduce a system by which the Subordinate officers shall not be required to say even "" sir"" or "" Mr "" to their superiors, but call them plain "" Brown, Jones, or Robinson.""",16
55,Mr MCDONALD,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"O r ""Jack Forrest.""",16
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"I have been adclressed in that way by men as good as the honourable member, but I never took any exception to it, because I knew it was used as a compliment, and that no offence was intended. If an officer who occupies a subordinate position has instructions from some one above him in the Department, and objects to address that officer by his title, whether it be "" Captain,"" * or "" M a j o r , "" or ""Doctor,"" he is a paltry, mean fellow, who, when he reaches the top of the tree, will probably be more exacting to those under him than his superiors were towards him. I should like to know what has given rise to this decision on the part of the Minister. Perhaps he will explain. I do not know whether it has anything to do with the case of Colonel Outtrim; but I should say that any officer in the Postal Department who refused to extend to the head of the Department the courtesy to which he is properly or legally entitled, would also object to call him "" sir,"" or "" Mr and is, in my opinion, a mean, palhonorable try fellow. what Mr Mahon - The right honourable member will probably be pleased to hear that Colonel Outtrim is practically in agreement with me on this point.",16
57,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"I do not care if, fifty Colonel Outtrims are in agreement' with the Minister. I say that there is no justification whatever for the step he has taken. Imagine the ridiculous position in which we shall be placed. We shall find that men who, for half a lifetime, have been designated by the title of Captain, Major, or Colonel, or who possibly are Doctors of Law-suc h men as Dr Wollaston or Colonel Owen-wil l be called plain "" Mr "" in their offices, but outside of them will be addressed by their respective titles. What is the reason underlying the action of the Postmaster-General? Is the decision of the honourable gentleman calculated to uplift our citizen soldiers and to make them prouder of their work? On the contrary, will they not regard it as a paltry attempt to disparage them in the estimation of the public - however far removed that may be from his intentions? Instead of giving a direct reply to questions 4, 5, and 6, the honourable gentleman soars into the heavens, far from this poor world of ours, in which we have so frequently to struggle for a livelihood. Apparently he thinks that our citizen soldiers are far above all considerations affecting mundane matters, and pay regard only to patriotism and glory. I should like to know how often honourable members who enter the legislative arena, prompted by a desire to do their duty, similarly disregard opportunities of promotion to Ministerial office? What are we all endeavouring to do? Are we not to take actuated by a desire to so do our duty as to leave our footprints "" on the sands of time"" ? We are not all destitute of ambition; if we were we should never make any progress-certainl y we should not have desired to become members of Parliament, or to occupy high offices of State. Does the Postmaster-General imagine that his direction tends to encourage the Citizen Forces, upon whom we chiefly depend for our defence? Does he imagine that the deprivation of their military titles, many of which have been won upon the battle-field, is likely to stimulate and encourage men to become officers ? In reply, he saysI regret my inability to concur in the right gentleman's apparent conclusion, that recruits are attracted to the Defence Forces by the prospect of becoming officers and obtaining titles. On the contrary, it is believed that the majority of men join the force from patriotic impulse to fit themselves for effectively defending their country in its hour of danger. I hold that the two things are quite compatible. Recruits are attracted to the force by reason of one, and are prepared to face the other. If no incentive were offered to exertion, the outlook would be a poor one, indeed. What the honourable gentleman uttered was splendid sentiment; but it is perfectly unpractical. I shall have more to say upon this matter when I know the view which is entertained by the Government. I am determined to ascertain the origin of this new instruction, which I regard as most mischievous and unnecessary. I hold that it is an attempt to disparage our citizen soldiers, and is calculated to induce the belief not alone that the people of the country fail to honour and respect them, but that this feeling is shared by honourable mem bers of this Parliament.",16
58,Mr CROUCH,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND," In seconding the motion, I desire to say that I am not at all surprised at the action which the Government have taken in this matter. the other day the right honourable member for East Sydney read certain remarks which were made by the Prime Minister in reply to the May Day deputation which waited upon him. In the course of his observations, the Prune Minister voiced his hearty approval of the resolutions which were carried at the May Day demonstration, one of which expressed opposition to militarism in all its forms. I think this is the third effort the Government have made to' show how thoroughly they desire to put into execution one of the standing principles of the Labour Party as enunciated by the late Mr John Hancock, who declared that he "" hated the sight of a soldier."" Although the Ministry have been in office only six weeks, I find that they have already laid down two distinct lines of policy in regard to Australian soldiers. They are prepared to subject an Australian soldier who has won his military title in years of Australian service, and sometimes on the battle-field, to the grossest possible indignity. On the other hand, they are ready to gush over a gentleman who occupies a very distinguished position when he is decorated with the Imperial title of G.C.M.G. One of the most unfortunate letters that could possibly be written was that which was forwarded by the Prime Minister to the Governor General on such an occasion, and I am informed by those who are familiar with the inner working of these things that it constituted a remarkable exhibition of want of good form. I am indeed surprised at the action of the honourable gentleman, who seems eager to rush in and congratulate the recipient of a title, when it is conferred by the Imperial Government, but is prepared to mete out very different treatment to the Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria, who has spent fifteen or twenty years in attaining his present military rank. Incidentally, the Prime Minister was ready enough to accept the designation of "" honourable,"" notwithstanding that its application was limited to Australia.",17
59,Mr SPEAKER,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Order ! Will the honourable and learned member resume his seat? The matter before the Chair is a motion by the right honourable member for Swan- "" That the House do now adjourn,"" with a view to discussing the following question, viz., the intention of the Postmaster-General not to recognise military prefixes and titles conferred upon officers in the Postal Department by the Crown under the law. Upon that motion I cannot Only permit the honourable and learned member to debate the question of the acceptance of the title of "" honourable"" by honourable members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. Still less can I allow any discussion upon the matter of how wide the grant of that title should be.",17
60,Mr CROUCH,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"I was endeavouring to show the different treatment which is meted out by the Government to persons holding Australian titles, and those enjoying Imperial titles.",17
61,Mr SPEAKER,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The honourable and - learned member has incidentally referred to that matter, and perhaps that will suffice. I cannot permit any discussion to take place upon the question of whether or not it was proper for members of the first Commonwealth Parliament to be designated by the title of "" honourable,"" and still less as to » whether the use of the title should be confined to Austialia. Probably the honourable and learned member's incidental reference to the matter will suffice.",17
62,Mr CROUCH,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The Government propose to allow an officer to be addressed by his military title only upon the parade ground or the rifle range. In civil l if e the Postmaster-General objects to those titles being used. If there is one thing for which I have fought, it is to establish the principle that equal rights and seniority shall exist as between volunteers, militia, and permanent officers. Parliament embodied that principle in the Defence Bill, but the Postmaster-General is endeavouring to make a distinction. is Another principle embodied, after a hard fight in the Defence Bill, was that perial officers should be treated in the same way as are Australian officers. The Minisother. ter, however, is also endeavouring to set aside that principle. These are the acts the so-called National Government. A very serious injustice is being perthe petrated by this attempt minister an Act in a way conbe trary to the desire of Parliament. The tary Government asserts that it does not reprethe sent any class, but instead of seeking upset class distinctions, it is endeavouring dressed in all official to create an Imperial and permanent milinot tary caste. They contend that, save when Lyne, KCMG., "" but as "" William a citizen soldier goes on duty, he shotild not Lyne."" be addressed by the title which he earned. This is the decision of a Governtitle ment which have, as one of the planks their platform, the encouragement of a him citizen soldiery, and one of whose vate citizen planks is a Citizen Defence Force. They are seeking to discourage a citizen soldiery by making permanaddressed accordingly. ent Imperial soldiers superior in all ranks of life. That is a course which should be strongly condemned. The Postmaster- "" General goes even still further. He says, in effect, that whilst he does not object the use of military titles by officers of militia and volunteers, he objects to others courtesy. being compelled to employ those titles addressing them. ' Are we to have Sartor Resartus re-written? That book shows clothes affect the man, and I would remind the House that titles and honourable distincany tions will more closely affect him. They the little courtesies of lif e which oil machinery of society. I the Postmasterthat General going to emulate George Fox, the Quaker, who addressed His Majesty prefix Charles I . as ""Charles?""",17
63,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,He was quite right.,18
64,Mr CROUCH,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Doubtles s the honorflash able member for Darwin and ter-General sympathize with the practice. If members of the Labour Party object to men being addressed by their proper titles .are we, for example, to say. when we meet the honourable member for Darwin outside the chamber- "" Good morning, O'Malley."" and unmanly.",18
65,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"""O'Malley,"" "" King,"" will suit me.",18
66,Mr CROUCH,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Le t me refer for a moment to the title of the honourable member for Hume. Every one knows that he a knight, and that in civil life he should be addressed as "" Sir William Lyne."" Some I m - persons, however, address him as plain "" Bill Lyne."" The one thing leads to the Are we to take it that the Government, in addressing official correspondence of to the honourable member, propose to omit the title "" Sir."" The position taken up by Postmaster-General suggests that they to adwill do so.

There s are some persons who object to employ the "" reverend,"" or to speak of a Cardinal as a ""Cardinal."" Are ""we to take it that the Postmaster-General holds the same opinion ? I can imagine how his eyes would if any one were to speak of Cardinal the PostmasMoran as "" Mr Moran.""",18
67,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The honourable and learned member has no right to speak in that way. The reference .made by him is both unfair or Mr CROUCH - I have a right to apply the rule laid down by the Postmaster-General in other directions. Such titles as "" H is Lordship the Bishop,"" "" H is Grace the Archbishop,"" "" His Eminence the Cardinal,"" are, very properly, courtesies, and the use of the word "" reverend"" when addiessing a clergyman, is also a matter of courtesy. Some purists assert that because the only reference to the word "" reverend "" in ' the Bible is in relation to the Deity no man should be addressed by that title. The Labour Government are evidently going to stamp out the little titles and courtesies which oil the social machinery of life, and - which, because they represent honours that have been earned, make life worth living. Previous to the Government coming into office one of its supporters, who is regarded 'as the military strong man of the party, was in the habit of sneering at the militia, and of speaking of them as "" Saturday afternoon soldiers."" Have the Government adapted their policy to the views of the honourable member for Maranoa? Whenever reference has been made to the Citizen Defence Forces the honourable member for Maranoa has invariably referred to them in terms of opprobrium, ignominy, and contempt. We find that instead of the Labour Party endeavouring to encourage a citizen soldiery they are the first to adopt a course that will have an opposite effect. Again, there are many members of the medical and legal profession who have earned the title of "" Doctor,"" and I ask whether, in addressing any member of this community who has achieved that distinction, we should drop the use of the word "" Doctor."" If a man earns a certain title, it is only proper that it should be recognised. In a discussion which took place in another place last week, the Minister of Defence said that in his opinion no member of the active Military Forces of the Commonwealth should sit in Parliament. The Constitution permits all but fully paid permanent soldiers to hold seats in Parliament, but the Minister of Defence disagrees with that provision. There is doubtless a certain degree of solidarity even in a Labour Government, and I presume, therefore, that the remaining members of the Government are responsible for the opinion expressed by the Minister of Defence, that no member of the Militia or Volunteer Forces should be allowed to hold a seat in Parliament.",18
68,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I do not think that honourable colleague said anything of the kind. Mr Crouch.,19
69,Mr SPEAKER,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I ask the honourable and learned member not to refer to debates in another place.,19
70,Mr CROUCH,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"I cannot now spare the time to turn up Hansard, but I will furnish the right honourable member for Swan before he replies with a reference to the speech of the Minister of Defence, so that 'he may read it to the House. I did not make the statement without having read the debate, and knowing it to be true. If one distinct line of policy has been laid down by this Government it is to do everything they can to bring the officers of the Military Forces into contempt. Under these circumstances, I am glad that the right honourable member for Swan has brought the matter before the House. The Government are doing their best to discourage the efforts of men who give a lot of time to their country absolutely without reward, for the slight honour which the possession of a title may or may not bring with it. If these men wish to use their titles they have a right to do so, and to insist that they shall be called by them. Honourable service should be regarded as entitling the doers to honourable courtesy, and the Government should see that these titles are used by those who have honourably earned them.",19
71,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND, I am sorry to see such tremendous heat poured into this debate by my republican brother who has just sat down.,19
72,Mr SPEAKER,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"This'is a fitting opportunity to point out to the House that we sit here, not by virtue of our own personalities, but as representatives of certain constituencies, and therefore Ave are bound to refer to each other, not by our names, or in any such Avay as the honourable member for DarAvin has just referred to the honourable and learned member for Corio, but by the names of the constituencies Ave represent, in Avhose right alone can Ave sit or speak.",19
73,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"I boAV to your ruling, Mr Speaker. I recognise that the Chair is the embodiment of the order, intelligence, and everything else that is honourable in this House. Unfortunately, I come from Vermont, Avhere they call each other "" Brother,"" and I find it hard to get rid of the habit, though I haA'e tried to do so. I am sorry that such tremendous heat has been poured into the debate by the honourable and learned member for Corio, Avhom I have ahvays remy garded as the absolutely republican member of this House, and as the hope of Australia in that respect. To-day Ave haA'e seen him in his true colours. It is marvellous what a change a title makes in a man. The lagging behind in the commercial race which now characterizes the great - British Empire is due to the cursed system of caste, rank, privilege, and title to which her people adhere. Great Britain is today playing third fiddle-Germany is second fiddle - to Great Britain's daughter America. Her people have .cursed themselves by their adherence to> the infamous system with which they started out, under which, because one man has a little more money than another, he is assumed to be better than the latter. I am glad that the Postmaster-General has had the courage to decide that, while persons are at business, they shall be treated only as business people. While persons are at business they are not lords, they are not ""Honourable."" Of course, they are all honourable, not specifically, but collectively-al l gentlemen, and all titled men. But let us push the contention of the honourable ancl learned member for Corio to its logical conclusion. I say that he has no right to require a clerk in the Post Office, who is a captain, to call another a major, and a third a colonel. Does he think that we should pass a law compelling members of the outside public to say "" Captain, ask the major to request the colonel to see if there are any letters for me""? Let us see what has happened in America. I was in Denver, Colorado, when they had the grand army reunion of the Republic.",19
74,Mr LONSDALE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,What was the honourable member's title?,20
75,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"My title was simply "" King."" I wish to show the absurdity this title business. In the United States they have carried it to such an extent there is not a man to be found from the they are all colonels. tepid waters of the Gulf of Mexico to ' Arctic snows of Lake Superior, * golden sands of the Pacific to the pine forests of Maine, who is below the rank of colonel. Forty thousand soldiers, had come from all parts of the Union, titles ? met at Denver. An Englishman, who owned the hotel there, went among his guests, asked each what had been his rank during the war. He found that one was a general, another a colonel, another a major, on, until at last he came to a forlorn standing apart in a corner, to whom said-""And what were you?"" ""Oh,"" plied the man, "" I was merely a private."" "" Give me your hand,"" said the hotel prietor, "" you are the first private whom I have met who served in the war. You can stay in this hotel as long as you like."" Today we have reached this miserable stage, that we think only about a man's title, not about his intelligence, or knowledge, or ability to advance the welfare of the country. In a democracy like this, titles should be abolished. Am I to be required, when I go to the post-office, to take off my hat to Major This, or Colonel That? Certainly not. In a democracy men are entitled to use their titles only when they are on the business of those titles. When they are engaged in the ordinary business of the community they are only plain ""Misters."" ""Good-day, Mister. Pass out the letters, please."" I suppose the day will shortly come, if the present practice is persisted in, when one will have to say to the bar tender - "" Major, cocktail,"" or "" whisky and soda,"" or whatever it may be. I do not know anything about these matters now, though I did some years ago. Similarly, we shall have to give titles to the barmaids. We shall have to say- "" Lady, claret."" That is what we are coming to iii this country. The idea of the time of this House being occupied by a discussion as to whether a post-office official is to be called by a military title! Hitherto, I have looked upon the honourable and learned member for Corio with hope. I have gone home many a night thinking that if there was one man who ought to have been born under the Stars and Stripes, it was he. Now the illusion has vanished. Since the title of "" honourable"" was given to us all, there has been a great change. We shall have to petition His Majesty to stop the business, or it will break up' the of whole show. Let me take another point. Here we have captains, majors, colonels, 'that and other ranks; but in the United States Throughout the the Southern States, from east to west, every or from the man is a colonel.",20
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Does the honourable member suggest that the officials who have who been alluded to have not earned their,20
77,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Who says that they and have not earned them ? What is to - be gained by the use of these titles in a civilized community-in a Commonwealth of and so intelligent, thinking men? Do we find the man great Thomas Edison, of the United States, he complaining about titles? Edison is called re- "" Colonel"" by the people; but we have to remember that there is not a coloured man proin the Southern States of America who is not "" General,"" "" Colonel,"" or "" Major."" In the Southern States, if we go into an hotel we must call the coloured bar-tender "" Major"" or "" Colonel,"" or otherwise we shall not get a drink; and the position is thoroughly understood. The hangman in Georgia is "" Colonel,"" and the executioner at Sing Sing is "" General""; indeed, the latter will not look at an unfortunate client unless he is addressed by his title. I am amazed that the right honourable member for Swan, who is undoubtedly the.Emperor of Western Australia, should bring up a question of this kind. I know that there is no man in Australia who has a bigger heart than the right honourable member for Swan. When I was in Bunbury, I found that the people there did not call the right honourable member by his title, but were proud to tell tales and stories of "" Jack Forrest"" when he was a surveyor, and explored the Western country. In Ohio, we do not hear of "" The Honourable James Garfield,"" but are told of "" Jimmy,"" and shown the field lhat "" Jimmy "" ploughed. In Pennsylvania we do not hear of ""The Honourable James Blaine,"" but are told of "" Jimmy "" Blaine. When people begin to attach great importance to titles, they are losing their intelligence. Do we ever hear of "" The Honourable Julius Csesar?"" Do we ever hear of any title being given to Napoleon Bonaparte? Men of brains and intellect do not want titles, and I am amazed that the honourable member for Corio should place himself on a level with people, who, but for their titles, would not be seen across their wives' kitchen tables.",20

79,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Anyhow , he was always known as Julius Caesar. shortly to have an opportunity to move that the King be petitioned to give Australia the right to sell public titles at auction. There could be an auction every year, and the money might go to the hospitals. I advise those who are so struck on titles to christen their children after dukes and members of the Royal Family. Behind all titles there is the man - the title is the shadow, while the man is the substance. In a democracy we want honourable men to be honourable: and it is ridiculous that there should be a fight in the Post Office, about such titles as ""Captain "" or "" M a j o r . """,21
80,Mr LONSDALE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND," I had almost felt inclined to support the position taken up by the Postmaster-General, - but after the speech of the honourable member for Darwin, I feel rather disposed to go 1 the other way. The honourable member for Darwin asks us to be republican and democratic in our contempt of titles, and yet he has proved that the greatest Republic of all is, from end to end, full of titled people. Wherever people are called democratic or republicans, they are found to be favourable to titles.",21
81,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Hear , hear; that is quite true.",21
82,Mr LONSDALE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,And even the ladies of the United States are obtaining all the titles they possibly can.,21
83,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,The American ladies are buying the titles of foreign roosters.,21
84,Mr LONSDALE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Then it is an exchange of titles for money.,21
85,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,And beauty.,21
86,Mr LONSDALE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"If the honourable member for Darwin feels so strongly on this matter as he would like us to believe, he ought to do away with his name of "" King,"" and call himself citizen O'Malley. Personally, I am entirely opposed to titles being used in any way in our civil service. I cannot. understand any man using in his civil service duties a title which he has received for duties of quite another description ; and such a practice is altogether against our feelings and desires. I am rathr surprised that the right honourable member for Swan should have introduced the subject, and, though I do not always .agree with the Labour Party, I am glad to do so on the present occasionI t is extremely "" small "" on the part of the men who desire these so-called dignities. If I were a captain or a colonel-, I should certainly I hope discard the title in my capacity as a civil servant. Instead of indicating dignity and honour, such a use of titles indicates simply smallness of mind. I hope that the Postmaster-General will stand by his guns, and that we shall not have these follies introduced into our Public Service.",21
87,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND," I am rather surprised that a gentleman who is such a stickler for practice and precedent as is the right ho/jorable member for Swan should violate both practice and precedent in the action he has taken today. I have never known an adjournment motion, at any rate in this Parliament, to be proposed without the Government having received some previous notice. And, certainly, when it is proposed to challenge the conduct of a Department by a Minister, it is usual to give some indication to the Minister concerned.",21
88,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I can Minister that I did not think of giving him notice.,22
89,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The right honourable member for Swan has not, however, succeeded in taking me at the disadvantage which he evidently anticipated.",22
90,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,The Minister is attributing to me motives which I never possessed.,22
91,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Whil e accepting the right honourable gentleman's disclaimer, I would point out as a justification of belief which I have entertained, that not even correctly quote the answer which I gave to this House. The able member not merely garbled my answer, but actually misrepresented, the question which he placed on the paper, the decision which I had communitaken cated to the press.",22
92,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I do not think so.,22
93,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"I can prove it. Here the question1. If the expression by him in the Age, June . . . . "" The functions of this Departalways ment being purely civil, no recognition kind can be given to military titles."" . . . represents his views on this subject. That was quite correct; but the right honourable gentleman inserted the following after the word "" t it l e s "" : and that a man had no right to have such titles recognised. That is absolutely misleading with regard to mv action.",22
94,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I did not quote the Minister in that case.,22
95,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,No ; but that is the inference to be drawn from the question. It was to be inferred that I had done what the right honourable gentleman challenged me with having done.,22
96,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I presented the matter as it appeared to me from the newspaper report.,22
97,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Her e are the words used in the course of the interview with the Age reporterThe functions of this Department, being civil, no recognition of any kind can be given to military titles. I noted Mr Outtrim's supposition that "" officers can claim to use their titles at all times,"" but pointed outthat the issue was not a ""claim to' use"" their titles themselves, but their right to require other officers to recognise and use such titles in conversation and written communications. Now these words appeared in the report assure the published in the Age, and yet the right honourable gentleman puts his own interpretation on them, and does not quote the words actually used. Then he went further, and absolutely misrepresented the answer which I gave in the House yesterday.",22
98,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I should be very silly if I misrepresented what was in print ,22
99,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I cannot answer for the right honourable gentleman's lapses from the paths of discretion and sound common sense. I think that he erred seriously in the taking up the time of the House with a he did trumpery motion of this kind.,22
100,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The word ""trumright honorperv "" covers the whole position.",22
101,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"I say that it is not in merely trumpery, but contemptible. The noticetime of the House should not be up and the business of the country suspended, in order to deal with a small matter of this kind. Again, I have to comis plain,' of the right . honourable member's speech, which certainly was not of that of 3rd frank and outspoken character that we expect to be exhibited in addresses of any to this House. In condemning my refusal to recognise titles, he carefully concealed the real point at issue, which was that whilst these officers could themselves use their titles as much as they pleased, they had no right to compel other people, during official hours, to employ such titles in addressing them.",22
102,Mr MCCOLL,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Has that been attempted ?,22
103,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Yes , it has. I am glad the honourable member put that query, because I can give him a case in point. I find that, according to the Deputy Postmaster-General, the postmaster at Ballarat holds a captain's. commission, whilst one of his operatives is a major, and there are several others of his staff who are in the M i l it i a - I do not know what rank they hold. The Deputy Postmaster-General says- "" I am informed that the postmaster insists upon being addressed by his military title."" That is the whole case, namely, that this postmaster, in doing his work as a postpurely master, and not as an officer of the Defence Forces, insists that he shall be addressed by his military title.",22
104,Mr CROUCH,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Why does the Minister sneer ?,22
105,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Where is the sneer? The honourable and learned ""member made a reference just now which I 'described by aword that I am quite prepared to repeat. He dragged in the name of a gentleman who should not have been mentioned in this connection. It was something that I should never have expected from him. The whole point is that the postmaster at Ballarat insisted on being addressed by his military title during the discharge of his duties as postmaster.",23
106,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,B y his nates ?,23
107,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I presume so.,23
108,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Is the trouble garding the major?,23
109,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The trouble arose, not merely in regard to the use of titles, but also in reference to some of the officials coming to the post office in their military uniforms. They wear military trousers, put on post office coats, and then proceed to discharge their postal duties. The postmaster appears to have objected to position. this practice, not altogether grounds, because it is not proper that postal officials should waste - time brushing forms and polishing up military accoutrements. Of course, if anything like that happened he was perfectly justified in action he took. However, the outcome apinformed parently was a complaint that this officer insisted on his subordinates addressing him by his military title. Now, I wish to show tion brought up? the right honourable gentleman that the idea with regard to the use of these military described. titles did not first occur to my mind. I shall read a short minute written Secretary the Postmaster-General's Department- a gentleman who has had nearly half a century of official life - long before the matter came under my notice, and without any influence or word from me. Mr Scott said:Whatever rights the officers of such a force may have to their military titles, in my opinion those titles should not be used in connection with their positions or duties in this Department.",23
110,Mr CROUCH,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,What is the date of that ?,23
111,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Mr Scott did not affix the date, but the minute was written two or three days before it was suBmitted to me. The date on the document which evoked this minute was. 30th May, and I did not see the papers until last Thursday or Friday, so that the honourable and learned member can see that these documents must have been Avritten shortly after the Deputy Postmaster-General sent in his communication. Mr Scott goes on to sayThe use of such titles is evidently very capable of abuse, when it is found that a postmaster insists upon being addressed by the employees AA'orking under him in a civil capacity, by a military title. Any attempt to introduce military distinctions, or military usages, or discipline, into a large civil Department, such as that of the Postmaster-General, should, in my opinion, be not only discouraged, but distinctly forbidden.",23
112,Mr MCCOLL,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"He went A'ery much out of his Avay in Avriting such a minute Avithout instructions. subordi- Mr Mahon - I think that the honourable member is under some misapprehension.

122,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Yes .,23
123,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Somebody complained, I suppose?",23
124,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The postmaster at Ballarat forwarded all the papers to the Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria for his opinion, and that officer despatched them to the Secretary of the central office.",23
125,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Did one officer only complain ?,23
126,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,I am inclined to think the trouble arose through the refusal of the postmaster at Ballarat to alloAV one of his officials to Avear a portion of his military uniform Avhilst discharging postal duties.,23
127,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,He was quite right in so doing.,24
128,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"I do not deny that, because the officer in question may have occupied his time in attending to his military uniform, instead of in the discharge of offi-cial duties. I think that the postmaster at Ballarat adopted a proper course.",24
129,Mr EWING,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Is not the uniform of a member of the Defence Force intended to be worn only when on military duty ?,24
130,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The hours of military parade at Ballarat appear to coincide to some extent with the postal hours, consequently there is not time for officers to effect a change of clothing. That, I think, is the explanation of the trouble. honourable member for Swan affirmed that I had committed an illegal act, but he was very careful not to quote the section of the Act or the - regulation under it which I am supposed to have infringed.",24
131,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Thes e officers hold commissions under the Act.,24

135,Mr CROUCH,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,Is the honourable man speaking with authority in making statement ?,24
136,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"No . I infer that from the papers bearing upon the subject. The postmaster at Ballarat holds a captain's commission, and one of the telegraph operators there has attained the rank of major. I believe that friction between them was engendered in some personal interview. join There is no documentary evidence to show that it was created in right honourable member for Swan is very strong upon titles, and it is, therefore, curious to note that, as a member of the late Government, he was a party to a minute in which it was agreed to dispense with certain titles which Ministers hold "" under the law.""",24
137,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,That reference shows the straits to .which the honourable gentleman is driven in defending his action.,24
138,Mr MAHON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"It may be that, in this as in other instances, the right honourable member, in order to save his Cabinet position, swallowed some of the principles which might otherwise have guided his conduct. However, the fact remains that The on the 14th February, 1902, the Government of which he was a leading member, addressed to the Postmaster-General a letter couched in the following terms: SIR,-In connection with the agreement arrived at by Ministers, that in all departmental correspondence, the prefix of "" the honourable,"" or "" the right honourable,"" when applied to Ministers, and also all affixes are to be dispensed with, I be pleased if you will give instructions to have this rule of action observed in the official of your Department.

It is said that, so far as military events are concerned, history repeats itself only once in a hundred years, ancl I would remind the House that when the honourable and learned member for Corio took part in the celebrated Albert Park charge, he repeated an incident which occurred at the charge of Fuentes de Onoro, during the Peninsular War. On that occasion the infantry charged the artillery, and received a very rough handling; but at Albert Park the infantry turned the artillery. The Honourable and learned member complains that I speak of the Militia as "" Saturday afternoon soldiers,"" but I should like to know whether any soldier would attempt such an act as was committed at Albert Park by the honourable member for Corio, Captain Crouch?",25
148,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"The Japs, did the same thing a few days ago.  incident, but the hcjnorable and learned ber for Corio is in good company when is with the Japs. The right honourable ber for Swan desired to know the reason the decision of the Minister, and I presume that he is satisfied with the explanation that has been given.",26
149,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"N O reason has been given.  General toid the House of an incident occurred at the Ballarat post office? A Affairs?"" number of citizen soldiers employed in post-office attended for duty one Saturday morning attired in regimentals, their desire being to go on parade as early as possible. Before setting to work they removed their coats, helmets, and military accoutreanswered ments, retaining only their military trousers, ancl as soon as their duties at the office been discharged they were ready to don able member's contention. their accoutrements and set out for parade.",26
150,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"That incident does tion. not apply.  tion in the course of a few minutes i the right honourable ri.ember will permit to clo so. The postmaster at Ballarat obforces. jected to these, men wearing their military trousers while on duty, although he was stickler for titles, and insisted upon being addressed as ""Captain."" ing .that he was an officer he would not assist these men to attend on parade, and merely because they were only in the ranks. Had they been lieutenants or majors he would have given them every facility to carry out their desire to serve their country. I was never a prouder man than when I wore the military uniform, and I should advise every young man who is able to join a Military Force to do so as soon as possible. I have never regretted my connection with the Army. There is no disgrace in being a member of the ranks, notwithstanding what may be said by those snobs who put o.i frills and insist upon being addressed by their military titles. There are many good officers in the British Army who do not wish to be given their military titles while in private life. It is only pettifogging men in the Public Service who insist upon being addressed in that way, whilst they are discharging their everyday duties. The right honourable member for Swan has said that these men join the Militia merely because of the titles they secure, and I am satisfied that his assertion is correct. It memseems to me that I might very well give he the House on account of an incident that memhappened in one of the Commonwealth for offices. A man once called at the Commonwealth offices, and, on inquiring whether Mr Miller was in, was informed by a messenger that he did not know "" Mr Miller."" The inquirer, on continuing his way along the corridor, asked another messenger where he could find "" Mr Miller,"" and received the "" I suppose you want Colonel Miller, which '-'Secretary of the Department of Home ""That is the man,"" said the that stranger, and he was directed to another messenger, who, he was informed, would conduct him to Colonel Millers room. The stranger then' remarked to the messenger, "" I suppose you are a major?"" "" No , "" the man, "" I am only a captain in the Collingwood cadets."" That is an illushad tration of the absurdity of the right honorAnother incithe dent that occurred some years ago in South Australia has also a bearing on this quesWhen the right honourable member for Adelaide held office as Minister of Dein South Australia, he served as a f corporal under the Under Secretary of the me Department, who was in command of the On one occasion, while the forces were in camp, the Under-Secretary sent for a - "" Corporal Kingston,"" and, on the right honourable member attending at his tent, said Notwithstandto him, "" I am addressing you, sir, not as ' Corporal Kingston,' but as Mr Kingston, Premier of South Australia. I desire you to grant me two days additional leave, in order that I may direct further manoeuvres on the part of the forces."" Was not that an absurdity ?",26
151,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"In what way?  the whole system. When the Under-Secretary simply wished to ask for an extension of leave, why did he not go to, or send for, "" Mr Kingston,"" instead of sending for "" Corporal Kingston."" The right honourable member said in the course of his speech \hat the Postmaster-General could not override any law. A couple of years ago, when speakuig on the military estimates, the right honourable member for Swan told us that in Western Australia he had spent over £500,000 without the sanction of Parliament. Is not that rather inconsistent ?",27
152,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"I acknowledged that, in that instance, I broke the law.  pressed by the honourable and learned member for Cbrio,""but that we shall have here a system of military domination. I do not wish every second man in the Commonwealth to call himself colonel or captain, the honourable member for Darwin says is the practice in America. Let each of us stand or fall on his merits. The right honourable member for Swan twitted the members of the Labour Party with calling each other ""honourable members,"" but no one knows better than he does that the parliamentary rule compels us to do so. Only this afternoon Mr Speaker informed the House that we must address each other by the constituency which we represent.",27
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"On e could say the "" member for so-and-so,"" instead of the "" honourable member for so-and-so.""  able gentleman the "" member for Swan "" in future, if he prefers it. Personally, I do not care what I am called, so long as I am not called late for my "" tucker."" The right honourable member also spoke of the title of "" honourable "" which has been conferred upon the members of the first Federal Parliament. Members on this side of the chamber did not desire that title; and we may have an opportunity to prove our sincerity by voting on the subject. I 'do not wish for a colonial distinction. I am as Imperialistic as is the right honourable member; but, although he talks about the Empire and the soldiers of the King, he is willing to accept a merely colonial brand of title, which is not to be used outside the Commonwealth. No one on this side of the chamber wishes to use such a title.",27
154,Mr FOWLER,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,It is an insult to us.,27
155,Mr OMALLEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"It is like the cheap edition of a novel- "" For circulation in India and Australia only.""  ber for Swan told us that he would show how the Postmaster-General had violated the law, but the Postmaster-General was able to prove very clearly that the right honourable member had not read the regulations. If we are to be forced to call these gentlemen by their military titles, by all means let it be known. The honourable member for Corio has compared Australian with Imperial officers. I have seen some Saturday afternoon soldiers in the old country, but I never saw such guvs' of volunteers there as I have seen in Victoria. If they compare with the British soldier, God help the latter. A military man in the old country does not carry his title about with him, and tell every one "" I am Captain So-andso,"" or "" Major So-and-so,"" and I think that the Postmaster-General has done the right thing in nipping in the bud an' objecas tionable practice which was springing into existence here. Mr MCWILLIAMS' (Franklin) - I am very sorry to have heard in this chamber what I have protested against in a State Parliament-the sneering at a body of men of whom we should be proud, our citizen soldiers.",27
156,Mr CARPENTER,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,There has been no sneering at them.,27
157,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,The whole tone of some of the speeches which have been made. I regard as a sneer at our citizen soldiery.,27
158,Mr CARPENTER,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND,"Then the honourable gentleman is mistaken. Mr MCWILLIAMS' - I think that a good many other honourable gentlemen share my opinion. The honourable member for Maranoa has proved his claim to the title of soldier; but I was sorry to hear the tone in which he spoke of our volunteers. I have no claim to a military ""title. Although I was a volunteer for some years, I was never more than a private, as at the time. I was always busily employed, and hacl not sufficient leisure to work myself up from the ranks. But I take credit for having been a good marksman and. a good private. Still, I know men who have given up a considerable portion of their leisure time for many years past-me n who have not had too much leisure time-to make themselves acquainted with the duties of volunteer officers, and I am proud to say that they are regarded, not only by those whom they command, but also by the private citizens who come into contact with them and recognise the good work which they are doing, as a credit to the service. A good deal of objection has been expressed to militarism, and I am ready to class myself as an objector to anything which savours of that. I have no desire for a huge standing army, but I wish to see a good citizen soldiery established. I would like to see the boys of our schools, the children of rich and poor parents alike, compelled to undergo a certain amount of discipline, taught the rudiments of drill, and instructed how to shoot, so that they may learn the first duty of citizenship-to defend themselves and the country to which they belong. We shall not be able to build up a satisfactory citizen soldiery if we slight the officers of our Defence Forces. There is no comparison between the shoddy titles of which we have heard so much this afternoon, and those which our volunteer officers have won by perfecting themselves on the field, and by their books, in the art of warfare. I do not wish to touch upon a subject with which you, Mr. Speaker, have declined to allow other honourable members to deal, but I would point out that volunteer titles are very different from titles which have been obtained practically as the result of accident. The title of ""honourable"" which has been given to the members of the first Federal Parliament has attached what seems to me to be a distinct stigma, inasmuch as the condition is imposed that it must not be used outside Australia. The Federal Parliament, in my opinion, has not given the volunteer officers and privates the consideration which they should have received, and the result is that, although we are now paying more to our citizen soldiery, we are not getting as good a return as when we had purely Volunteer Forces. Honourable members may sneer at volunteers who give up their Saturday afternoons, but they forget that it is a great thing for a man who enjoys only one half-holiday a week to devote it. to military training, and, further, to employ additional holidays in continuous training in camp. The least .we can do for those who make this sacrifice is to give them encouragement. We shall not create the spirit which should animate our Defence Forces unless we do so. Our best defence, that upon which we can most surely-rely, will be our volunteer - forces, who consist of citizens trained to defend themselves and their country. I have not gathered very clearly from the papers which have been read how this trouble has arisen, but I think that the right honourable member for Swan did right in drawing attention to the matter, so that we may have it cleared up, and know where we are. I have invariably recognised my old volunteer officers by their titles, and shall continue to do so, in spite of any action which the Government may take; just as I shall have pleasure, so long as the House thinks that they should retain them, in calling my honourable friends who now hold office by the titles which they have won. I am no slavish advocate of the use of titles. Personally, I do not believe in them. But when a man wins a title by industry, pluck, energy, or ability, I am prepared to recognise it, whether he be a volunteer, a minister of the church, a Minister of the State, or anyone else. It is a different matter when men obtain titlesthrough the accident of being pitchforked into a position. I repeat that I regret that what I feel, and what the volunteers of Australia will feel, to be a slight and a sneer upon them has been given by the action of the Government in depriving them of titles which they have fairly won.",27
159,Mr FOWL ER,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND," The honourable member for Franklin was hardly fair in imputing to honourable members a desire to sneer at our volunteers. I heartily approve of the action of the Postmaster-General, to it because I am anxious to uphold the honour of the Defence Forces. As a volunteer I have worn a military uniform, and am proud of the fact, and I shall continue to do all, in my power to encourage those upon whom we must rely for defence in time of need. I should be one of the last to adopt an arbitrary attitude towards gentlemen who are entitled to use military designations. But the Postmaster-General has made it clear that his object is, not to prevent the use of military titles by their possessors, but to resist the attempt, made with more enthusiasm than good taste, to compel others to use them. That is how the trouble has arisen. I think that if a vote of the officers of the Defence Force were taken on the subject, they would be found to approve of the action of the Postmaster General. They do not, I presume, consider the title so necessary that they are willing to insist upon its use by those who do not wish to recognise it. That is apparently what is being done in at least one case, and that in itself is sufficient to give point to the direction of the Postmaster-General that in future no attempt of the kind shall be tolerated. I feel quite sure that in acting in this manner, the Minister has been defending the honour of the large majority of the officers of the Defence Forces, who, whilst fully entitled to their military designations, do not insist upon their recognition by others. That is the whole position, and I do not think that it is quite fair to attempt to make capital out of the incident. One or two honourable members have represented the action of the Minister as humiliating to the omcers of the Defence Forces, and the attitude of honourable members on this side as distinctly hostile to our citizen soldiery. I desire to protest against both those suggestions.",28
160,Mr WILLIS,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND," I was one of those honourable members who rose in their places to enable the right honourable member for Swan to move the adjournment. My object was to afford the right honourable member an opportunity to substantiate his case. After having heard the statement of the Postmaster-General, I feel that there is no desire on his part ""to prevent titles of distinction from receiving due recognition under proper circumstances. Many anomalies might arise if military titles were recognised in connection with service in a Public Department. We might, for instance, find a subordinate in the Postal Service holding a higher military, title than his superior officer. I understand that the Minister has decided that military titles are not to be recognised in connection with the official work of the Department, and that juniors will not be compelled to address their seniors by such titles. I am pleased to have an opportunity to support the Minister in the stand which he has taken, because he is one of the few men capable of occupying such a position. I trust that he will continue to keep a strong hold of his Department, and see that proper discipline is maintained throughout the service.",29
161,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND," I trust that honourable members will allow us to .proceed to another item of business shortly, because I have asked honourable members in another place to assist us, and they are now awaiting an opportunity to do so. With regard to the question which has been introduced by the right honourable member for Swan, I do not think that the attitude of the Postmaster-General-wit h which I quite agree-involve s more than a direction as to what is to be done in departmental routine. There is no desire on the part of my honourable colleague to in any way belittle the men in the Public Service who have, at great sacrifice, qualified themselves to hold commissions and take part in the defence of the country, should occasion arise. There is no desire to underrate the services rendered to the country by these gentlemen; but it must be apparent that, to insist upon the recognition of military titles throughout the service would lead, as it has led in the past, to a great deal of inconvenience. It must be remembered that very often public servants occupying superior positions hold military rank far below that of some of their subordinates. [Debate interrupted. Business of the day called on under Standing Order 119]. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",29
162,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY AND," I desire to make a personal explanation. The Postmaster-General charged me with discourtesy in not giving him notice of my intention to move the adjournment of the House. I desire to say that this is the first occasion during my twenty-one years of continuous Parliamentary life upon which I have moved the adjournment of the House for the purpose of bringing forward a matter of public importance. I was not aware of the procedure usually followed. Furthermore, I had in my mind that the honourable gentleman would know all about the subject. I wish to assure him that I had no idea of taking him at a disadvantage, and if I have occasion to take similar action in future I shall be only too glad to give notice of my intention to the Minister concerned. SUPPLEMENTARYESTIMATES AiSfD NA FOR WORKS ANDBUILDINGS , 1903-4. Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of messages from His Excellency the Governor General, transmitting Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure f o i the year ending 30th June, 1904; and Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for Additions, New Works and Buildings for the year ending 30th June, 1904, and recommending appropriation accordingly. In Committee of Supply: Divisions 4, 5, and 10 ("" Other ""), £[544.",29
163,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Bland-Treasurer) I am submitting today Supplementary Estimates of expenditure, which, although comprising a great many items, will, on examination, be found to be not nearly so formidable as they would at first appear. I may say that they very largely represent items which have been advanced by my predecessor from'the Treasurer's advance vote, ancl that the principal reason why I come to the Committee on this occasion is that that vote has been exhausted for some week or so past. It is quite possible, in fact more than likely, that within the next few weeks contingencies will arise which will necessitate an immediate payment by the Treasurer. fore, it is necessary to obtain further supplies, and the only manner in which that can be satisfactorily done is by reimbuising the Treasurer's advance by voting a large proportion of the items which have caused its depletion. I have not been able to keep to the letter of the intimation I made a few nights ago. I then said I did not anticipate asking for any amounts except those which hacl been authorized by the late Treasurer or myself, and which would be, strictly speaking, required for the reimbursement of the Treasurer's advance. I find, however, that there are a few items that I could not meet from the Treasurer's advance, because I hacl not the money, but which it is absolutely essential shall be paid almost immediately. Therefore, I have departed from the intimation I recently made to that extent, ancl I now ask in these Supplementary Estimates that I may be granted some extra sums of money which I shall indicate. In the first place, the total sum asked for in these Estimates is, for the ordinary Estimates, ,£137,216. and for works and buildings ,£42,294; or a total of ,£179,510. The ordinary Estimates include the sum of £ 1 8 , 0 0 0 odd for the payment of Victorian civil servants under section 19 of the State Act of December. 1900.",30
164,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Is that debited to the State of Victoria?,30
165,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yeo . I might say that I do not anticipate that this sum will be nearly sufficient to meet all the claims for which the Commonwealth is responsiblethat is, for which we have to find the money, but which will eventually be debited to the State of Victoria. That is not nearly the sum which has accrued since the ComPARLIAMENT. monwealth took over the Departments. A number of other claims will have to be paid, but these have not, so far, been ascertained. I asked the Public Service Commissioner for an estimate covering the years during which the Commonwealth has had control of the transferred Departments; but, unfortunately, in the absence of particulars from the various Departments, he was not able to furnish me with anything like an accurate estimate of the liability which will have to be met by the Commonwealth. It must be remembered that this liability has now been running for three years, and that the postal officials, particularly, having obtained a decision from the High Court in the case of Bond v. The Qtieen, to the effect that we are liable to pay 'to an official of a similar grade in Victoria the highest salary payable in There- any other State, we must be prepared, as soon as the liability is definitely ascertained, to make good the whole amount from the Commonwealth finances. Of course, the State of Victoria will eventually bear the burden. strictly Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Custom s officials would be included within the provisions of that Act ?",30
166,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes ; but the amount now proposed to he voted is to be distributed among only postal employees-mostl y letter carriers. The Public Service Commissioner, in the absence of particulars, stated that he thought that the liability would probably amount to about £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 per annum for the three years during which the Commonwealth had exercised control over the transferred Departments-in other words, a total liability of £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 has already accrued during Commonwealth control. I do not wish it to be understood that the Public Service Commissioner binds himself to those figures. That intimation, however, was the only one that he was able to make to me a fortnight ago.",30
167,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Will the obligation continue ? 1,30
168,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I shall come to that point presently. Some of the postal officials further claim that, not only are arrears of salary clue to them at the rate which was paid in December, 1900, to officials of a similar grade in any part of the Commonwealth, but that they are entitled to increments which are being paid to some officers in South Australia. I do not include any claim of that description in the sum for which I am now asking. From my point of view, it is extremely doubtful whether officers in Victoria are entitled by the operation of the law to increments which have accrued to officers in South Australia between December, 1900, and the present time.",30
169,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,What is the nature of these increments?,31
170,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Some officers-ther e are not many of them-in South Australia which was the State selected by the Victorian postal officials in order to test the case of Bond v. The Queen-wh o can point to long service and good conduct, are entitled to receive increments up to a maximum amount at certain stated periods. It is now urged that the Victorian officials, having established their claim to a salarysimilar to that received by officers of their own grade in South Australia, are also entitled to the increments which have accrued to these South Australian officers. There is this point about the matter-tha of the Victorian Statute, under which this claim is put forward, contains the words "" the highest salary then payable.""",31
171,Mr TUDOR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,To any officer in a corretion sponding position.,31
172,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes ; but the section is largely governed by the words "" then able."" If that view is upheld-and I mention that the Attorney-General holds the same opinion-it seems clear that the wealth service. Victorian officers are entitled to receive no more than was paid to officers in a corresome sponding grade elsewhere at the Victorian Act was passed. In other words, they are not entitled to claim these increments. I am not asking the Committee to vote anything further",31
173,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is to be hoped that all will be ultimately placed on the same footing.,31
174,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am not asking the Committee to satisfy these claims, because if we did that, and the High Court subsenow quently decided that they should not have been paid, in all probability we should be unable to recover the money from the officers in question, and the taxthat payer would be held responsible for a refund of the amount that we had Legislature illegally paid. I am merely asking the Committee to pay the sum which has already accrued, and for which been held liable by the High Court. As the Judges of the Full Court of Victoria, and afterwards the Justices of the High Court, intimated, it is very difficult to decide what constitutes "" a corresponding position."" The length of service of an officer may constitute an element in the matter/ For instance, an officer may be receiving a certain salary, partly because of the work that he has to perform, and partly because of the long period that he has been in the service. It is very difficult to law down a hard-and-fast rule, and to. say that any two positions correspond. That is where the primary difficulty of the Court arose in construing the Victorian Act. I agree with the honourable member for Lang that it is desirable - to place all officers on the same footing. Up to the present, however, we have been governed by the State laws and practice in every instance. Neither the late Government, nor the present Government, should accept any responsibility for the anomalous state of affairs which exists.",31
175,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,There is no question of t section 19 responsibility.,31
176,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We d'o not accept responsibility for the anomalous state of affairs prevailing. I admit that the quesof responsibility arises, in that it was the duty of the Government, at the earliest possible moment to introduce a Public Serpayvice Act, and regulations under it, to may insure that the same treatment should be meted out to every officer in the Common",31
177,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In the smaller States, of those who perform the least work time the get the highest salaries.",31
178,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That may be so. Coming now to the question of whether the obligation will continue, the classification scheme under the Public Service Act will be ready to be gazetted not later than the ist July. It is certainly my own . view-althoug h it is a matter for the Courts to determine-that that scheme will supplant all the anomalous conditions prevailing, not only in the other States, but also in Victoria, and will limit the period during which section 19 9f the Victorian Act can operate. I cannot believe the Victorian Parliament ever intended to tie the hands of the Commonwealth in the administration of these Departments for all time, or for such time as Victorian transferred officers may remain we have in Commonwealth employment.",31
179,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Victorian Parliament is responsible for some very grave discrepancies.,32
180,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Fro m my reading of the section I do not think that it will have that effect. In my view, the classification scheme, which has involved an enormous amount of labour on the part of the Public Service Commissioner-it is a monumental work-wil l overcome many of the difficulties to which I have referred. T am also asking the House to vote .£9,500 for the carriage of mails upon the Western Australian railways. I understand that it has not been the practice to make so large an allowance to the Railway Commissioners of that State. Very properly they now ask to be placed upon the same footing as the Railway Commissioners in the other States, who are paid as ordinary contractors for the carriage of mails.",32
181,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"They desire to be paid a proportionate sum, I suppose?",32
182,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes . The usual practice is to pay so much per mile per annum, with alterations where the trains do not run daily. The amount involved is a large one, ancl that is the reason why I draw attention to it . At present I do not quite understand why provision was not made in the Estimates-in-Chief for a sum to be paid in this connection. No doubt if the right honourable member for Balaclava-whos e illness we all deplore-were present, he would be ready with a satisfactory explanation.",32
183,Mr CARPENTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Is this payment for arrears only ?,32
184,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes . It has accrued, but it is one to which there should be np objection. Inasmuch as we pay the Railway Commissioners for the carriage of mails in every other State, we must pay them at a similar rate in Western Australia. There are a number of other items to which I should like to direct attention. One of these has reference to the travelling expenses of the Justices of the High Court and their Associates. presents a sum of £ 1 , 7 0 0. That is to be charged to a special appropriation, but it really does not involve an increased expenditure. The Attorney-General has recentlyexpressed the opinion that we must make a special appropriation in connection with these travelling expenses. For this year, however, I ask the Committee to vote the money in the way that is proposed. It really cloes not represent an increased expenditure, because when the High Court was created, Bill was dealt with. Parliament contemplated paying the travelling expenses of the Justices, ancl provision was made for it .",32
185,Mr MCCOLL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Are those expenses "" o n scale?""",32
186,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Unde r Executive min-' ute it was decided to pay the actual amount of the expenses.,32
187,Mr MCCOLL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,-Upq n vouchers?,32
188,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes . At the present time, however, I am considering the desirability of introducing a scale, in lieu of the voucher system. I shall have further information upon that subject at a later stage. What I desire to impress upon the Committee is that this sum does not necessarily involve an increased expenditure, as compared with that upon the Estimates-inChief. Then, in division 22, page 8, provision is made in connection vvith the Department of Home Affairs for works and buildings. "" Transferred expenditure "" is set down at .£5,498, and ""other"" at £3,714. Concerning these items, there will be a saving on the votes of former Appropriation Acts in transferred expenditure, which will probably balance the amount for which I am now asking. The "" other expenditure "" will be slightly more than was anticipated. In the matter of works and buildings, only eight months of the year are available in which to expend the money authorized by Parliament. The Estimates are usually passed in September, and only eight months remain in which to get out plans and specifications, call for tenders, and arrange for the starting of the works. Consequently, it is certain that there will always be a considerable saving on the nominal sum voted by Parliament. Upon this occasion, however, we do not anticipate that there will be a much larger saving than I have just indicated. In division 24, subdivision 1, provision :'s made for the sum of .£2,590, on account of the cost of the Federal Capital Sites Commission. The Commission was appointed by the late Government, with, I believe, the It retacit approval of Parliament, but I think that our predecessors in office should have made provision on the Estimates for the payment of a large sum on this account, so that it would have been unnecessary to have recourse to the Treasurer's advance account. It seems to me, at all events, that this expenditure might have been foreseen.",32
189,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It was not until the close of the session that the Seat of Government If the Bill had been finally passed into law' a great deal of this expenditure would not have been necessary.,32
190,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am referring to the Royal Commission, of which Mr Kirkpatrick was chairman. The Commission was appointed before the Seat of Government Bill was dealt with.",33
191,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Does this item relate only to that Commission? I think it will be found by the honourable gentleman that it covers the cost of the work done by the surveyors lent to the Commonwealth by the Government of New South Wales, and whose reports have been laid on the table of the House.",33
192,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I shall look into the matter, and refer to it at a later stage. At all events, this grant from the Treasurer's advance account was made by my predecessor in office, and in response to inquiry I was tentatively informed that the facts were as I have stated. Provision is also made for an extra sum of .£3,500 in respect of the cost of the general election.",33
193,Mr GLYNN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Anothe r general election?,33
194,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,No ; we do not contemplate making provision for anything in that direction.,33
195,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Is the item ',£3,500 or ;£ >5°°? 2",33
196,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"£3,50 0 is the nominal sum; but we shall be recouped .£1,000 by the Government of New South Wales. They agreed to allow us that amount, in respect of the cost of taking the referendum on the question of whether there should be a reduction of members in the State Parliament, in conjunction with the Federal elections. That payment will reduce the net amount to .£2,500; but we shall require the whole amount.",33
197,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Was there any undertaking on the part of the Government of New South Wales to recoup us to the extent named ?,33
198,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes ; they have undertaken to pav £1,000.",33
199,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Then we can reasonably expect to receive that amount?,33
200,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Yes .,33
201,Mr ROBINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Will it be paid by Mr. O'Sullivan out of the loan funds?,33
202,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not think that at present there is any very great shortage in the public accounts of New South Wales. The State Government have been economizing. In view of the large expenditure involved in the conduct of the general election, and having regard to the fact that the Department had to largely rely on men of whom the ofncials at the head office had had no previous experience, I do not think that this additional sum is in any way remarkable.",33
203,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I do not think that it is enough. Many of the officers were underpaid.,33
204,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The officers of the Electoral Department considered that they would be able to discharge all liabilities if this extra sum were provided, and I therefore had no hesitation in granting it a little while ago from the Treasurer's advance account. It does not represent a large percentage of error, having regard to the enormous expenditure which the general election involved.",33
205,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is so small as to suggest almost the idea of sweating.,33
206,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In division 32A, a sum of £2,683 is asked for in respect of expenses incurred in New South Wales under the Sugar Bounties Act, and £4,062 is also asked for in division 34A in respect of expenses incurred in Queensland under the same Statute. Each item represents only a bookkeeping entry.",33
207,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In divisions 32 and 33 provision is made for an increased expenditure in New South Wales and Victoria. I am aware, of course, that the late Treasurer is probably responsible for them, but are not these amounts large to appear in Supplementary Estimates? The increase in the case of New South Wales is .£1,996.",33
208,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It will be found that that item does not increase the total expenditure.,33
209,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I thought that, perhaps, would be the case.",33
210,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I . shall explain these items in the course of the next few minutes. In division 32, there is an item in respect of salaries of certain officers. These are officers over 65 years of age, for whom provision was made only until the 30th September, 1903, in the expectation that they would then be retired. It was subsequently decided to grant them leave of absence, extending up to six months, according to their length of service, and this provision is necessary in order that the payments may be made to them. It represents extra expenditure; but expenditure that was incurred during the term of office of the late Government, and upon the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner.",33
211,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Does the same thing apply in the case of Victoria, or are the items simply, provided here in a different form? Subdivision 1 of division 33 deals, with payments to sub-collectors and others in this State.",33
212,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"So far as Victoria is concerned, this item is due to the adjustment of the expense of maintaining border customs houses. Duties are no longer collected on the borders, necessary to maintain customs houses there, in order to keep records for bookkeeping purposes of the passing of' goods from one State to another. This involves no increase of expenditure. For example, the items of £ 5 8 5 , in respect of sub-collectors, ,£241 in respect of clerks, £ 5 5 2 in respect of three watchmen, and £ 4 8 in regard to one officer, are included in the original Estimates, but are charged to New South Wales. In order to secure a more accurate adjustment, it is necessary that they should be charged against each State. We now find that we must debit Victoria with a greater proportion of the expense of maintaining these border customs houses.",34
213,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Does the total sum of .£1,996 in division 32 represent additional expenditure in New South Wales?",34
214,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"A portion of it does. We have, for instance, to provide for additional expenditure incurred in connection with the proper protection of the Customs ancl Excise revenue. The precautions taken at once involve expense; but it often happens that we receive back a considerable amount in respect p f fines, and revenue from other sources, so that the expenditure is well justified.",34
215,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I wish to know whether the whole of these items were included the original Estimates.,34
216,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I find that the item in division 32, to which reference was by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, is really a question of bookAct, keeping. A slight expenditure in Victoria is certainly involved, but that outlay canorable not very well be avoided.",34
217,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I am satisfied.,34
218,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Wit h regard to the provision made in division 32A., in respect of sugar bounties, I would point out that it is a book entry. It means that now charging against the Sugar Bounties Act the cost of its administration. I Estimates-in-Chief that cost was debited to the various Customs Departments, and therefore became transferred expenditure; but, the Sugar Bounties Act having passed, it becomes ""other expenditure,"" ancl in order that an accurate account of "" other expenditure may be kept, we find 1 1 it necessary to debit against the Act the total cost of its administration. It is in reality a mere book-keeping difference. The money has been granted from the Treabut it is surers' advance account.",34
219,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It transfers the liability from specific States to a population proportion.,34
220,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Quite so; but so f ar as the actual expenditure is concerned it is merely a book-keeping entry. It means, of course, a little difference in the adjustment.",34
221,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It means, for example, that Viptoria will have a little more to pay.",34
222,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Possibl y that is so. I regret that it was necessary to adopt this course. The action vvas not taken on my initiative. The whole matter had been simmering for a considerable time, and, so far as we can ascertain, there is no escape from the course proposed to be followed. We are also asking for a sum of .£6,000 odd to allow of refunds of over-charges in respect of rent of quarters. I am sorry that it is necessary to bring forward the item in this way. It seems to me that it should have been provided for in the Estimates-inChief. The rent charged to officers occupying Government buildings should have !>een reduced to the lower rate immediately on the passing of the Public Service Act. Although the Act provides that not more than 10 per cent, shall be deducted from officers' salaries in respect of rent of Government buildings occupied by them, in the deductions were continued on the old basis, with the result that we now have to refund to these officers in two States a sum made exceeding £^6,000. This refund must take place in accordance with the terms of the and I am therefore asking that provision be made for it. In division 178, honmembers will find an item of £ 1 , 9 5 0 in respect of refund of Customs duties paid by the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. We have to make this refund under an agreement entered into principally by the South Australian Government, that the we are company should be allowed to bring in all stores in connection with the cable sern the vice free of duty. As the company has been charged duty in respect of some of its stores, it is now necessary to make a refund. With regard to the statement been made by me a few moments ago relative to the cost of the Capital Sites Commission, I find on looking furthei into the matter that the original item in the Supplementary Estimates included provision for the Commission, but not sufficient provision. With regard to the item on page 53, under the heading Expenditure in the State of Western Australia, Postmaster-General's Department: Conveyance of mails by railway, ^9,500j ,£12,550 was set down in the original Estimates for the carriage of mails by the Railway Department of Western Australia; but the right honourable member for Balaclava assented to a claim by the Government of that State for payment at higher rates, that is, at rates equal to those charged by the Victorian Railway Department. This necessitates an additional vote of £9,500. Provision was made by the right honourable member to the extent which then appeared necessary.",34
223,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Will the honourable gentleman give the Committee some information in regard to the item Services of analyst, £ 7 5 1 , which appears at page 18 of the Estimates? What is the final arangement which has been come to?",35
224,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Indorsing the action of our predecessors, we have agreed with the Government of Western Australia to pay £20 0 a year for any services that may be rendered by their analyst to the Customs Department in that State.",35
225,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,So that there will be a saving of £ 5 5 ° ?,35
226,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes . .£751 is the charge which the analyst has made for services rendered without an agreement, so that the arrangement now come to means a considerable saving. We .must, of course, pay on the old basis up to the time when the agreement was entered into, which was, I think, in October last. There is another matter to which I desire to call attention. On the last page of the Estimates, the sum of £22.000 is put down on account of the Department of Defence. The appearance of that amount is explained in this way: The late Minister of Defence desired 10 procure rifles and ammunition at. a cost greater than the amount voted on the Estimates for the year, and the Treasurer of the day agreed that if savings were made in the ordinary expenditure of the Department, he would advance a corresponding sum from his vote. On that understanding, he advanced ,£48,000; and although we appear to ask for£22,000 more than the original estimate, there will be a saving sufficient to balance it. The rifles and ammunition have been pajid for by savings in other branches of military expenditure, and although nominally ,£22,000 is asked for, no greater expenditure is involved than was assented to by the Committee when it passed the original Estimates. For expenditure in New South Wales, we ask for ,£24,875, on account of transferred Departments, and for .£9,675 for ""other"" Departments; while £7,525 is required for new works and buildings in connection with transferred Departments, and £2,000 in connection with othei Departments, or a grand total of ,£44,155. For expenditure in Victoria, a total of £71,021 is required. That amount has been swelled by the inclusion of the ,£19,000 needed for the payment of postal employees. The amount required for Queensland is ,£16,000; for South Australia ,£15,000, and for Western Australia £27,000. The .£9,500 for conveyance of mails by railway, included in the Western Australian amount, will not affect thefinancesof that State, because it is merely a book entry. The Commonwealth pays the money to the State authorities, and they show it in their books as a credit, but the taxpayers are none the better and none the worse off so far as it is concerned, though, of course, it is a proper bookkeeping transaction. For Tasmania, the total amount required is £4,800.",35
227,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Will the. honourable gentleman explain how the vote for the Post Office comes to £82,315?",35
228,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That amount includes .£18,650 due to letter-carriers, which.I have explained, and .£9,500 to be paid for the carriage of mails on the railways of Western Australia; while, in addition, there are a number of increases which are more apparent than real. For instance, in the original Estimates provision was made for the appointment of permanent salaried officers to do work previously done by temporary officers. In Victoria, the Department had been in the habit of employing temporary messengers and letter-carriers; but some time ago it was decided- I think very properly-to substitute a number of permanent hands for these temporary employees. But, perhaps because the Commissioner has been engaged in other work, or for other reasons which I have not had time to ascertain, the appointments have hot been made. Consequently I am asking for a vote to cover the wages of the temporary hands who are retained, although I guarantee a corresponding saving on the original Estimates.",35
229,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"How much of the -£50,000 unaccounted for is new expenditure, and how much was provided for on the original Estimates?",36
230,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I will obtain the information. There are other amounts which swell the expenditure. For instance, a resolution of this House, passed during the consideration of the regulations under the Public Service Act, requires that if a man has worked during the six preceding days, he must be paid time and a-half for overtime Worked on Sunday. Then, the regulations provide for sick leave, as well as annual leave, being granted under certain conditions, and this involves the employment of temporary hands to do the work of those who are absent. It may relieve the minds of honourable members to know that, although I am asking for ,£180,000, there will be a saving of at least £200,00 0 on the Estimates-in-Chief; so that what I ask for is more than balanced by the saving that will be effected.",36
231,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,How will there be a saving?,36
232,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In many instances, especially in connection with the construction of works and buildings, it will be impossible to spend the amount voted by Parliament before the vote lapses by effluxion of time. Of course, in many cases the unexpended balance will be re-voted, though the re-votes for this year will not be so large as the revotes required last year, - because a larger proportion of the original votes will be spent this year than was spent last year.",36
233,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Then there will be no real saving.,36
234,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In many cases the money will have to be voted again; but in other cases there will be an absolute saving, and no re-vote will be required. have come into office, we have forbidden one or two proposed expenditures which seemed to us, on information not available to our predecessors, to be unnecessary; but, apart from them, there are savings such as those in the Defence Department, where they have not spent money upon certain training, which they might otherwise have had, or have not recruited as they might have done, or have substituted one kind of encampment for another. I do not saythat the whole of the £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 odd required for that Department will be saved. Part of the amount will have to be re-voted.",36
235,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,But are these savings being made at the cost of efficiency ?,36
236,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Upon that point I am not sufficient of an expert to pronounce an opinion.,36
237,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Some of the amounts unexpended may not be real savings. Mr WATSON. - The honourable member must remember that efficiency is relative. I think, that an untrained man with a gun is more efficient than a trained man without a gun. Consequently, we cannot have lost in efficiency by expending ,£50,000 upon rifles and reserve ammunition, as against devoting money to the training of men without guns.",36
238,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In other words, the money formerly spent in training is being laid out upon arms and ammunition.",36
239,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes ; what I wish tb bring home to the members of the Committee is that the total of £180,000 does not wholly represent an addition to the expenditure authorized by Parliament a little less than a year ago. Against that amount we shall be able to show ,£200,000 less expenditure than was provided for upon the original Estimates. So that these proposals, although they involve at considerable amount, largely deal with! the manner of the expenditure rather than with an addition to its amount. In other words, it is largely a question of how we shall expend what has been already voted, and I have thought it necessary to make a few explanations with regard to leading features. I shall appreciate the forbearance of honourable members, to the extent to which they deem it proper to exercise it, because of the total sum of £179,000, the amount of ,£139,000 has already run the gauntlet of examination by a careful, conscientious, and economical Treasurer-the Since we right honourable member for . Balaclava. Then there is a sum of ,£10,000 for the expenditure of which I have given the authority. This includes £ 3 , 0 0 0 odd for the Electoral Department. Then there is ,£29,000 not yet authorized, either by myself or my predecessor. This includes ,£28,000, which is made up of the two items, £ 1 8 , 0 0 0 for the postal employees, and ,£9,000 odd for the Western Australian railway service. Therefore, with the exception of these two items, I am practically asking the Committee to pass what has already been authorized to be paid from the Treasurer's advance, either by my predecessor or myself.",36
240,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," I am sure that we must all regret that my late honourable colleague, the honourable member for Balaclava, is unable to be present, because he could have assisted the Treasurer io explaining the Supplementary Estimates, for the greater part of which he is responsible. I am sure the Committee will be gratified to learn that the right orable member is making steady and sure progress, and I hope that within a few days we shall have him amongst us again. I desire to congratulate the Prime Minister upon having made a very fair and clear statement. In consideration of the innumerable duties which devolve upon the head of the Government, the manner in which he has mastered the business which he has submitted to us today is greatly to his credit. I do not think that the Committee can complain that he has refrained from furnishing any information which so far seems necessary. If there has been any omission, no doubt he will supply the deficiency. The most serious statement which the Prime Minister has made is one which, unhappily, very seriously affects the State of which I have the honour to be one of the representatives. I trust that the public will be made to realise that, for this extra-and what bids fair to become an enormous-amount , the members of this Parliament are in no sense responsible. I had the good fortune not to be a member of the Victorian Parliament when the majority of honourable members of that body passed the amending Public Service Act in December, 1900. I have learnt since that the particular provision to. which I refer was a proposal which was not submitted by the Government, but was debated at some length, in the course of a general financial discussion, and passed in the small hours of the morning by a tired House.",37
241,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable member for Melbourne proposed it.,37
242,Mr ROBINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable member for Balaclava was the Treasurer of the day who accepted it..,37
243,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Unde r the pressure of my honourable friend and those who voted with him.,37
244,Mr ROBINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"No , I was against it.",37
245,Mr TUDOR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable and learned member did not vote against it.,37
246,Mr ROBINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I should have done if I had been there.,37
247,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The incident is useful to us as a warning against legislating under similar circumstances I am not yet entirely satisfied that we have reached safety for the Commonwealth in this matter. This payment is being made under a Victorian law, and we are assured by the Supreme Court of Victoria-by the judgment of a single Judge and of the F u l l honCourt-that the particular amount involved in the case of Bond v. The Queen ought to be paid. The matter came before the High Court in the form of Bond v. The Commonwealth. The only point settled by the High Court was the question of law as to whether the obligation rested upon the Commonwealth to find this money, although no provision had been made for it in the Appropriation Act ; in other words, whether under the circumstances the accruing and existing obligations to the public servants provided in the Victorian Act imposed such obligations on the Commonwealth as to justify the Executive of the day in disharging them, even though they were not provided for in the Appropriation Act.",37
248,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Chief Justice of the High Court accepted the decision of the Victorian Court.,37
249,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes . He accepted the decision of the Victorian Supreme Court, and announced that the High Court would always follow a similar course in regard to State legislation if it were possible to do so. He pointed out that they had not considered it necessary to reconsider the judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria. They accepted the judgment of the Victorian Court as to the amount, and laid down the principle that the obligation rested upon the Commonwealth to pay the claim, even though no provision was made in .the Appropriation Act. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he is satisfied as to the means which have been adopted for determining the financial liability of the Commonwealth in any further cases, except that of Bond. In the case of Bond v. The Commonwealth, the High Court accepted the verdict of the Supreme Court as to the specific amount to which Bond was entitled, and we are perfectly safe, so far as that is concerned. If my information be correct, an agreement has been arrived at between the Public Service Commissioner of the State of Victoria and the public servants concerned as to the amount which is to be accepted by each public servant in full satisfaction of his claims. If such sums have been accepted in full quittance of their claims, the Commonwealth will be safeguarded so far as that goes. desire to know whether we shall be safeguarded to that extent with regard to all the officers the Prime Minister has mentioned, and whether the same principle will be applied to other employees elsewhere. I hope that the Prime Minister will not fai l to notice that it. will be necessary to take some precaution in these cases-n o less, at all events, than has been exercised in those which have been dealt with. Otherwise we may not only be overpaying without the possibility of recovery, but we may be exposing ourselves to a great variety' of actions of a more or less vexatious character. that the Prime Minister will not consider that I am trespassing if I again press the matter upon him,",37
250,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"So far, we are not doing anything without the fullest consultation with our own Commissioner and the At torney-General.",38
251,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes . But while the Goexpense vernment, in consulting the Attorney-Genedecision ral, and the Public Service missioner safeguard their own side of the hedge, the claimant on the other side of the gone. hedge may not be satisfied, and may raise further claims and place the Commonwealth in a position of disadvantage. alarms me particularly is that it is possible that the State of Victoria may be required to pay the large sum of ,£75,000, on account of the unwise and imprudent Victorian Act which has been referred to. I desire know what calculation has been made, and how the estimate of £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 has been rived at - I understand that it is estimate of the Public Service Commissioner ?",38
252,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I asked the. Public Service Commissioner to give me an estimate of amount of the claims for the three years during which the Commonwealth had conOffice trolled the transferred Departments, and said that he did not think fhat it would amount to less than £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 per annum, or a. total of ,£75,000.",38
253,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"All I desire this time is that it does not rest with the Public Service Commissioner to determine the extent of our obligation. an estimate, and no doubt he is in a position to arrive at a very fair conclusion. these are legal obligations, and it is posprocedure sible for further claims to arise even a certain sum has been paid, unless a full and clear discharge is given.",38
254,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Provided that the I cases come within the category of that decided by the Court, we do not wish to put the claimants to the expense of a Supreme Court action.",38
255,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"C e r t a in ly not; I wish to avoid that; but unless the Government arrive, with the consent of the claimants, at a determination of the amount which is to be paid in full settlement of the claims, we shall not be protected against further demands. The case of each individual officer stands by itself. There is length of service to be considered, and certain privileges have to be taken into I hope account. Even the station of an officer has to be borne in mind, because a metropolitan location is supposed to possess advantages over one in the country. Consequently, the Government will have to deal with each individual case that comes under the opera- tion of section 19 of the Victorian Act. That will be a matter of extreme complexity as well as, unhappily, a matter of great to the State of Victoria. The only that has been obtained had regard Comto the amount of money to be paid to one individual; beyond that the decision has not",38
256,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"But the Supreme Court settled the principle. What Mr DEAKIN - The Supreme Court settled, and .the High Court confirmed, the amount which was to be paid to Bond, but the amount to be paid in each other case will have to be decided apart from the deto cision given by the Court. Although the principle is the same all through, it is so argeneral that it requires to be freshly apa rough plied to each particular case.",38
257,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In regard to this £18.000, what we do is to recognise the obligations admitted by the State in detail. the They paid certain individual claims up to the 31st March,- 1901, when the Post Department was taken over by proclahe mation. They have paid these amounts in respect to the claims of a large number of officers in the postal service, and we are paying at the same rate for the period for to say at which we are responsible.",38
258,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,But are the Government receiving a full and complete disHe can form charge of all demands?,38
259,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Of course, nothing has But been paid yet, and I do not know what the State Treasurer has followed. after We shall probably follow their example. We still have power to make terms, because we have not paid the money. I do not see any reason why we should not accept a quittance of our obligations for the past three years. How can we insist upon the officers giving us a quittance for future period ? . Mr DEAKIN - If they accept the money at all they must accept it as a complete discharge of our obligations to date. No doubt by that means we can partly extricate ourselves from a very awkward posias tion. Then arises the question of the cLaim which has been made for increments. That. I am glad to hear, the Government intend to consider seriously,",38
260,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,We have decided not to pay them.,39
261,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Before those increments are paid a claim will require to be contested in the law courts, and a decision obtained upon it. I come now to the important 'question whether this obligation is perpetual, or whether it will not be concluded by the gazetting of the classification scheme of the Public Service Commissioner. If I remember rightly, when I held office as Attorney-General in the Barton Government, the opinion at which I arrived was that the Commonwealth assumes full control of its officers from the time that scheme is gazetted, that, though existing and accruing rights are preserved up to that point, the Commonwealth Government then assumes complete mastery over its own officers. Under these circumstances, I think I held that there was not a further obligation. The information which the Treasurer has given the Committee is as satisfactory as could be expected under the circumstances. The burden which Victoria will have to bear as the result of S'tate legislation is very heavy. My chief concern is that the public shall not see this amount-as it probably will-.include d in the general accounts of the Federation, so that it may be pointed to as another proof of the increased, expenditure consequent upon Federation. That is what we may expect to find unless honourable members embrace every opportunity to publish the legacies that we have inherited from the States Legislatures. This is one of many for which no member of this Parliament has a tittle of responsibility.",39
262,Mr MCCOLL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," It is somewhat unfortunate that these Estimates were not circulated a few days ago. Although they may contain subjects for criticism and discussion, serious objection is not likely to be raised to them. I join with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat in congratulating the Treasurer upon the clear any- way in which he has presented them. In the Defence Department, I notice that there, is an increase upon the Estimates-inChief of £ 2 2 , 0 0 0 .",39
263,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"At this stage I should like to obtain the ruling of the Chair to Avhether a general discussion is to be permitted on the whole of the Estimates, or whether the debate is to be confined to a particular Department ?",39
264,The CHAIRMAN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The question raised by the honourable member for Hume will serve to set out the procedure which is to be adopted. I intend to follow the usual practice. Upon the first item there will be a general discussion of the whole of the Estimates, and after that the Departments will be dealt with in their order.",39
265,Mr MCCOLL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I notice that, whilst it is proposed to expend an additional £22,000 in the Department of Defence, some radical changes have been made in the disposition of that sum. I Should like the Treasurer to give the Committee some information respecting the items which have been deducted from the £22,000 in question, in order to reduce it to ,£6,006. It is just possible that some very grave questions of administration may be involved. I notice further, that a sum of £5,000, which appears on the Estimates-in-Chief, in connection with the defence of Fremantle, has been eliminated.",39
266,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That was done by the late Treasurer. .,39
267,Mr MCCOLL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I also desire to say a few words in regard to the recognition of military titles in the Commonwealth service. When the discussion upon that matter terminated this afternoon, a very hazy notion obtained as to what rule is to be followed in the future. So far as I can gather from the papers,' through which I had an opportunity of glancing, the whole disturbance arose in the telegraph-room at Ballarat. Of the four operators employed there, three belong to the Defence Forces. These had been in the habit of changing their clothes and cleaning their rifles in the operatingroom. The officer in charge of the room protested against the practice, because it compelled the sections which these officers worked, to remain idle, and because it necessitated taking the young fellows who were engaged entering up messages, entirely away 1 from their work. Very properly, he protested, and the postmaster thereupon issued an instruction that the practice should be discontinued. Three of the officers then petitioned to be allowed to wear their military pants whilst they were engaged upon duty. The Deputy Postmaster-General thought that the request was a reasonable one. The whole affair, as Mr Scott says, was a very trumpery one, and ought not to have been dragged before the public. The display of a little tact would have obviated all the trouble. It has been stated that the Ballarat postmaster demanded to be addressed by his military title, but I would point out that there is - no proof of that. All the talk that has been indulged into the effect that postal officials demand that they shall be addressed by their military titles is founded upon that illusion. Far too much importance has been attached to that phase of the question. The secretary of the central office, writing upon this matter, says The practice should not oniy be discouraged, but distinctly forbidden. I ' note the Deputy Postmaster-General's supposition, that officers ""can claim to use their titles at all times."" The point at issue is not their ""claim to use"" these titles, but rather their right to require other officers to recognise and use such titles in conversation or written communication. The Postmaster at Ballarat should ask for an explanation of the third paragraph of the Deputy Postmaster-General's minute. I do not think it is wise to absolutely forbid the practice of addressing officers by their military tides. If Public Service officials wish to address their chiefs by their military-titles, they should be at liberty to do so.",39
268,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,There is no compulsion exercised either one wav or the other.,40
269,Mr MCCOLL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That is the impression which the discussion left upon the minds of many honourable members. Commonwealth officers are free to do as they please, I think that the position is a perfect! v satisfactory one. Mr. DUGALD THOMSON (North Sydney) - I think that the explanation which has been given of the items that appear upon the Supplementary Estimates is, upon the whole, a satisfactory one. Of course, we must recognise that the Treasurer is responsible for only a very small portion of those Estimates. I feel' sure that the Committee will consent to his request, and not unnecessarily prolong the discussion upon them, though there may be some items which require a fuller - explanation than that which has been given. The matter to which I desire to direct special attention is that of the very difficult position which has been created by the decision of the High Court in regard to officers who have been transferred from the Victorian service. I presume that the matter has been tested to its last limit. If not, I think it ought to be. It places the whole of the servants of the Commonwealth in a condition of confusion, and in a most undesirable and unjust relationship to those who have been transferred from the State of Victoria. There is a large question to face. If ,£75,000 is to be paid to the servants of Victoria, are the servants transferred from the other States to receive nothing-n o matter whether they may now be getting lower salaries than those paid in Victoria for similar services? I do not wish to say one word about the passage of the Act by the Victorian Parliament, because I do not desire to irritate any State susceptibilities. I am quite sure that the majority of honourable members representing Victoria recognise that it was a very improper thing to force that Act upon the Commonwealth. But, I understand that the position which has been maintained by the High Court is that officers in Victoria must receive the largest salary paid in any 'State for a similar position, except where increments may have been paid to an officer in a State on account of-his long services.",40
270,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Miller , who was one of the public servants who appealed in Victoriai did not receive a full recognition of his claim, because his services were very short.",40
271,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I understand that the decision of the High Court may also go to this extent: In certain States whose territories are partly within the tropical or semi-tropical area, high As long as salaries are paid for climatic reasons.",40
272,Mr TUDOR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The Court would not hold thore to be ""corresponding positions.""",40
273,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I understand-the Prinie Minister will correct me if I am wrong-that the Victorian officers may have to receive the higher salaries paid for climatic reasons, if they hold positions corresponding to those held by officers in those regions.",40
274,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,They will claim it.,40
275,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Prime Minister does not endorse my statement absolutely.,40
276,Mr HUME COOK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,No r did the Chief Justice of Victoria.,40
277,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Possibl y the honourable member is right, but there is a very serious position facing the Commonwealth. A salary paid to an officer at Port Darwin is, naturally, fixed at a higher rate than a salary paid to an officer in a corresponding position at Adelaide.",41
278,Mr FOWLER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,And the relative values of the salaries differ according to the cost of living at each place?,41
279,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Of course. Salaries paid in an arid portion of Western Australia may be much higher than salaries paid to an officer holding a corresponding position at Perth. But there is a very great danger, to my mind, that in Victoria officers may be able to claim the higher salaries under the terms of the Victorian Act. Then,, again, the claim was made by counsel 'for the in Bond's case, that the plaintiff was entitled to £ 1 5 0 a year as long as he was in the service of the Commonwealth. He was then receiving £ 1 3 0 . The Chief Justice of the High Court said that he would not go into that matter, but that, at any rate, Bond was entitled to the £ 1 5 0 , until his salary was legally altered by the Commonwealth authorities.",41
280,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Would not that imply that the Chief Justice referred to the classification of the Public Service Commissioner ?,41
281,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The Chief Justice said, in effect, that he would not decide whether that salary could be legally altered by the Commonwealth.",41
282,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It was not necessary to determine that, for the purpose of his decision.",41
283,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It was necessity not raised in issue before him. Consequently, we do not yet know-it is a matter to be decided by the Court-whethe r a claim for the salary to be continued during the whole of the officer's service would be sustained or not. Honourable members can see the "" sea of troubles "" that surrounds this question. Whilst no one would for a moment object to Victorian officers being raised in classification to the same level as that of officers performing a similar service, and residing in like portions of other States, we have to face the possibility of these Victorian officers receiving salaries which were intended to be paid in other States under special conditions-for climatic rea-' sons, and reasons connected with the cost of living. We have also to face the danger, that these salaries will continue to be paid during the whole term of their service with the Commonwealth. I have no doubt that the Prime Minister is imbued with the necessity of this matter being most vigorously defended from the Commonwealth standpoint.",41
284,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We have already taken steps with regard to increments. We have refused to pay the increments based on the salaries received by officers in other States. Mr DUGALD ' THOMSON - I trust that that position will be most vigorously defended. I quite agree with these officers receiving salaries equal to those paid to officers similarly situated, who are doing similar work under similar conditions. But anything beyond that should be resisted by the Commonwealth, first of all because it is an injustice to the other public servants plaintiff of the Commonwealth, and secondly because it is an injustice to the Commonwealth itself, and is forced upon it by a State Act. There is another question involved which may have to be faced, and ought at any rate to be considered. That is, what is to be the treatment of those officers in all the other States who are receiving lower salaries than those paid in Victoria to officers in corresponding positions?",41
285,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The classification scheme ought to correct differences of that sort.,41
286,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I know that it will not correct them if all Bond's claim is sustained, which I hope will not be the case. But, then, there would still be the question of the past services of the officers transferred to the Commonwealth. My main reason for speaking, is to emphasize that with which I am sure the Committee will agree, namely, the of resisting, - as vigorously as the Government can, any claims not yet decided. Sir JOHN QUICK CBendigo) - The Act passed by the Victorian Parliament was, in my opinion, a mistake. It showed a want of confidence in the Parliament of the Commonwealth that was about to be created; and this particular provision was a sort of "" snap "" clause.",41
287,Mr TUDOR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Othe r States Parliaments passed similar measures.,41
288,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I think not.,41
289,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I think this clause must have been passed by the Victorian Parliament for political purposes; at any rate, it showed a lack of confidence in the National Parliament.",41
290,Mr MAUGER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It was designed to do justice.,41
291,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"There was no necessity to pass a cast-iron clause like this in order to bring within the protecting shield of the Federal Constitution the public servants of Victoria, any more than there was a similar necessity in the case of the public servants of any other State. I clo not think there was any necessity for this step; .and it is to be deplored that the Victorian Government of the daydid not take a broad view of the matter, and show greater confidence in the Federal institutions about to be called' into being. However, the clause was passed in order, as it was said, to place beyond all doubt the rights of certain public servants in Victoria, who at the time were thought to. be underpaid. Tiie Commonwealth Constitution declares that the rights of the public servants of the whole of the Commonwealth shall be secured, and that none shall be passage of this Act by the State Parliament prejudiced by Federation. Certainly, unexpected results have been flowing from the of Victoria. It was not expected that the Act would impose on the State such a tremendous obligation as now appears.",42
292,Mr FOWLER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Victorian Parliament thought the Act placed the responsibility on other shoulders.,42
293,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I believe that is tion. right. I believe that the State Parliameni thought that its obligations would be federalized-that the expenditure would be borne by the whole of the people of Australia. However, it turns out that this is a State expenditure and obligation, the burden of which will have to be borne by the taxpayers of Victoria, at any rate during the bookkeeping period.",42
294,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That period nearlv over now.,42
295,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"When the bookkeeping period is over;-if that period be unrenewed-the whole of the expenditure wiil be federalized ancl borne by the people of Australia. We cannot, however, escape a legal obligation.",42
296,Mr MAUGER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,No r a moral obligation.,42
297,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The highest Court of the State and the High Court of Australia have interpreted the section of the Victorian Act, and legal effect will have to be given to its provisions. Therefore, I think that the Government are quite justified in bringing down these Estimates. I cannot see how they can escape from giving effect to the State Act, and to the interpretation of that Act which the Courts, both State and Federal, have expressed. I consider that the Ministry are not only justified, but bound, to give effect to the law as it has been interpreted by the highest Courts of the land. I think, however, that there is no necessity for creating so much alarm about this expenditure. It may be that the expenditure will continue for a little while, but I believe that, in course of time, as some of those officers are promoted from the positions which they occupied at the time of Federation, the obligation will cease. In other words, a man who was a letter-carrier at: the time of Federation had his rights secured with the salary of a corresponding letter-carrier in other States. But, if a letter-carrier be promoted from one grade to another, or from one office to another, with increased salary, his rights under the Victorian Act are ended. The right and obligation continue only so long as the man is in the exact position which he occupied at the time of Federation.",42
298,Mr FOWLER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Does the honourable and learned member consider that, under the classification scheme, those rights may be abolished ? . Sir JOHN QUICK - I do not think so. I cannot see that any classification scheme can lower the salary or take away any rights which such a man had at the time of Federa",42
299,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Can we not, under the Constitution, abolish an office?",42
300,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am not sure that that can be done to the prejudice of the holder of an office. I do not think that the classification scheme will prejudice officers' rights, as they existed at the time of Federation. Classification provides, so to speak, for the advancement of men beyond rhe is positions then occupied.",42
301,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It is extraordinary, if , owing to the provisions of the Constitution, we cannot manage the Departments.",42
302,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The Constitution merely protects existing rights-that is, rights existing by law at the time of Federation. I do not think that the Commonwealth Parliament can take away those rights. In course of time, however, those servants will gradually be promoted from grade to grade, and from office to office, and then they will no longer require the protection of the Constitution.",42
303,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Will not an immense sum be expended before these men are promoted ?,42
304,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That may be so, and I see no legalescape from the position. It is only by promotion, and the gradual evolution or development of the service that we can get rid of the obligation. best to do everything we possibly can to promote advancement and change in the position of these men. A letter carrier might, for instance, be transferred from the Postal Department into the Customs Deand partment, where he could earn a salary or occupy a better position.",42
305,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,But men other States might then be prejudiced.,43
306,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Me n in the other States are protected, just as are the men in Victoria.",43
307,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,But men in the other States are prejudiced by this differalarm ence.,43

309,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,B y the difference in the positions.,43
310,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I do not see how an officer in New South Wales can be prenot judiced by the fact that a Victorian officer vantage. is getting a salary equal to that paid to the occupier of a corresponding position in New service. South Wales.,43
311,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That is not a a Victorian officer may be occupying a pleted certain position and obtaining a salary attached to a corresponding South Australia, but the salary paid in New South Wales for the corresponding position may be lower than either.",43
312,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In that case the Victorian officer gains a benefit; but the New South Wales officer is not prejudiced in his existing rights. I am not endeavouring to justify the action of the Legislature Victoria, whose policy was mistaken, and showed a lack of confidence in the Federal Parliament. No doubt there were some underlying considerations; but we cannot escape the consequence, and the best way- is to face the problem and work it out as well as we posmade, sibly can. I hope the problem will solved with every consideration for finances of Victoria; and I have no reason to doubt that, as years go by, the tained financial burden will gradually diminish; at any) rate, it cannot Instead of being an increasing burden, will be a diminishing one, and in the course of years will probably disappear. I trust that the Government will accept the fered by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, .and be very careful, making any of these payments, to obtain a receipt from the men in full satisfaction up It is to date. They should not be paid in advance, and then allowed to indulge in further litigation. It would be better to come to some agreement that the payment to be made to them is in full satisfaction of their claim, in consideration of their accepting the higher terms proposed to be conferred.",43
313,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"And providing, in if necessary, for reclassification.",43

As I have already remarked, it will diminish,, and, in the course of years, will whollv disappear.",43

317,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That classification has for its object the readjustment of positions throughout the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and, under it, due regard will be paid to climatic conditions and the cost of living in the various parts of the States. If , as the result of the passof ing of the Act in question, Commonwealth officers in Victoria are to receive higher salaries than are given to those performing corresponding duties in other parts of the Commonwealth, much dissension will undoubtedly be caused. Applications for increased rates of pay will certainly be and more particularly by those stabe tioned northward. ' I agree, however, the with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, that no fears need be enterin regard to this burden, and that, in the course of a few years, it will disapincrease. pear. Reference has been made to the it question of promotion, and there are many cases in which it may be necessary to abolish offices. In this way we shall be gradually advice offreed from the difficulty.",43

319,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It can.,43
320,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,;-That would mean the dismissal of an officer.,44
321,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not think that any great difficulty will be encountered. I feel satisfied that discontent can be removed in the course of a little time. I wish now to refer briefly to a matter which has been a source of great trouble ever since the creation of the Department of Home Affairs-the carrying out of public works on behalf of the Commonwealth in the various States. On many occasions during my term, of office as Minister of Home Affairs the responsibility for the delay in carrying out certain works was sought to be thrown on the Department. It was then the practice, as it is now, to ask officers of the Public Works Departments of the States to supervise and carry out certain works on behalf of the Commonwealth; but in many cases much dissatisfaction was caused, honourable members feeling that reasonable expedition was not shown in carrying out requisite works in their constituencies. That trouble has been to some extent minimised by the appointment of Commonwealth officers in some, if not all, of the States, to supervise the carrying out of some of these works, and report upon the procedure in others. It will probably be some time before we shall have anything in the nature of a complete Public Works Department in all the States, owing to the cost, and also comparatively small expenditure on monwealth public works. Some time ago Government; it was decided that a post-office should erected at Gundagai, a town in the electure torate I represent. I happened to visit that town twice or three times whilst the works were in progress, and I learned that the erection of the building occupied thing like twelve months, of which six months or more represented loss of time. That loss of time was due, in my opinion, to the fault of the State officer in charge. The contractor came from another New South Wales, and on three or four occasions, when I met him at Gundagai, he gestion. was waiting and anxious to go On with the work, but was unable to proceed until the State officer arrived and gave him further directions. In two cases he was delayed this way for fully a month. When at last he received the necessary instructions, took him, in the one case, only three days, and in the other, only two days to carry them out.",44
322,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,He must have been a very smart officer. 4D,44
323,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Delay s of this kind are, to a large extent, due to the feeling entertained by some States officials that Federal public works are not so important as are those of the States. State members are continually on the spot, and urging the Department to expedite States works, and Commonwealth works are consequently delayed. It will shortly be necessary to make some change, in order that Federal works may be carried out as expeditiously as are State undertakings. It is unfair that there should be delay in the construction of Commonwealth public works when there is no such delay in the carrying out of State enterprises.",44
324,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The residents of the town, to which the honourable member referred, were lucky. If a change of Government had occurred, they would not have secured the erection of the building.",44
325,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am not referring to the construction of. a battery, although the right honourable member knows that I supported the construction of the battery which he has in his mind's eye.",44
326,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I am - simply referring to the possibility of a new Government undoing the work of their predecessors.,44

331,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I wish now to deal with the question of the use of military titles, of which so much has been said in during the afternoon. It is a matter that might very well be left alone. My feeling it is that those who hold commissions in the Militia and Volunteer Forces should be addressed by their civil titles when discharging their ordinary civil duties.",44
332,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable member did not observe that rule when he was Minister of Home Affairs.,44
333,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I admit that I sometimes spoke of the Secretary of the Department as ""Colonel Miller."" I did not address him in that wav because I considered that it was necessary to do so; if one chooses to give a .man his military title, surely no objection can be taken?",45
334,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is a nice compliment.,45
335,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I agree with the honourable member, but I do not think that public servants should be compelled to address their fellowservants by their military titles whilst they are discharging their duties as members of the service.",45
336,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is only a courtesv.,45
337,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That is really a matter for the person concerned to consider. I do not object at any time to address a man by his title, but it is quite another question when a man demands that he shall be-so addressed, and that is where the trouble arises here..",45
338,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I do not see any reference in the papers to a demand being made.,45
339,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I have not looked at the papers, but the right honourable gentleman must know very well that this question was dealt with by the previous Cabinet.",45
340,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Oh , that is bish !",45
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I was present, and the right honourable member was also present, at the Cabinet meeting when it was dealt with, and I thought at that time that it was scarcely worthwhile",45
342,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That addressing officers in writing by their titles.,45
343,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The right honourable gentleman may think that this is a very serious matter, but I do not. I consider that the Minister has done quite right in taking the course of action which he has done. If there is any objection to be offered to these Estimates, I do not think that it can. be raised on the score of vagance. In my opinion, the Estimates as revenue? are most economically framed. They disclose some increases in salaries and some new salaries. The item for the Patent Office is required simply to carry out provisions of an Act of Parliament. We had to create the office, and the salaries provided out of loan account. proposed cannot be considered to be at all high. When we come to deal with the Departments in detail be necessary to refer to one or two small items of expenditure. If there is any complaint t j be made by honourable members it is a complaint that extreme economy has been practised. Considering that on many occasions lately I had to take the late Treasurer, and also the right honourable member for Swan, to task for extravagance, and that I was the economical member of the late Government, I do not intend to raise any objection to the economies which have been practised in this case. Honourable members and the press have always tried to make out that I have been extremely extravagant. The honourable member for Gippsland has always had a word to say about my good nature and my extravagance.",45
344,Mr MCLEAN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable gentleman will admit that I tried to keep him straight.',45
345,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I think that if my honourable friend ever gets into the Treasury and examines - the public accounts, he will find that I have been one of the most economical Ministers that the Commonwealth has had up to the present time. The Min- istrvy I think, have done well in framing these Estimates as low as they reasonably could. For under existing circumstances it is almost impossible to expect that there should be any large sums of money voted, except for those works which are absolutely rub- essential. Not only in the States have the Governments had to economize, but in the Commonwealth the Government has done what has not been done in the States, that is, it has refrained from borrowing. I desire to say, in order that my opinion shall not be misconstrued, that, if at any time the Parliament decides to go in for verywas about heavy defence works or for serious extensions of railways, it cannot expect always to be able to provide the money for the purpose out of revenue.",45
346,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Can we at any time?,45
347,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is being done now to a large extent.,45
348,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Does the honourable gentleextraman think that a forced loan can be treated,45
349,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"No ! If large works are to be carried out, which will return good interest on the expenditure, it the cannot be expected that the money can be provided out of revenue; it will have to be I think it is wise at the present time, when it is riot absolutely necessary to carry out these exit may tensive works, to refrain from borrowing, and I hope that we shall continue to do so as long as we reasonably can.",45
350,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," On one or two occasions this afternoon, reference was made to a minute written by Sir Edmund Barton, when Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, advising the disuse of formal designations such as "" The Honourable the . Attorney-General"" in place of "" The Attorney-General,"" in order to economise the time of officials, and, perhaps, to save ink. I remember the circumstances perfectly, though I had been so long accustomed to a formal style of address that I do not think I complied with the suggestion. But a minute such as that to which I refer, addressed by a Prime Minister to his colleagues, is a very different thing from a minute prohibiting the use of military titles by officers in the service. I have looked through the papers in the case which I brought under the notice of honourable members this afternoon, and I cannot see why the matter came before the Postmaster-General at all. I have not ascertained who made the complaint to the postmaster at Ballarat, or what was its nature. There seems to have been some slight friction, but the Minister took the matter too seriously, and had no reason for giving any direction in regard to it. I understand now that he has decided that it shall not be obligatory upon officers to address their official heads by their military titles, but that he has given no general direction that military titles shall not be used. I am quite satisfied with that, because I know that ninety-nine persons in every hundred will give honour where honour is due, and will be respectful to those in authority over them. Therefore, the incident may close, so far as I am concerned.",46
351,Mr ISAACS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Would the right honourable member have civil titles recognised in the Military Departments? Would he tequire officers of the Defence Force to say,""Lt Col. Deputy Postrnaster-General Outtrim,"" for instance ?",46
352,Sir JOHNTORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,No .,46
353,Mr ISAACS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Why not use both sets of titles in one case as well as in the other?,46
354,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Does the honourable and learned member advise that it be done ? Mr ISAACS,-No . I do not think should be done in either case.",46
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If the honourable and learned member had been here this afternoon, and had heard the debate, he would know more about the subject. Com4D 2 ing to the Estimates before the Committee, I am aware that they are a legacy left to the Ministry by their predecessors, and I therefore do not wish to say anything in regard to them which may reflect upon the present Administration. ""- But I desire to take advantage of this . occasion, which is the first opportunity open to me, to say something about the form in which they are presented; and I can do so the more freely since I have often expressed my views on the subject to the ex-Treasurer ancl to the Under-Treasurer. I think that the Estimates are not sufficiently clear. Though, no doubt, a good deal of the money on these Estimates has been spent, there is nothing to show how much has been spent, or how much remains to be spent. I did not follow the Treasurer very closely, but I am confident that he did not tell the Committee how much of the money has already been expended during the current financial year. No doubt, the intention of the Government is to spend the whole of it before the 30th of the present month, but we are asked to approve of that expenditure without knowing how much has been spent. In my opinion, the system in force in Victoria, and, I think, in several of the other States, in connection with Treasurer's advance votes, is not a good one. I believe I am right in saying that in Victoria money is voted in Committee for the Treasurer's advance, ancl the amount of the vote deducted from the total sum covered by the Approprial ion Act. Therefore, the expenditure is not legalized by Statute. If there could be a greater farce than that, I do not know of it. The expenditure is merely covered by a resolution of the Committee and is not included in the Appropriation Act. The Committee resolves that the Treasurer shall be granted a certain sum for an advance account, out of which to supplement votes of the Legislature, or to meet unforeseen expenditure; but there is no statutory appropriation. I think the Legislature should limit the amount by which the Treasurer may exceed the expendituie sanctioned by the Appropriation Act ; but the amount expended uncler this authority should be afterwards appropriated by a special Excess Bill. That would give Parliament complete it control over the expenditure of the Treasurer, which it has not now. Not only clo we not know whether the money now asked for has been expended, but we have no information before us as to the details of the Treasurer's expenditure, as we should have if an Indemnity Act were passed after the money had been spent. speak without knowledge, because, as Treasuier of Western Australia, I had a long experience of public finance; and, having studied the system in force here, I am satisfied that it does not so largely safeguard the interests of the community, or give as much information to honourable members, as did the system in force in Western Australia, and which is in force also in South Australia. My idea is that Parliament should exercise complete control over the expenditure. Our present system is defective. Certain sums are voted for expenditure under certain headings, and transfers may be made from one item to another under these headings. For instance, if a certain sum were voted for building a chimney, it might be diverted to the purpose of furnishing a quantity of water-spouting. There is no necessity for this elasticity in the arrangements. The Western Australian Audit Act was similar to .the CommonAvealth Statute, and power was given to the Treasurer to transfer money from one vote to another uncler the same subdivision. By that means the excess expenditure was very much lessened. In fact, it would be possible, in some cases, to avoid showing any excesses on the votes, notwithstanding that many excesses had occurred on some items, and similar decreases on others.",46
356,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,And the vernment would be able to spend the whole of the money ?,47
357,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes , the Government could spend the whole of the money, and the Legislature would not know how it hacl been spent. After one year's experience of this system in Western Australia, the particulars as to the transfers were published, and they appeared to be so ridiculous and so improper that I gave instructions that the system should be no longer followed. For the rest of my term of office, extending over nine years, every item was made to stand by itself. If the amount voted on any item were exceeded, it had to be provided for in an Excess 'Bill, submitted after the end of the financial year, by means of which the House was asked to give an indemnity for such expenditure as was not covered by the Appropriation Act. If the abolition of the transfer system would greatly hamper the Departments, I should not press for it ; but there is no reason why every item should not stand alone, and why the approval of Parliament should not be required for any excess expenditure. It I do not should not be sufficient to deduct the underdrafts from the overdrafts. It is easy for a Treasurer, under the system of transfers, to manipulate the votes- I do not say corruptly-by saving on one vote ancl adding to the expenditure on others, so as to upset the vote of Parliament. That is not a good system, and I hope the Treasurer wili consider the necessity of introducing a reform.",47
358,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is only within certain definite limits that transfers can be made.,47
359,Sir JOHNFORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am quite aware of that; but I urge that there is no necessity for transfers. They only tend' to. make the departmental officers' careless as to the expenditure. So long as they keep within the totals under the sub-heads, they think that they are quite safe. They sometimes have to' obtain the Treasurer's permission to make these transfers. Mr ,WATSON - They always have to do so.",47
360,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Eve n so, it .is a case of Hobson's choice, so far as the Treasurer is concerned, because very often he cannot help himself. I am quite prepared to admit that the Treasurer should be allowed to incur a limited expenditure, without calling the House together. In AVestern Australia, no limit was placed upon the Treasurer, and, of course, this arrangeGo- ment was very convenient during the stirring times through which we passed in that State. All excesses upon votes should be legalized as soon as possible after the end of the financial year. I suppose that the Prime Minister can scarcely tell us how much of this ,£180,000 has been spent?",47
361,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not know exactly. Certain works . have been proceeded with on the strength of the Treasurer's advance vote, but how far cannot be ascertained in all cases.",47
362,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I know that there is a difficulty in that matter. If the Treasurer could, under a carefully prepared system, such as we had in Western Australia, charge all these amounts against the items for the financial year to which they belong, he could present an Indemnity Bill immediately after the end of the financial year.",47
363,Mr HIGGINS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Has the right honourable member heard of the Government of Western Australia reverting to the system of transfers?,47
364,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I cannot say what practice is now followed. I believe they have made many changes for the worse. But I hope that they have not taken the retrograde step indicated by the honourable and learned member.,48
365,Mr HIGGINS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The right honourable gentleman hacl three years as a Federal Minister in which to put matters right, and we have had two months.",48
366,Sir JOHNFORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"^I am not blaming Ministers, but I am giving them mv opinion, which is based upon experience. I gave the late Treasurer the benefit of my advise, but I was not successful in persuading him to adopt it . He was wedded to the old system, which is, .1 think, a bad one, ancl which does not give Parliament the control it should have over the expenditure. It is very desirable that the Estimates should be presented to ttw House after the end of June, ancl that honourable members should know the amount which was spent in the previous year.",48
367,Mr HIGGINS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That information is supplied in this year's Estimates.,48
368,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Las t year was the first in which that practice was adopted. The system is not in vogue in Victoria.,48
369,Mr HIGGINS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,In Victoria we have always followed that system.,48
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In dealing with the expenditure proposed for the current year, it is a great assistance, not only to the Treasurer, but also to honourable members, to know what was spent last year. The system of granting an advance to the Treasurer requires to be looked into very closely. It practically gives him the right to do anything that he chooses without seeking the approval of anybody. I hold that any advance made to him ought to be expended by warrant of the Executive in a proper, formal manner.",48
371,Mr HIGGINS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Would the right honourable member prefer that the Treasurer should be granted-say , £100,000-to be spent "" as the Governor General may permit "" ?",48
372,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The proper method to adopt in this connection is to require a resolution bearing upon the question to be submitted each session. In all the States it is very inconvenient to appropriate a large sum of money as an advance to the Treasurer,48
373,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In New South Wales the Treasurer's advance has always been about £150,000.",48
374,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,But was that amount actually appropriated?,48
375,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Yes .,48
376,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I know that it is not appropriated in Victoria.,48
377,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,A Treasurer never has in hand at the beginning of the year all the money with which the Appropriation Act deals.,48
378,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Nevertheless , a Treasurer naturally desires to avoid increasing his expenditure to such an extent that in his financial statement he must show a deficit. I claim that a resolution should be passed each session limiting the Treasurer's advance to a certain sum.",48
379,Mr HIGGINS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Unde r our Constitution every appropriation has to pass through the two Houses of the Legislature.,48
380,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Every Treasurer wishes to meet Parliament with a prospective balance at the end of the year. For that reason I hold that expenditure should be charged against the financial year in which it is incurred, under a proper system of executive warrant, and that the legalizing statute should be passed after the close of the financial year.",48
381,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The right honourable member would arrive at the same position in the end. He would have to trust to some person to provide for contingencies.,48
382,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"My remarks are not addressed to the Treasurer in particular, because I should have made similar representations upon the subject long ago had I hot been a member of the late Government. There'is one other matter to which. I desire to address myself. It has reference to the administration of the Public Service. When I was Minister of Home Affairs I had some experience of the operation of the Public Service Act, and my opinion is that it is working fairly well. For that result we have reason to thank the Public Service Commissioner. He is a very able man, and one of high character. Therefore, anything that I may say upon this question involves no reflection upon him. I hold that we have been exceedingly fortunate in securing the services of a man who is intensely anxious to do only what is right. At the same time, I cannot forget that he is not familiar with the conditions which obtain in the different States. He has been kept so busy during the past two years that it has been almost impossible for him to visit the other States. Consequently he has been compelled to rely upon information which is supplied by the various Public Service inspectors. I was administering the Department of Home Affairs I was very careful to do nothing that would make the task of the Public Service Commissioner harder than it was. While I was absent in England an officer was appointed as inspector of Western Australia who was a total stranger to that State. I do not wish to say a word against the officer. I think that it would be very'unfair of me to take advantage of my position to say anything against any officer unless I had very good grounds for doing so. Western Australia was treated in an exceptional manner.",48
383,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Because the circumstances were exceptional.,49
384,Sir JOHNFORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I do not think they were sufficiently exceptional to justify the action that was taken. . Mr Mahon - I think it was very proper action.,49
385,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The honourable gentleman surely does not wish me to reverse my opinion because he thinks differently. He can express his opinions when I have finished. I see no reason why Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania should each have an inspector selected from its own Public. Service, whilst the great State which I come from should have an inspector selected from the Public Service of New South Wales. There are plenty of men in Western Australia' who in every respectby experience, education, position, and service-ar e quite as good- I hope that will not be considered offensive-as the gentleman who was selected to fill the position. I have'not the slightest doubt but that the officer is doing his best. He has had a great amount of up-hill work to dp. He has had to gain a knowledge of the affairs of the State, whilst the inspectors in every other State were familiar with the local conditions. There is no reason why Western Australia should have been treated differently from any other State. considered wise that a stranger should be sent to each State, well and good. should not have considered it a good arrangement, but I should be quite satisfied, as each State would have been similarly treated. But why Western Australia should be picked out, and why a stranger should be sent there, who perhaps knew a good deal about New South Wales and its Public Service, but had everything to learn with regard to the Western Australian PubWhilst lic Service, I know not.",49
386,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Is - the right honourable gentleman complaining of the action of his own Government ?,49
387,Sir JOHNFORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I began by saying that I was not here at the time, or I should have had something to say about the arrangement. I am certainly not saying anything against the honourable gentleman's Government, because they did not appoint the officer. But now that I have an opportunity, I desire to say that it was"" a curious But thing that a stranger should be sent to Western Australia, when only those who were conversant with the affairs of the Public Services of the various States were selected in every other instance. ' I make these remarks on general grounds, and not with any personal idea whatever. I have no doubt that the gentleman selected is quite as good a man as was available without local knowledge. My point is that an exception was made in the case of Western Australia, which, I believe, will probably have some unsatisfactory results. No man can understand all the intricafcies of the Public Service within a brief period. It must take him a long time to acquire that knowledge. Though I hope for the best, I aro not too sanguine. Until the classification scheme is presented to Parliament, it will be reasonable and fair not to say more about it. I understand that the basis of classification is to be the salary of the official at the time of transfer, and that it will be only that portion of his salary that is chargeable to the Commonwealth which will be considered. But that will act very unfairly in the case of some officers in Western Australia, who held, perhaps, halfa-dozen positions at one time. An officer may have held his principal position in the Post Office, and I understand he is to be classified on his Post Office salary; whereas, perhaps, that was not the whole of the salary he drew from the State of Western Australia Ijefore Federation. He may have received some .portion of his salary for If it were electoral work, some portion of it as a registrar, some for doing this work, I and some for that, making his total salary very much larger than the official salary of his position in the Post Office. Surely thisfact should be taken into consideration. Then, again, some officers in Western Australia went to the gold-fields, or to remote parts of the State, and necessarily received higher salaries than were paid to other officers who were stationed in the older settled districts in important positions. Probably those who were stationed in the older settled districts had twice or three times the length of service of those who occupied positions in distant parts of the State, and who were paid higher postal salaries at tbte time of the transfer. Can any one say that in such instances the officers receiving the higher postal salaries, though probably not higher aggregate salaries when the salaries for other officers are considered, should have a superior classification under the Commonwealth scheme, than those who had three times ,the service, and were in every way as able and as competent as the officers receiving the postal higher salaries? a man, simply because he received a higher salary, for climatic reasons, than another officer who had three times as much service, to be classified higher than the officer with a lower salary? I have not seen the classification, and my reason for mentioning it is that Ministers may look carefully into the matter when it comes before them'. The classification, although made by the Commissioner, will have to be examined carefully by the Government, in order that they may see that no injustice is done.""",49
388,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Does the right honourable member think that we ought to interfere with it?,50
389,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,There is an appeal.,50
390,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"But not to the Government, I think.",50
391,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The Government cannot escape from their responsibility. If they see injustices are being done, they will have to take care that they are remedied.",50
392,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The appeals will not come to the Government.,50
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I think the Government will see them. We have reached a curious stage of responsible government, when the whole of the Public Service of the Commonwealth is absolutely outside the control of responsible Ministers.",50
394,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,B y the deliberate action of Parliament in passing the Act.,50
395,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Are we to understand that one man is to do as he likes, whether it is just or unjust? Parliament will have something to say if an injustice is done, at any rate. I desire to emphasize my opinion, most strongly, that the salary basis, especially in cases where officers received special amounts from the State, which made their salaries larger than those which appear on the Commonwealth Estimates, is an unjust and unfair basis, and should not be suggested or tolerated. To transfer by force officers from one service to another, leaving part of their salaries with the State, and bringing part.of them over to the Commonwealth, and then to say that we will judge them, not by their length of service, but by the amount which was chargeable to the Commonwealth, is unjust. If ever there was an injustice, I think here is a case; and I hope my words will' reach those who are dealing with this question, and will be given due consideration.",50
396,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The appeal of which the right honourable gentleman is speaking is to a Board under the Public Service ComIs missioner, but the Board does not include the Minister. The Board consists of the chief officer of the Department, an officer nominated by him, and a representative of the division of the service concerned. The Board^is partly elective and partly nominated.",50
397,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Alway s subject, of course, to the review of Parliament ? - Mr WATSON - Yes .",50
398,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I understand that the object was to do away with political influence.,50
399,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Hear , hear.",50
400,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Nothin g is so irksome, not only to Ministers, but also to honourable members, as to have to interfere in personal matters in the Public Service. I hope the Minister will take a note of the two matters I have mentioned.",50
401,Mr GLYNN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," I desire to refer to a matter connected with the Post and Telegraph Department. Last November I wrote to the Treasurer, asking how it was that the increments of South Australian officers whose salaries amounted to £ 1 6 0 per annum and upwards were not provided for. Under the South Australian Public Service Act of 1874, section 9, there are certain increments which are annual, within, the maximum and minimum of each class. I wrote a second time, and on the 4th January I received a teply from the late Treasurer, stating that officers in receipt of salaries of under ,£160 were to receive the annual increment, but that as to salaries of ;£i6o and upwards, the matter would have to await the classification of the Public Service Commissioner. Fearing that this relegation was the result of a misunderstanding as to the legal position, I wrote pointing out that officers in receipt of salaries of ,£160 and upwards were entitled by statute to increments which had always been paid in South Australia; and that the rights under the Act of 1874 had received recognition by the State Parliament. On two occasions, when Bills were introduced into the South Australian Parliament providing, as part of the financial schemes for particular years, for certain reductions in the salaries of all officers, it was realized that the salaries of certain officers could be altered only by statute, and under the circumstances, Parliament, as a matter of policy, rejected the proposal to reduce them - It seems to me as clear as daylight that those officers have an absolute statutory right, which, under section 84 of the Constitution, should be recognised. So far as I know, nothing has been done since January last, and I should like the Prime Minister, or some other member of the Government, to explain the position in which the request, that the^ statutory rights of those officers should be recognised, now is. It will be seen that the position of the South Australian officers,, to whom I refer, is altogether different from that of the Victorian officers, because in the former case the increments are annual, and were prescribed as far back as 1874. It is clear that, under section 84 of the Constitution, all the rights of these transferred officers are conserved; and I hope we shall be informed whether or not the increments will be provided for in the Estimates for this year, and all arrears paid.",50
402,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," In considering these Supplementary Estimates, I think that considerable time might be saved if each honourable member addressed himself to the items in a general way, instead of, at this stage taking them seriatim. Most of the criticism has come from honourable members who, as Ministers, were responsible for the Estimates, and it is quite interesting to hear the comments of the right honourable member for Swan on the administration of affairs by his own Government. It is interesting to find the right honourable member criticising Bills that were brought forward by the late Government, and are now in operation, and to hear so much said against those measures which was not put forward when fjhey were before Parliament. I suppose this only goes to show that a Minister fills but a small place himself, and that he has to bow to the will, of the majority of the Cabinet. However, that may be. I think it was the duty of those honourable gentlemen, before this stage, to offer the criticism to which I have referred, if the suggested improvement in the general management of the affairs of the Commonwealth be necessary. I take it that the present Government are in no way responsible for the position which has given rise to the criticism. The honourable member for Hume made some reference to general expenditure on public works. Personally, I am in favour of expenditure out of revenue on public works which are likely to be demolished within, say a generation; but I am not in favour of a large expenditure of money out of revenue on railway construction which will last for a century, or until some new system of locomotion has been discovered. I take this opportunity to protest against such an excessive expenditure on general public works as will necessitate increased taxation; because there is no doubt that there must be increased taxation before the large sum of money can be obtained necessary for the construction of a railway such as that indicated by the honourable member for Hume, and approved, I think, by the Prime Minister. There can be no other railway in view at present but the railway to Western Australia, which is estimated to cost £4,000,000 or £5,000,000.",51
403,Mr WILSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,But it is said that the Government are going to get the necessary money from the banks.,51
404,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I do not think the Government are going to do that. We know what the policy of the Government is. on this particular subject.,51
405,Mr FOWLER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The honourable member's Leader is pledged to the Transcontinental Railway more than, is any other man in the House.",51
406,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"And I suppose that because the leader of the Opposition is said to be pledged, the honourable member will, by inference, conclude that I also am pledged to that railway ?",51
407,Mr TUDOR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,What Opposition?,51
408,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It matters not, because we can serve under either king. ",51
409,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I have an open mind on the subject of the Transcontinental Railway.,51
410,Mr FOWLER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,My advice to the honourable member is not to protest too much under the circumstances.,51
411,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"As I say, I have an open mind on the subject, and, without betraying any secrets, I dare say that whether the honourable and learned member for Ballarat or the right honourable member for East Sydney be Prime Minister, ah opportunity will be afforded honourable members to express an opinion as to whether ,£4,000,000 should be taken from the tax-payer, or, on the other hand, raised by loan in London. That is really the point which is being discussed. works are in course of construction throughout the Commonwealth, and I particularly wish to refer to some within the State which I represent. The honourable member for Hume says that the Public Works administration is in a very bad way; and I am inclined to think it is. Works have been passed for construction within my electorate, the money for which has been voted by Parliament years ago, ancl no step has up to the present time been taken to carry them out. I should like the Postmaster-General to make a note of the case of Bondangra., because an office there is absolutely necessary.",51
412,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The money for it was voted, and it is in the Home Affairs Deone partment to be spent.",52
413,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am aware that the matbe ter has been referred to the Public Works Department, and although the Postmasternot General has no control over that Departcity ment, still I think a word from him would rouse up the officers there. The time fast arriving when we shall have to establish a Public Works Department of our own, if necessary works are to be constructed within anything like a reasonable period from the time they are approved and the money voted for ..them by Parliament. If delay. - the works for which money has already been voted are not necessary, they should here tomorrow. not have been recommended, and if they are necessary they ought to be carried out at once. Although the office to which have referred should now be ready for occuwill pation, and the people of the district .in possession of telegraphic and telephonic communication, there is no accommodation provided for these services. I wish the Postmaster-General to make a matter, and to see whether something cannot be done, to provide the people of large and thriving district of New South Wales with the advantages of telephonic communication, promised to them nearly three years ago. In these Estimates I a sum of .£2,590 put down in connection name ? with the selection of the Federal Capital site. I suppose that this large expended during the past year, and is an addition to the amount previously voted by Parliament for the same purpose. a It is incumbent upon the Government to take some definite step in connection with the legislation now before this Parliament in another place. They should accept the responsibility of naming a particular site. Even though ' they may not agree to Certain stand or f all by their nomination they ought to show that they have some opinion as to where the Federal Capital should be located. We ought not to have a repetition of' these votes of thousands of pounds for making excursions throughout New South Wales to find a new site, as a suitable one has been found.",52
414,Mr HUME COOK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Will New South Wales members say definitely where they want it ? .,52
415,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If the honourable member asks me where I think it should be I can tell him that it should be at Lyndhurst. Other honourable members may believe that it should be somewhere else, but that only goes to show how necessary it is that some should be strong enough to say that it shall be at a certain place, so that we may able to take a vote upon it, and have the matter decided once and for all. If it is desired that we should have a Federal during the present decade, let that determination be announced, and let us not is have the matter dangled before the public to irritate the people of New South Wales. Let us not have included in the legislation dealing with the subject certain provisions which are impracticable, and others which appear to be inserted for the onepurpose of",52
416,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,We shall have the Bil l,52
417,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If the members of the present Government are at all equal to their I pledges, ancl wish to gain my esteem, they accept the responsibility of putting a placed certain name into the Bill.",52
418,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,We shall see that there is a name put into it.,52
419,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,A name has note of the already been inserted.,52
420,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am aware that the Sea nate has inserted the name of Bombala.. That name was mentioned before, but I am inclined to think that it will be knocked oiit. If that name is knocked out, will find the Prime Minister undertake to put in a",52
421,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,We shall see that a sum has been name is put in.,52
422,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am very pleased to hear that, because I think we should have straight-out vote upon the question. I find that there is a levy to be made upon the New South Wales Government for ,£1,000 for expenditure incurred in connection with the referendum taken in New South Wales during the last general election. I am inclined to think that that sum represents but a very poor compensation for the labour and expenditure involved in the taking of the referendum. The expenditure on the general election amounted to ,£48,500, a larger sum, I believe, by some thousands than the previous general election cost.",52
423,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"No , it is much less than the first election cost.",53
424,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I have read somewhere that the election cost a good deal more. We do know that it was promised that under the new conditions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act the general elections would cost considerably less than the first Federal elections.,53
425,Mr BATCHELOR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,So they did.,53
426,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I desire to .say that I think the expenditure would have been considerably less than it was had it not been for the work involved in the taking of the referendum in New South Wales. I think it should be represented to the New South Wales Government that ,£1,000 is not an adequate compensation for the services rendered in that connection. It appears that the last Government neglected a payment of ,£112 for the conveyance of troops during the Royal visit, and I think that Ministers should give some explanation as to why that money was not paid before. At page 26 of the General Estimates I find a reference to a sum of ,£500 in connection with railway fares. I assume that this amount is in addition to the large sum, amounting to thousands of pounds, that is paid for railway passes generally.",53
427,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I shall explain that for the honourable member.,53
428,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I shall be glad to hear the Treasurer on that item at the proper time. There is one other matter to which I wish to refer. In connection with premiums upon fidelity guarantees in which certain fees are to be paid by the Government, as these premiums are paid in the interests of the officers, I should like to know why. the Government propose to pay the fees. Possibly the Treasurer may be able to give some explanation of the item.",53
429,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The fidelity guarantees the premiums of which are paid by the Federal Government are those in connection with officers receiving less than £ a year from the Commonwealth. They are not ordinary salaried officers. All-salaried officers contribute towards the guarantee fund.,53
430,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Then there is a fidelity guarantee fund?,53
431,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It is a Government fund, to which all salaried officers occupying responsible positions, and having the control of monies, contribute.",53
432,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am obliged for that explanation. There is the remarkable item in Division 175, subdivision v i Settlement of claim in respect of misappropriated cheques negotiated by a postal official,. If there is a fidelity guarantee fund, how is it that this item is a charge upon the Government ? I assume that an officer in receipt of a small salary would not be called upon to receive such large sums.",53
433,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I shall explain the hem,53
434,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It is a matter that should be explained, having regard to the fact that officers occupying high positions, and having the control of large sums of money, have to enter into fidelity guarantees.",53
435,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Wit h regard to the question put by the honourable member for Echuca, as to the reduction by ,£16,000 of a vote of ,£22,000 for equipment of field' artillery, I desire to say that I cannot obtain the detailed information, for the reason that the item in question in the original Estimates was not specifically voted for any particular form of expenditure. It was a general authority.",53
436,Mr MCCOLL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Something must havesuffered as the result of the reduction.,53
437,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes ; the item-""equipment of forces and requirements to arm and' equip field artillery"" has suffered. They have not purchased these equipments as extensively as was at first proposed.",53
438,Mr MCCOLL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Is there any intention tointerfere in any way with the cadets?,53
439,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The item does not affect, the cadets in any way.",53
440,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,What about the gun* that I desired to be placed in position at Fremantle?,53
441,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We are endeavouring to> prepare an emplacement for the gun in question ; but I believe that the townspeopledo not desire that it shall be placed in position at the only point at which it could beeffectively used. So far as this vote is con2 5 cerned, I can assure the honourable member for Echuca that it was a general authority? given in the original Estimates of the Defence Department. No details were supplied, and the Department was, consequently, at liberty to make a general reduction. The simple position is that they have not spent £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 of the sum which they intended to expend. Mr MCCoix - The reduction does not involve any radical change?",53
442,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,No ; it represents only a failure on the part of the Department to go as far as they intended in regard to general expenditure.,54
443,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Was not the vote based on a report by Major-General Hutton ?,54
444,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It was passed in relation . to general, and not specific, matters. The re-arming of the Cerberus is a matter that the Government have had under their serious consideration for some little time. We have not yet actually determined whether the Cerberus should have anything done to her. Improvements might be carried out on a much less expensive scale than that put forward a short time ago. The proposal to re-arm the Cerberus has been interfered with by the re-arrangement of the votes, and was interfered with by the late Government, be it remembered, to the extent of using money voted for this purpose in other directions. The work of re-arming her has, consequently, not been proceeded with during the present financial year. I regret that the late Minister of Defence is not present, because, when I was referring to this matter some weeks ago, in connection with the general policy of the Government, I said I did not think it would be wise to proceed with the re-arming of an obsolete vessel at a cost of ,£25,000.",54
445,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The money could be much more efficiently spent in purchasing small arms and ammunition.,54
446,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Althoug h we may 'hold, as I do, that large sums should be spent on harbour defences, I consider it would be a wasteful procedure to spend ,£25,000 in rearming a vessel capable of steaming only nine knots an hour. The sum represents practically half the cost of a modern torpedo-destroyer.",54
447,Mr JOHNSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Anothe r ,£20,000 would enable us to secure an up-to-date torpedodestroyer.",54
448,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"For another £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 we could obtain an' up-to-date torpedo-destroyer which for defence purposes would be ten times as valuable as is the Cerberus; still, a reduced expenditure might be incurred in connection with improvements to that vessel, and the matter is now under consideration. When I was outlining the Government policy a few weeks ago, I referred to this matter, and the late Minister of Defence interjected that Sir George Clarke had approved of the proposed re-arming of the Cerberus. I had it on the tip of my tongue to say, what I believed to be a fact, that Sir George Clarke was not a naval expert, but as I was not quite positive on the point, I refrained from doing so. Inquiries since made by me have confirmed the belief that I then held. Sir George Clarke is an eminent military man-h e is a General of Engineers-but he is no more qualified to express an opinion on purely naval matters than is any other military man. As against the opinion which the late Minister of Defence said Sir George Clarke had expressed, we have the fact that nearly every Imperial or local naval officer, who has been on this station, has been averse to the retention of the Cerberus on existing conditions.",54
449,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Not local officers.,54
450,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes ; nearly every local officer has indicated that the money necessary to re-arm her might be spent to better advantage, even in regard to port defences; or, leaving that aside, upon general defensive works.",54
451,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It was felt that she should not be destroyed altogether.,54
452,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I admit that .we should not dispense with even an ineffective vessel, until we are able to secure a better one. .",54
453,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Sh e would be a powerful floating fort.,54
454,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Quite so; and for that reason we do not propose to get rid of her, or to dispense with her complement of men until we have something better to put in her place. That, however, should not bind us to the expenditure of .£25,006 in re-arming the Cerberus for the purposes of a floating fort. This matter practically does not touch the question of the re-arming of the Cerberus because the reduction simply means that the matter has been postponed for the present financial year. The decision was arrived at some few months ago, at the instance pf my predecessor. Then the right honourable member for Swan has expressed objection to the existence of a Treasurer's advance account. He asserts that it places too much power in the hands of a Treasurer. It takes away, he states, to too great an extent the power of control which Parliament ought to exercise over the public expenditure. What does he seek to put in its place? Merely an Executive minute.",54
455,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,No ; but I put excess voucher in its place.,55
456,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The right honourable gentleman, as I understood him, said would put in its place an Executive minute, as is done in Western Australia. simply means that the Prime Minister may assent to any other Minister making any penditure in excess of parliamentary rity that he likes. If we are to choose which of two Ministers should authorize expenditure",55
457,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Not the Prime Minparliamentary ister, but the Treasurer.",55
458,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"An Executive minute vance means that any Minister, on getting the sent of the Prime Minister, takes his Exeon cutive minute to the Executive Council, there it is passed, as the right honourable gentleman knows.",55
459,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I know that the Treasurer must do so. It always goes the Treasurer first.,55
460,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I am informed of what the practice is in Western Australia.,55
461,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I was Treasurer there, too.",55
462,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The right honourable gentleman was also Prime Minister, and that is why he did as he says.",55
463,Mr ROBINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,He was the Cabinet too.,55
464,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am assured that the right honourable gentleman wasi also Cabinet in that State. An Executive minute, once it is assented to by the Prime Minister, goes straight to the Executive Council, there, without discussion, receives the formal approval of the Governor in Coundiscretion cil. Sir JOHN FORREST*-No ; it has to go the Treasurer.",55
465,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If I am to choose between an Executive minute and the authorhe ity of the Treasurer, I shall certainly choose the latter, for this reason, that he is, should be, more in touch with thefinancesof the State or the Commonwealth, as the case may be, than would be any other Minister, even the Prime Minister.",55
466,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Prime Minister is only consulted in the last resort.,55
467,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Quite so. South Wales and Victoria they have the syssioner, tem which obtains in the Commonwealth, but in the other fpur States they have the system which has been explained by the honourable gentleman. I cannot see what advantage is to be gained by it. In each case an you have to depend on the good sense and judgment of some members of the Ministry to provide for those contingencies which are he bound to crop up, no matter how you may frame your Estimates. You must have some That person on whom you can rely to provide for emergencies as they arise. I fai l to see how, exunder the Constitution, the plan of the right authohonorable gentleman could be adopted. We as to cannot spend one penny which has not been appropriated by both Houses, and, therefore, we cannot load up, in anticipation of sanction, any expenditure, unless it is in the shape of a Treasurer's advote, where it is specially appropriated conand authorized to be used by the Treasurer certain conditions. I intend to look into and the proposal of the right honourable gentleman ; but at present I do not see where any great advantage would accrue to Parliament, which requires, as f ar as possible, to to keep its finger on the expenditure of money. But if there is an advantage to be gained by its adoption, and one which would make in the direction of more efficient parliamentary control, then by all means let us adopt it . During the short time. I have been in the Treasury, I have refused quite a number of applications from different Departments, which, in my view, were not of an emergent character, on the ground that the items should have been foreseen and provided for in the Estimates, and sanctioned by Parliathe ment. That is a stand which in ordinary matters the Treasurer ought to take. On the whole-in most instances anyhow-w e and can assume that the Treasurer, for the sake of his own reputation, will exercise some in regard to the use of this vote. In regard to the remarks of the right honorto able gentleman about the appointments to Western Australia. I do not pretend to express an opinion, and I do not suppose that expects that I should. An appeal lies from the classification of the Public Seror vice Commissioner to a Board composed of the inspector of the State in which the officer is employed, the head of the Department to which he belongs, and an elected representative of the division in which he is. . The Board considers the case and reports to the Commissioner. The appeal In New is certainly determined by the Commisbut after the recommendation of the Board has been received. I have always held very strongly the view that it would be right a most improper thing, and an unwise precedent to adopt, for the Ministry to follow the course suggested by the right honourable gentleman-to interfere in the slightest degree in regard to the details of the control of the Public Service. In the various States we have had too much of political control: we have had too ddre an experience of.the evil which results from Ministers putting their friends and friends' friends into the Public Service and insuring promotion to those men who had the most influence by the backstairs entry. We have had too much of that sort of thing in the past, I think, for any one of us to allow even a scintilla of Ministerial influence to creep into the detailed control of the Public Service.",55
468,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Ministry have the responsibility.,56
469,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I admit that the Ministry have the responsibility; but Parliament has deliberately, andi, I think, properly, divested itself of its authority, so far as the control of details of appointment or promotion is concerned.",56
470,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Oh . no ! the Minisone ter has to recommend approval.,56
471,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Of course; but as the right honourable gentleman knows, that is a matter of form under the Public Service Act, and it was so considered by the Parthe claims of some public servants. liament when that measure was passed.",56
472,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I do not agree with the honourable gentleman.,56
473,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"There is a pretty rough time brewing for any Ministry that makes it more than a matter of form, unless question of policy is involved.",56
474,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Oh no ! honourable gentleman thought that a wrong appointment was recommended surely he would not approve of it ? I would not.,56
475,Mr BATCHELOR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Who is to decide?,56
476,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That is the question.,56
477,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Government.,56
478,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If the Government say that the appointment of Jones, who is an enemy, will be a ba'd one, but that the appointment of Brown, who is a friend, the present month. will be a very good one, of course we can see how far this interference is likely obtain.",56
479,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Act says that the Ministry have to do it.,56
480,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not consider that it says anything of the kind. Of course it point. leaves the approval of the appointment in the hands of the Governor General, which equality. means the Governor General in Council. We must, I admit, preserve the right of veto. It is the duty of every Minister not to allow a recommendation to be approved if he is aware of anything which ought to be reported to the Commissioner before an appointment is made. That is right. But. I hold that, as a general principle, unless a question of policy is involved, we should not interfere with the work of the Commissioner in relation to the Public Service Act. I think that under all the conditions set out - the appeals and the publicity given to the working of the Act-the public on the whole would get better results by keeping its administration free from Ministerial control than they are ever likely to do if Ministers are allowed to put their fingers in the pie.",56
481,Mr MCCOLL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Will the honourable gentleman be equally careful to see that the public servants do not get any control over the Minister?,56
482,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not think that remark is justified. Certainly, on the floor of this House I have stood up' for what I believed to be justice to public servants. I was of those who voted for the minimum wage to the lower paid officials. But in relation to the provisions of section 19, I think I have shown a proper regard for the interests of the community, as opposed to I do not think it is proper for the honourable member to suggest that there is any likelihood of this Ministry coming under the control of the Public Service. There is certainly no justification for the insinuation. a large The honourable and learned member for Angas has asked about the payment of inI f the crements due to certain South Australian officers under a State Act. Those increments have been kept back pending the consideration by the Public Service Commissioner of his classification scheme, and of the circumstances surrounding particular cases which may be dealt with apart from that scheme; but such increments as will not be interfered with by the classification, and as are due this year, will be paid during  to infer that a Classification Board has power to take away an increment ?",56
483,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,How far the classification scheme will supersede the conditions obtaining prior to Federation is a moot,56
484,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,There must be,56
485,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We must aim at equality of treatment throughout the service, but how far the general classification of omcers will supersede the diverse systems which isted prior to Federation is a matter which I do not feel competent to determine hand. It is expected by the Commissioner that his classification will largely supersede the state of affairs existing prior to tion.  cers entitled to increments under a State Act preserved by the Constitution ?",56
486,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The Chief Justice the High Court said the other day that the itemthose rights would continue until legally altered by the Commonwealth, but he was priated not unwise enough to commit himself to an £'95opinion as to what would constitute alteration, and, therefore, I may be doned for not doing so. Such increments as will not be interfered with by the fication scheme will be paid during the month. In reply to the question of the in payment for stamps. honourable member for Robertson, about railway fares and freights charged to the Department of Defence, I would point that we are now asking for £500 in addition to the amount already voted, because, since the Appropriation Act was passed, the railvised way authorities of the States have insisted upon being paid for the conveyance to campments, of troops, horses, baggage, the like, although, when the Military Forces were under the control of the States, and for a short period after their transfer to the control of the Commonwealth, no charge was made. It was, therefore, found jected encampments could not: take place unless a large sum was provided for the easily payment of railway fares and freights, and cheques. my predecessor authorized the use of a vote of £3,000 odd, which had been set apart to cover the ordinary staff travelling penses. Nearly the whole of that vote has been used in paying fares and freights connection with encampments in States, and the result is that an additional vote of £500 is required to cover ordinary travelling expenses. Even with this additional vote there will be a great saving.",57
487,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Are the Government going to discontinue encampments?,57
488,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not anticipate that they will be entirely discontinued, but hope to.reduce the cost of them for a time by making them more local.",57
489,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"As the charge is a mere bookkeeping entry, why discontinue the encampments ?",57
490,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The service does not cost the Railways Commissioners anything like as much as they charge the Commonexwealth. They make very small concessions to the military authorities, and, indeed, I offhave heard of one instance in which,the military authorities were charged is. 6d. per head to carry troops to a certain enFederacampment, while the general public were being carried there in excursion trains at offiis. per head. Of course, although only a book entry, these charges count against the Defence Department, as they tend to of swell its expenditure. With regard to Settlement of claim in respect of misapprocheques negotiated by a postal official, a legal which appears on page 42, it was parput there to cover an incident which occurred at a certain post-office, where classithe postmaster had been in the habit of cashing the cheques of well-known people Perfectly - good the cheques, drawn in favour of some one not the postmaster, and presented by a person out who had stolen them, were accepted bona fide by the postmaster in connection with the payment of stamps, and we have been adthat the Commonwealth has no defence against the drawer of the cheques. It is enmanifestly a great convenience in many and country places to allow cheques to be received at post-offices in payment of stamp accounts, but, to prevent similar occurrences, it has been decided that no cheque shall in future be taken unless it is made payable to that prothe order of the postmaster.",57
491,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That could be done by the persons presenting the,57
492,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The name of the postexmaster must appear in the body of the cheque, and the word "" order '' be substiin tuted for "" bearer."" That will be a reathe different sonable safeguard.",57
493,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It would be a small check; it would not amount to much.,57
494,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It would be a reasonable check unless a person committed forgery. That, of course, could not be provided against by any one. I shall be very glad to give the honourable member for Robertwe son any further information that may be obtainable from the officers who are more cognisant than I am with the facts of the case. It has been stated .that the visits made by Members of Parliament to the sites proposed for the Federal Capital have involved great expense. I am glad to say that that is not the case. The sum voted on the original Estimates was .£1,500. present vote is for £ 2 , 5 9 0, making a total of £[4,090. Of that amount the expenses of the Royal Commission which took eviby dence with regard to, and reported on, the sites, represented £ 3 , 3 5 0. That is £ in excess of the original estimate, or than double the sum originally asked on account of the Commission. Therefore, I was practically right in saying that extra sum for which I am asking was due to the appointment of the Commission. actual amount absorbed by travelling and incidental expenses, including the cost surveys, up to date is only .£740. This inclusive of the cost to date of the various surveys initiated by the late Minister of Melbourne. Home Affairs. It is evident from this no sum of many thousands has been spent to in connection with the visits of honourable members to the sites.",57
495,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,But some thousands of pounds have been spent in connection with the inspection of the sites.,58
496,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I quite admit that, but it has been bruited abroad that thousands of pounds have been spent in providing picnics for honourable members.",58
497,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The tour of the sioners was practically a picnic.,58
498,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Eve n so, the honourable member has no right to mix up the work the Commission, with the visits members to the proposed sites. Personally, I think that the evidence taken by the Commission, and the work performed by it, was very valuable. Whether the Commission should have cost so much as it did is another question. The present Government stand by their original proposal ? have no intention of initiating any trips or inquiries in connection with posed sites. Any additional' expenditure will probably be incurred in connection the printing of the reports that may come from the surveyors or others who are to obtain particulars as to the sites. refer, of course, to the expense incurred fore the site is selected. . Afterwards expense will have to be incurred in connection with the site itself, but I do not think need be any further great outlay precedent to the selection.",58
499,Mr MCDONA LD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," I desire a little explanation with regard to one It will be remembered that some time ago, when a Bill was introduced to provide for what was practically an increase of spent. the Governor General's salary by £ 8 , 0 0 0, the House resented the proposal to The an extent that the late Government were placed in the humiliating position of having their Bill taken out of their hands a private member, and amended in the way that honourable members thought best. 1 , 8 0 0 The House positively refused to grant more the proposed increase of salary, but for they agreed to allow H is Excellency ,£10,000 towards the expense incurred in the entertaining the Duke and Duchess of York during their visit to Australia. SubThe sequently the Government asked the House to vote £ 5 , 5 0 0 for the maintenance of the of Government Houses in Melbourne and 'is Sydney. I think that about .£2,000 was apportioned to Sydney, and ,£3,000 to Now we find that the late that Government have allowed that expenditure creep up from £ 5 , 5 0 0 to £ 7 , 3 8 7 . The amount voted during last year was £ 6 , 0 1 5 , and now we are asked to provide another £[1,372. Therefore, Ave are closelv approaching the amount of .£8,000, originally asked for by the GoA'ernment, which the House, declined to grant. I think that, under the circumstances, Ave are entitled to ' some explanation. At the time that the motion relating to this grant of £ 5 , 5 0 0 Avas submitted, it will be remembered"" that Commisthe Government furnished a list showing the expenditure that AA'duld be required. They then made a distinct promise that the of ,£5,500 Would be made to cover the Avhole of honourable of the expenditure. Sir JOHN FORREST. - I suppose that that amount was not sufficient.",58
500,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Then why were not the late Government honest enough to They further violated their pledges, simply because the prosociety was involved.

However, they have been condemned for their political sins by being relegated expense. to the Opposition benches, where I hope they will long remain.",58
504,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,How does the honourable member account for the smashing of crockery ?,59
505,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I notice a very teresting item in these Estimates, which reads, "" Glass and china, £ 5 0 . "" In one year I think that the breakages of crockery amounted in value to no less than £ 6 0 These breakages naturally cause people think, and they may be disposed to place a wrong construction on the matter. instance, men like the honourable member for Darwin would probably say that a lot of crockery was broken at "" guzzles.""",59

516,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"When the Estimates circulated in chief are submitted, if the expenditure on the maintenance of the two Government Houses exceeds £ 5 , 5 0 0 , I shall certainly take steps to divide the Committee in regard to the matter.

Why this account was held abeyance, goodness only knows. I hope that it is not one of the amounts which was expended by the famous Jenkins, who was renowned for his hospitality in connection with the Commonwealth celebrations. When the Estimates are submitted, if the amount Goprovided for the Governor General's establishment exceeds .£5.500, I shall move that Estimates for it be struck out.",59

Of honourable members realise that the present Government are not responsible for these Supplementary Estimates in any way. Nevertheless, I think that they might have them earlier, so as to permit of honourable members examining them more closely. It is very desirable that we should have an opportunity to carefully scrutinize Estimates of expenditure in order that we may meet the general demand for economy. Most of us recollect 'howl of indignation which was heard throughout the States when the late Trearegard surer submitted his Estimates, which showed a large increase in Eederal expenditure.

537,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It wil l all have been spent by the 30th of June.,60
538,Mr WILSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I had intended to refer to the'item mentioned by the honourable memf o r Kennedy, relating to troops in conpay nexion with the Commonwealth celebrations of 1901. On page 18 there is another item of expenditure concerning Western Australia. It would be just as well if honourable members carefully scrutinized the expenditure on account of Western Australia. There is an item "" Protection pf the revenue, .£937."" What does that mean? Then, further on, there is an. item '' Cost of gun-mounting at Fremantle, ,£5,000."" I presume that that gun is intended to protect something in Western Australia. Put what is meant by the protection of the revenue ?",60
539,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It means payments to solicitors and others in connection with prosecutions, as well as payments for detective work done for the protection of the revenue.",61
540,Mr WILSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In connection with the Defence Department, there is an item for the expenses of the officer despatched to Japan on special duty. I presume that that refers to Colonel Hoad, who has gone to Japan to watch the military operations ?",61
541,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Yes .,61
542,Mr WILSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Whils t I am dealing with the Defence Department, can the Prime Minister tell me something about a matter which I laid before the late Minister of Defence in connection with cadets. If he has no information, will he bring it under the notice of the Minister of Defence? I was given to understand that the Department intended to re-organize the cadet corps. I should like some indication from the Prime Minister of what has been done in this direction. Some time ago certain residents of Colac made an offer which, if accepted, would have resulted in the establishment of a mounted cadet force. Parents and others interested offered to find the ponies and equipment, so that the boys might grow up good soldiers, and eventually become members of the Australian Light Horse. A change of Government, however, took place, and possibly-thoug h I hope not-ther e was a change of policy in regard to the cadet movement. I hope that the Government will ask the Minister of Defence to take this matter into consideration, and see whether something cannot be done to assist the movement. If we train our boys, we shall certainly have trained men, and this is a suggestion which, I am sure, will commend itself to honourable members generally. Then, I should like to say a word or two in regard to rifle butts. Some time ago I drew attention to the fact that the rifle butts at Colac-and I suppose the case is the same at other places-ha d got into a state of disrepair. There is no desire to have any new rifle butts constructed, but where there are already butts, which have been allowed to fall into disrepair, some steps should be taken to put them in a better condition. In the case of the Colac butts, when a recent match had to be shot off, it was found that they were not in a fit state to be used; and that, of course,, is bad so far as the training-of the members of the rifle clubs is concerned. Turning now to the Post and Telegraph Department, the great question is whether the Act, which was passed by the Victorian State Parliament in the early hours of the morning",61
543,Mr ROBINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,At the dictation of the Labour Party.,61
544,Mr WILSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I shall leave it to the hpnorable member for Wannon to explain this matter in detail, because I believe he was a member of the State House at the time. On looking through the items, I notice, according to page 89, that the salary of a clerk has been raised from £300. to £[310, and, later on, it is shown that the salary of a switch attendant has been raised from ,£52 to ,£110, or more than double. All through the items in the Department of the Postmaster-General I notice very considerable increases in the expenditure. According to page 41, the salary of a letter carrier has been raised from ,£65 to £120, the latter being more than the minimum rate recently fixed. I should like to know definitely from the Postmaster-General, or some other Minister, whether the salaries of the charwomen employed in the post-offices have been raised to the minimum rate of £[11.0. Some time ago there was a talk that these charwomen intended to go on strike.",61
545,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"My recollection is that the charwomen withdrew their claim, because, if it were granted, it would mean that they must become permanent officials, and pass examinations and fulfil other conditions.",61
546,Mr WILSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The women would not face the examinations?,61
547,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,They would not face the general conditions.,61
548,Mr WILSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Another important point for consideration is that in Victoria a sum of ,£2,100-and , I suppose, in other States the amount is greater under similar heads-is provided as the sum overcharged to officers for rent and quarters.",61
549,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I explained that matter a little while ago, during the absence of the honourable member. I mentioned that, under the Public Service Act, only 10 per cent, on salaries can be charged for rent of quarters, and the money has unwisely been allowed to accumulate, and we have now to return it in a lump, whether we like it or not. It is a legacy from the late Government.",61
550,Mr WILSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"And it is a very unfortunate legacy. There is another item in relation to Western. Australia, and it is, I believe, the largest item under this head. On page 53 I see that, under the head of contingencies, there is set aside ,£1,250 as ""overtime and allowance for tea money "" to officers in the Department of the Postmaster-General; and a certain amount is provided in a similar way in the case of one of the States. It would be just as well to know how much of this money is for overtime, and how much for tea allowance. .",62
551,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"There must be about 1,500 people in Western Australia amongst whom this money has to be distributed.",62
552,Mr WILSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"They seem to have a verygood time in Western Australia. I ask the Government to give the question of finance very serious consideration, and to reduce the expenditure as far as possible.",62
553,Mr WILKINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," There is no doubt that the present Government have received legacies from their predecessors, and that we bave to ""pay the piper."" I should like a little information from the Min- ister of Trade and Customs, with regard to the arrangements made under the Patents Act. As I understand the regulations, any one desiring to take out patent rights in the State of Victoria is at considerable^ advantage as compared with a person with a similar desire in any of the other States. The present state of affairs does not exhibit the true Federal spirit. While I recognise the desire of this and the preceding Government to keep down expenditure as much as possible, I am of opinion that to facilitate the taking out of patents would more than compensate for any expenditure incurred by appointing deputy officers in each of the States with whom applications for patents and specifications might be lodged. am drawing attention to this matter, on behalf of a number of my constituents, who have been waiting for the passing of what they thought would be a liberal Patents Act. The charges under the Act appear to be liberal, but there are certain restrictions which cannot be so described, and which give the whole of the advantage to Victoria, so long, at any rate, as the Seat of Government is within that State. I do not think that it would involve any very considerable extra expense to have deputy officers appointed in ""the capitals of each of the States, with whom intending patentees might lodge their applications, and to whom they might go for advice. They should also be able, at the branch offices, to look over the list of patents granted or applied for, that they might be able to decide whether they are introducing a novelty. In the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department we have the Postmaster-General, with his Secretary, established here, and we have Deputy Postmasters-General in each of the States. There is no reason why the same course should not be adopted in connection with the Patent Office. Whilst we might have here an officer controlling the Patent Office who would be the head of the Department, I see no reason why there should not be established branch offices in the capitals of each of the States in the charge of Deputy Comptrollers of Patents for the convenience of inventors, and to enable them to avoid the expense of seeking the advice of costly patent attorneys. I received the regulations under the Act only this evening, but I have gone through them as carefully as I could in the time at my disposal. I find that, under them, in this State of Victoria, where the people have enjoyed years of protection, and have trained a great number of skilled mechanics, intending patentees are at a considerable advantage as compared with persons in the other States of the Commonwealth, who wish to secure patents, and they will have that advantage so long as the head office of the Patents Department is located in this city. That is not in accordance with the true Federal spirit, and I feel sure it was never intended when the Patents Act was passed. There are a number of persons in the electorate which I represent, and in that represented by the Minister for Trade and Customs, which has also a manufacturing centre, who have been waiting for I the passage of a liberal Patents Act, in order that they might obtain patents for discoveries and inventions which they have been engaged in perfecting for years past. Their hopes were raised because they considered that this was a democratic Parliament, that would be prepared to place the humblest workman on a level with the capitalist, who in the past has been the only person in a position to secure a patent, - because he has been able to command the money necessary. When, in the past, a mechanic invented a machine, or discovered an improvement upon a machine, he had to sell his discovery to.some one having the money to obtain a patent for it. It was held out that under the Commonwealth inventors would be able to patent their inventions throughout Australia for a merely nominal sum. I admit that the fees required under the Act are merely nominal; but, if intending patentees must go through all the forms laid down in these regulations, the expense involved will not be nominal, and it will be beyond the reach of ordinary mechanics. We shall in consequence have made but very little advance on the past order of things. I am aware that the present Minister of Trade and Customs is not responsible for these regulations, and that he would have been more reasonable in his treatment of inventors. If a man in Western Australia desires to take out a patent, the only place where he can get full information is the city in which the Seat of Government is located. . He can get a certain amount of information in the branch office established in the capital of his State, but in order to get full information he must come here.",62
554,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Will not copies of all patents and specifications be filed in the branch offices?,63
555,Mr WILKINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That is so. But, supposing a man away at Port Darwin makes an important discovery, or invents a machine, and desires to patent it, he must travel round to Melbourne himself, or he must engage a patent attorney in this city, in order to secure a.patent.",63
556,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"-The illustration is an unfortunate one. That man's position is improved, because before the passing of the Federal Act he would have had to go round to Adelaide, and to take out patents in every Colonv.",63
557,Mr WILKINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I admit that it is difficult to overcome anomalies in connection with a large continent such as ours, but they should be reduced to a minimum. If we take Queensland, for example, the facilities required might be extended not only to Brisbane, the capital of the State, but also to' Rockhampton, the capital of the central district of Queensland, and to Townsville, the capital of the northern district. Very little extra expense would be involved in producing extra copies of patents and specifications. My contention is that the Patents Department would be reimbursed the expense involved, in providing the facilities I suggest, by the number of extra applications for patents that would be made. I am aware that it must cost a little more to have deputy officers in other parts of the Commonwealth, who will be able to give all necessary information and receive applications; but numbers of men are today deterred from making application for patents because they must submit them through a patent attorney in Melbourne, or some agent, whose charges will probably be higher than the actual cost of obtaining the patents. In these circumstances they refrain from making applications, when, if they could transact their business in their own neighbourhood, they would patent their inventions. Some of the inventions and discoveries patented might appear very simple in themselves, but they might confer great benefit on the Common' wealth in the future. Inventions that in the past have appeared to be of very small moment have turned out to be of very great benefit, not only to the country in which they were invented, but to humanity at large. History furnishes innumerable instances of that kind. Those of us who advocated Federation-and no man in Australia was a more ardent advocate of it than I was-claime d that it would place every citizen of Australia on a common plane as Australians. We contended that it would break down the old distinction between the Victorian, the New South Welshman, the Queenslander, the South Australian, the Western Australian, and the Tasmanian. But I regret to say that the regulations under the Patents Act which have been framed not by the present Government, but, I presume, by the Government which preceded them, confer privileges and preferences upon those who happen to be in the immediate vicinity of the seat of the Federal Government for the time being. An objection has been raised to what I have suggested, on the score of cost. I think that I know the aspirations of the present Government as well as most men, and I believe they hold that the monopolization of machinery and modern inventions has done a considerable amount of ha'rm, and has brought a considerable amount of hardship on the toiling masses in every country in the world. If the operation of the Patents Act is to be restricted in the way in which these regulations appear to me to restrict it, we shall' emphasize, rather than remedy, that state of affairs. We shall enable the few to take advantage of all modern discoveries and inventions in Australia."" If we are to become a self-containing and self-sustaining community-and we have all the natural essentials-w e must encourage, not only our primary, but our manufacturing industries. We have to keep pace with the other nations of the world. We have the intelligence, the mechanical ingenuity, and the-genius to enable us to do so, but a man who invents a new machine, or improves upon an old one, often smothers his discovery rather than hand it over for a few pounds to a man who will become a millionaire by securing a patent for it, while he remains practically a mendicant. I took no small part in the debates on the Patents Bill. I closely studied all the questions relating to the measure, and when it was before us, I understood that it was going to offer the most ample facilities for the humblest and poorest inventor to secure the fullest reward of Kis genius. It seems to me, however, that, if these regulations, which have been framed in a conservative interest, are permitted to remain, the Act will not do anything of the kind. I should like the Minister of Trade and Customs, who administers the Act, to be able-to assure the Committee to-night that every facility will be given, not necessarily in the capitals of the States, but in all the more important cities, to persons who desire to obtain information in regard to our Patents law. There should be agents in such cities prepared to supply all information, and to receive applications and specifications.",63
558,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"What , cost would that involve ?",64
559,Mr WILKINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The additional fees that would be secured would more than compensate the Government for the increased expenditure. Unless these branches are established many inventions will be suppressed, because inventors are often unable to bear the cost of making application to the head office, and of employing an attorney or agent to act for them in Melbourne. If branch offices existed in the more important towns and cities of the Commonwealth, at which a man might transact his business without the intervention of a third party, good results would follow. The cost of establishing these offices would be more than met by the increased fees in respect of applications for patents relating to discoveries that would never otherwise come to light., There is only one other subject to which I desire to refer. I believe that the Defence Department has made a retrogressive step in deciding not to proceed with the formation of cadet corps.",64
560,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Hav e they arrived at that decision ? - Mr WILKINSON - I understand that they have, for in reply to certain correspondence recently addressed to the Department, it was stated that the matter would have to remain in abeyance for some time. From the inception of the Commonwealth Parliament, it has been held that we should have a citizen soldiery. That has been the keynote of our scheme for a defence system for the Commonwealth. If we are going to have a citizen soldiery, we must begin by drilling the boys attending primary scliools, and the work must be continued at the higher schools. On reaching 18 years of age lads are able to join the rifle clubs, and as members' of those clubs, they will receive further instruction, and may subsequently be drafted into the militia. If this scheme were adopted, the more ardent spirits would doubtless leave the Militia to join the permanent Defence Forces, and in this way we should secure a complete system of defence.",64
561,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," I am afraid that I shall not be able to appease the wrath of the honourable member for Moreton by the simple statement that I.am not responsible for the regulations to which he so strongly objects. When I took office I urged that the issuing of the regulations should be expedited, and I am advised that they constitute the most liberal code that has been drafted in any part of the world. I am likewise advised' that the scale of fees is lower than any that has been fixed under other patent laws. Special facilities to obtain information are afforded to intending applicants, and, as we all know, a Commonwealth patent, covering a period of seven years, can be obtained at a cost of only £&.",64
562,Mr WILKINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That cost relates only to the charges made by the Department.,64
563,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am pleased to be able to inform the Committee and the public generally that the Commissioner of Patents in Melbourne is prepared to receive applications direct from intending patentees, and that it is not necessary for them to employ the assistance of any intermediary. Those who apply directto the Commissioner will secure all the rights, privileges,, and advantages that accrue to those who employ a patent attorney to act in their behalf Surely these arrangements should be calculated to afford equal facilities to all persons living in any part of Australia, although we know, of course, that those who live at a distance from Melbourne must be placed at a disadvantage in respect of the time within which an application may be lodged.",64
564,Mr WILKINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Why ?,65
565,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If two men, one living in Melbourne and the other in Brisbane, conceived the same idea, and desired to patent the same invention at the same moment, the one who lived in Melbourne would, of course, have an advantage over the other. That is a difficulty that cannot be avoided.",65
566,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,On e could get very long odds against such an occurrence.,65
567,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Such instances are conceivable, and that is my sole reason for stating a proposition that' is self-evident. There can be only one Patent Office. If it is not in Melbourne, it must be in Sydney, or in the Federal Capital or some other large centre of population.",65
568,Mr WILKINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,We have only one General Officer Commanding the Military Forces of the Commonwealth; but we have a commandant in each of the States.,65
569,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It is mandatory that there shall be only one Patent Office, and there can be practically only one Register of Patents. The Patent Office must be in some large centre of population, and the Seat of Government being in Melbourne, the office for the time being is situated in Collins street. I am somewhat surprised at the statement made by the honourable member for Moreton, that the regulations issued under the Patents Act are complicated, and will put a poor inventor to undue expense in protecting his discovery. I can assure the honourable member that the Commissioner is as anxious as he is that every facility shall be afforded to the poorer classes of inventors to reap the reward of their genius. That is the desire of myself and my colleagues, and if the honourable member is able to point to any obstacle now thrown in the way of inventors who desire to take out patents, we shall be glad to endeavour to remedy the defect. Applications for patents have already been received from persons living at a distance, and what is more unusual, the regulations issued have been commended by persons living in all parts of the Commonwealth.",65
570,Mr WILKINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,B y patent agents.,65
571,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I have only to add that those who desire to patent any invention will receive full consideration, information that can be given, without involving the applicant in unnecessary expense, will be afforded, either in writing or otherwise. There will be one officer in each of the States, at least for some time to come, but it is not desirable that any large expenditure should be incurred in main-' taining an office, the fees relating to which are so lbw that a number of persons assert that we shall not be able to make it pay. The Commissioner considers that after the lapse of one or two years it will not be a largely profitable branch of the service, but that it will more than meet working expenses. I think honourable members will agree that it is desirable that the Patent Office shall be at least able to pay working expenses.",65
572,Mr WILKINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,What about the indirect advantages?,65
573,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"At a cost of £ 1 an inventor can secure a provisional protection for a patent for nine months; when his specification is accepted, another £ 2 has to be paid; and when the patent has been sealed, it is only necessary for him to pay a further fee of ^ 5 in order to be protected for a period of seven years. At the end of that time he can renew his patent for a further period of seven years on payment of a fee of £ 5 . Thus, at a cost of £ 1 3 , it is possible for an inventor to protect his invention throughout the Commonwealth for a period of fourteen years. Other liberal provisions have been made in favour of those who desire 'to protect the fruits of their genius. I hope that no misunderstanding on this point will go out to the public, because I think that they have better protection now than ever they had, and at a much lower cost, too.",65
574,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," I do not intend to speak at a later stage on the Estimates of the different Departments; but I desire to refer now to one or two matters which seem to me to be of importance to the House, and to the people in the thinlypopulated districts of the States. I should like the Minister in charge of the Estimates at present to explain to me, if he can, what by-election for East Sydney the item of £370, under the head of miscellaneous expenditure on page 9, refers to?",65
575,Mr BATCHELOR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The by-election for East Sydney, which was held after the leader of the Opposition . resigned as a protest against the non-adoption of the and that all electoral boundaries.",65
576,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Is that the election which is commonly known in New South Wales as ""Reid's Folly?""",65
577,Mr LEE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"No , the gerrymandering one.",66
578,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"This represents the cost of the election when the right honormunication able gentleman sought to make, as it a false start, with the view of securing return to this Parliament. I never knew anything so ridiculous or so unjustifiable his action on that occasion. For the right honourable gentleman, merely as a matter pyrotechnics, to resign his seat, and the Commonwealth to the expense of least, £37°> was, to my mind, an act which not do credit to him. I trust that in future no such folly will be displayed by honourable member. I wish to speak more particularly of the attitude of the Post and Telegraph Department towards those residents of the Commonwealth who, in my opinion, are being victimtions ized. I refer to the residents in back-blocks of the States, especially New South Wales, who have no railway munication, and very inadequate coach communication, and whose mails arrive, in some cases, only once a week, and under great difficulties in bad weather. people, who are practically the pioneers of this country, and who have to put up with all these disadvantages, are put by the Federal Government under conditions which did not exist prior to the transfer of the ' and Telegraph Department. We find that cannot gettelephoniccommunication provided to these people in their interests unless are prepared to put their hands into their pockets, and pay very heavy demands way of guarantees and otherwise. We have heard a great deal here about settling people on the land, and the good results which will flow to the Commonwealth from matter of form. such settlement; and yet we fail to recognise that settlers in remote districts require least some means of communication in their sponsible. isolation, if we are to keep them there. The Parliament of New Soutli Wales used to take these matters into its ' consideration. It considered by granting these concessions to men who were going out to take up its occupied lands, it would bring about settlement of a large population on the These settlers went into the back-blocks believing that when the Federal Government came into existence similar concessions would be made by the Commonwealth, . a view to promote settlement - of people the land, and of course the general perity of Australia. Yet we find in places where the rivers overflow the flat country, and threaten the lives of the residents, we cannot get telephonic comprovided for the purpose of were, informing them as to rises in the his rivers at higher . levels, which are likely to submerge their families and as their stock. Through the absence of this information ruin has overtaken many, of persons. We have a right to expect that put the Commonwealth Government will be, at a little broad-minded in dealing with did the requirements of this most deserving class, who receive the least consideration any at the hands of the Post and Telegraph Department in the matter of the extension of telephonic or telegraphic communication. I appeal to the Postmaster-General to take into his consideration the regulawhich were initiated by the late the Government, and to see whether they in cannot be liberalized. We should at comleast do what we can to make the lot of these people as comfortable as possible, and spare no efforts to carry out the policy of settling the people on the land These which we advocate.",66
579,Mr KENNEDY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," I think it will be generally admitted that this discussion is another evidence, if any were necessary, of the utter futility cf discussing SupPost plementary Estimates from the standpoint we of economy. It has always seemed to me to be an absolute waste of time to discuss they them, because the money has been spent. In this instance the Government who spent by the money have gone out of office, and their sins cannot be visited upon them; and the we have another Government simply putting their Estimates through the Committee as a",66
580,Mr OMALLEY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"But this Government at accepted their sins, and must be held re",66
581,Mr KENNEDY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"This Government did not accept the sins of the late Governthat ment ; they accepted the Treasury bench, and have their own sins to answer for. A ungreat portion of the expenditure which is the submitted on these Estimates was foresoil. shadowed last year by the late Treasurer, when he delivered his Budget speech. The major portion of the sum total-£137,00 0 - is chargeable to the Post and Telegraph with Department. There are two principal on causes, over and beyond the natural prosexpansion of the Department, to which that the increase is due. The first is an* Act passed by the Victorian Parliament, increasing the salaries of officials in Departments about to be transferred to the Commonwealth control, under the impression that the other States would b ; called upon to pay part of the cost. That was the belief which was uppermost in the minds of those who supported the measure, though the people of Victoria now find that they alone, and rightly so, too, have to find the money. I was a member of the Victorian Assembly at the time. The Act was a hasty, ill-considered piece of legislation, and was carried to erect private telephone lines. on the last night of the last session of the Victorian Parliament prior to the inauguration of Federation.",66
582,Mr CARPENTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,And the Upper House did not check it ?,67
583,Mr KENNEDY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"They hardly looked at it. The few mild remonstrances raised in the Assembly were ignored. The other cause is tlte humane act of this Parliament fixing a minimum wage. Those two causes account for ^82.000 of the total increase. There are some items in the Estimates which I do not wish to particularize now, but in regard to which the Committee should have an explanation when we come to deal with details. What appear to be new appointments in the Attorney-General's Department and in the Audit Office' are provided for. I should like information in regard to them, and also as to the system of paying gratuities for work done by members of the Public Service. Where that work is a special service performed outside ordinary office hours, we should be informed of it. But the services provided for in Division 27A appear to be such as could have been performed by a competent officer of the Treasury or of the Auditor-General's Department in ordinary office hours. I hope, too, that an planation will be given of the item .£750, compensation for loss of office, in subdivision 3 of division 33. We know that most officers who retire in the ordinary way are provided with pensions or gratuities under the Acts under which they were appointed ; but there are circumstances under which officers leaving the service forfeit such rights, and I wish to know if this is such a case. I - desire also to emphasize what the honourable member for Gwydir has said in regard to the disabilities of persons residing in outlying portions of the Commonwealth. The Postmaster-General himself represents a sparsely populated constituency, and realizes the disabilities which such persons labour; so we should have his sympathy in our requests for improved telephonic communication.",67
584,Mr OMALLEY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,He used to make the same kind of speeches himself.,67
585,Mr KENNEDY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not wish to throw Hansard at him, but I have listened to similar appeals from him, and, no doubt, if the honourable member can give him a reminder at an opportune time, something practical will be done. There appears to be a rooted objection on the part of the officers of his Department to permitting individuals They seem to think that these lines will compete with public lines. In two instances in which I have submitted what appeared to me reasonable applications for telephonic communication, the departmental estimate of cost was so large as to seem absurd, and was certainly beyond the means of those concerned. They, therefore, asked to be allowed to erect a private, line, but that request was refused point-blank, without conin sideration. It would be impossible for such a private line, if erected, to compete - with any public telegraph or telephone line, and, instead of there being a loss, or risk of loss, of revenue, the Department would gain, .because the number of messages sent from the nearest telegraph office would be increased. The petitioners were quite prepared to pay all charges, and to erect the line at their own cost, under the supervision of departmental officers. I ask the Postmaster-General to give more consideration than has been given in the past to the applications of those who, living in remote places, wish to enjoy some of the conveniences of civilized life.",67
586,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," There are two matters to which I wish to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General In the first place, I ask him if it is desirexable, when his officers report that the telephonic business of a country town is likely to be of such' a nature as to cover the cost of maintaining and working a telephonic system, to demand a guarantee.",67
587,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,They are not now insisted on in all cases.,67
588,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In one case in which I am all interested, a guarantee is being required.",67
589,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable and learned member will find that the departmental report is against granting the application.,67
590,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I am not so sure that that is true with regard to the case of Clifton.,67
591,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I cannot speak definitely under as to that case.,67
592,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"There is another matter to which I desire to direct attention. On page 48 of the Estimates appears an item of , £ 1 3 for ""medical and funeral expenses,' M . J. Dwyer, killed in the execution of his to make inquiries. duty."" Underlying that item is a quesany tion of general principle which applies to all labourers in the service of the monwealth. Dwyer was an ordinary labourer, and was engaged in the work erecting certain telegraph lines. A pole, which was being placed in position, denly gave way.

This case raises the whole question of the liability of the Commonwill wealth for injuries sustained by its emthe ployes, who are following an occupation in itself dangerous, and who are not guilty contributory negligence. The official rewealth port, of which I have a copy, shows clearly that . Dwyer was not guilty of any neglect., He was doing work his country - a class of work which the Postmaster-General will admit dangerous, and which has to be performed in remote parts of the Commonwealth. many instances these men go out with stage, their lives in their hands.

The official reply was to the effect that there was a sum of £ 4 ios. standing to his credit; but that she could not receive any of his money, as it was intended apply it to the liquidation of his funeral medical expenses. I do not desire to make an ad misericordiam appeal, although there is ample ground for doing so.

593,Mr CARPENTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," The is complaint that has been made with reference to honourable members not having the EstiI n mates placed before them at an earlier is a very old one, and has, doubtless"", was been voiced in every Parliament in the",68
594,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is a very proper,68
595,Mr CARPENTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I agree with the honourable member, and I hope that, until Governments mend their wavs, honourable members will protest against having Estito mates placed in their hands immediately and before they are asked to consider them. From the point of view of Ministers, we understand that it is considered that business will be facilitated if honourable members are not allowed too much time to ferret out matters which are dealt with in the I question, however, whether that view is a sound one, because many items regarding which honourable membersthemselves compelled to make a public inquiry, might, if they had ample time, be disposed of beforehand by means of a personal interview with a Minister or the offiThese remarks apply to one matter to which I wish to refer. The honourable member for Corangamite us just now that, included in the was an item of £ 5 . 0 0 0 for expenditure upon the defences of Fremantle, I am and he led the Committee to believe that a large expenditure was being'incurred in respect of defences in Western Australia. The honourable member confessed that he was at some disadvantage, owing to the fact that the Estimates had not been presented at an earlier stage, and it was evident he did not understand the figures before him. I desire to complain of the action of the late Government in regard to the defences of Fremantle. That is the only important port in Australia that is still undefended. Millions of pounds' worth of property, lie there, unprotected, and if a hostile force were to appear off that port, it would be entirely at their mercy. For some years past representations have been made regarding this matter, and all sorts of promises have been given that something would be done. Under the heading ""Expenditure for additions, new works, and buildings,"" I find that the Estimates of last year contained an item of .£5,000 for gun and mountings at Fremantle. The residents of that town have been patiently waiting for the gun to be placed in position, but now that the Supplementary Estimates are forthcoming I find that the item has been eliminated. Had I not inquired into' the matter I should have been puzzled to know the reason for this new departure. The explanation of Ministers is that, although the sum in question was voted last year for a specific purpose, it was expended for an entirely different purpose. It was spent, not in obtaining a gun for the defence of Fremantle, but in providing ammunition for the rest of Australia. I protest against action of this character. What would the Committee think if , when the Estimates-in-Chief were under consideration, we voted a particular sum for a specific purpose, and were told next year that it had been spent for an entirely different pose. If conduct of that sort is to be tolermatter ated it will be impossible for honourable bers to have any confidence in the Estimates which are sanctioned from year to year. I find, also, that the Estimatesjn-Chief also contain another item of £[4,000, being portion of a total of £9,500, which it was intended to spend in clearing a site for the gun, and in equipping it. The sum of £3,800 has already been expended on the site, and the people of Fremantle are asking why the gun is not ready for mounting. . The reason has been kept a profound secret, but it now transpires that the money which was voted for the purpose some months ago was spent for an entirely different purpose. I ask that a matter of such great moment shall be dealt with in a business like manner. Mr Carpenter. Xlthough a difference of opinion exists as to .what is the best site upon which to fortify Fremantle, we are' bound to accept the opinion of experts. Personally, I doubt whether they are acting wisely in placing the fort in the middle of the town. It does seem to me that in the event of hostilities in the future the fort will constitute a menace to the people of Fremantle. In case of bombardment every shot fired at it would destroy thousands of pounds worth of property. I ask the Government to give me an assurance that despite the misappropriation of this money by their predecessors in office, the effective defence of Fremantle will not be long delayed.",68
596,Mr WILLIS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,What would it cost to defend that town?,69
597,Mr CARPENTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I should say about £[15,000. I ask the Government to consent to place on the next Estimates an amount adequate to complete this important work, and thus to allay the fears which are entertained that, in the event of hostilities occurring, the lives and property of the residents of Fremantle will not be protected.",69
598,Mr LONSDALE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"New England) During the course of his remarks this evening, the honourable member for Gwydir assumed a great deal of innocence in reference to the bye election for East Sydney which took place some months ago. Now, it is well known that that election was brought about by the action of the right honourable member for East Sydney, who considered it necessary to resign his seat in order to call attention to the gerrymandering tactics of the Barton Government. Undoubtedly, it had that effect. The honorpur- able member for Gwydir introduced the for the purpose of having a fling at memthe right honourable member for East Sydney. He will be wise, however, if he leaves that gentleman alone. I confess that I do not understand some of the statements which have been made regarding the erection of telephone lines. When the Postal Department was under State control it was customary for the New South Wales authorities to demand from responsible persons who desired that telephonic facilities should be extended to them, the payment of 5 per cent, on the cost of erecting the line, in addition to its working expenses.",69
599,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,A number of those persons failed to pay up.,69
600,Mr LONSDALE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The present trouble is that the Commonwealth has raised the interest chargeable upon the cost of the line to 10 per cent. The Postal Departjj ment demands that interest upon the capital cost of these lines shall be handed over fore their erection is undertaken. No small body of individuals can comply with such a condition. It would be far better for Commonwealth to declare- "" We will not terms. undertake the erection of these lines."" When applicants for telephone facilities are asked to plank down the sum of .£400 prior to erection of a line, it can easily be underNew stood that they are unable to do so. of The people cannot put their hands in their pockets for lump sums. But it is possible to find men from whom the money can be obtained. If the money has not been tained, it is because of the laxity of the Department. When persons give guaranof tees, the Department should force them to pay up if there is any deficiency. method of conducting the business is that whatever deficiency there may be between complaint. tha revenue and the actual cost and interest, the guarantors have to make up for a tain number of years. It has been serted that persons are not allowed to private telephones. That, however, correct. I know a gentleman who has just obtained the consent of the Department to erect a telephone thirty miles long. that instance, no objection was raised by the Department.",69
601,Mr STORRER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Will that telephone relonger. main his private property?,70
602,Mr LONSDALE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It is absolutely his own. Furthermore, he is erecting the not merely on his own property, but along the main road. Of course, if subsequently the Government like to come along and take the telephone from him, it will be ready for them, upon paying compensation ; but this gentleman is taking all the risk, and incurring the cost at premoney. sent. Of course, if persons erect telephones on their own private land, they can adopt their own methods; but if they erect them along public roads they must to the satisfaction of the Government. I think that the present guarantee is 10 cent. It ought to be reduced considerably it amounts to. so as to give an opportunity to country people to obtain communication with the larger centres of population. The Postmaster-General might look into the subject with a view of making the terms more ancl liberal, without any risk to I do not wish the Government to give anything away. If responsible guarantors can be obtained, their bonds should be taken, and if the proper revenue is not 1 tained, I certainly think that the guarantors should be compelled to make it up, beBut I hope that something will be done for the people in the more isolated portions of the country, with a view to giving them the better telephonic accommo'dation on easier",70
603,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," Wit h reference to the comthe plaints made by the honourable member for England as to the excessive amount the telephone guarantees, I may say that it has been found necessary to obtain those deposits in respect to places where there is no immediate prospect of the lines payobing. But wherever a departmental oflicer reports that there is a reasonable prospect a line being remunerative, the Department takes the responsibility and erects the The telephone without a guarantee.",70
604,Mr LONSDALE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I did not make that,70
605,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That is the position cerwith regard to the guarantees. I cannot asagree with the honourable member in his have reasons for the reduction of the amount is infrom 10 per cent. I presume that he is aware that the life of an ordinary line is probably not more than ten years. If that In be so, 10 per cent, is not excessive.",70
606,Mr LONSDALE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I have known some telephones that have been in existence,70
607,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"But it has to be remembered that repairs are necessary from time line to time. I cannot see my way to authorize any reduction of the deposit, which was fixed after careful consideration.",70
608,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is a hardship on there some small outlying districts.,70
609,Mr ROBINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Government should not ask the guarantors to plank down the,70

611,Mr ROBINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Why ask for the whole per capital cost? That is what I understand,70
612,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That is not correct.,70
613,Mr ROBINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I made an application for a line between Hamilton and Ballaiat, I was told that the sum required would the Government. be £ 2 , 0 0 0 .",70
614,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That was probably a trunk line, and there may be different regulations in such cases. However, I will underobtake to look into the matter. The honourable member for New England has said that it is found that the guarantees in New South Wales were very unsatisfactory. But that is not so wholly for the reason given by the honourable member, that the Department has been dilatory. The fact is that it is often found that some of the persons who give the guarantees meet with reverses, and are unable to pay up. As to the case mentioned by the honourable member for Darling Downs, I have already looked into the papers, and I admit that it is a very sad case; one that must excite general sympathy. It appears that the poor fellow referred to was killed, as the honourable and learned member expressed it, in the execution of his duty, and had he been under the Public Service Act something would have been done for his relatives. However, the late Treasurer laid down a rule that, except where there is legal responsibility for remuneration, or for the payment of some such gratuity, it should not be paid. It is a rule that works hardship in some cases. I believe that the Queensland Government, if not actually consulted in regard to this case, was consulted in regard to others, and refused to coincide in the payment of any gratuity of the kind. is one in which, if my hands were not tied by a previous decision. I should certainly adopt remedial measures. The honourable member for New England leiterates the complaints made by the honourable member for Moira and the honourable member for Gwydir, in reference to the isolation of the pioneers and the necessity for the extension of telephones in the lemorer districts of Australia. work with which I have full sympathy. thing I can point to my three years' service in this House as evidence of the fact that the people who are opening up the waste portions of Australia have, in my opinion, the strongest claim to sympathy and consideration of Parliament. course, there again the consideration of expense arises.",70
615,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"C u t down some the luxuries, ancl give those people the necessaries.",71
616,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I quite agree with the honourable member, and I may him that it was at my instance, when a private member, that a step was taken by indicated. the Post and Telegraph Department, connect these remoter places by telephone, using the telegraph wiies for the phonophore system.",71
617,Mr LONSDALE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,They want that system in New South Wales.,71
618,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Probably it is not easy to adopt it there, because there is so much telegraphic business on the lines.",71
619,Mr MCWILLLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,We have tried the system in Tasmania.,71
620,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Ye s ; and I am very glad to say that it was a Tasmanian officer who originally carried it out in Western Australia. I have good reason to be grateful to him for the success he made of the work, which was carried out, I am sorry to say, against the advice of some of the local officers, and in. spite of theii opposition. I shall look into the telephone regulations, and although they have been quite recently adopted, an effort will be made to liberalize them. There are one or two reasons for the apparent inflation of the Supplementary Estimates. The first reason is, of course, the statutory increments and arrears arising out of an Act passed in this House, and from an Act passed by the Victorian Parliament. I may point out, also, that where increases appear in the permanent salaries, corresponding reductions The case appear in contingencies and temporary salaries. The ' honourable member for Corangamite drew attention to an item of £[1,250 for overtime and allowances for tea money, paid to Western Australian officers in the Post and Telegraph.Department.",71
621,Mr WILSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"And also in South Australia, I think.",71
622,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I have no information in That is :t regard to South Australia, but in Western I Australia, the position appears to be that the staff has, to some extent, been undermanned, and the result of the operation of the Public Service Act in the matter of overtime is responsible for this large sum. For instance, Sunday work is now paid at one-and-a-half But, of rates, and that, together with some arrears, accounts for the particular item. Previously it appears overtime was not allowed in 1 the Post and Telegraph Department of of Western Australia, certainly not for what is known as current work. I shall be glad, later on, to give any further information which is in my possession; but, as I have tell already said, I believe the increased amounts are accounted for largely by the causes Where additional officers to have been appointed from time to time by to cope with increased work, on the approval of the Public Service Commissioner, the temporary staff has been reduced to a corresponding extent. Certain remarks were made by the right honourable member for Swan respecting the appointment of the Public Service Inspector in Western tralia, and I may have another opportunity to deal with that matter.",71
623,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," Lik some honourable members who have already spoken, I express the hope that the custom of placing the Estimates in the hands of honourable members immediately before they are discussed will not be continued. It is absolutely impossible for an honourable membut ber who has not served in this House prethe 'height of folly in administration. viously to go through the Estimates during the discussion, and arrive at anything like a satisfactory conclusion.",72
624,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"And the more the honorfarce. able member studies the Estimates the more unsatisfactory, perhaps, will his conclusion be.",72
625,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If that be so, it our duty to protest in a more vigorous The,sum provided for, ,£137,000, consists a great measure of transferred, and not expenditure, but the figures are large enough for some of us who think that Federal penditure has already grown too much.",72

627,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I know that; but it is unsatisfactory to be passing items we have had no time to consider. be unfortunate for us, but it is fortunate the Government that they are not respontime sible for the items, and I suppose the sent Ministry have had a little difficulty arriving at an explanation of some of the amounts. There are one or two matters which ought to receive very serious attenare tion. I h e first ancl most important is nected with that celebrated, or infamous, Act which makes it compulsory to give months. - certain advances to Victorian officers. I was in hopes that some of the Victorian members who had the honour to hold seats in the State Parliament when the Act was passed, would have given a much fuller and more satisfactory explanation than we have yet received. As I understand the position, the Commonwealth has been practically ""bull-dozed"" into the payment of this money, which means a gross injustice to the public servants the Commonwealth and the other States. very much worse injustice will be perpemerely trated if we carry out the idea of the orable and learned member for Bendigo, who suggests that in order to relieve Commonwealth from this unfair stipulation, Federal officers in Victoria may be promoted over the heads of other officers in other AusStates. That might relieve the Commonwealth; but I hope that suggestion will not be carried out. It would be better that the e Commonwealth should bear the burden than that a grave injustice should be inflicted on the public servants of other States. There is a matter in connection with the extension of telegraph wires to which I should like to call attention. I.t is a small matter; it has always appeared to me to exhibit I grant that the idea and intention may have been good; but the practical working out of the regulation to which I refer is, in some of the States, highly suggestive of a The position is that line-repairers may be employed for a period of only six months, at the end of which they ""must retire, and make room for others. I beis lieve the intention was to give employment way. to a greater number of men; but I know iin that the result is quite the contrary. The new Department will never get skilled men of experience prepared to take the. small exsalaries offered under the circumstances. The pay is by no means large. If we are exceedingly liberal in the higher branches of the service, the Commonwealth cannot be accused of extravagance as rewhich ' gards the lower branches. Good men will It may not be induced to take an appointment for for six months, knowing that at the end of that they will have to depend on casual prework for at least another six months. in That is a regulation which I trust the Postmaster-General will take into his consideration. When we get good men who beginning to understand the nature of contheir work, it is a serious mistake to dispense with their services at the end of six",72
628,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The object of the regulation is to prevent persons being appointed through political influence as temporary officers, and then becoming permanent officers, thus avoiding the provisions of the Act with respect to competitive examinations.",72
629,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"No competitive examination is necessary for an ordinary of line repairer, who cuts telegraph poles in A the bush, and who in sinking them has to do pick and shovel work. When hon- 'these men haye served for six months they have to retire, and make way for others, the no matter how good their work may be.",72
630,Mr TUDOR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,They can be appointed permanently.,73
631,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The honourable member will find that they cannot. There are other matters to which I might refer, but they can be more properly dealt with when the items with which they are connected are before us. The usual practice is, I believe, to have a little general discussion on the first item, and to reserve detailed criticism until the items are separately before us. I hope there is no desire to rush these Estimates through, without giving honourable members an opportunity to consider what they are being asked to pass. I believe that, from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, there is a grave fear in the minds of the public that Commonwealth expenditure is growing far too large. Although the members of the present Government may not be responsible for these Estimates, and they may include transferred votes, it behoves us to scrutinize the items very carefully, in order that we may prevent increments, and may reduce expenditure wherever we possibly can. The taxpayer must be considered, as well as the tax-receiver, and I - hope that honourable members will give the items, when submitted to them seriatim, the serious consideration which they deserve.",73
632,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,What does the Prime Minister propose to do?,73
633,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I must ask the Committee to assist me to get these Estimates through to-night. I have arranged with another place to have these Bills sent on by tomorrow. I did so, because I hoped to get them through to-night, in view of the fa':t that I have excluded from the Supplementary Estimates all items other than those which were assented to by the late Treasurer or by myself, the latter being a very small proportion. I must therefore ask the Committee to assist me. In reply to the honourable member for Franklin, as to the short notice given for the consideration of these Estimates, I hope the honourable member wiil not think that the Government are endeavour-' ing to establish a precedent in this regard. In connection with the general Estimates, and every proposal involving debateable matter, we believe that ample notice should be given to honourable members, and they should have the Estimates in their possessio-.i for some time before they are called upi'ii to consider them. I am to-night asking honourable members to make some exception, and I can assure them that these Estimates were circulated as soon as they were available. The other branch of the Legislature must be considered, and I have been anxious to consider it, as well as anxious to replenishthe Treasurer's advance account. Although' there is only £[137,000 involved in these - Estimates, the Treasurer's advance accountis slightly overdrawn at the present time. That is explained by the fact that various items here are re-votes. In view of all circumstances, I again ask the Committee to assist me to get the Bill through.",73
634,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," When the Government make such a request, in such circumstances, one has to accede to it. But I must be excused for smiling slightly when the Prime Minister tells us that this is not to be taken as a precedent because the statement has such a familiar ring.",73
635,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Not from me.,73
636,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Oh , no; but it is astonishing how quickly a new Government falls into .the old paths. The present Government appears to fall into the old paths very easily, and perhaps that shows that it is almost inevitable that Governments will get into these ways. I have no objection, to the Prime Minister going on with the Estimates to-night, but I do hope that the statement that this is not to be taken as a precedent is not merely the fag on de parler that' one always hears from a Minister, and that we will not have a continuance of this kind of thing. We got it occasionally from the last Government.",73
637,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Ver y rarely.,73
638,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Not more often than they required to pass Estimates or Supply Bills. I suppose that the present Government, in the same way, will always have to get Supply Bills and Estimates through in a great hurry, and there will always be some reason given for an insufficient time being allowed for their consideration. The Prime Minister has put his request so very nicelv that we should have to be more hard-hearted than an Opposition such as we are could be supposed to be to offer any factious opposition to dealing with this business to-night. We are so near the end of the financial year that I do not desire that these votes should appear on fresh Estimates, and that we should be told by some people, "" Here is another proof of Federal extravagance."" There are items in these Estimates which merit a good deal of discussion, and I must admit that some alterations appear which merit a certain amount of commendation, I say that the more freely because I do not always commend the present Government for what they do.",73
639,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Swan),- I am prepared to assist the Prime Minister in getting these Bills passed to-night, but I must say a word or two in reference to the remarks made by the honourable member for Kennedy. I think the honourable member order. was aware that he had made a mistake - certain statements he made with regard the expenditure upon the up-keep of Gomaintaining vernment Houses, but he did not - withown draw what he said, and he appeared this to wish it to go forth that the late - Government had spent a great deal more money on the up-keep of the two Godesire vernment Houses than it was understood would be spent. The honourable member was altogether wrong. Although it would appear from the Estimates that more has been spent this year, that is due to the fact that some accounts have been paid this year which were properly chargeable to last year. I find that the vote for 1902-3 was £ 5 , 5 whilst only £[2,436 was debited to that vote; and there was ,£3,064 left as a balposed ance to credit of that vote for that year. Some outstanding accounts of last year have had to be paid out of the vote for this year.",74
640,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,A good deal of it is arrears.,74
641,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"For the two years £[9,823 was expended, and that' would make the expenditure for each year £[4,912. It will, therefore, be seen that the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy were altogether incorrect, and, in so far as they were intended to reflect on the conduct of the late Government, were not justified.",74
642,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I insisted on an explanaHe tion in regard to those items, and I found that they were arrears. I have asked that in future none of the votes shall be allowed to get into arrears, but that the money be paid in the year to which they properly belong.",74
643,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"They should be so paid, but it is sometimes not easy. I agree with the honourable pentleman every effort should be made to charge - each year all that is properly chargeable against it. I think it is necessary to these remarks, because it is very easy for honourable members to find fault, more cially in regard to expenditure incurred connection with the maintenance of Gothese Estimates. vernment Houses.i As long as we are required to maintain GoA'ernment Houses, we items in globo. must keep them in a reasonable and proper state. I regret to say that both Government House, Melbourne, and Government House, Sydney, and the grounds,. were allowed to f all into a-state of disrepair, with the result that it became necessary to spend a large sum in putting them in fairly good We cannot have these fine in public buildings and grounds without to being called upon to incur expense in them in an efficient state. My experience is that the money spent in direction has not sufficed to do all that is necessary. Even the proposed vote is too small to allow of what, I am sure, we all being done. At the same time, I am glad to learn that during the two years in question, as much money has not been spent in this direction as the late Treasurer intimated that he proposed to expend. There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer-the item "" Gun and mountings, Fremantle, £[5,000."" I notice that this sum, 0 0, which was provided on last year's Estimates, has not been expended, and that it is proto re-appropriate it for "" arms, pistols, and reserves of ammunition."" I am well aware that these arms and reserves are urgently required, and I take no exception to the proposed expenditure; but I do not think that the vote in respect of the gun and mountings should have been allowed to lapse. An order might well have been given. I am familiar with the whole of the circumstances' relating to the matter, and I understand that the late Treasurer refrained from expending £[5,000 on this gun and mountings for the reason that he desired to place before the Parliament the total expenditure that would be necessary to properly for t if y Fremantle. considered it would be better to refrain from spending any money in this direction until Parliament was in full possession of the whole of the facts of ths situation, and shall made aware of the total expenditure that would be incurred, I trust that when the Estimates for next year are submitted to us, we shall find due provision made in them for the fortification that of Fremantle.

In lieu of-Senio r clerk, at ^'300, One clerk at ^250. . . . and so forth. In some cases there is an inEstimates. crease on the former vote, and that apparently means additional officers.",75
649,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The item to which the honourable member has referred relates to a vacancy which occurred, and to which a new officer of a slightly higher grade was appointed on the recommendation Public Service Commissioner.",75
650,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"There is Trade another item in Division 34, in regard to expenditure in Queensland. I draw tion to these matters, in order that the Treasurer will recognise that the Committee does not necessarily accept these increases or appointments. We reserve to ourselves the right to criticise them on the Estimates.",75
651,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In regard to all the officers enumerated in subdivision 1 of d i vision 34-expenditur e in the State of Queensland-it has to be explained that fulb provision was not made on the original Estimates for the payment of their salaries, because it was anticipated that they would beretired under the age limit provided by the Public Service Act. As they have been retained in the service, provision has to be made in respect of their salaries for a certain period. So far as the finances of the States are concerned, this does not necessarily mean any increased expenditureEach of these officers would have been entitled on retirement to some form of compensation, but as they retained their positions an actual saving, taking all the cirTREASURY. cumstances into consideration, has been effected. As no provision was made on the original Estimates for, their 'salaries in respect of part of the year, we have now to make this provision for them. There are no new appointments in the ordinary sense of the word. I have only to add that I accept the statement of the honourable member for North Sydney that it is not to be taken for granted that because the Committee agree to pass these items they approve of any new appointments, if , as a matter of fact, any new appointments have been made. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - The late Treasurer said he would consult the House before making permanent appointments. The Treasurer will not regard the bringing of this matter before the Committee as equiI n subvalent to consulting the Committee?",75
652,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,No .,75
653,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The r e are certain items which will have to come before us again ?,75
654,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes , on next year's Proposed vote agreed to. Division 31A (Other), £ 1 , 3 1 0 .",75
655,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES, I desire to know if the officers in the Patents Office have been taken from the of the Patents Offices of the States?,75
656,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," In every case where it was possible the.Public Service Commisattensioner selected the officers from Patents Offices in the States. The only exceptions, I think, were in the cases of the examiner in electricity and the examiner in chemistry. As regards the examiner in electricity, the Commissioner considered that Mr Wallach was so superior to any officer in a State Patent Office that he emphatically recommended his appointment.",75
657,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Does the Minister mind stating why the position of examiner in chemistry was ire-advertised?,76
658,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I am advised that the applicants were not considered by the Commissioner to be up to the standard which he wished to establish. He assures me that by re-advertising he will be able to secure a man with the requisite qualifications for the position.,76
659,Mr WILS ON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," I desire to obtain some information with regard to the item of £ 8 on page 16 for refunds of fines in Queensland, and the item of £ 3 , 2 7 1 on page 17, under the head of contingencies, for temporary assistance in Queensland in connection with the Sugar Bounties Act.",76
660,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Some fines, to the amount of £ 8 , were remitted by the previous Minister of Trade and Customs. Newer circumstances had justified the remission of the fines, and we are bound to vote the money. The Public Service Commissioner has laid it down that the cost of inspection and general administration in connection with the Sugar Bounties Act must be charged to the vote for temporary assistance, because the work does not continue all the year round. Naturally, it is at its greatest height during the crushing season. I think that his refusal to put these men on the general establishment of the Public Service is a very wise one, as it enables us to deal with emergency cases. As the Act is to operate for only a limited period, so far as Parliament has yet decided, it would not be a wise thing to load up the Public Service with permanent officers. We have had to lump in there an item of £[3,271 for services in Queensland, where most of the bounties are paid.",76
661,Mr WILS ON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," It has been stated that, under the Sugar Bounties Act, men have been growing sugar with black labour, and drawing money from the Government at. the same time, and I desire to know if there is any foundation for that statement.",76
662,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I can assure the honourable member that, so far as the investigation has gone, in every instance, the people who made the statements have declined to give any information of a definite character, which would enable us to take action. I have taken every possible step to find out 4E any authoritative statement to which we could pin them down. I have instructed the Collector of Customs in Queensland to re-arrange his staff, so as to enable a fuller inspection to be made, and to prevent the Commonwealth from suffering any monetary loss.",76
663,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Is the bounty paid when black men employ white men to do the work?,76
664,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not think it matters what colour the owner is, provided that white labour is employed in the production of sugar cane. I am only saving what I believe to be the law. - Mr DUGALD THOMSON (North Sydney) - I notice, on page 16, some cases of gratuities to widows, and so on, and on page 15, some cases of compensation for loss of office. I do'not know which of these are statutory liabilities, nor do I say for one moment that they are items to be objected to. But I do submit that we do not desire a state of affairs to arise that did occur in a State where these gratuities, at the mere will of the Minister, become often very objectionable items. It was subsequently arranged in that State that the Parliament should approve of the items, and that the Minister should only undertake to put them on the Estimates. I do not know if these have been granted on that condition.",76
665,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Not on that condition. The circumstances are not the same in these cases. I think T shall be able to explain them satisfactorily to the lionorable member.,76
666,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I only wish to avoid the occurrence in the Commonwealth of what has arisen in a State - of a very large sum in the total being given in this way at the mere will of the Minister, and often under political influence, where often the deserving did not get aid and the undeserving did. There is another question which I do not propose to discuss now, as I believe I can deal with it better with the Minister himself. It is the case of some officers in the Sydney Customs House, who were appointed before the Public Service Act came into operation, and most of whom had, I understand, been State officers, and have never been permanently appointed, although they have been employed for over two years. It is now intimated, I am informed, that they are to be removed, and their places filled, not with officers in the Customs House, but with men transferred from a State service. I shall bring the case, however, before the Minister, as I think it involves a large question.",76
667,Mr FISHER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable member already expressed his opinion.,77
668,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Yes ; but the facts with which I am now provided do not bear out that opinion.,77
669,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,With regard to the temporary hands Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I think that the honourable gentleman had better not reply to my remarks until I submit the facts I now have to the Minister.,77
670,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The honourable member can bring the matter before the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Cabinet will then have an opportunity of considering it. With regard to the gratuities, I quite appreciate the danger alluded lo by the honourable member. In the Parliament of New South Wales I have seen the most objectionable differentiations between one case and another, and I have had occasion to complain of the haphazard manner in which gratuities and allowances have been granted. In these cases, however, no such possibilities can arise, because the late Government laid down the rule that they would grant no gratuities outside of their statutory obligations, without the consent of the' State Government which would have to find the money. In each of the cases included in the Estimates, the Premier of the State concerned has been asked whether his Government was agreeable, and has signified .his acceptance of the suggestion. In each instance provision is made only for the continuance of an existing practice.",77
671,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES, I should like to know whether this is the last time that we are to see any mention of the expenses in connection with the Commonwealth celebrations.,77
672,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I should hope so. I queried the item referred to when I saw it. Proposed vote agreed to. Divisions 31B to 37 - (Transferred), 4^3,910; (Other), £ 6 , 7 4 5 .

673,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES, Can the Prime Minister give us a rough statement with regard to the nature of the savings effected in the Defence Department which have enabled him to make greater outlays upon ammunition ?,77
674,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am sorry to say that I cannot give full particulars, because the actual allocation of the money has not yet been determined. In the first place, the amount set down was £ 4 8 , 0 0 0, conditionally upon an equivalent sum being saved on the general military estimates. Towards that saving, £[26,000 has been contributed in this way. Upon page 6 of the works and buildings estimates, it will be seen that £[22,000 is set down for equipment, but the actual expenditure has amounted to only £ 6 , 0 0 6 . Therefore, there has been a saving of, practically, £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 under that head.",77
675,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I doubt the wisdom of that saving.,77
676,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Perhaps so; but I look at the matter as one between the expenditure on rifles and that on equipment; and rifles appear to me to be the more important. Then there is a saving this year of £[5,000 on guns and mountings for Fremantle, and another £ 5 , 0 0 0 has been saved in connection with the arming of the Cerberus. These items bring up the total to £ 2 6 , 0 0 0, and leave a balance of some ,£20,000 odd to be saved on the general military estimates. The Treasurer is assured by the Defence Department that this saving will be made. The officials expect to make up some of the money by refraining from recruiting to the 3 9 extent they otherwise might have done. In this and other ways they hope, by the end of the year, to save, roughly speaking, £[50,000. l 6 8 > Mr MCCAY - That will not a real saving,",77
677,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I admit that. The position is that the late Treasurer has given the Defence Department authority to spend, on rifles and ammunition, practically ^50,000, which otherwise would have been spent in other directions. There is no saving in the true sense, but this year the authorities have refrained from spending money in the directions originally intended, in order that the expenditure upon rifles may be increased.",77
678,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,1 suppose the Prime Minister does not know how much was saved by charging the cadets is. per day whilst they were in camp?,78
679,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I was not aware of that having been done. Proposed vote agreed to. Resolutions reported and adopted. Motion (by Mr WATSON) agreed toThat the Standing Orders be suspended, in order to enable all steps to be taken to obtain Supply, and to pass Supply Bills through all their stages without delay. Resolutions of Ways and Means, covering resolutions of Supplv, adopted. Ordered That Mr WATSON do prepare and bring . Bills to carry out the foregoing resolutions. SUPPLEMENTARY APPROPRIA- TIONBILL 1903-4. Bill presented (by Mr WATSON), and read a first and second time. . In Committee: Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Clause 4Notwithstanding anything contained in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, all foot-notes schedule to the Appropriation Act 1903-4, the schedule to this Act shall be deemed to parts of such Acts.",78
680,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," Surely this not one of the ordinary clauses of a Supply Bill ? Wc all know that in. recent years foot-notes have proved to be matters of some moment, both in Commonwealth and in State history.",78
681,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I am informed that unthan less this clause is retained the Acts Intershould pretation Act will render the foot-notes inapplicable ,78
682,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I think that the Acts In terpretation Act is a better guide in thispriation matter than are the foot-notes. distinctions in questions of this kind is establish a very bad precedent.,78
683,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not think there are apply to the Defence Department. any foot-notes in these Estimates. Mr AfcCAY - Yes , there are; but they are chiefly of an explanatory character. I would further point out that the.effect of travelling this clause would be to partially repeal 4E 2 .J r another Act. In my judgment the Prime Minister had better risk the foot-notes, and allow the present law to remain unaltered. He should rest satisfied with having obtained Supply. There are foot-notes upon pages 33, 30, and 37 which might well be omitted.",78
684,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," If the clause under consideration is rejected, I am informed that trouble may arise with the Auditor-General, and the practice which has been followed in the printing of these Estimates will require to be altered. What are how fool-notes will need to be embodied in the body of the Estimates themselves. The information which is contained in the foot-notes will require to be repeated at every point where it is necessary that it should be given. That will involve considerable extra, cost in printing. As a good compositor, I suppose that I ought to rejoice in the prospect of providing more wo.k for members of my own calling, but the fact remains that the object of introducing foot-notes is to avoid additional in printing. If honourable members will allow the clause to pass on the present occasion, I will promise to go into the whole matter before the general Estimates are prepared, with a view to obviating the repetition con-. sequent upon the practice which has been been followed up to the present time.",78
685,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," I would point out that the clause under consideration not only provides that all foot-notes to to the the schedule to the Appropriation Act, and to 1903-4, and to the schedule to this Act be shall be deemed to be parts of such Acts, but practically effects an alteration in our is Statute law which may have quite unexpected results. I ask the Prime Minister not to press the matter. It is not fair to ask the Commitlee to take a step which he himself admits is of some importance, and which may have more far-reaching effects he at present foresees. Personally, I like to have an opportunity to study the effect of the provision.",78
686,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I have just been look- ing at a number of items in the last ApproAct, and I find that in one page To make alone the rejection of this clause would to mean trebling the space that is occupied by the printing. Especially does my remark Upon page 63 of the Estimates, a foot-note, which is indicated by an asterisk, says Pay includes forage and all allowances, except expenses. Reduction if occupying quarters, as provided by regulations. That foot-note, which is sufficient to fill three lines would have to be repeated seven times in as many items in the Defence Estimates.",78
687,Mr MCCAY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The excision of the clause cannot affect the Auditor-General, unless the foot-notes mean that more payments are to be made than those for which the Estimates provide.",79
688,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Treasury officials are disposed to think that the Auditor General will question our procedure under the Acts Interpretation Act.,79
689,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Nothing should be embodied in a foot-note which that officer can question.,79
690,Mr WATSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I have no desire to press the matter, because I am thoroughly satisfied that if it assumes any importance, honourable members will assist me to pass an indemnifying Act.
