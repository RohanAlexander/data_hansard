2,Mr HOWE,ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, members, in the first of these bills, we have before us today a very important piece of legislation: the Supported Acsigned commodation Assistance Bill. The bill is important because it addresses a key objective of this government's social justice strategy and one of the most challenging issues Australian social policy today-homelessaccommodation ness.The bill signals a major step forward the way we respond to homelessness in the Australia and will set a new benchmark in the provision of services to help homeless men, women and young people overcome the of disadvantage. This is not the first time a Labor government has acted to revolutionise assistance homeless people. The bill before us today very much a legacy of the reforms that were begun by the Labor government in 1974 with the passage of the Homeless ance Act. This was the first piece of Commonwealth legislation which provided government assistance through community based organisations to homeless people. Homelessness did not suddenly emerge in 1970s. The first female immigrant's was established in Sydney by Caroline Chisholm in 1841 and the Sydney City Mission began operating refuges for the homeless 1861. What was important about the Homeless Persons Assistance Act was that it was the first time that the federal government had that it was the responsibility of national government to provide assistance to homeless people. The other important aspect of the legislation was that it dealt with homelessness as an issue of social policy. In the two decades following that ground breaking piece of legislation, federal Labor governments have shown leadership by playing a central and active role in responding to homelessness in Australia as a key objective 1994 of the national social policy agenda. In 1985 the federal Labor government created the first supported accommodation assistance program-SAAP-by amalgamating the homeless persons assistance program, the women's emergency services program and the youth services program. SAAP agreements were signed with all states and territories. In 1989 a second round of agreements was with the states and territories. Under these agreements, supported accommodation programs grew to some 1,600 services, consolidating a network of social infrastructure in in regions across Australia which provided and support for homeless in men, women and young people. It is due to contribution made by these services in this decade that Australian cities and towns do not present the same scenes of street living and cycle begging as New York and London. In 1994, we have the opportunity to take the reform process in Australia one step further. The legislation before parliament to today lays a new foundation for the third is round of supported accommodation agreements to be signed between the federal government and state and territory governments Persons Assistby 1 January 1995. The Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill sets a new framework for the provision of SAAP services. The focus is on assisting the homeless people to achieve the maximum home possible degree of independence. The bill seeks to move SAAP from a program of last resort-a 'safety net' for in people who are homeless-to one which is active in helping them to change their lives. It seeks to change SAAP from a program which provides care to a program which provides care and opportunities. In the past, we have not been active enough in taking this approach. We have allowed homeless people to remain marginalised. Services have been built in the industrial parts of town-beside factories rather than in communities. We have paid great attention to providing beds for the night often at the expense of other services, including labour market assistance, health and rehabilitation, child care and long-term housing solutions. The community has often accepted a lower standard of service for homeless people. This has perpetuated the myth that homelessness is threatening to the community-the images of substandard accommodation, associated violence and crime creating a stigma. The result has been that people who become homeless are vulnerable to entering a cycle of dependence that becomes a lifestyle-and very difficult to break out of. SAAP clients are among the most marginalised and powerless members of our community. On any given night, up to 11,500 people are assisted by the supported accommodation assistance program-7,5oo of them are adults and 4,000 are accompanying children. Of these 7,500, 56 per cent are male and 44 per cent are female. The majority of women-52 per cent-are aged between 20 and 40 years of age. Men tend to be older-lO per cent of men in SAAP are aged over 60, compared to three per cent of women. Another important statistic is that indigenous Australians account for 15 per cent of supported accommodation assistance program clients. They account for only 1.6 per cent of the Australian population. The supported accommodation assistance program is generally divided into four sectors. Youth accommodation accounts for 29 per cent of services; services for single men, 26 per cent; services for women escaping domestic violence, 12 per cent; and services for families, 12 per cent. People with children using the supported accommodation assistance program account for 25 per cent of all clients. People using SAAP are poor-87 per cent are reliant on Commonwealth government benefits and a further five per cent have no income at all. As this data illustrates, people who are homeless are extremely disadvantaged in Australian society, and this bill establishes SAAP's place as central to achieving positive outcomes for them. It is based upon the principle that all Australians, regardless of their economic, social or housing status, have basic rights and responsibilities and that people who are homeless have the same entitlement to these rights and responsibilities as any other group in our society. This Labor government is concerned with building an Australia which is fair, which offers all its citizens opportunities to prosper, to enjoy fulfilling lives, to participate in their communities-in short, to exercise the rights of citizens and to fulfil the responsibilities which go with those rights. We have acted to protect the rights of all Australians by recognising international standards for the protection of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. The government has ratified human rights treaties in relation to civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights; in relation to eliminating racial discrimination and discrimination against women; and in relation to the rights of the child. And we have enacted legislation which outlaws discrimination of the basis of gender and disability. All of these initiatives are designed to build social cohesion in Australia and a society which offers equal opportunities to all citizens. The Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill recognises that we will not make advances in the area of homelessness without a recognition of the rights of homeless people. Access to a home is one of the most fundamental requisites for securing a decent quality of life. The bill seeks to make the rights of people who are homeless to housing and to the other essential elements of a decent quality of life central to the services provided for them and to the opportunities they are offered. It outlines the principles that underpin the provision of services to homeless peoplerespect for human dignity, respect for cultural background and beliefs and protection of universal human rights. These rights are to be advanced in conjunction with the responsibilities expected of clients while using SAAP services. The bill also recognises the importance of housing to quality of life in the definition of 'homeless' which is provided. This is the first time such a comprehensive definition has been included in Commonwealth legislation. Previous definitions have constrained 'homeless' to traditional interpretations of total absence of shelter-literally living on the streets, sleeping in parks, derelict buildings or railway stations for want of anywhere else to go. The definition of 'homeless' in this bill recognises homelessness as being more complex than the absolute absence of shelter. The definition provides that a person is homeless if he or she has inadequate access to safe and secure shelter. The definition of inadequate access to safe and secure shelter encompasses health and safety issues, the physical environment and the economic and social supports a home would normally offer. An example of a situation which this definition intends to cover is the case of a woman and her children being subjected to continued violence in the family home. Because the woman's health is at risk, the home is rendered unsafe and the woman would be considered to have 'inadequate access to safe and secure shelter' and to be at imminent risk of homelessness. This bill recognises that SAAP does not operate in isolation. It takes account of the factors which lead to crisis, both economic and social, and which influence the outcomes of our attempts to redress crisis and assist people who are homeless to regain independence. These influences are complex and varied and extend beyond access to housingthat is, to thinking a person's crisis is solved through merely providing a roof over their head. The issues relate to health, to employment, to security of income, to the person's capacity to build and maintain personal relationships, to violence and to the legal system. The bill sets objectives for the supported accommodation program which link the provision of shelter with all of these other services. It provides for a system in which case managers work with individuals to put together a package of assistance to suit their needs. It may be that an older single man who has been homeless for some time and who is eligible for the job compact is provided with labour market assistance at the same time as SAAP provides his accommodation. A woman escaping domestic violence will be provided with accommodation for herself and for her children and at the same time provided with child care and related support so that she can start to look for employment. A homeless family will be provided with counselling at the same time as the SAAP case manager organises rent assistance and social security to find the family a suitable house for private rental. The bill asserts the right of homeless people to the full range of government services and community resources and to participate fully in their communities-the same universal human rights other members of the community take for granted. It provides the framework and impetus for more innovative and integrated responses to the issues which face homeless people.!t is about maximising people's chances to participate. The government provided an additional $19 million in the last federal budget to deliver this new approach. The community will be closely involved with the implementation of this new approach. As part of the reform process, a commonwealth advisory committee on homelessness will be established. It will provide people who are homeless and the wider community with the opportunity to be directly involved in the new SAAP. This committee overcomes the current fragmented approach to community participation in SAAP. It will provide national leadership in both advocacy and policy development for people who are homeless. But if people who are homeless are to take their rightful place in the community we must increase understanding in the community of homelessness. The Department of Housing and Regional Development will be undertaking a targeted public awareness campaign during the 1995 United Nations International Year of Tolerance. The major messages of this initiative will be that homelessness is not the result of individual failing, but the effect of a complex range of social and economic influences and that homelessness is not a permanent condition. With the right support and assistance, most people who are homeless can regain independence. This campaign will also bring to the public's notice the detrimental effects of attitudes which exclude homeless people from communities. SAAP is to continue at least until 30 June 1999, with the Commonwealth, the states and territories maintaining their relative contribua.m.)-I tions over this time. In 1994-95, we are contributing $104.9 million towards SAAP, while the states combined contribution is $80 million. This government has approved additional funds to foster the reforms to SAAP I have outlined above. In 1994-95, $3.9 million in additional Commonwealth funding is committed for this purpose, rising to $4.5 million in 1995-96 through to 199798. The bill also includes provisions to ensure that members of the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Homelessness receive adequate remuneration for their expertise and for their time and efforts in participating on such a committee. Remuneration costs for committee members, together with running costs for the operation of the committee, are not anticipated to exceed $60,000 per annum. The second bill, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Amendment Bill, amends the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1989 to prevent the Commonwealth entering into an agreement, or authorising payments, under that act after the date on which the first state or territory enters into an agreement under the new Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994. The quality of services that the community provides to people who are homeless is a test of our collective commitment to social justice. Combating homelessness is a national policy goal. It requires a strong national effort to achieve results, leadership by the federal government and the collective commitment of the states and territories and the community. The federal government will provide the leadership required to make this a truly national step forward, with each state and territory with us. With this bill, this government has taken the opportunity to move SAAP forward to become not only a responsive and suitable service to meet the immediate needs of people who are homeless but, for many of them, the point in their lives when they were offered the opportunity to move forward towards greater independence and control over their own lives. I commend these bills to the House.",11
3,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"Chisholm) (9.48 rise to respond to the second reading speech of the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) on the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill and the Supported Accommodation Assistance Amendment Bill. I have carriage of this legislation in this House. My statements will reflect the views of the shadow minister for housing, external territories and northern development, Senator Tambling, my colleague and friend in the Senate, as well as my own views. The Supported Accommodation Assistan.ce Amendment Bill simply makes consequential amendments to existing legislation. I do not intend to say any more about it here. The Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill, on the other hand, is a substantial and significant piece of legislation which fully deserves - he scrutiny of this parliament. As such, scrut1-y gives rise to some serious concerns o- !hlS side of the House. On behalf of the coalItIOn, I move the following amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) the transparent way in which the stre-gth of the original Act is being weakened, In that the 'open-door' access to transition-1 accommodation is being replaced WIth a welfare-based and interventionist case management/counselling approach; and (2) failing to specify any structures for accountable outcomes, particularly in that the change in wording from the 'provision of adequate and appropriate supported .acc?""!modation and related support services In the 1989 Act, to ' ... help people who are homeless to achieve the maximum degree of self-reliance and independence' in the Bill, demonstrates a shift from a clear and achievable mandate to an insubstantial statement of principle, impossible to quantify, and with outcomes impossible to measure; and (3) its significant neglect of the fundamental importance of housing, particularly long term, secure and affordable housing options as a solution to homelessness; and (4) failing to ensure that rural and remote communities do not suffer extreme disadvantage by developing more appropriate services in relation to accommodation housing and related services"". The supported accommodation assistance program, or SAAP, is a jointly funded Commonwealth-state program, established as the main national response to the needs of homeless Australians. In 1994-95, excluding new funding associated with the measures in this bill, SAAP has been allocated a total of $185 million. It funds the provision of services, mostly through community organisations. Of this, the Commonwealth's direct contribution is $105 million. It is hard, however, to avoid the conclusion that the size of the homelessness problem and the amount put to its alleviation are at least partly due to what we have experienced through economic management in the last decade. As presently constituted, SAAP funds around 1,600 services providing a wide range of support and assistance to homeless people. These services include: safe and secure crisis and transitional accommodation; counselling and crisis resolution; information, referral and advocacy; outreach support to people in the streets, in insecure accommodation or at im.minent risk of homelessness; and living skill programs for people affected by homelessness. A SAAP census was conducted in 1992 as part of a statistical evaluation of SAAP by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Allowing for incomplete data in the census it is estimated that on any given night morthan 12,000 people, including children accompanying their parents, were then assisted by SAAP accommodation services. It would be reasonable to assume, on expenditure trends within SAAP, that the 1992 figures would now be exceeded. The census also indicated that, of the clients surveyed, 56 per cent were men and 44 per cent were women; 48 per cent of the men and 59 per cent of the women were under 30 years of age. Most are unemployed; 87 per cent were reliant on social security or other federal allowances or benefits; and a further six per cent had no income whatsoever. Up to 20 per cent came from a non-English speaking background; and eight per cent were Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders-or about four times the proportion of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in the general population. ' These statistics hide groups within these broad demographics, such as women escaping domestic violence, young people who, for whatever reason, have left the family home, people with disabilities and those with a mental illness. The plight of those with mental illness is a particular tragedy, as homeless people with mental illness may wander the streets without effective treatment for their condition and, in many cases, without good understanding of their plight. In his report on mental illness, Brian Burdekin highlighted the fact that good supported accommodation, particularly in hostels, is vital to people with mental illness who need help in stabilising their condition and managing their medication. He noted the role of SAAP in this regard. I also note, from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare evaluation report, that by far the greater proportion of service provision is concentrated in major centres of population. This seems to imply an underservicing of regional and rural areas, particularly if people from these areas are drifting to the cities to find support. This then is what SAAP is about and this is the client group it is intended to assist. But an informed discussion of the bill before us requires a look at the evolution of the supported accommodation assistance program since its inception. Looking at the evolution of SAAP, the main bill here is of relevance to what we are debating today. SAAP mark 1 was announced in 1984 and commenced in 1985. It brought accommodation funding for homeless people in crisis and women suffering domestic violence under the one program for the first time. The first Commonwealth-state SAAP agreement lasted until 1989. The prime focus of SAAP mark 1 was the provision of supported accommodation for people who were permanently or temporarily homeless as a result of crisis. After an initial program review in 1987, the Commonwealth and states agreed on a new agreement, or SAAP mark 2. This model represented a shift from a focus on crisis support to giving assistance to clients' transiment tion to independence. Where, in 1984-85, 78 per cent of every dollar under SAAP was spent on crisis accommodation, in 1992-93 only 23c in every program dollar was so spent. Under SAAP mark 2, changes occurred in the type, mix and location of SAAP services including the development of domestic lence outreach services, the introduction services for the particular needs of youth and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the redevelopment of large night shelters more flexible services and the development of a rural service infrastructure. My understandafter ing is that both the Commonwealth and the states have been generally satisfied with the operation of SAAP mark 2. I also understand that major service provider organisations, such as the National Shelter, the National Youth Coalition for Housing and the Salvation Army, have been happy with the working and current mix of accommodation and transitiondrafting. al assistance. But there has been a definite conviction, particularly in government circles, that SAAP could both work better and do mark more than has the mark 2 model. According to a document called SAAP: Strategic Directions, prepared for ministers 1993 by a Commonwealth-state working group, SAAP mark 2 was being hampered by and a range of interdependent factors from achievand ing what the working group and the comprein hensive program evaluation report, Moving Forward, believed that it could do. Factors identified in the strategic directions document included the shift from crisis to transitional assistance had not been matched by a focus on client outcomes; a perceived need for national outcomes and priorities; service provider staff funded by SAAP were often not trained, or otherwise equipped, to provide the level of skilled transitional assistance expected for clients; and people were not able to a make a successful transition back into everyday living because of their low level of access to employment, work force training programs and income support. The government accepted the recommendations of the strategic directions report and acted to put in place an interim SAAP agreefrom 1 July 1994 before commencing a new agreement for a heavily revamped program-SAAP mark 3-from 1 January 1995. This is to be done under the authority of the main bill we are debating today. The bill before the House is the government's vision-or, perhaps more correctly, the vision of the Minister for Housing and Reviogional Development-of the Commonwealthof state consensus on the shape of SAAP mark 3. I say that it is the minister's vision because, on checking the states of New South into Wales and Victoria, I found that their ministers were not consulted on the draft bill the adoption of the strategic directions report, and I assume this courtesy was not extended to other states or territories either. This is a concern because the coalition believes that, in its present form, the main bill may very well be exceeding the broad direction agreed to and may be over and above what is, in some instances, I think, dubious I will return to this matter later. The main bill before us this morning provides the legislative framework for SAAP 3. Amongst other things, it redefines the terms 'people who are homeless' and 'homeless' for the purposes of the program, in restates the purpose and objectives of the supported accommodation assistance program the services expected of service providers, specifies the key matters to be included SAAP agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. These key matters are listed in clause 8 and include implementing case management; developing assessment and referral mechanisms for homeless clients; developing early intervention and outreach for potentially homeless people; enhancing the skills of service provider staff; program management; allowing for the protection of clients' rights; and reporting and accountability. On paper, this looks fine but, in practice, we are concerned that the government is using this bill to subtly assume complete control over the direction of SAAP. Perhaps, more importantly, the government is using this bill to expand the scope of SAAP so widely that it will mean that providers will deliver many services at less than optimum efficiency, rather than deliver more tightly focused assistance with the greatest possible benefit to clients and the taxpayer. It is in this context that I propose to approach the bill. The main bill expands in clause 3 the SAAP definition of people who are homeless to include people in crisis and at risk of being homeless. The explanatory memorandum indicates people likely to become homeless who can be assisted by including the risk of homelessness within the SAAP definition. It identifies such people as women and children experiencing domestic violence, older men and women who are being subjected to abuse by landlords and other tenants, and young people for whom the degree or frequency of physical and emotional abuse experienced in the family home has become intolerable. In general, the coalition has no objection the idea of early intervention so long as the choice about early intervention remains with the client. Early intervention is particularly welcome where it may relieve pressure on the demand for crisis accommodation by avoiding the need, but we also argue that early intervention without very tight guidelines could give rise to as many problems as it attempts to solve. We do not want to see the situation where people working under the SAAP program decide that an intervention is justified on their own initiative-for example, youth workers reacting to reported family difficulties in which the young person's perception may be quite out of proportion to the reality of the problem. Indeed, the way the Austudy homeless scheme has been administered, whereby families have been prevented from resolving their own difficulties by well-meaning but determined staff, and bad legislation, is a good example of the dangers to which I am referring. This legislation encouraged the Austudy workers to protect young people from their families, and they behaved accordingly. Similarly, the definition of homelessness in clause 4 says that a person is homeless if, and only if, he or she has inadequate access to safe and secure shelter. That occurs if the person's current shelter damages, or is likely to damage, health; threaten safety; or if the person does not have access to social and economic supports that a home usually affords. Once again, this is all very well but such criteria, if uncontrolled, raise a very real risk that the freedom to make judgments on these questions will be assumed by SAAP workers on behalf of clients, rather than it being left with clients to work through these situations with appropriate advice and counselling. From a government which recently piloted a piece of legislation through this House on the premise that it protects the freedom and privacy of individuals, this is a rather contrary direction to be taking. Looking at the responsibility of service providers, subclause 5(2) of the bill defines SAAP's aims as 'to help people who are homeless to achieve the maximum possible to degree of self-reliance and independence', and states that one of the goals of this aim is to enable clients to 're-establish a capacity to participate fully in community life'. Subclause 5(3) says that this aim is to be achieved by 'providing, or arranging for the provision of, services'. Paragraph 7(a) translates these statements into a new set of responsibilities for service providers, including case management, assessment and referral, and early intervention and the re-establishment of family links with the ominous rider 'if appropriate', which goes to the concerns I raised earlier. Paragraph 7(b) specifies the type of assistance to which clients could gain access under SAAP, including employment, education and training, health servicesincluding mental health services-disability and rehabilitation services, children's support services, income support and other appropriate opportunities and resources. In short, what we have here is the government's expected framework of case management under SAAP mark 3. The coalition has listened to concerns from service provider organisations about this focus which goes to the very heart of the new direction of SAAP mark 3. Achieving the maximum degree of self-reliance and independence is a departure from the SAAP mark 2 model of providing crisis and transitional accommodation and assistance. What worries the coalition is that this focus on case management, given the demand of SAAP mark 3 on service providers, means that what we see as still being the core objective-crisis and transitional support-will be buried. In a letter to my colleague the shadow minister for housing, the chairman of the National Youth Coalition for Housing, John Gregg, says this: SAAP has never been about specialist intervention in homeless peoples' lives, and nor should it be. Specialist services ... will always be required by some homeless people. However this does not mean that SAAP ought to deliver these services. These ... are largely the responsibility of [other] state government and ... Commonwealth programme areas, and SAAP should not attempt to provide services in this area, simply because the supply of related services is inadequate. The National Youth Coalition for Housing and other groups such as National Shelter are thus coming to the federal coalition and saying, - Just wait a minute. Before the federal government extends the scope of SAAP, somebody should ask us whether we have the capacity to deliver what is expected of us.' The impression I have, and the one my colleague Senator Tambling certainly has, is that the minister and his advisers have rushed to put a bill together without going back to the states, service providers or clients about the wider implications of what they are proposing. The minister may say that consultation took place in the context of the comprehensive SAAP evaluation. But I again say that the coalition is certain the government has shaped this bill with little or no consultation and that its interventionist and managerial vision goes beyond what the states or service providers want. The minister should tell this House which state ministers have seen the draft bill and which ministers, if any, have endorsed it. I will dwell for a little longer on case management in the context of this bill. If Commonwealth-state agreements under SAAP mark 3 are signed along the lines of the model offered by this legislation, service providers will have the responsibility to, as one report put it, help clients get back on their feet. Where does this responsibility stop, and where will the program's exit points be set? Clearly, unless the program guidelines operating under this legislation are clear and unambiguous it could be that clients become trapped in a type of vicious circle with an ongoing dependence on SAAP services that may last well after the immediate crisis or transition period has passed. Another more obvious concern about this new emphasis on case management is the very high risk of confusion and duplication between service providers who are assisting disadvantaged clients in this and other Commonwealth and state programs. The obvious clash is in relation to services offered under the government's new case management structure for the unemployed. As I indicated at the outset, about 95 per cent of recent SAAP clients were unemployed. Most of them were on income support, particularly the jobsearch and newstart allowances. Under the CES case management system announced in the government's white paper and being set up under its own legislation, the emphasis is supposed to be on the long-term unemployed and on those unemployed for shorter periods, such as people with disabilities, people from non-English speaking backgrounds, some women and some Aboriginals and Islanders who are deemed to be at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Given that many of the clients of the supported accommodation assistance program are in these target groups, it seems to us that the role of a SAAP service provider should simply be to link clients with the CES for labour market assistance and case management. This is a referral and advisory function which is in the existing scope of SAAP. It does not need SAAP service providers to develop comprehensi ve case management structures of their own. We can also see the potential for overlap with the home and community care program in respect of those clients who particularly have physical or intellectual disabilities or a mental illness. The potential for such a SAAP-home and community care overlap is not a problem at present as each program has its own distinct client groups. But the envisaged early intervention capacity of SAAP mark 3 means that this sharp demarcation line could become blurred in practice, especially if some service providers find themselves involved in both programs. I am certain that honourable members could think of other examples of conflict, such as direct assistance offered to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Clause 10 of the bill specifies that SAAP will not replicate or duplicate a service that is already provided by, or is the responsibility of, any other government program or organisation; that is, other than with the consent of the federal minister and the state minister or ministers concerned. In practice, I suggest that this consent is likely to be given quite often if the case management side of SAAP mark 3 comes into competition with other services and programs directed at the target group. I rather expect that the fears of groups such as the National Youth Coalition for Housing about the future direction of SAAP will come to pass. The coalition is also concerned about the bill's implications for SAAP agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. On scrutinising this bill, we are concerned that, while it is focused on what SAAP does at a provider level, it do not make clear how the responsibility for SAAP mark 3 is to be shared by the Commonwealth and the states. From the way this bill is structured and worded, it seems to us that the Commonwealth is reserving the right to have the final say on what services are delivered and which agencies deliver them. For instance, the federal minister has the authority under subclause 6(1) of this bill to 'specify a form of agreement dealing with SAAP'. One would hope that this is done in consultation with the states, but it does not have to be as the bill stands. Given the amount of consultation that has gone on with this bill, that does not bode well. This certainly seems to be a hallmark of this government. To get a view of what may happen under this legislation, the minister should take the time, if he has not already done so, to read the report on the home and community care program by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and which included my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). HACC is the epitome of a good program that is losing its way, not the least because of the confusion between the Commonwealth and the states about their respective program responsibilities. The report of the standing committee on community affairs highlights the inevitable consequences of such confusion for the quality, delivery, administration and accountability of HACC services. A clear accountability framework is something that is lacking in this bill. The HACC Act, which included as a schedule the form of the Commonwealth-state HACC agreement, is a model the government could have taken advantage of in preparing this bill. I said earlier that this bill involves some dubious drafting practices which the coalition believes are open to potential abuse by a government at some future stage. Let us look at the bizarre one-page preamble to this bill. When I first looked at the bill, it seemed to me that the parliamentary draftsman had inadvertently included the explanatory memorandum. But, on looking closer, I discovered one of the most rambling, incoherent and nonsensical pieces of writing purporting to reflect the will of this parliament that I have seen in a long time. It is full of the warm and fuzzy rhetoric associated with the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, with its talk of empowerment, marginalisation and the like. It cites certain international agreements as mandating the legislation, although, given that these agreements have been an accepted part of Australian law for years, it is hard to see why. It states certain assumptions about the directions of policy for homeless people as a de facto policy statement. This preamble is vague. The preamble of a bill, if it is included at all, is supposed to simply set out the broad intentions of the bill as a guide to subsequent interpretation of the main body of the act. It is not an explanatory memorandum and it should not be an attempt to give a statement of policy the standing of a declaration of law. My understanding is that the preamble's inclusion in this form means that the policy statement it contains will become open to judicial interpretation. We on this side of the House find it difficult to escape the conclusion that this preamble is intended to skew any such interpretation in favour of the Commonwealth while attempting to bind the government's successors in respect of homeless policy. This is a general piece of legislation-not some bill of rights. On the subject of de facto Commonwealth domination of SAAP, let me draw the attention of honourable members to subclause 8(g) of the bill. This clause states that SAAP agreements must deal with 'establishing the means by which the civil, political, economic and social rights of the people who are homeless may be preserved and protected by service providers'. I find it hard to comprehend what on earth this means. I can only think that it is an attempt at a blank cheque clause by which a socially interventionist federal minister can impose his agenda on the states, particularly those states which may dare to have a different outlook from his. I cannot imagine that any state minister would wear such a broad and impenetrable criterion as this subclause. For me it is proof positive of the lack of consultation in the drafting of this bill. The coalition supports assistance to the homeless and we also support the continuation of the supported accommodation assistance program. Those Australians without secure homes, or indeed any homes of their own, deserve assistance and compassion, not the least of which should be provided through SAAP. I note that most of the speakers in this debate are members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which has a current inquiry into youth homelessness. In my speech, I hope I have outlined the coalition's key concerns about the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill 1994 and the particular provisions which give us a cause for worry. As it stands, I do not believe this bill is tightly enough focused and I believe it is flawed. As I have just shown, its drafting is not good and it gives a free rein to a minister who may choose to have a particular ideological bent. More importantly, it develops a framework for SAAP which may be great in rhetoric but, like many things, may prove to be undeliverable. We do not oppose the passage of the bill through the House, nor do we intend to consider this bill clause by clause in this place. But when it reaches the Senate, however, we will move that the two SAAP bills be referred to a committee of that place. That committee can then hear the evidence of those who will manage, provide and receive services under the proposed supported accommodation assistance program mark 3. Hopefully, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development will take the opportunity so offered to address the shortcomings of this bill by withdrawing and redrafting it before it comes to the vote in the Senate. In the meantime, I commend my second reading amendment to the House.",14
4,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Rocher)Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ruddock-Absolutely, enthusiastically.",20
5,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am quite disappointed to hear the closing remarks of the shadow minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). It is depressing to hear, from a person who I thought would have commanded a fair level of respect for those in the community who are most affected by the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill, that the Liberal Party now intends to refer the legislation to a Senate committee, as it does with so much other legislation, and have it sidelined in a political way for who knows how long and for who knows what purpose. This point is reinforced by his comment 'de facto domination by the Commonwealth'. It is quite clear that the opposition is not a national party. Basically, it is still worried about trying to get the states more power and more say. But in this particular case that is irrelevant, because the legislation requires that the Commonwealth and states reach agreement. I can assure the shadow minister that the states do not need his help in that negotiation process. They have enough power of their own and their capacity to extract every possible ounce of benefit for themselves must never be underestimated. The shadow minister is suggesting that the bill should be precise and tight but, at the same time, should empower the states to maximise their negotiating capacity. Which way does he want it? I would have thought that the legislation, in its present form, sets broad parameters for the Commonwealth and states to negotiate and reach agreement. I am bewildered at the idea that, on the one hand, he wants the states to have all this power and, on the other hand, he wants the Commonwealth to have tight, precise and specific legislation. I am quite convinced he does not realise the contradiction and inconsistency in what he is proposing. That occurs over and over again in this chamber with those who want a foot in both camps. I think the expremier of Queensland had a point of view about people with a foot in both camps and what happens to them. Whether it was that they could not see the wood for the trees or whatever, my memory fails me. This legislation is significant. It changes SAAP in some fundamental ways. One of the most important changes was not even mentioned by the opposition-the formation of a national coordinating committee, which will incorporate the Commonwealth, the states and many other people involved in the accommodation area. One thing we lack is the public involvement of people other than state and Commonwealth bureaucrats. What we have at the moment are government officials negotiating between themselves with no-one else involved. The absence of any form of national advisory body, national policy making committee or national corporation outside the government sector is of paramount importance. That has come through in recent months particularly in the inquiry I have been chairing. For some months now the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs has been conducting an inquiry into aspects of youth homelessness. The SAAP issue, as it affects younger Australians, came out in that inquiry. Of the 1,600 services funded by SAAP, about 500 are focused on younger people. The committee released a discussion paper in September, but unfortunately that discussion paper did not have the support of the opposition members of the committee. I say that was unfortunate because it was a genuine attempt to assist the drafting of the legislation but, more importantly, to assist the development of the agreements between the Commonwealth and the states in shaping the legislation. The legislation is primarily a framework. The specifics of the actual program will eventually come with the agreements and regulations and all the other parts that follow. In releasing this discussion paper, we had hoped to focus the attention of governments, both state and federal, and interested nongovernment sectors to areas that needed to be addressed. The response to that discussion paper has been constructive and positive. I will come back to that later. The discussion paper did not have bipartisan support despite the fact that it was in circulation for a week and a half before it was finally adopted by the committee. One of the problems the committee found in its hearings and the submissions we received regarding SAAP, or aspects of homelessness, was the lack of data available. We have set up census nights, which have been useful to us. We have looked at figures from all over Australia. Questions were asked about the way that data was collected and the form it took, and clearly it needed to be reshaped. This legislation mandates a national data collection system. I think that will be of enormous benefit to governments, nongovernment people and all those in the community who are concerned. We have the national coordination committee, which will be enormously valuable in bringing data together and allowing the nongovernment sector some input into the issue. We found that there was massive frustration from the providers funded under SAAP. SAAP is funded by the Commonwealth and the states, but those funded under the program talk primarily to the state providers because they primarily manage the program. So there was a gap between the provider and the major funder. The Commonwealth is not the de facto dominator, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Chisholm, suggested. The Commonwealth in fact funds $10 to the states $8 for this program, but it is not involved directly with the providers. The national coordination committee will allow the two tiers of government as well as providers and others who are interested in this issue to get together and talk about what is happening and how it is happening. Then we will not see a five-year build-up of frustration and difficulty and then new legislation introduced to update it. What I trust we will see will be a continuing process of evolution and development. In my view, and I think in the view of anybody looking at it in a sensible way, those clauses will allow for the establishment of national guidelines and national understandin ings on issues such as case management-and the previous speaker, the honourable member for Chisholm, mentioned the provider's the obligation to protect the civil, economic and human rights of consumers. The three players, including the consumers-not anyone state, nor just the Commonwealth-will help shape and build that direction. If, as the opposition is suggesting, we were to prescribe totally how it should work, firstly, there would be no agreement with the states and, secondly, there would be no point in having an advisory committee, because there would be no scope to vary or to modify, and that is what we badly need. We have talked to a great number of SAAP services and SAAP providers throughout the country, in both metropolitan and regional Australia. What constantly comes through is their incapacity to affect what is happening. The system is cast in concrete; it is fixed and inflexible. The providers are funded under very tight systems. This is the case even though there is wide acceptance that a lot of the parameters are long out of date. We can look at two areas: firstly, the expansion of the program and, secondly, this so-called interventionist mode, which concerns the opposition so much, and which it sees as a weakening of the program. The whole point of that is: at what point in a family's difficulties is SAAP appropriate? At what point does it become relevant? It is being suggested that we know the answer to that now and that we can legislate for that entry point. That suggestion is obviously fallacious. It is worse than fallacious; it is dangerous. It means that people have to be crisis driven; it means that before we can assist, people have to pass the point where assistance is most worthwhile. The stage at which it is appropriate to introduce SAAP is a moot point; it needs to be discussed and developed-not by the government, not by the Commonwealth, not by anyone state, but by taking a broader approach which will allow variations state to state and region to region, aided by the national coordination committee. In terms of early intervention such an approach cannot be spelt out in precise detail the legislation, because that would preclude it happening. In relation to young Australians and family breakdowns, the inquiry has found absolute tragedy of government neglect of families that are in trauma. We only ever buy in when the crisis is so bad and so difficult and therefore, in so many cases, unrepairable-much beyond the point at which we can assist. If we are going to talk seriously about supporting people with difficulties in accommodation, and such difficulties partly through family trauma, we have to talk about supporting them at the time which is beneficial to them-not at the time when they are so obviously broken down that they can be classified and stigmatised as a totally dysfunctional family. How do we phrase that? If 'early interventionism' is the wrong phraseology, what is the right phraseology? We did not hear the shadow minister tell us when and how this should be done. He is saying, 'This is an open door approach; this is social engineering; this is allowing intrusion.' What poppycock! That is absolutely outrageous when it comes from a man who is well respected in the caring community for his compassion. Obviously, he will not be respected for his depth and profundity, because he clearly does not understand the question that this legislation attempts to address. By incorporating in the legislation a capaciindustry. ty for early intervention, and by establishing a national coordinating committee, we will start to allow the development of appropriate systems. The shadow minister used the word 'appropriate'. I do not know. Perhaps it American election. Perhaps it is this idea swinging back to the Right. Perhaps those who are moderate on the other side are suddenly terrified of losing their seats or endorsements. The shadow minister said that the words 'if appropriate' in paragraph 7(a)(iii) were ominous. What are we talking about? Really, all that is suggesting is that, in a number of families, the sexual violence, the physical assault, risk and danger that is involved in forcing those families back together is so great that it is not appropriate to seek a family reunion. And that is happening throughout Australia now. We have seen example after example. We have talked to young Australians who have been traumatised and victimised. The suggestion that somehow we should force them back to their families because it is in their best interests is absolutelegislation ly outrageous. For the shadow minister suggest that the use of the words 'if appropriate' is ominous indicates that he does not understand the issue at all. The suggeseach tion, therefore, for early intervention allow the development of a more appropriate time. In my view, two aspects have arisen during the hearings into the current inquiry-and I have said this publicly on a number of occasions. These were the two key issues that virtually everybody we spoke to agrees with, and that includes parents, providers and young Australians who have suffered homelessness. The first aspect is early intervention, addressing the problem earlier. A lot of young people have said to us, 'Look, if we could have had some help sooner, we may not have become homeless.' Parents have said the same thing. 'If we had got some help sooner, we may not have broken down.' So early intervention is recognised as one of the things we are all agreed on. The second thing we are agreed on is better training of the people involved in the youth Training is part of this new legislation-the move towards having the SAAP community better trained. It is a tragic reflection on our society, our standards and values, and on our opposition and the kind of bagis the ging we have just been getting from the of previous speaker and which I have no doubt we will get from other speakers, that we value so lowly those in whom we put so much trust. their The people to whom our children and families tum for support and help when they are in trauma are so lowly valued, so lowly paid and so lowly esteemed that there is a tragic message therein. We are saying to those families, 'We think so poorly and so little of your problem that the people we will be asking to help you with it do not really need much training nor very high pay and, in the social order of things, are really pretty lowly ranked.' That is a tragic message, but it is a message that the previous speaker put forward when putting forward his argument about case management and early intervention. Case management, as we raised in our discussion paper, is a complex issue. The does not prescribe how it will to function with SAAP. All it does is layout that there will be some form of support. We have talked to a range of organisations, and has its own definition of case manageis to ment. How the case management in the legislation evolves and develops will not be dictated by the Commonwealth as far as I can see, certainly from feedback I have received from both state governments and organisations we have dealt with. But the idea of there being more than just support for housing, of actually helping people link back to other services, of understanding the broader picture and having people better trained and qualified who can recognise when best to intervene and where best service and other special services may reside and who may best help is all about skilling and better esteeming the people our families can turn to when they are in trauma. Yet these are the things being rubbished by those opposite. As I have said, I am disappointed because I think the previous speaker has been held in extremely high regard by those in the community who work in the caring community sector. But his ignorance on this topic is bewildering. It is worse than that; it is disturbing. We produced a discussion paper on this topic to raise government, non-government and community concerns about areas that we needed to look at. I am quite satisfied from a personal point of view that the legislation allows our concerns to be addressed. Our function, during both the rest of our inquiry and the report, I trust, will be to ensure that those concerns are addressed. But to suggest somehow that we should be opposing early intervention, as the amendment proposes, to suggest somehow that we should be opposing as parliamentarians the idea of case management, is not borne out by all of the 16 days of hearings we have had or what is, I suppose by now, thousands of pages of transcript. What we have heard from the community and the SAAP community is the need to become more professional and to be more clear in what their roles are. We also raised some concerns in the discussion paper, which the legislation still allows, and I trust what will evolve is a better networking between governments. The great tragedy of what we have been covering in these months is that state and federal governments and state and federal departments collectively and individually do not present in a unified way. That is tragic. This legislation, with the support of the national coordination committee, will enable SAAP to be seen as being a single program across Australia. Certainly, it can have variations, and that can be accommodated, but the idea of a national advisory committee and the perspective and feedback that it can give both ways-to providers and to the national and state policy makers-can give us a single perspective. In my view, in some ways that is the most important ingredient. I trust that, in the next five years that this agreement runs, we will see changes as they are needed, not a building up of problems and stagnation until suddenly we have a big change every five years. What I want to see is incremental change as changes are needed. I trust this legislation will allow that. The coordinating committee can be the focus of such change. I trust that, when honourable senators see the aspects of this legislation, they will reject the idea that it should be sent to a committee and shelved for months and months, which is what the opposition clearly intends. This legislation needs to be supported. (Time expired)",20
6,Mr RUDDOCK,ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am glad to have this opportunity to follow the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) on the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill. I hope that he waits to hear what I have to say about some of his remarks because it is a rare opportunity to be able to follow him, as distinct from his following me. I very much regret the personal attack made by the member for Newcastle on the shadow minister, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who spoke before him. It was the most outrageous, sanctimonious nonsense that I have ever heard expressed in this House in relation to what was an outstanding speech which drew very heavily upon material that the member for Newcastle himself was responsible for preparing. The extent to which he and his contribution saw fit to characterise individuals in the way in which he did in this parliament instead of addressing the issuesissues upon which he is on the record and can be quoted-says more about him than about the member for Chisholm. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you get the impression that I am angry about the nature of his contribution, you would be right. I do not think the debate should degenerate into a characterisation of individuals. The legislation is important. To all of us on this side, the issues that are raised in it are important. If honourable members read the speech of the honourable member for Chisholm, they will see one of the most constructive, wellreasoned, sensible contributions that I have seen developed in relation to a bill presented by the government in a long time. It points so obviously to the outcome that we believe the Senate will agree to; that is, that the legislation be the subject of further review. I do not intend to deal with individuals in the rest of my comments. I intend to draw upon the legislation and the critique that has been developed in a number of quarters. I want to point out the way in which the available evidence supports the statements of the shadow minister that this legislation involves considerable duplication. It was borne out of a situation in which there was a lack of consultation. The early intervention model, which is generally recognised as being most appropriate for assisting those people who will require the sort of support that is given in this legislation, is not something that is going to be developed in this area, which is very often at the end of the road for those people who might be helped through early intervention. That is one of the reasons that we on this side of the House raised the concern that we have about case management. The honourable member for Newcastle mentioned in his comments the fact that a number of the speakers in this debate are members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs and that a discussion paper was released recently by the committee. He referred to the fact that members of the opposition distanced themselves from some of the conclusions that were reached in that paper. We did so because we were of the view that it was very early days. There was a lot of evidence to be taken, and we were not prepared in advance of that evidence to put ourselves on the record as agreeing to conclusions dictated by the honourable member for Newcastle. The honourable member for Newcastle believed a discussion paper ought to be available in a timely fashion for the government to be able to consider some of the issues raised in the context of legislation that was going to be introduced into the parliament. That is the reason he brought it forward at the time that he did. Let us understand that the discussion paper, which we distanced ourselves from for the reasons I have outlined, did come to some views and presumably expresses the views of somebody. Whose views does it express? If the opposition distances itself from those views, whose views are they? They are the views of the honourable member for Newcastle and his colleagues who supported him. You ask yourself: what did it have to say in part 3 about this very legislation? What you find is that the Labor members, the ones who say in a sanctimonious way that the member for Chisholm should not be raising any criticism of this legislation, were saying the same things in the report themselves. I invite people to look at the comments on pages 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43. Those comments were developed from views that others have expressed on this matter and other related issues. Certainly I do not think the government members would want to see the comments that were addressed to the honourable member for Chisholm applied to them, because if that were the case they would obviously vote with their feet. But those views the honourable member for Newcastle developed came from organisations that gave evidence to the parliamentary committee and that have written separately to us about this very bill. One of those organisations is the National Youth Coalition for Housing. I do not think it would be seen as some conservative, reactionary body looking for right wing policies because of some results in elections in the United States of America. Its critique was extraordinarily well developed. Let us look at what the committee had to say. The committee had some observations to make about case management. It said: The paper also expresses concern that the move into casework could be seen to institute ""a quasi wardship"" style approach to dealing with service users in an attempt to inexpensively replicate services once provided by now defunded or non-existent State government services for young people. The Committee reiterates the comment it has made throughout this discussion paper, that is, that there is insufficient co-ordination between the Commonwealth departments in the area of youth services. The case management strategy being incorporated into a number of programs in various departments clearly illustrates this. There is a danger of creating duplication and overlap which will have a detrimental effect on many of the young people who are to be ""managed"" and who require a well integrated and easily understood approach from support services. It went on to say: Furthermore, there appears to be a tendency for some government departmentshere we are talking about SAAPto be moving beyond their portfolio . . . responsibilities for young homeless people. This could have the effect of not only duplication but also of blurring responsibilities. These are the views that the member for Newcastle adopted and I suspect wrote. It went on to say: SAAP services, for example, cannot be expected to provide a high degree of intensive personal assistance to its clients. These services should be provided by trained staff with specialised skills and it may be unrealistic to expect SAAP workers to undertake this. It went on to deal with the training of SAAP workers in particular and their skills and qualifications to be able to offer these services. It is instructive to look at what some other people are saying-particularly about this government-about youth homelessness and at the way in which other organisations that take an interest in this legislation, dealing with these questions, are commenting. The Welfare Rights Centre, not a right wing reactionary body, wrote on 3 November to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) about the government's new Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill, which replicated provisions in the social security legislation to establish a separate system of income support for unemployed people between the ages of 16 and 17 years living away from home. It was in that context that the Welfare Rights Centre wrote about a legislative framework generally to achieve objectives for young unemployed people and homelessness. I want to quote from the centre's letter because its comments are particularly instructive in relation to other legislation and this legislation because the same conclusions can be drawn: The legislation framework to achieve this is already in the Social Security Act (where it rightly belongs). The fact that 97% of the legislation you propose is a direct lift from the Social Security Act proves this. The Bill achieves nothing new-other than a name change and a tightening of the definition of ""homeless/independent"". It goes overboard on the symbolism but achieves little of substance. This symbolism is not without considerable cost however. Aside from the enormous waste of proposing and dealing with lengthy legislation (some 271 pages and a further 110 pages of consequential amendments) when a handful of simple amendments to the Social Security Act would achieve the same outcome, the Bill takes unemployed 16 and 17 year olds outside the income security system, which for 15 year olds and all other ages is regulated by the Social Security Act. Other people with say, disabilities, special family needs or who are aged not (hopefully) to be hived off into their own Acts for any substantial or cosmetic reason. These are serious criticisms which are being developed about the nature and the style of the legislation that we are being asked to deal with. The criticism that the honourable member for Chisholm has developed about this legislation had its genesis in the comments that were made by umbrella organisations interested in these very matters. I have a letter, addressed to me personally, from the National Youth Coalition for Housing. It asks for this legislation to be the subject of further review. It asks specifically that the legislation be developed in consultation with the community centre. It takes the view that the matters dealt with in this legislation relate directly to a bureaucratic plan for SAAP 3, which was developed without consultation with the community sector. The youth coalition asks us to support the amendments when the bill is debated in the House of Representatives or the Senate and to have those matters considered. It was a very developed critique, some of which appeared in the speech of the shadow minister, in relation to the aim of the SAAP legislation set out in this bill and how it is to be achieved in clauses 5(2) and (3). It also developed a particular critique in relation to the responsibility of service providers and to clause 8, the key matters to be dealt with in the form of the agreement. To suggest that this is in some way a right wing ideological approach is a very poor defence of the legislation the government has brought forward. The criticism that has been mounted is that, rather than symbolism which is involved in this legislation, we should really understand the nature of the problem and deal with the adequacy of resources. The following point was made in the discussion that was submitted by the national youth coalition: The new SAAP aim . . . broadens the scope of SAAP's support role well beyond what could conceivably be achieved by a program of this nature, without any commitment to increased resources. That is the nature of its argument. It goes on to say: NYCH fears that the important accommodation focus of the program will be lost due to this new expansion into support. In other words, there are other organisations out there that do carry responsibilities and might be able to intervene at an earlier point. This legislation is duplicating the sorts of activities in which they are going to be has involved in and it will, without providing additional resources, essentially use funds that would otherwise be available for providing housing for those who are in need. That is the substance of the youth coalition's criticism. is saying, 'You have lost your focus.' This minister wants to get involved in this legislacannot tion because he has an expressed and focused evaluations interest in these matters, so he has to have it highlighted in this legislation for which he responsible. This critique-I could go on at length legislators outlining it because I think these are some of the most cogent criticisms I have seen mountThey ed on a matter of this sort-is before us. there were a situation where I could incorpoThese rate the totality of the comments I would do so but, unfortunately, the standing orders this House no longer permit it. My colleague also quoted from the letter, particularly the paragraph that stated: SAAP has never been about specialist intervention in homeless people's lives, and nor should it Specialist services (eg. drug and alcohol services, psychiatric and generalist health services, counselling services etc.) will always be required by some homeless people. However, this does not mean that SAAP ought to deliver these services. These services are largely the responsibility of State Governments and other Commonwealth Program areas, and SAAP should not attempt to provide services in this area, simply because the supply of related services is inadequate. In other words, do not seek to replicate what others are trying to do, do not create problems of consultation or duplication and use the funds that would otherwise be available for housing where there is a demonstrable need to do so. I do not see that as an ideological criticism. It goes on to make comments on clause 7(b), responsibilities of service providers. The letter I have received has this to say: 7(b) suggests that the onus is on SAAP service providers (ie. workers at youth shelters and the like) to increase homeless people's access to the following: employment, education and training, health services, disability and rehabilitation services, children's support services and income support. SAAP services have always attempted to refer SAAP clients to these services, as part of an overall strategy of moving clients towards independent living. The major frustration in achieving this aim been the sheer lack of employment and education opportunities and support services. It appears ludicrous that SAAP services are expected to take responsibility for increasing homeless people's access to employment, health services and It the like, when the broader community are already having difficulty in accessing the same. SAAP and should not be expected to increase homeless people's access to these things. Future of the program will surely render SAAP a failure in this area, due to structural issues is beyond the control of the program that dictate access to employment etc. NYCH questions why would deliberately want to set SAAP up to fail in this area? are very serious comments from people If who have some knowledge and expertise. people make the points very strongly about the matters that ought to be dealt with of in relation to an agreement with the states, particularly under clause 8, which refers to from implementing case management. They raise some questions about the interpretation of that-that one might be expecting agreements be. to deal with implementation and, hopefully, the next round of agreements ought to deal with the continued management of case management if it has been put in place. These people have raised serious issues about drafting which ought to be the subject of examination. I suspect that the speed with which the government wants to move in this area, and in which legislation is being proceeded, is well beyond that which ought to be available for consultation and discussion with those who are interested. The exclusion of these people from that process has been one about which both they and we are concerned, and an opportunity will be provided by the Senate if the government is not prepared to postpone this matter and ensure that a proper examination takes place.",24
7,Ms DEAHM,ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"I consider it a privilege to speak today on the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill 1994. In my speech I will deal with a number of the issues that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has raised, but I would first like to say a few words about homelessness. I think it is something that has been recognised by the community in this country only over the last 20 or so years. We celebrated not long ago the anniversary of the opening of the first women's refuge in Sydney. We heard from the women who set that up about the great difficulties they had in convincing governments at all levelsincluding the federal government-that there ought to be assistance for people in that situation of distress. It is to the credit of government of the day, including the now Governor General, that it was instrumental in identifying the problems. I think one of the problems is that most of us in this parliament, and in every other parliament, come from fairly secure backgrounds and perhaps have not had a lot of experience-certainly very little first-hand experience-in this area. I remember that, when issues about adoption were being discussed in the upper house in New South Wales, one member came out and told the parliament about her experiences of having to crawl out the back window of her home, with the aid of a friend, to get her children and herself away from a violent and disastrous marriage. Now we do have places to which women in distress and young people who are subject to violence and intimidation at home can go. I include in that psychological abuse, which we sometimes overlook. We think that if people are being bashed or sexually abused they have a good case, but there are other kinds of abuse which are just as severe and from which people-whether they are women in a marriage or young people in a familyneed to get away. A few years ago I had the privilege, and the great frustration, of working in a program for homeless youth in Sydney as a volunteer. These were not kids who had just left home and could be picked up by some of these facilities; these were young people who had been living on the streets in Kings Cross in Sydney. Those of you who know the area will know how tough it is. I was given the care of a young man who was then 18. He was born a drug addict; his mother was an addict. He was adopted by well-meaning parents who did their best for him but who, like most people in those days, did not know what to do with addictive babies. It is only really in the last few years that we have begun to know how to handle that situation. So he grew up being a very frustrated and hyperactive young man. He was given various medicinal drugs to change his situation which, in the long term, only exacerbated his addicthe tion. He was on fairly hard drugs by the time he was about 11 or 12. He was in and out of youth detention centres and had a very bad time of it. What is such a great shame is that this young man, like so many of the people who I came across in that program, was exceedingly bright. This boy dropped out of school at 14, but he had been part of the school debating team. He could pick up a two-inch thick paperback at Central Station in Sydney, arrive at my place two hours later and have read most of it. He could tell you all the characters in Tolkien's novels. He had a brilliant mind. It is to me a great shame and a personal distress-I came to love that young man-to see a life being messed up. The trigger in his situation was drugs. His homelessness was caused by that and a lack of understanding in his, as I have said, well meaning family. Homelessness is caused by a number of things. In that case, they were the triggers. I might add that it has been several years since I have heard from this young man. At that stage, he had just come out of gaol. He was doing a TAPE course and doing extremely well at it. But I know that his phone has been cut off and that he is not at the same address. I suspect that he is probably lying in a street doorway somewhere, if he is still alive. I am just saying these things to set the scene and to show honourable members how the whole situation of homelessness is important to me. We must do all that we can for people who find themselves homeless, be they in a situation similar to that of this young man, they are young people who have been abused in some way or they are wives and mothers who want to get away from a violent marriage. We need to do all that we can for them. Therefore, the SAAP program and the SAAP agreements between the state and federal governments are extremely important in providing those things. I will quote what the bill sets out to do: The Parliament recognises the need to redress social inequalities and to achieve a reduction in poverty and the amelioration of the consequences of poverty for individuals. Homeless people form one of the most powerless and marginalised groups in society. Responses to their needs should aim to empower them and to maximise their independence. These responses should be provided in a way that respects their dignity as individuals, enhances their self-esteem, is sensitive to their social and economic circumstances, and respects their cultural backgrounds their beliefs. That is an extremely important aim for the government. In dealing with some of the issues that the honourable member for Berowra has raised, and if we are going to do those things, we need to do more than just open the door of a refuge, give them a key to a room and say, 'That's it. You've got a roof over your head.' I would also like to talk about the definition of homelessness. It does not just mean that somebody does not have a roof over his or her head. For the purpose of this act, a person is homeless if, and only if, he or she has inadequate access to safe and secure shelter. So people in a refuge are still, for that definition, homeless. It also includes people who are in crisis and at imminent risk of becoming homeless and people who are experiencing domestic violence and who are at imminent risk of becoming homeless. So those people under this act are eligible for SAAP services. One new factor which has been brought up that is coming into this agreement but which has not been in the previous ones is SAAP operatives being responsible for case management. I share the concerns of some of the previous speakers-I have to say that I did not hear them all-about the possibility of the case management offered at this level overlapping with case management which is already carried out to some extent by Social Security and, under the white paper provisions, by DEET. There were several reasons that the standing committee on community affairs put out the discussion paper which the member for Berowra referred to. The government had entered into protocols with the state governments-this is to do with the homeless youth inquiry-as to who should look after young people of certain ages. There were also concerns that white paper provisions for the youth training allowance and the SAAP agreement were going through. I find it quite astonishing that the member for Berowra condemns that discussion paper. He got all his fellow opposition members on that committee to sign a paper and put out a press release condemning the discussion and paper. Yet he just read from the discussion paper precisely the things that we are all concerned about. We are all concerned about the possibility of people being case managed five times. That is precisely what the discussion paper said. For the benefit of honourable members, I will outline the reason why the opposition members of the committee did not go along with that discussion paper. We had limited time in which to consider the draft. We were all busy. We all had problems getting time to read it. When we came to the meeting to discuss it, the member for Berowra had not read it. When we started to go through it, he asked for more time. We agreed on a meeting later that day, which was the deadline. We had to get it out in order to get it to all the people who had contributed to that inquiry. When we got to that meeting, he still had not read the discussion paper and wanted to spend the next three hours or so going through it. As we all had other meetings to go to, it was passed as it stood. For the member for Berowra to say that there are conclusions in this discussion paper which should be part of the final report is incorrect. He keeps saying that, but he has not read any of the conclusions. He has read only the bit that he agrees with. To that extent, the member for Berowra stands condemned. On the issue of case management, yes, I have concerns too. As I have said, we all have concerns. My local refuge has concerns. I have taken those concerns to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), who has assured me that there will be provision for training and additional staff which will be necessary to carry out this procedure. Many of the refuges that we have talked to during the standing committee inquiry have said, 'We're already doing this. ' It is a logical place for case management to be carried out. Let us take the example of a young person who comes into a youth refuge. He is in distress and is feeling vulnerable. He finds somebody at that refuge who is willing to look after him-to give him accommodation and to sit down and talk to him. What better person to case manage that young person? It is much better than sending him off to an impersonal bureaucracy somewhere, such as DSS or DEET. I am not condemning those authorities; they do very good work. But a young person in this vulnerable situation will relate to the person who has put out his hand to help him. That is a very good reason why those SAAP facilities should be doing case management. The criticisms levelled at this bill are due to a lack of understanding. The member for Berowra says that there was no consultation. Incidentally, he says that he had a personally addressed letter from the National Youth Coalition for Housing. So have I; so has every member of the standing committee. Every member of the House may have one-I do not know. I have read that letter and I do not think it is quite as dramatic as the member for Berowra has said. I am advised that that group and all the other groups involved with SAAP were fully consulted before the drafting of this bill. It has not been rushed through as the member for Berowra says. Those people have been involved in the drafting process and none of what is in the bill is of any great surprise to them. When I read that letter, I immediately related its contents to my own refuge and its instant fears, 'Oh, my God, we've got to take on another responsibility.' All they need is some reassurance that they will not be dropped in at the deep end and that training and assistance will be provided. As the National Youth Coalition for Housing said in its letter, they already do a lot of that. I guess that comes down to what the definition of case management is. Does it mean that the case manager at the youth refuge physically has to go out and find a job for the young person or does it mean that the case manager has to put the young person in touch with different bodies, employment agencies and so on? I see that as being part of case management. There is just a little panic reaction from some of these people. They feel that they have to take on this huge burden when really they are just being the carers for these young people for the duration of the time that they are there. They should make sure the young people have income support and that their health is okay. They should take them to a doctor if they need a check-up and give them some advice on basic primary health care. My local youth refuge is, at the moment, conducting a federally funded education program for young men on basic health. It provides sex education, basic hygiene advice, dietary advice and so on. I think we will find that most youth refuges do those things already. We are just giving it another name and making sure that those things happen. I do not think there should be a big drama about case management. We put out the discussion paper to get some feedback from people working in the area on how we can case manage young people who are coming in under the youth training initiative, Austudy or whatever. It may be the case that DSS or DEET will say, 'This person is being case managed by the youth refuge; it does not need to be duplicated by one of us.' That mayor may not be the way it will happen. That is why we needed the discussion paper that is condemned by the member for Berowra. I hate to say it, but a lot of the problems result from personal animosity between the member for Berowra and the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). I am heartily fed up with sitting through many standing committee meetings and putting up with this conflict. That is my problem. Mr O'Connor-Tell us about it.",28
8,Ms DEAHM,ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"The member is not on the committee. I have a few concerns about the way this bill will operate, principally because, like so many pieces of legislation that come before this House, it involves a state-federal agreement. Any state-federal agreement has to work smoothly at both ends. Very often they do not. I heard this morning from a minister about federally funded projects which are channelled through state offices and which are then claimed to be state programs. We have all had experience with that. Taking the experience of my own local youth refuge, I have found that the state people have said to them that, under the new agreement, they will have not a local management committee but a state bureaucrat running the show. I am opposed to that. In my experience, and no doubt from the experience of many people in this place, community organisations which are run by local management groups have the commitment of the local community because the management committee is drawn from the local community. I can think of a couple of people on the management committee of that youth refuge who are very committed. There is an elderly gentleman on that committee who is also on the committee of the local youth centre. We would call him a pillar of the community, the salt of the earth. He gives so willingly to those organisations through fundraising, making sure the staff are happy and so on. I believe they will run much better if they are managed by community management groups. Having said that, I realise that, because those people are volunteers and amateurs, they sometimes do not have the expertise in financial management, personnel management and whatever. There are people there to help. The University of Western Sydney, which is in my electorate, runs training programs for community management groups. Help is available. I think it would be a great shame if this bill were amended, watered down, and the provisions relating to case management taken out. If those umbrella groups which have expressed concern and been consulted-it is erroneous to say they have not been consultedsit down and work through the legislation with the federal bureaucrats who are there to see that it works properly and the states cooperate, then we will find that this is a good piece of legislation. It has been mentioned by several members that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs is conducting an inquiry at the moment into certain aspects of youth homelessness. We have almost finished our proceedings. We have been to every state in Australia and we have talked to government departments. It is timely that we are conducting the inquiry now, considering the changes in the white paper and the current legislation. I think our input will be valuable. The information in the white paper will be valuable to our inquiry. We have seen young people and we have seen the people who work with them. Hearing from those people first-hand about the problems they have had with various agencies and various set-ups gives us an advantage when reporting to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin). I hope other ministers will be involved and read our report and see that we want to make sure that those young people do not slip through the net, are properly looked after and get what is due to them. I refer to the situation people are in when they become homeless. Lack of selfconfidence and self-esteem was one of the things we talked about. What we learnt through the inquiry, and what I have learnt certainly from my own experience, is that young people particularly lack self-esteem, as do the women who leave disastrous marriages that I have mentioned and sometimes also adult men who find themselves in difficult situations. You only have to go to the Matthew Talbot Hostel in Sydney to see some of the problems there. They do lack self-esteem and that is one of the things I think the SAAP worker can help with a great deal. I know that the social workers at Social Security are doing their best as well, but their brief in lots of ways is a little different. The youth worker in a youth hostel is better able to get to know the young person who is sitting there with them. They may be on night duty and seeing them at night-seeing their night fears, attending to their nightmares and so on. I think developing that self-esteem is one of the most important things. Providing shelter is one thing, and providing training, employment and maybe a reconnection with the family are another, but without self-esteem all of those things are going to go down the tube. I think rebuilding self-esteem is one of the most important things we can do for young people and that, to me, is a fundamental part of case management, which is a fundamental part of this bill. It is my sincere hope that this bill will go through both houses unamended-unless there is any way we can improve it for the lot of the people who are homeless and who will benefit from this bill-and be adopted across the board.",31
9,Mr OCONNOR,ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"It gives me great pleasure to support the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill 1994 and the Supported Accommodation Assistance Amendment Bill 1994. I take the opportunity to commend the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) on the support he has given in this House over time to the development of housing policy and the sorts of programs enshrined in the SAAP legislation. The minister is a noted reformer of the housing sector. He is one of the key players in the development of national policy and these types of programs, and he is to be commended for his widespread consultation with not only state governments but also the wider community in the development of this particular program. As chair of the government's caucus housing and regional development committee, I convey to the minister and to the parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), the total support of their colleagues in the caucus for this very important piece of social legislation. There are some important things in life. It is important to have a job, a roof over your head, good health, decent education and opportunity for your family. Of course, it is important to enjoy the personal and economic security of the family. Housing represents one of the two basic human needs of food and shelter. Any society which fails to deliver on the housing front is really not worth its saltI say that in a national sense and direct it at the state level as well-regardless of the complexion of the political parties in power at the time. Unfortunately, in Australia's experience the market mechanism has not been able to consistently deliver the sort of outcome that is desired in an affluent, urbanised and highly industrialised country such as Australia. Over time in Australia, we have seen the development of a very sophisticated private market to meet the housing needs of a significant number of Australians. We have also seen the development of an extensive and important public housing sector to widen the opportunity for access to decent housing by Australians. Labor in government over the last decade has recognised the pivotal role that the public housing sector plays in broadening the opportunity of all Australians to decent quality and affordable housing. In 10 years and successive budgets, Labor in government has thoroughly demonstrated that strong commitment to the public housing sector and to the delivery of housing programs such as SAAP. I hope that in the 1995 budget the government maintains its very strong commitment. I can assure the minister that he will have the support of the caucus committee in the discussions that he has with colleagues and with Treasury and Finance in defending the amounts of money that the federal government allocates to public housing and to programs such as the one which is before the House today. The Labor Party has a long held commitment to the sorts of social policies that support those most in need in our community. The supported accommodation assistance program is an important plank in this commitment to social justice, as it secures Labor's commitment to helping homeless men, women and children through to 1999. This program was established in 1984 and came into operation on 1 January 1985. It was initially a safety net program but has subsequently been moving towards taking a more active role in the reintegration of people into society and the resolution of crises and conflicts. The many programs that SAAP now funds and supports include night shelters, soup kitchens, hostels, social work agencies, women's refuges and day centres. The published reports and the anecdotal evidence would suggest that SAAP has very effectively and satisfactorily fulfilled its important role. For example, the 1993 Moving forward report, which was a national evaluation of the SAAP program, found that this program had been largely successful in achieving its aims. The stated aim of the 1994 SAAP bill is to help people who are homeless achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance and independence. To achieve the aim of the 1994 SAAP legislation, the government, in cooperation with the states and territories, will be continuing the SAAP program with funding for this financial year of $105 million, with funding of some $74 million for the states and territories. This funding will be indexed annually to 30 June 1999. As I mentioned before, the SAAP program has proven itself to be an important vehicle for combating homelessness in this community. The various reports that have been mentioned in the debate thus far have endorsed the success of the program. I guess we can ask ourselves why a program of this type has been so successful. One of the features of this program has been the way that it has brought various levels of government together to address a very urgent need in the Australian community. We have seen cooperation with local and state governments in the delivery of this program. More importantly, the program focuses very much on the empowerment of individuals who at a point in their lives are significantly disempowered. At its core, it has a preventative philosophy-the early identification of people's problems and the provision of assistance to them. I think we can constructively look on the SAAP program as an investment-not as a cost to budget or a cost to the community-in a very important area of housing and social policy. As I read through the briefing papers on this piece of legislation, I must say that a fairly warm feeling came into the heart. Enshrined in the preamble to the bill are some very important statements that really do reflect the underlying philosophy of the Labor Party in government when it drafts this sort of legislation. I would like to share with the House four of the aims which are outlined in the preamble. The first aim is to take into consideration the social position of the homeless and their lack of power. It is very important that the government, in the programs that it delivers, recognises the social condition of those who are receiving assistance-not to have a handout mentality when it comes to these particular programs, but to have as their core philosophy the empowerment of the individual clients over time through the assistance they receive. I think that is a very admirable objective and one which has been effectively achieved thus far in the SAAP program. In the preamble there is a very important acknowledgment of the second aim: the role for government and the need for government to respond to the needs of the homeless. Yes, the community does have an awareness of the problem of homelessness existing in our society. But at least in this legislation we see a very discrete and public acknowledgment, on the part of the Labor government, of the needs of the homeless. The needs of the homeless are acknowledged and the desire to empower them, through legislation and government support, is enshrined in this legislation. The third aim is the adoption al treaties regarding the protection of personal rights. We have had much discussion in the community, and indeed on the floor of this House, on this very important point. But Labor in government does not go around simply endorsing and adopting the principles of international treaties for the sake of it. Some of these treaties enshrine some very important principles which ought to be acknowledged by an Australian government and by the Australian community. So I am very pleased to see that, in the preamble, this particular principle has been enshrined as well. I believe that the fourth aim is the most important and really says something very good about the SAAP legislation. It states: . the need for involvement of community ... in providing assistance to the homeless. This is a very important point because the total community must accept responsibility for providing all of its citizens with the wherewithal to meet people's basic primary needs of food and shelter. The SAAP program is evidence of the government's desire to involve the total community in meeting this very important problem of homelessness in our society. Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, you would be aware that my particular electorate, like yours, covers one of the most important provincial cities in Victoria, and indeed in Australia. It is very important for the regions to involve themselves in processes which identify the housing needs in their area. As far as the situation in my own electorate is concerned, we have been very fortunate in the Geelong region to have an agency which has undertaken the fairly monumental task of identifying the needs of the region-and I refer to the Barwon Region Housing Council. The council went through a process, in 1993 and throughout 1994, of developing a housing policy strategy paper. I would particularly commend the work of one of the operatives in that organisation, Mr Chris Couzens, and the staff of the Barwon Region Housing Council for their great work in drawing elements of the Geelong community together to confront the real housing needs of the of internationpeople of the region. That process of wide consultation, as I have said, has produced a strategy paper, and that strategy paper provides a very firm base for the community of Geelong to develop a coordinated response to housing needs in the Geelong community. I am pleased to say that the recently formed city of greater Geelong has finally involved itself in the process of evaluating this particular strategy paper and bringing the key players in the region together to devise a coordinated and action response to the problems that our community faces in confronting homelessness and meeting the housing needs of people in the area. I have been fortunate enough to hold meetings with commissioners and officers of the City of Greater Geelong to discuss local government involvement in meeting the housing needs of the region. I have also held extensive discussions with representatives from the community sector. I note with some joy the employment of an officer within the community services sector of the City of Greater Geelong who has extensive expertise in the housing area. I am looking forward to local government involving itself much more in this particular process and providing the catalyst for the rather disparate interests in the region to get together and move forward in meeting the housing needs of people in the region. I want to mention some of the findings of that strategy paper because they relate very much to the sorts of issues that we are discussing here today. The strategy paper found that there was a need for further crisis accommodation in the Geelong region. There was a problem of affordability in the private rental market for low income individuals and families. I made the point the other day in a debate in this House that around 30 per cent of families in my electorate earn incomes of less than $20,000. The strategy paper made some comment about the quality of affordable housing, and the discrimination against particular subgroups and the lack of affordable and flexible housing for those particular groups. More importantly, the report identified and emphasised the relationship between the housing sector and other service areas such as health, transport, and employment. It also stressed the important role of federal, state and local governments in delivering services to this community. SAAP in Geelong has been very successful, and around Australia the SAAP program funds up to 1,600 different services. One of the particular services that I would like to mention is a dental scheme for homeless young people which services the Geelong suburb of Corio and is run out of the Corio community health centre. That particular program has a twofold aim. Its obvious and primary role is to provide dental care to homeless youth in the area who would otherwise not have access to what can often be expensive dental work. The second and perhaps more important role is that it puts the centre in touch with homeless youth and gives them the opportunity to alert these young people to other forms of assistance that they might need. I listened with great interest to the contribufor tion by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) who, in one of his usual eloquent displays on the floor of the House, was very critical of this particular program and the government that sponsored it. I guess that is his role. At this point, I want to contrast the position of the opposition and that of the government on these sorts of issues. In a recent speech I made reference to the manner in which this government has addressed not only the economic wage issues for low and middle income earners but the social wage issues as well, and of course our expenditure on housing is a very important part of the social wage. When The Things That Matter-or 'the things that batter' - was launched, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) uttered some great platitudes about the concern of the opposition for the underprivileged in this country. But in the document the sparse budgetary details that members on the other side of the House have given mask their underlying commitment to rip the guts out of the social expenditures undertaken by the federal government at the national level. If you were to win government, you would intend to proceed with the removal of tax on savings. That would suck some $3 billion out of the revenue base. If we add the costs of a new family department, infrastructure spending that you have said you will undertake, reductions in taxes, and private health insurance incentives, that means simply one thing-massive increases of expenditure on the outlay side. When we put all these sorts of factors together we find that the opposition is hell-bent on cutting expenditure not only in the housing area but also in the education and health area. We are not going to let the honourable member for Berowra get away in this House with blithe statements about the opposition's position on these matters. I would like to give the House an example of Liberal governments in action when they deal with these sorts of issues. In Geelong, St Augustine's receives substantial funding from state government to provide medium to long-term accommodation adolescent boys. That expenditure was . slashed by some $300,000, or 40 per cent, by a Liberal state government. The Director of St Augustine's, Brother Trevor Parton, said that the involvement of two Liberal members, Mrs Ann Henderson and the MLC for Geelong Province, Bill Hartigan, was 'scandalous'. Liberals in action on the ground are engaged in fairly scandalous behaviour. (Tzme expired). Mr HOLnING (Melbourne Ports) (11.37 a.m.)-Without any reservation I commend the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill and the Supported Accommodation Assistance Amendment Bill to the House as I commend the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), whose work over a period of time has enlarged the original concept of a Labor government in 1974 which indicated a national responsibility to deal with the plight of homeless persons. It was in 1989 that that initial approach by the Commonwealth was consolidated further so that services provided to the homeless sector of Australian society extended to some 1,600 organisations around Australia. I listened with considerable interest to the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). I wonder whether they realise that this legislation carries the support of the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul, the Council for Homeless Persons and Hanover Welfare Services. That is the reality. The minister and his department and officers have consulted at great length with all those major organisations, and this bill carries their support. So we may well ask: has the coalition thought its way through this legislation? Indeed, has it thought its way through these concepts? The member for Chisholm criticised the aim of SAAP. In fact, this aim, as represented in the bill, is substantially the aim for SAAP, endorsed by all community services and ministers, represented in strategic directions and further endorsed in negotiation phases before the drafting stages of this bill by all state and territory officials. I do not know whether the coalition is preoccupied with some internal problems which we read about in the newspapers. But, clearly, those opposite have not focused their attention on what this bill sets out to achieve. The amendments that have been moved indicate that they have not seriously applied their minds to this legislation. There is a test for that. It is useful, on basis of preceding legislation and preceding involvement of the national government on this issue of homelessness, to look at just how well the coalition thought through these concepts of need and Commonwealth involvement in the run-up to the last election. With some interest I went through that historic document Fightback, which was endorsed by both the speakers who, presumably, had thought about the role of the national government in dealing with the problem of homelessness and its effect upon the nature of our society. All one could find were two general statements: the coalition will look after the needy and give more help to families. In a very detailed document, there was no mention of specific funding and no mention of the role of the Commonwealth in looking after the homeless. There was only one minor reference under the heading 'The Family'. It says: Attacking the problem of crime also involves attacking youth homelessness. Great! It has actually got round to considering the proposition. The document goes on: Our homeless young people are vulnerable to crime. They are particularly vulnerable as victims of crime. No-one could disagree with that. It goes on further: Family breakdown is the major contributing factor to youth homelessness. It is certainly an important factor. Then it says: The Coalition puts great emphasis on the role and importance of the family. There is no mention of the role the Commonwealth has to play and no mention of the funding that is needed. It then goes on to say that they will provide lots of premarriage counselling. That was the level of thought and consideration given by two prominent members of the coalition who had a position in drafting the coalition's policy in the run-up to the last election. Just as it is clear from the coalition's policy documents that the detail of the concepts involved in this legislation were not even considered then, it is perfectly clear that they are not even understood now. The honourable member for Chisholm, who the hails from my own state, emphasises the need for consultation. But the consultation he is talking about represents the continual policy problem that confronts the coalition. At the end of the day, it does not know whether it is a national party or a confederation of state groups. Clearly, what has evolved in this parliament is a view that there is an important role for the Commonwealth to play in dealing with the problems associated with homelessness. What we have here is a concern-I have no doubt it is a legitimate concern of the member for Chisholm-about the principle of consultation. For the benefit of our legislation, I believe all governments, state and federal, have to continually consult with those expert groups and community organisations involved in particular problems. We have to get the wisdom and counsel of people who are working in the field. That has occurred here; it has occurred with all the major organisations. Consultation, as a principle, does not stop there. I believe in this principle. So too does the government, and the coalition seems tobut it stops short. The honourable member for Chisholm gave a lengthy speech about consultation with the states. What he means is that what is important is the consultation that goes on between federal bureaucrats and state bureaucrats. The minister, as I have already pointed out, has consulted with all the major community groups. At the draft stage, there were also discussions with representatives of the states. If the honourable member for Chisholm believes the issue of consultation is so important, why is it important to the opposition to bring amendments into this parliament? He is a member of a national party in a state where the principle of consultation does not exist. Only this week the government of Victoria abolished funding for the Youth Accommodation Coalition. Was there any consultation with that organisation? Was there any consultation with the community groups that support that coalition? Was any consideration given to the impact this would have on the work this organisation does? There was not one bit of consultation. There is a dichotomy in the attitude of the honourable member for Chisholm, who has carried this argument on behalf of the coalition. He has produced a confected set of amendments which will simply delay the application of this legislation if it is carried. He is committed to the principle of consultation between bureaucrats-and some of that has already taken place, as I have pointed out-but he has not stood up as a significant member not of this parliament but of the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party to say it is time for what has been the most dictatorial government in the history of Victoria also to consult. Was there any consultation with the expert bodies and those responsible for mental health services before the government of Victoria virtually put people with mental illness out onto the street, in situations where in many cases were a threat to themselves and to other citizens? Was there any consultation before important public services in health and education were diminished? In my own electorate, decent and highly respectable citizens are being arrested because they are defending a park against a decision of the Victorian government. The Victorian government is using the powers of the police force to arrest those citizens carrying out a protest designed to protect a facility which a previous Liberal government some years ago decided was absolutely not necessary or desirable to be used for a car race. Was there any consultation? So, on an important piece of legislation, we are getting an attitude from the opposition which again indicates that it cannot make up its mind where its national responsibility lies, whether it is a states party or a national party-that is, a party that is concerned to think its way through the obligations that rest upon an opposition in this parliament to seriously consider how to deal with legislation as important as this in terms of national responsibility. I have no doubt that the House will reject this confected and artificial set of amendments, because the only effect of referring this legislation to a committee would be to threaten the continued smooth operation of SAAP. SAAP is already operating under an extension of the old agreements and the old act. It is important in this area-more so than in many other areas-that the people who run those services and their clients know quickly where they stand so they can proceed with all the new planning that has to take place. There will then be effective accountability established so that we can get an effective administrative regime for an invigorating and refocused SAAP. That is the issue. We have got what we have from this thoughtless coalition because it has a letter from one group. Prior to the last election, coalition members had no policy in place for their own election commitments. They had not thought their way through the implications of this legislation. They totally ignored those very important community organisations that are dealing every day at a face-to-face level with this problem-and I have enumerated them-and their support for this legislation. What is important to the honourable member for Chisholm, a fellow Victorian, is that he establishes the principles of negotiation and discussion with a state government that discusses no aspect of its policy-at any level-with community organisations and democratically elected representatives of community organisations. There is not a municipality or a region of Victoria which at the moment is not in revolt about the way in which the Victorian government has gone about restructuring local government. It has hired political appointees to replace democratically elected councillors. Has there been a word of protest from the people who stand here and say how important it is to negotiate? Those protests are coming not just from independent councillors or people who are councillors and might be members of no political party, but also from members of the Liberal Party. This is important legislation, and it is important that it be put into place quickly and effectively. That the coalition has not sorted out its national responsibilities in this matter is no reason it should confect a reference to some group of people in the Senate. The only effect of that exercise is to delay the implementation of a much needed service. We are not going to solve all the problems of homelessness but-because of this policy, the national involvement and the attitude of this minister-despite the immensity of the problem, you do not walk about Melbourne and Sydney and see the desperate plights that you see in London or other parts of Europe. The results of a long standing conservative government are that you cannot walk in places like Hyde Park or the major streets of London without seeing people huddled under any form of shelter they can obtain. We still have great challenges in this not minimise that-but, because of the attitude of this government and its philosophies, we do not face poverty everywhere we move and we do not find people living in the appalling conditions in which people in other parts of the world are living in. I commend the legislation to the House and I hope that by the time it gets to the Senate the coalition will have rethought its responsibilities to this legislation but, more importantly, to those organisations which need to be able to implement the policy considerations and the funding that comes with this legislation so they can get on with the job. This is far too important for the kind of confected nonsense which has been brought into this House as an ill thought through a set of amendments. I believe that these amendments ought to be withdrawn so coalition members can walk away and think again about their national responsibilities in this very important area.",32
10,Mr LINDSAY,ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (11.55 a.m.)-I reiterate the importance of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Amendment Bill 1994 and one cognate bill. It is important because it addresses a number of key objectives of the government's social justice strategy. One of its most important challenges today is homelessness, which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) eloquently why expressed in his remarks. There is no question that homeless people are extremely disadvantaged. This bill establishes the SAAP's place as being central to helping persons in those circumstances achieve positive outcomes. It sets a new framework for the provision of SAAP services. The bill seeks to move SAAP from a program of last resort to one which offers people opportunities. It is active in helping them to change their lives. The bill is about maximising people's opportunities and about asserting their right to a full range of government services and community resources. Most importantly, the bill acknowledges the dignity of people who are homeless at the same time as it asserts their right to participate in their communities area-one must like other citizens. We believe that our nation's collective commitment to social justice will be tested by the way that we respond to homeless people, by the opportunities we offer them and by the quality of services we provide for them. With this bill, we know that the government is showing the leadership that is required. We also support it because we believe that it is the decent thing to do and that it is the decent thing for governments to do. I commend the bill to the House. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",38
11,Mr LINDSAY,ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (11.58 a.m.)-by leave-I move: (1) Preamble, page 2, after ""the Universal Declaration of Human Rights"" insert ""and of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women"". (2) Clause 3, page 3, definition of ""people who are homeless"", lines 15 and 16, omit the definition, substitute the following definition: '''people who are homeless' includes: (a) people who are in crisis and at imminent risk of becoming homeless; and (b) people who are experiencing domestic violence and are at imminent risk of becoming homeless;"". I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum to these amendments. These government amendments more directly acknowledge the significance of issues relating to domestic violence for the supported accommodation assistance program. We know that domestic violence is a major factor in people becoming homeless. This is particularly the case for women and women with children who face intolerable situations in their own homes. The government therefore proposes two amendments to the Supported Accommodation Assistance Amendment Bill 1994. Firstly, Australia's adoption of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women is included in the preamble. Secondly, direct reference is made to domestic violence in the definition of 'people who are homeless' in clause 3. These amendments are minor, despite the significance of the issues they address, in that they do not alter the intentions or the purposes of the bill. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Lindsay)-by leave-read a third time. NA NA Consideration resumed. Second Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Lindsay) read a second time.

12,Mr BRERETON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (12.01 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) contains three sets of amendments to legislation in the industrial relations portfolio. First, the bill alters the arrangements for industrial relations in the coal industry. Secondly, it gives effect to a recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal that the parliamentary allowance be incorporated into the base salaries of members of parliament. Thirdly, the bill improves the quorum and voting requirements for the national Occupational Health and Safety Commission. Coal Industry This bill represents a landmark step in the rationalisation of industrial relations arrangements in the Australian coal mining industry. The bill provides for amendments to the Coal Industry Act 1946 and the Industrial Relations Act 1988. It will bring industrial relations arrangements in the coal industry into the industrial relations mainstream. From the day it comes into effect, industrial relations in that industry will be regulated by the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The Coal Industry Tribunal's powers and functions are presently established by complementary Commonwealth and New South Wales legislation, which commenced in 1946. That makes the Coal Industry Tribunal about the same age as the Liberal Party. Some might say that they are equally anachronistic in the 1990s. Fortunately, coal industry unions and employers have proven themselves willing to embrace reform. This was despite the efforts of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the political equivalent of a steam engine, to huff and puff about an alleged government cave-in on the reform bill. Having just performed a breathtaking backdown on Jobsback himself, it was an astonishing performance from the member for Bennelong. No sooner had he put his tired old press release out than the employers were out there welcoming this reform package. What the member for Bennelong could not believe was that the government had cooperatively delivered yet another reform which the conservatives had avoided-and avoided shamelessly-during the Fraser government when Ian Macphee had to back off for Doug Anthony. Yet we have been able to implement the reform in a manner acceptable to both unions and employers, to whom I want to pay tribute. Without them this historic change could not have been undertaken in an industrially peaceful manner. Only through detailed negotiations have we been able to reach agreement with the United Mineworkers on most aspects of the legislation. Where we have been unable to agree, such as on the issue of access to enterprise flexibility agreements, we have agreed to disagree. In practice, the government would not expect this to become a major issue in the industry, given the high level of unionism and the strong leadership of the UMW. Either way, the experience of this legislation gives us cause for optimism that future issues can be addressed in a similarly cooperative, tripartite fashion. This has been the way so many of the government's reforms have been achieved in the last decade. In the coal industry, like so many others, the conservatives left it to Labor to reform the special industrial arrangements that applied, arrangements introduced in 1946 to meet the specific circumstances then applying in New South Wales, and arrangements that are no longer appropriate to a modern and export focused industry, particularly when that industry is now as significant in Queensland as it is in New South Wales. The current complementary legislation reflects an agreement between the two governments-Commonwealth and New South Wales-for the regulation of the coal industry in New South Wales. Each of the two governments has undertaken not to take any action, without the prior concurrence of the other, to repeal or amend any of the legislation covered by the agreement. The government of New South Wales has indicated to the Commonwealth that it is also its view that industrial regulation of the coal mining industry should be mainstreamed through the transferring of the powers of the Coal Industry Tribunal to the existing Commonwealth and state industrial tribunals. I wish to emphasise that, in view of the existing agreement over changes to the current complementary legislation, the measures proposed in this bill will only commence when the Governor of New South Wales agrees in writing. The bill is introduced at a time when the coal industry has been going through a period of significant reform to its administrative and industrial relations arrangements. In 1992 this parliament, acting with the benefit of complementary legislation passed by the New South Wales parliament, made changes to the functions of the Joint Coal Board. This included making the Australian Industrial Registry responsible for administrative support to the Coal Industry Tribunal, in addition to performing that role for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Also, during 1992, legislation was passed to establish a new Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation to reform the way long service leave was funded and administered in the industry. These reforms are all designed to improve the efficiency of the coal industry. The role and functions of the Coal Industry Tribunal have of course been the subject of public discussion for many years. A number of previous inquiries have recommended its abolition. However, it is only this government, through today's historic legislation, that has bitten the bullet on a necessary reform. It has done so after full consultation and discussion with the relevant industry parties, all of whose views have been taken into account in drafting the legislation.",39
13,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Every thing's historic, isn't it?",41
14,Mr BRERETON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"You hate this one! The process of mainstreaming began in August 1993 when the government wrote to a wide range of industry parties, including the relevant state ministers, seeking their views on the industrial relations arrangements which should apply to the coal industry in the future. We received a range of responses. We continued the consultation process by releasing, in July 1994, a copy of a draft exposure bill and explanatory material outlining a preferred approach to reform. Again, a range of views were received in response. The government has considered all of those views in developing this legislation. We consider that the coal industry should be subject to the same industrial relations institutional arrangements as other industries. The coal industry no longer needs a separate, specialised and insular industrial relations system. This is a fundamental change in a key export industry. We do not deny it will be challenging for the parties to adapt to the mainstream system after such a long period under specialised arrangements. However, we are confident they will do so smoothly and effectively. As originally introduced, the bill would have provided a two-stage process for change. Under the first stage, the Coal Industry Tribunal would have continued to exercise its current jurisdiction, but subject to a number of provisions for partial integration into the mainstream of the federal industrial relations system. After further discussions with the industry parties and with New South Wales and Queensland, the government has now decided that a two-stage process is unnecessary. I foreshadow that the government will be moving amendments to this bill to omit the initial transitional stage. The amended provisions of the bill, when proclaimed, will mean the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal and full integration of coal industry industrial relations arrangements with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Awards made by the Coal Industry Tribunal will continue in force as if they were awards of the commission, and matters which had commenced in the tribunal will be heard by the commission. The amendments which the government will move in the consideration in detail stage also expressly provide for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to have regard to any decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal that are relevant to the matters before the commission. Furthermore, we expect that, in accordance with its usual practice when assuming a new jurisdiction, the commission will give due weight to relevant decisions of the local coal authorities and boards of reference established under the Coal Industry Act. It is appropriate for the legislation to expressly recognise what would be the practice ordinarily adopted by the commission. The considered views of the previous specialised tribunal ought not be ignored when they are relevant to the decisions of the commission. The requirement will be for the commission to have regard for relevant decisions, not to be bound by them. As time passes, earlier decisions of the tribunal will cease to be relevant as they are overtaken by changes in circumstances. Following very constructive discussions which I had with my ministerial counterparts in both New South Wales and Queensland, the amendments will also establish a basis on which New South Wales and Queensland will be able to legislate to overcome jurisdictional restrictions, which would otherwise confront the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in dealing with local disputes in the mining industry. The amendments will provide that if South Wales or Queensland adopt the federal act with appropriate modifications, to apply as a law of the state concerned, the commisfrom sion will be able to exercise the powers perform the functions available to it under state law. Reflecting the complementary nature of this scheme, any full bench of commission which is exercising such tion is, as far as is practicable, to include a cross-appointed member of the state tribunal. There will be further discussions with those states and the industry parties about the best way to implement these aspects of the legislalegislation tive scheme. There is a question of whether New South Wales will be able to change its side of existing complementary legislation within same time frame as the Commonwealth. tors Understandably New South Wales wishes to be certain of the final form of the bill, after it has been considered by the Australian Parliament, before proceeding with its own legislation. To avoid delays, the amended bill will on the corporations power for certain transihad tional purposes. In particular, this relates the conversion of tribunal awards to commisto sion awards; however, reliance on that constiments tutional power will cease when complemenwork tary New South Wales legislation is in force. The bill's reliance on the trade and commerce powers to supplement the commission's formed. jurisdiction will not be necessary since the Commonwealth and state governments are bers of parliament. developing a complementary scheme for this industry. In those circumstances it will unnecessary to proclaim that provision. The bill provides that the legislation have effect from a date to be fixed by proclaOccupational mation. We intend for the bill to come into force on 1 July 1995, subject to the agreement of the Governor of New South Wales as represented required by the bill. This will allow the commission and the parties enough time to make all the appropriate arrangements before the legislation commences. coal Remuneration of members of parliament The proposed amendments to the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 will New implement a recommendation by the Remuneration Tribunal that the parliamentary allowance of $4,767 per annum, introduced 1 July 1994, be incorporated into the and base salary of senators and members of the House of Representatives. The tribunal said that an amendment to the legislation would the serve to improve the transparency of parjurisdicliamentarians' remuneration. By way of background to the proposed amendments, the annual base salary of members of parliament is currently specified in the and is payable at the maximum salary rate applicable to a Senior Executive Service band 1 officer in the Australian Public Service. This pay linkage provides a practical the and sustainable approach to determining the salaries of members of parliament and senaand ensures that they will not be treated in isolation. However, with the introduction of performance based pay in the SES, the link originally intended has not been maintained. The parliamentary allowance re-established the pay linkage between parliamentarians and the SES at the base of SES band 2. The rely tribunal, when determining this allowance, regard to the wage fixing principles of the to Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the spread of enterprise bargaining agree in the public sector and in the general force, as well as to the developments in parliamentary practice and the conditions under which parliamentary service is perIt should be noted that this measure does not affect the net remuneration of membe National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Experience has shown us that the quorum will and voting requirements in the National Health and Safety Commission Act are impracticable when the commission is considering a grant to an organisation in the commission. This bill alters those requirements. It also ensures the continuation of the current practice of members of the commission not taking part in deciding grants to the organisations that they represent. Financial impact statement The bill will involve a very minor increase in Commonwealth expenditure. As a result of the integration of the jurisdiction of the Coal Industry Tribunal into that of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, it is necessary to review the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales governments under which the cost of administration of the Coal Industry Tribunal is shared. The current annual total administrative cost of the Coal Industry Tribunal is $1.216 million. I warmly commend the bill to the House.",41
15,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"We have just heard a self-congratulatory speech from Australia's high diving expert. Talk about double turns with quadruple pikes! We have just seen from the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) an absolutely outstanding example of that. I ask my colleague the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) to get from the advisers box a couple of bits of paper that I think really show this minister-Danger Man-for what he is. 'Danger Man' is the title given to him by none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I do not normally warm to the Prime Minister's descriptions. But the minister is certainly Danger Man as far as Australia's productivity is concerned. He is certainly Danger Man as far as wage breakouts are concerned. He is certainly Danger Man as far as good industrial relations are concerned. And he is certainly Danger Man as far as the administration of the transport portfolio is concerned. In fact, as far as the administration of that portfolio is concerned, he is one of the most dangerous men you can imagine. Mr Brereton interjecting",43
16,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"On this occasion, a description given to a member of parliament",43
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Newell)Order!,43
18,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I do not want him to go. Do not stop him from interrupting; I enjoy the minister's interruptions. Of course, he now wanders out of the chamber. Danger Man doesn't like a bit of verballing, does he? He is very good at verballing people in Sussex Street, but when it comes to somebody verballing him, he likes to go running out.",43
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! Would the member for Bennelong come to the substance of the bill, rather than debate the member.",43
20,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"He is the substance. It is perfectly all right for him to get up and make a political opening to his second reading speech but, apparently, according to the rules of this parliament, I cannot reply in kind. Mr Deputy Speaker, is that your kind of New South Wales Labor justice? That is a quite inappropriate interpretation of the standing orders of this parliament, and I am not going to be intimidated by you when giving a legitimate response to a political attack by the minister. I know the application of the standing orders. Yesterday the minister really excelled himself. He put out a press statement in which he said that the federal opposition had finally admitted defeat on industrial relations. He said that we had utterly changed our policy. He said that I had backed down, because I had indicated that one of the possible areas of review was that the coalition might have what is called an opt-out choice in relation to the transfer from an award to a workplace contract rather than an opt-in. The minister claimed that I had not changed the coalition's industrial relations policy at all. He went on to say that the opt-out choice was a complete backdown. He cannot have it both ways. I cannot simultaneously be hauling up the white flag of surrender and not changing my policy at all. That, of course, is what is the minister's problem. Mr Deputy Speaker, in response to your admonition, I will return to the specifics of the bill now before the parliament. If one can mix one's metaphors, which I guess one is inclined to do on these sorts of issues, this bill is a high-water mark in the monkey organ-grinder relationship between this minister and the trade union movement of Australia. For a long time it has been common sense industrial relations to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal. That has been the view of many commentators on industrial relations; it has been the policy of the tion; it has been the policy of the industry; and, in April of this year, it was the announced policy of the government. I want to dwell on that for a moment. We are now in November, and we have the final version of the government's legislation. It has taken the government three attempts and six months to get this legislation right. Mr Hollis-So what?",43
21,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The member for Throsby interjects and says, 'So what?' I would agree with the member for Throsby that, if at the end of the day you have the right result, it would have been a justifiable exercise. But, at the end of the day, you have not got the right result. At the end of the day, you have been seen to have engaged once again in an act of surrender to the trade union movement of Australia. Having paid back the political support that unions gave it in the 1993 election campaign, having paid its political dues in full plus compound interest through the Industrial Relations Amendment Act 1993, the government has again genuflected before the barons of the trade union movement on the issue of the Coal Industry Tribunal. When the minister went on the PM program in April and said that it was good industrial relations to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal, was he serious or was he just playing politics? He was not. In fact, I immediately offered him the support of the coalition because it was consistent with coalition policy. But, of course, I had not bargained for-perhaps I should have-the reaction of the unions. Since that announcement in April, we have had three different legislative offerings from the minister. Finally, we are left with a bill. Undoubtedly, the bill improves the current situation, but it falls a long way of what has been desirable for a long time. It falls a long way short of even the Hancock recommendation. I would be the last bloke in this parliament to hold up the Hancock committee as an epitome of what ought to be done to industrial relations in Australia. But, on this occaParty sion, we had the Hancock inquiry, which was composed of Professor Keith Hancock, Charlie Fitzgibbon, the former federal secretary of coali- the Waterside Workers Federation, and George Polites-very experienced people in industrial relations. They certainly had a different view of industrial relations from mine, but I respected the experience they brought to their work. Most of the recommendations they made in their inquiry in 1985 were to reinforce the present system. Indeed, the 1993 bill had its genesis in the Hancock recommendations-in particular, the destruction of the secondary boycott protections, which were a monument to a level playing field so far as small business and the trade union movement is concerned. Of all the things this government has done, the most shameful of all in industrial relations is to, once again, put trade unions above the law. The government introduces bill after bill allegedly to reinforce the notion of equality before the law. We are lectured from day to day about the need to eliminate discrimination from our society. We are told that any form of discrimination based on gender, race or religion properly is abhorrent to what Australians stand for. But, when it comes to discrimination by reason of membership or nonmembership of a trade union, the government develops a great amnesia-that does not matter; that is an acceptable form of discrimination. Just as there is no form of murder or crime which is acceptable, there ought also to be no form of discrimination which is acceptable. What is the difference in principle between saying to a person, 'You may not have a job because you are a Catholic or a Jew' or 'You may not have a job because you don't belong to the union'? I have never heard a satisfactory answer from anybody sitting opposite. short They have never been able to explain that moral double standard. They have never been able to justify discriminating against people by reason of their conscientious and genuine objection to belonging to industrial organisations. They smugly go about maintaining this double standard. Until the Australian Labor comes to terms with its moral duplicity on that issue, it will never be convincing advocates of a discrimination-free Australian society. The 1993 industrial relations bill and this little tawdry, inadequate exercise before us today is in a sense a child of that larger exercise. The 1993 industrial relations bill did a number of shameful things, the most shameful of which was the destruction of the secondary boycott law. By changing that law, the government did a very simple thing. If a corporation called John Howard Pty Ltd imposes a secondary boycott on a corporation called Eric Fitzgibbon Pty Ltd and causes that company damages, the managing director of that company can go to the Federal Court of Australia and get an injunction immediately telling John Howard Pty Ltd to back off. If that company does not back off, it can be up for contempt. Yet if I sool a union onto Eric Fitzgibbon Pty Ltd and cause the company the same damage, he does not have the same remedy. He can bleed to death for a minimum of three or four days without any effective legal remedy at all, and then, only by leave and permission of the Industrial Relations Commission, he can go to court. The grim reality, as anybody who has an atom of understanding of small business will know, is that if we deny essential supplies to a small business for three or four days it can go broke. That does not apply to a big company or a big union, but it applies to all the hundreds of thousands of battling small businesses which are the economic life and soul of this company. By destroying the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act, you have created yet another new class in Australia; that is, rogue unions which can thumb their nose at normally civilised conduct. You are proud of that. You have been trying for 17 years to destroy those provisions, and you finally got the numbers in the Senate to do it. I think that was the most shameful element. When the coalition wins the next election, the first thing that will be put in our industrial relations reform act is a restoration of the secondary boycott provisions. What those provisions enshrine is a very simple principle; that is, that we all should be equal before the law. Until you embrace that principle, you cannot claim to be convincing advocates of non-discrimination in Australian society. You are humbugs when it comes to discrimination. You are in favour of certain forms of non-discrimination, not all forms of non-discrimination. The reason for that is that you govern for not all Australians but only some Australians. Mr Fitzgibbon-Rubbish!",44
22,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, it is not rubbish. I know it hurts, and that is why you interject. I know that you do not like it, but it happens to be a reality. You do not govern for the whole community; you govern on the interest group principle. You think politics is all about maximising the needs and wants of interest groups, not about serving the overall national interest. You can see that thread running through every piece of legislation and policy that you characters put down. It is never the aggregate national interest; it is always the individual interest group that you are trying to serve. On this occasion, you are trying to serve the trade union movement. Commonsense dictates that the Coal Industry Tribunal ought to have been abolished. Commonsense dictates that you ought to have one single industrial tribunal dealing with all federal areas of industrial authority. That has been a view that many people in the Labor movement have had. I think it was a view that Neville Wran once had. I think it was a view that your minister had in April this year. What happened on the way to the dispatch box? I will tell you what happened on the way to the dispatch box-Laurie got mugged by the ACTU. That is what happens always. All the fine words about abolishing the Coal Industry Tribunal have been reduced to naught. You have had three backdowns with as many variations. Yet we are left with this miserable little compromise. I suppose one should be grateful because the miserable little compromise enables, once again, a public focus to be placed upon the industrial relations policies of the present government. Despite all the government's talk of equality and looking after the battler, historians will record that the great enduring legacy of the Hawke-Keating years is that the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. One of the reasons that the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer is that when it comes to industrial relations you do not govern for the entire community; you govern for sectional interests. I know all of you opposite get very angry when the opposition ever raises anything about the rich and the poor, about equality. You are very sensitive. Your Prime Minister gets out of his tree when it comes to any suggestions about the rich and poor. Let me giveMr Fitzgibbon interjecting",45
23,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Oh, aren't we touchy on this? Isn't the great battler from Hunter touchy on this? Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have known, loved and respected the Prime Minister for many years and I have never seen him in a tree in my life.",46
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Newell)There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,46
25,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Gee, you have a problem. I know this hurts the member for Throsby and my friend and colleague the member for Hunter. I will just give you one very relevant statistic which illustrates my point. In 1976, which was only 18 years ago, 65 per cent of all Australian households had incomes between $22,000 and $72,000 a year-15 per cent had incomes below $22,000 and 20 per cent had incomes above $72,000. Using constant dollar comparisons so you get a true comparison, by 1992 that 65 per cent had fallen to only 40 per cent, the 15 per cent doubled to 30 per cent and the 20 per cent had risen to 30 per cent also. So what happened in the space of that 16 years, the bulk of which you were governing the country? The great Australian middle class collapsed and a wonderful Australian egalitarian tradition was lost, despite your so-called magnificent economic policy that allegedly brought unparalleled prosperity, equality and a fair go to all Australians. If your middle collapses from 65 to 40 per cent in the space of 16 years, you are watching a great national transformation. That has been the result of your policies. Whenever you and any of your mates get up and talk about fairness and discrimination those figures ought to be ringing in your ears, because they are a permanent indictment of your failure to deliver equity and a reminder of just how you have failed to govern the entire nation. Sure, many of your mates have got richer; a lot more have got poorer and those in the middle have been squeezed. One of the reasons for that is that you have not had a decent industrial relations policy. You have not had an industrial relations policy that has lifted national productivity. You now have a situation where workers are looking for pay rises because they cannot afford the higher interest rates your economic policies are visiting upon them. The reason that you are having trouble with the unions now on wage claims-we do not support them-is that by jacking up interest rates you are further squeezing the disposable incomes of Australian families. Because you people are unwilling to use other economic instruments, you are squeezing the disposable incomes of Australian families. Your failure to develop a decent industrial relations policy is one of the reasons you are driven to rely on monetary policy-that equals higher interest rates-in order to control the economy. Those opposite do not like to be reminded of this, but they are the high interest rate experts of Australian politics. This government drove interest rates to a higher level and kept them there for a longer time than any government since federation. That allegation cannot possibly be had disputed. You are the past masters. The current Prime Minister is without doubt the world's greatest high interest rate expert. As the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), has said, whenever the Prime Minister has a problem he reaches for a gun and shoots a home buyer with higher interest rates. That is fundamentally the great failure of your current economic policies. The reason those opposite do not like to be reminded of this is that it cuts them to the quick to know that a Labor government has presided over the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. It is a Labor government that has done that; it is not a tory government that has done that. It is an Australian Labor government that has driven the poor into greater poverty and has made the rich richer. It has destroyed the great Australian egalitarian middle class. It has done it all and it has done it all on its own. Those opposite do not like to be reminded of it, but I can tell them that they are going to be reminded of it a lot between now and whenever the election is held. They will not find it a very comfortable message in all those marginal seats, particularly in regional New South Wales, of which the member for Hunter, sitting opposite, is very familiar. They will be very uncomfortably reminded. To return to some of the more specific provisions of the bill-this is a wide-ranging debate and I appreciate the indulgence you have given me, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - our view, very simply, is that this government has been played off a break by the unions so far as the Coal Industry Tribunal is concerned. Of course, while the Coal Industry Tribunal saga was going on, we had the great ANL sagathat other great sweetheart deal. This is good business if you can get it. Every small business man and woman I know in Australia would love this. My colleague the shadow minister for small business, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), knows a lot more about small business than the rest of you put together because she operated a successful small business for a long time. I can tell you right now that every small business proprietor that she knows and I know would love to be told by the government that they did not have to remit group tax deductions in relation to the wages of their employees. But this is what the government has done. It has entered into this unprecedented sweetheart deal in relation to ANL. What is to guarantee that in a few months time, because the Commonwealth is a minority shareholder in ANL, it does not come back to the trough and say, 'You hold the minority stake; it is in your financial interests to do something about it'? We believe that the Coal Industry Tribunal should have been completely abolished ages ago. Although the kind of half pregnant absorption, if I can call it that, engaged in in relation to the provisions of this bill is some improvement on the present system, its falls a long way short of what the minister promised back in April. You are either going to absorb the tribunal into the AIRC or you are not. Do not engage in this Claytons absorption and say, 'We are not going to have a separate body but we are going to have a separate body within the other body.' That is just sophistry and does not fool anybody. We all know it is a compromise forced on you by John Maitland and his colleagues. We all know that. We all know that was the compromise. You do not fool anybody. If you are against something and you want to do something, why do you not do it and do it unambiguously instead of mucking around with these compromises for which you lot opposite are absolutely famous? The opposition regards this legislation, and the minister's behaviour, with the contempt that it deserves. I will move a second reading amendment, and we will have something to say on the government's amendments during the committee stage of the debate. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the passage of this Bill, the House: (l) admonishes the Minister for Industrial Relations for clearly failing to meet his April 1994 promise to fully absorb coal industry arrangements into the industrial relations mainstream; (2) condemns the Government's continued preference to satisfy the narrow sectional interests of trade union leaders rather than govern in the national interest; and (3) deplores the erratic fashion in which the Minister for Industrial Relations manages his portfolio responsibilities, clearly exemplified by the number of different bills presented by the Minister on the subject of the coal industry"".",46
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Is the amendment seconded? Mr MCGauran-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,47
27,Mr HOLLIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) and, not surprisingly to many people, I will confine my remarks to that aspect of the coal industry. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) said it was a landmark step, and indeed it is. It is a pleasure to follow the wide ranging speech of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). It was a wide ranging speech, indeed, but the same theme always comes through when the honourable member for Bennelong gets up to speak. We know it will be a union bashing exercise but sometimes it is with more vigour than others. Many times in this House I have heard honourable member for Bennelong talk about the privileged position of those who are leading the trade union movement. He talks about closed shops but he never talks about the closed shops of the professions. arguments in this House would ring with a lot more sincerity if he started slamming closed shops of the professions of Australia instead of constantly bashing the trade movement. Over the last few weeks, aspects of this bill Relations have given some government members some cause for concern. It had the potential to be a controversial piece of legislation. It legislation that has occupied a deal of time as, indeed, it has of my colleague the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzso. gibbon). We have had discussions on this legislation with each other, with the minister and-I make no secret of this-with the trade union movement. It is pleasing to see that nature of the legislation has been resolved. It has been resolved through consultation and discussion between the major players. It has been resolved with some skill and sensitivity, which is what really rankles those sitting opposite. The honourable member for Gippsment land (Mr MCGauran) has allowed a small smile to cross his face because members of the opposition thought they were going to see the bunfight of all bunfights; they thought they were going to see the Labor members of parliament who represent coal mining areas dispute with the minister; they were going to see strikes; and they thought they were going to see great headlines in newspaper about threats. But it has been resolved without that and all the wonderfully profound speeches of those opposite have to go back into the bottom drawers of their desks, where they will remain. This has been solved with skill and sensitivity-and that is what rankles the opposition. This piffling amendment that the honourable member for Bennelong has moved, and which was seconded by the honourable member for Gippsland, is a piece of timeconsuming nonsense. The opposition lost on this vote. Opposition members did not have the the fight they thought they were going to have, so they should have the good grace to accept it and to congratulate the government and the minister on this legislation that has been brought before this House and negotiHis ated with great skill and sensitivity. I pay particular tribute to the CFMEU, the which played a very constructive role in ensuring that the positive and effective eleunion ments of the Coal Industry Tribunal are integrated into the Australian Industrial Commission. The honourable member for Bennelong argued about my putting miners in a special situation. I do put is coalminers in a special position and I make my no apologies for that. The coalminers of Australia are special to me and will always be I make no apology for saying that. But, as usual, opposition members are running with their line that the Coal Industry Tribunal should have been abolished without any questions asked and that the CFMEU should not have been consulted or have had any say the controversial in the matter. Opposition members are always talking about industrial relations, and they wanted a fight out of this. We have achieved what I think the opposition wanted, what the governwanted and what most members of this House wanted. We have achieved it without a major industrial disputation and without a major fight. This upsets opposition members. I cannot believe them. One would have thought that they would have at least had the in good grace to come in here and congratulate thought they the government on this. As the minister said in his speech, those the opposite hate this legislation. They cannot believe-and this is what is really galling them-that we have achieved this without a bang-up, drag-down fight. They are opposing it and the honourable member for Bennelong has moved that amendment because opposition members have been denied a fight. The old street brawlers from way back have been denied a fight, and that is really galling them. One has a certain amount of sympathy for the honourable member for Bennelong. He has been left hanging as limp as a flag while the coal employers support the package agreed to by the government and the CFMEU. The words the honourable member spoke in this place today are hollow. He did not have too many objections to the bill. He even talked about the ANL. He talked about everything but the bill because he could not find too much in it to object to. But they are his own views. He has the support of no-one in the opposition for this legislation. Who does he represent in this matter? That is the question we now have to ask. He does not represent the views of the coal employers, who are reported in yesterday's Australian Financial Review as welcoming the outcome of the government-union talks on industrial relations reform in the coal industry. Can you imagine the honourable member, after he put out that press statement yesterday condemning this legislation, flipping through the pages of the Australian Financial Review and finding out that it was welcomed on all sides? The only people not welcoming it were the honourable member for Bennelong and the seconder of his motion, the honourable member for Gippsland. The opposition has also been rubbished for its support of the package by the New South Wales government. So the honourable member for Bennelong represents the views of no-one. The polls show that the Australian people are not terribly interested in these views either. The facts are that the consultation and discussion which have taken place between the government and the mining unions have resulted in very productive outcomes. The transfer of the Coal Industry Tribunal functions to the AIRC will be quicker. Initially, a two-stage process was proposed. If the amendments foreshadowed by the minister in his second reading speech are accepted-lam sure that they will be-it will be a one-stage process. The coal industry is of vital importance to Australia. It is a major export earner. It is an industry that has undergone massive change in the last decade. The bill ensures that the positive features of the Coal Industry Tribunal are retained within the mainstream industrial relations system and that the unique aspects of the coal industry are given due consideration within the Industrial Relations Commission. So what if it has taken six months. The honourable member for Bennelong made much of the fact that it has taken six months to get it right. So what. It is better to take six months to get it correct than to repeatedly take three months and get it wrong each time. We on this side are not frightened to sit down, negotiate a matter through and take into account all sides. I thought that industrial relations is all about listening to all sides of the argument, compromising where necessary and, where you feel strongly about it, sticking to your point of view. So what if it takes six months. The honourable member seemed to make a fuss that it took six months to get it right. Surely the important point is that we have got it right. The Coal Industry Tribunal was established by the Commonwealth and New South Wales coal industry acts of 1946. The CIT was established, along with the Joint Coal Board, to settle disputes in the coal industry. The development was necessary at the time because of the finely balanced supply of coal and the demand for coal. Any disruption would have had effects on domestic and commercial coal users. The CIT has the power to deal with interstate industrial disputes in the coal industry and disputes within New South Wales and works together with local coal authorities. The Commonwealth and New South Wales coal industry acts grant the CIT the power to consider and determine most industrial disputes and other matters, including those arising under an award or order of the Industrial Relations Commission. Local coal authorities have the power to inquire into and settle local industrial disputes and those disputes which are referred to it by the mine conciliation committees. Where an industrial matter or disputes affect persons outside the limits of power of a local coal authority, the local coal authority is to refer the dispute or matter to the CIT. A decision made by the local coal authority can be reviewed by the CIT upon application. An order, award or determination which is made by the CIT is unable to be appealed against or reviewed unless on legal grounds. Over the years, the need for a separate tribunal dealing specifically with the coal industry has been questioned. In fact-the honourable member for Bennelong referred to this-page 437 of the Hancock report called for discussions to take place between the Commonwealth and New South Wales with a view to abolishing the CIT. One argument suggests that the reason for the current bill is that the CIT could not resolve quickly enough the dispute over coal prices in April this year. The argument goes that this indicated that the miners had contempt for the decisions of the CIT. As one of those who supported the April strike over coal prices, I supported the right of the miners of Australia to protest against the stupid practices of Australian negotiators who sell our coal on an ad hoc basis to the Japanese. I have told the story many times in this chamber about all the Australian coal producers being held up in a hotel-usually a luxury one-in the centre of Tokyo and then being called in one by one to negotiate with the centralised negotiating body of the Japanese, which always is probing to find the weakest point. Inevitably, it does find it. When it finds it and the first of the coal producers caves in, there is a mad scramble to get volume. It usually means a cut in the price of coal. In order to keep the price up, they want to get volume. I do not think the arguments about the CIT hold any water. Anyone who cares about the price we gain for our exports, especially with such an important natural resource as our coal, would have supported that dispute in April. It highlighted the commercial corruption being engaged in which is costing us dearly and which urgently needs to be addressed for the sake of this important industry and our nation. It has also been reported in the media and other places that the CFMEU was opposed to the abolition of the CIT. I have already paid tribute to the CFMEU for the role it has played. It is certainly true that the union and a number of my colleagues, myself included, were against the wholesale abolition of the CIT. However, the union and my other colleagues-unlike the coal employers, who simply wished the CIT away, or the opposition who would abolish it with no questions asked-decided to mount a very strong case for retaining and transferring to the AIRC the most positive and effective features of the CIT. This has been achieved. The CIT has served Australia very well since it was established. It has been argued that, by placing the coal mining industry into the mainstream of industrial relations, perhaps now the coal industry can experience the same flexibility, productivity and general efficiencies experienced by other industries. The Australian Coal Association, in a media release yesterday welcoming this legislation, has made the point that 'it will benefit both employees and employers by providing opportunities and competitiveness'. These views, however, seem to ignore the fact that the CIT has been exemplary in implementing the government's award restructuring policy objectives. In fact, every available industrial relations indicator suggests that the coal industry is ahead of any other Australian industry in development of the Industrial Relations Commission's 1988 structural efficiency principle and the 1991 enterprise bargaining package. No-one can deny that the coal industry has been exceptional in the pace and degree of workplace reform, productivity growth and enterprise bargaining. This has been facilitated by the CIT through its low-key, non-technical approach which has allowed the employers and the unions to sort out their problems directly. I believe the legislative package that is now before the House will allow this industry focused, non-legalistic approach to continue. The main problem in my mind at the moment is the employer fixation on throwing all industrial relations issues to the enterprise level. This ignores the benefits to be gained from an industry level approach. In keeping with the union's dedication to the coal industry, it has made the valid proposition that a vision statement should be adopted for the industry which will commit both industry parties to work together at peak levels. I understand that the employers are still dragging their feet on this particular issue. However, I would commend it as something to discuss. I have no doubt that the CFMEU will continue to push it. The coal industry has always had a high level of enterprise bargaining. An average of 25 per cent of weekly earnings is negotiated on a site by site basis, and has been for decades. In fact, it can be said that the CIT pre-empted the current enterprise focus by more than 40 years. This bargaining preceded formal enterprise bargaining in the AIRC. Bargaining in the coal industry takes place at at least two and sometimes three levels-the industry, company and site levels. In keeping with the anti-union focus of some employers, like CRA, many want all wages and conditions to be negotiated at the enterprise level. This idea is about giving greater power to the employer in dealing with these issues. It seeks to reduce and eliminate the award safety net and is at odds with achieving Australia's economic national objectives. Enterprise agreements now cover over 60 per cent of all blue-collar workers in the coal industry and over 50 per cent of production. This figure is much higher than all other industries, except metals, the federal public sector and some parts of the construction industry. Productivity growth has been over five per cent since 1980. It has been over seven per cent in the last two years. Productivity growth has outstripped wages growth, which has led to falls in real unit labour costs. This producadoption tivity growth of seven per cent is double and triple that of most other Australian industries. This growth has occurred despite falls in investment. It is the result of working harder and smarter rather than having new capital equipment. Despite this bill, the current industrial relations framework of the industry is not the source of its problem. The press statement of the Australian Coal Association, which I have already referred to in this debate, makes light of this. The problems stem from companies which are unprofitable, not because they cannot achieve high productivity growth but because they cannot get decent prices for their coal. For instance, the price cuts which were negotiated earlier this year-up to $US3.85 per tonne-had the same effect on coal industry revenue as the wage increase per employee of $500 per week. No amount of workplace reform is going to solve this problem. As usual, the unions-in this case the CFMEU-and the government provide a convenient scapegoat for employers and the opposition who are unwilling to reform or take responsibility for reforming unfair market arrangements in countries like Japan. When there is an unwillingness to do thisand that is the position of the local coal employees and the opposition, which supports and claims to represent them, although there will be a few questions on that now-the response must be to pass on the cost of those mistakes to the work force. So if an employee, a hard working coal miner, is told to work harder for less, as members of the government we lose taxation revenue, with a consequent flow-on effect throughout the community. Integrating the CIT into the AIRC solves an administrative problem. However, the problem which besets the industry is based on the price gain for Australian coal exports. The coal industry has already achieved significant or-if one wants to be extravagantphenomenal workplace reform and productivity growth, which is yet to be matched in other areas. I referred earlier to the proposal by the CFMEU contained in the union's submission to the Taylor inquiry, which recommends the of an agreed vision statement between the unions and the peak employee groups. This would, I understand, involve the development of an explicit partnership between employees and the unions to achieve industry reform and set goals for the industry. But, as I also said earlier, the coal employees are dragging their feet on this matter. They have yet to agree to the proposal in principle, let alone in any other way. I commend this legislation to the House and sympathise with the opposition. (TIme expired)",47
28,Mr MCGAURAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), on behalf of the United Mineworkers Federation, has given the victor's speech. There is no doubt that this legislation before the house reflects what the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), the member for Throsby and their colleagues have pushed for in notices of motion, 90-second statements and other industrial relations debates. Members opposite have got what they wanted on behalf of John Maitland and the United Mineworkers Federation. They have rolled their own minister The member for Throsby tried to portray this as being something of a defeat for the opposition. The one who has lost out is the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), because the submission of the United Mineworkers Federation of August has been incorporated-namely, that the Coal Industry Tribunal remain a separate panel within the Industrial Relations Commission. I notice that the member for Throsby disingenuously claims that the CIT has been integrated into the IRC. Rather, it has been attached. The other thing that the UMW called for under this legislation is that the IRC must take into consideration previous decisions by the Coal Industry Tribunal. There is no doubt about the fact that the United Mineworkers Federation has carried the day. So the long history of the last 12 months, incorporating three national strikes, totalling some 12 days, has paid off. The relevant unions have had their lackeys doing their bidding in this chamber. There is no use the member for Throsby trying to portray this as an unhappy result for the opposition; it is the Minister Industrial Relations who is feeling the most uncomfortable. We have vague generalities about the role of the Coal Industry Tribunal within the Industrial Relations Commission. It is so very imprecise. It will operate as a separate panel, yet the government tries to portray it, unconvincingly, as absorption into the IRC. We can do nothing other than read the legislation to mean that the CIT's previous decisions must influence later considerations by the IRC-or do they not? Perhaps the minister-or other members of the government who are to contribute-will clarify for us whether the IRC will be bound by the CIT's previous decisions. It is not explicit in the language, but that is the hope of the UMW. The member for Throsby-to deal with him very quickly-tried to maintain that the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has one set of rules regarding compulsory unionism for the trade union movement and another for professional associations. The member for Bennelong, for as long as I have known him-12 years-has sought to abolish compulsory membership of professional associations, as he has for trade unions. The last point concerning the honourable member for Throsby I want to dwell on is that he pointed to the statements by coal employers, who have welcomed this legislation. Of course they welcome this legislation, because it is an improvement on what has gone before it. Of course the attachment of the Coal Industry Tribunal as a separate panel within the mainstream industrial relations system would be welcomed by employers. They have had to suffer for decades the absurdities of the Coal Industry Tribunal. It has built up this culture of antagonism between employer and employee for far too long. After all, the Hancock inquiry of 1983, the Niland report of 1989 and the Industry Commission report of 1991 have all recommended genuine integration of the CIT into the mainstream industrial relations system. You only have to study the history of the Coal Industry Tribunal to see what a detrifor mental effect it has had on the coal industryour largest export earner-and consequently on the jobs of UMW members. Let us go through some of the classic decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal which the honourable member for Throsby, the honourable member for Hunter, the honourable member for Charlton and the UMW would have us believe will continue in perpetuity. They do not see the role of the Coal Industry Tribunal being watered down; otherwise they would tell us. Do they really believe that the operations of the Coal Industry Tribunal are going to change in the future? I would be genuinely interested to know, because as soon as they say that the role of the CIT is going to change in the future then the UMW will be on the phone and into their offices. In 1983 three pit ponies were still being used at an underground mine. The union objected to proposals to retire the horses. A dispute was formally notified in 1986 and the union's position was upheld. The horses were retired only when the union consented in 1989 after three years of very inconclusive inspections and hearings. Another classic case was where a company decided to retrench 140 employees from a mine which had suffered prolonged losses. The local coal authority interpreted a site agreement to mean that they could not retrench those employees unless less senior employees at a nearby better performing mine were retrenched first. So the employees all went out on strike. As a result, 280 workers had to be retrenched. Here is another example given by the NSW Coal Association. A dispute arose between a company and two unions over whether crane drivers or tradesmen should operate a small lifting device attached to a maintenance truck. The dispute led to an order by the local coal authority that tradesmen should operate the device when lifting equipment on and off the vehicle, but a crane driver had to be called if the device was used to hold parts in position while they worked on them. Another widely publicised example given by the Coal Association and never challenged by the UMW was that in 1993 the miners union sought enforcement of an alleged industry practice of recruitment only from union retrenchment lists. Unions threatened national industrial strife if they could not maintain their closed shop and provide the list of employees available to a mine. The Coal Industry Tribunal found that custom and practice at the mine was recruitment from the retrenchment list and that the practice was reasonable, and it ordered the practice to be continued. The CIT is just a dinosaur in industrial relations terms and has the effect of continuing this isolationist attitude that the United Mineworkers Federation perpetuates. So long as the coal industry has to put up with union employment lists and closed shops rather than employment on merit, then we are going to have this continual warfare. It is so out of date and unrepresentative of the trade union movement at large and certainly the Australian community. The industry still suffers roster arrangements that are inflexible. There is overmanning in some places, and absenteeism remains a serious problem. Honourable members who seek to preserve the Coal Industry Tribunal as a separate panel, with all of its traditions and powers, within the Industrial Relations Commission are doing a disservice to the very people, the unionists, they pretend to represent. From 1 July the coal industry will be formally a part of the Industrial Relations Commission. The present head of the CIT will become a deputy president of the IRC. He will be in charge of the panel dealing with the coal industry and possibly with other matters. Again I ask: why is this so vague? Why is the legislation so generalised? Will the CIT panel consider other industrial relations matters? Have government members and the minister misled the United Mineworkers Federation? If I were John Maitland I would be asking the government some hard questions. Is the in government conning the union? Is it playing a double game? Does it really want full integration-in the true sense of the word, and not as the honourable member for Throsby used it-over a period of time by stealth so that John Maitland and the UMWU will not know what is happening, or if they do it will be too late to do anything about it? Why isn't the government more honest? Why will it not reveal the full details, as it would with any other aspect of the Industrial Relations Commission? The Industrial Relations Commission will be required to have regard to any decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal that are relevant to matters before the commission. How much more evasively can legislation be drafted than that? That can only lead to the conclusion that the IRC will be largely bound by earlier decisions. Is that the case? Mr Hollis-It is good legislation.",52
29,Mr MCGAURAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is good legislation if what the government is doing is playing a double game and trying to dishonestly lure the United Mineworkers Federation into the CIT by stealth. The industrial relations record of the coal industry is shocking. It is appalling. It is a matter of national shame. While the coal industry has only 0.3 per cent of the nation's labour force, it accounts for 12 per cent of working days lost through industrial disputes. The coal industry lost 3,288 days per 1,000 employees through industrial disruption in 1993. The all-industry average was 108 days. The four-day strike in September 1993, the six-day strike from 27 February to 4 March -. _ _ _ _-I--I----""C-("",,""-d_ _ _ _ _ _ __ l<;?S,-l--------+-+--------1994, and the two-day strike called off on 19 April 1994 have been at an enormous cost to the industry. The industrial dispute statistics of the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that there was an increase of 146 per cent in the number of working days lost in the coal mining industry between the 1993 and 1994 financial years. That massive increase can be largely explained by the ineffectiveness of specialist industry arrangements. In his famous 19 April 1994 announcement, the Minister for Industrial Relations, angered by the national strike, committed himself and the government to absorbing the Coal Industry Tribunal into the mainstream industrial relations system. The minister has failed his own test of fully absorbing the industry into the commission. How will this specialist panel, the new tribunal, be any more able to control the industry and change the culture than the previous one? Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a graph prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the record of industrial disputes in the coal industry. Leave granted. The graph read as follows_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Industrial Disputes: \Vorking [)a-'s Lost r1l'r Tholl-aJld Employees All Industries",54
30,Mr MCGAURAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I was intrigued by the member for Throsby's description of the skill and sensitivity shown within government ranks in reaching this point. Is the honourable member referring to the same skilful and sensitive Minister for Industrial Relations whom the Secretary of the Newcastle Trades Hall Council, Peter Barrack, in a letter dated 20 October 1994 which was widely circulated to members of parliament and to the labour movement at large, called for the resignation of? Mr Barrack said: To mention the Minister's name in any forum of working people and Labor supporters is to bring howls of derision, anger and outbursts of obscenities against him. His credibility within the Hunter industrial movement would probably be less than the Shadow Minister John Howard, ie. people can distinguish little difference, only that Laurie is a member of the Labor party. In the Hunter region it is argued forcibly that Laurie was indirectly responsible for the loss of the two safest seats in New South Wales ie. Swansea and Newcastle in the 1987 NSW elections. The Government should be warned that while Laurie Brereton remains Minister for Industrial Relations it will not be possible to mobilise the level of rank and file involvement in the electoral process that was achieved in 1993. There will be passive non-participation. And he goes on to heap further abuse on the Minister for Industrial Relations. So I would call upon the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who are constituents of the Newcastle Trades Hall Council, to either endorse the comments of Mr Barrack or dissociate themselves from those comments and support instead their Minister for Industrial Relations. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) should not try to pretend that there has been any great skill and sensitivity in this: it has been a bloody, drawn out battle between the Minister for Industrial Relations on one side, and John Maitland and the United Mineworkers on the other side, with all of you opting to support the trade union involved. Why? One of the worse features of the industry is the culture that has arisen within the United Mineworkers Federation. Those who saw the profile on John Maitland and the United Mineworkers in the colour magazine of the Sydney Morning Herald some three or four weeks ago will have been very disappointed in what they read. One cannot help but have some personal respect for John Maitland because of his varied skills and personality, but one must condemn him for propagating this separation between employees and employers which is all so unnecessary. Let me quote from the article of 22 October this year. It says: Near Bowenwhich is in Queensland, of coursewe leave the coast and wind through low hills on the final leg to Collinsville. Maitland's previous visit here was on May Day. 'You'll see what I mean,' he says. 'Ask a miner how he gets on with the managers and he'll say, ""P. .. ing terrible!"" Ask management, and they'll say, ""Bloody miners are impossible"", and blah, blah, blah.' The reporter asks if it is some sort of act, and Maitland's response is: In a way, yeah. Because mostly we all get on very well. [Misrepresenting] one another is part of the culture. That might sound crazy, but it's just traditional: it's the way things are. Are the jobs of United Mineworkers members not more important than some sort of game or ideological warfare that union leaders like Maitland indulge in? There is an interesting part later on about one of the public meetings. I will quote from the article so that nobody thinks I am misrepresenting his words. It says: Maitland reminds the meeting how he personally handed over the union's $200,000 donation to the ALP before the last Federal election . . . How is that? He has enriched the Labor party's election coffers with $200,000. No wonder he has so many spokesmen in this chamber: you are so beholden to him. I really despise more than anything else the comments by a local lodge president at the Collinsville coal site. I will just call him 'Moscow'; there is no need to mention his surname. 'Moscow' is his favoured address, and that is fair enough. However, the same article says: Lodge president 'Moscow' ... explains how the company's new human-resources manager, a woman, thought it would be 'civilised' for the two of them to have a drink together at the workers' club. Moscow laughs and laughs at the idea. 'I told her she could drink there, but not with me! 'The boys'd think 1 was a traitor-they hired a woman to disarm us: she thought she was gunna make us respectable. That's why, at our first meeting with her, we decided to go in hard. 'Honestly,' he hoots, 'I've never ""f ... ed"" tIc ... ed' so much in my life!' That is just brilliant, is it not? Why do not condemn that? Forget the sexist aspect it all. Just consider the human cruelty. He wanted to rough her up, firstly because she a woman-and that is obvious throughout his remarks-and secondly because she wanted indicate some sort of sensible working relationship. There was no dialogue; there was no searchable ing for common ground so that they could benefit the employees and the future viability of the mines. Oh, no! Moscow just wanted rough up a woman, just to give him some personal pleasure. Mr Snowdon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. A lot of latitude has been allowed in this debate, but this is beyond pale. The member should refer to the legislacircumstances tion and start debating the issues within the legislation.",55

32,Mr MCGAURAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"More specifically, Mr Deputy Speaker, my worry is that the legislaopposition tion before the House, which will continue Coal Industry Tribunal by another guise in the Industrial Relations Commission, will perpetuall ate this culture which is so destructive to most important export industry and which will lead to the loss of jobs. Workplace inefficienthe cies and the unnecessary division between employers and employees will continue. I do not see how anybody on either side of this House, let alone within the trade movement at large, can endorse the deliberate tactics of John Maitland and the UMW to maintain this conflict. There is an opportunity vindictive. for employers and employees to work together for the benefit of both, but that is being constantly squandered by the UMW and that situation is now being entrenched and formalised by the legislation before the House. The Coal Industry Tribunal will live to fight another day. (TIme expired)",56
33,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"From the outset I indicate my personal support for this legislation. I indicate that you support within the context of some reservaof tions that I have about some aspects of the just agreement that has been reached and about is some details that I would have preferred to see included in the legislation. I want to my general support for the legislation because I think it represents a really remarkoutcome on the part of a government which is prepared to negotiate, to consult and to compromise as is necessary and to come to to mature, sensible and constructive arrangements with the trade union movement. In particular, in this case, it is an arrangement with the United Mineworkers Federation, a trade union which has shown itself on many the occasions to be better informed about the of the coal industry and the importance of the coal industry to Australia, and about the future possible direction of the coal industry in Australia, than many of those who purport to be the experts. The miners federation has traditionally been right when it has adopted a position, when it has interpreted a set of circumstances and when There is no it has offered solutions. I think it really reflects unfavourably on the that the member for Bennelong the (Mr Howard), the shadow minister for industrial relations, indicates in his amendment that words after 'That' should be omitted with our a view to substituting words indicating that, while not opposing the passage of this bill, House does three things. I am not going to read those three things. They have already been read out, and they are on the public record. But I will say this: those three actions union suggested by the member for Bennelongpresumably with the support of the opposition-are petty, they are nasty, and they are What the opposition is attempting to prove with that amendment I simply do not know. What the suggested actions do prove, probably without the opposition's intention, is a complete lack of understanding of the realities of industrial relations in Australia. They prove a complete lack of any empathy, understanding or sympathy for trade unions which are legitimately and honourably pursuing for their constituents the objectives which they have a responsibility to pursue-in this case, with John Maitland doing it admirably. Mr Hollis-They hate the trade unions.",56
34,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The evidence is in all of the actions that they take and all of the things that they say, showing-as the honourable member for Throsby indicates-a certain lack of feeling for, affection for, or understanding of, the Australian trade union movement. The outcome of those negotiations has been nothing short of successful, in anyone's estimation. I said that I have some reservations. Anyone concerned about the operation of the coal mining industry and the effectiveness, the coordination and the consistency of government policy would be concerned about any particular outcome which is not thrust down people's necks-which is not arrived at as a result of donning the jackboots and going in in a confrontationist way, which is quite clearly the approach that would have been preferred by the opposition. I want to emphasise to the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) that, although he comes from a rural constituency and a rural background, he now has a responsibility on behalf of the opposition to become better informed about the industries for which he is responsible and also to develop a little bit of understanding about the nature of coal mining and its importance, and the sorts of ways that we need to address the problems that exist there. He has to understand that there were extensive negotiations, as there should have been. I hope that, if ever at any time in the future-God forbid-the opposition becomes the government, it will show an equally responsible approach to the need to negotiate with interest groups in the community. That includes, absolutely, the trade union movement. It was not a confrontationist approach. It was an exercise in open door negotiations and open door politics. It was an exercise in access, both by the union and by the government-both by John Maitland and by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). It was an exercise in contact. It was an exercise in consultation, in negotiation and in agreement. Where agreement could not be reached, there was an understanding between them that they would disagree on those issues. There were at the end of that negotiation process some outstanding issues, which are still unresolved. One is in connection with the intrusion of legalism into the whole area of industrial relations in Australia. Let me sayabsolutely, forcefully and emphatically-that I support any proposition to seek to reduce the area of legalism in industrial relations. I would prefer to see a reduction in legalism in all areas of human relationships. What is needed in industrial relations, as in other forms of human relationships, is an understanding, a maturity, an ability, a willingness to consult and to negotiate. We do not need silk in that process, nor do we need to indulge ourselves in the lUXUry of the costs of employing the silk so that men and women cannot sit around a table and discuss things without looking to the person on their right or their left and saying, ' Mr or Mrs QC, how do we respond to that?' That is not mature, it is not sensible and it is not conducive to sensible results. Another area in which I share a lot of the union concern relates to the whole application of what we refer to as the EFAs, the enterprise flexibility agreements, in relation to the coal mining industry. In terms of unionism, the coal mining industry has traditionally been a closed shop. I endorse that. I was born into a coal mining community of about 600 or 800 people and my family were coalminers. My father carted timber to the pits in order to hold up the roof under which my uncles, my grandfathers and my cousins hewed coal. I know the way in which they depended upon one another, not only for their security in the mine but also for their security within communities and for their security, one to the other, in the conditions which they fought bloody hard to get. So I strongly support unionism, and I say emphatically that within the coal mining industry I support compulsory unionism. Without those unions a lot of those people, families and communities that have survived through and within that industry would not have survived. The coal industry is in fact the most highly unionised industry in Australia, almost 100 per cent, including the administrative and clerical workers. That makes a total of about 30,000 people, all of them committed to principle of unionism and to the protection the values of unionism. The industry has long and a proud history of effective industhis trial representation by trade unions, the United Mineworkers Federation, included now in larger national union structure, and before the Miners Federation, as we always referred to it. It is one of the most advanced sectors with respect to enterprise bargaining, which has already been undertaken in the coal industry. Let me emphasise that the cooperseen ation of the coal mining unions and coalminers and the leaders of the coal unions has resulted in a level of enterprise agreements which at least as high as the best results in Australia and higher than most. These enterprise flexibility agreements specifically designed to cover lowly unionised industries. My colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) indicated that in his second reading speech. He said: To provide access to the non-union sector, enterment. prise flexibility agreements will operate for ployers and employees at an enterprise who are subject to federal award coverage. So, on the basis of that sort of qualification, it is not necessarily something which is appropriate for coal mining, which is already highly unionised. I believe that unions have a role and must have a role in the development of enterprise agreements. Never let us move away from that, whether we are social democrats or democratic socialists on this side of the chamber or whether we are more conservative members of the coalition. If we their have any understanding of the history of industrial relations and the history of unionism in Australia and the achievements of unionism in Australia, if we have any understanding of those things at all, we will recognise the important role which trade unions have traditionally played in Australia. I do not believe that EFAs are needed in the coal industry, nor do I believe they are appropriate. I believe that their use in the coal industry could be as a deunionising strategy such as has occurred in other sectors. It has been suggested to me, 'Look, Bob, you do not the have to worry about that because the coal mining industry is already highly unionised, so it the is obvious that unions will have to be inof volved in the development of those enterprise a agreements.' But, Mr Deputy Speaker, I put proposition to you: at some time in the future, with the application of this type of a enterprise bargaining, there will be a new it coalmine opened and employees will be employed in that mine on the basis of their not being a member of the union and on the basis of their entering into individual contracts with the employer. We have already evidence of that happening, and that is a matter which will be resolved in due course in the normal course of industrial relations is and, I would hope, with a minimum of industrial conflict. But I would not hold my breath until there was any form of guarantee that that were is going to be avoided. I mentioned the whole question of the legal profession accessing industrial tribunals. I emphasise again that it is not appropriate in any type of mature, adult negotiating arrangeI think it is very unfortunate that when emthe more recent period of more intense negotiations and consultation started between the minister and the national President of the United Mineworkers Federation, John Maitland, and their advisers and their colleagues, but particularly those two fellows, it started in an unfavourable way, in an undesirable way. You will recall that earlier in this year we had 20,000 coal miners taking industrial action. They were not taking action over wages or over conditions; they were not taking action over safety factors; they were not taking action over accumulated disputes with coal owners or coal managers. Those 20,000 coal miners were sacrificing their income, they were sacrificing their families' welfare, they were sacrificing their material security and comfort in order to seek to protect the Australian coal industry and to seek to protect Australian coal export earnings. That is why they were demonstrating. That is why they were on strike. That is why they were forfeiting their income. I believe now that it was probably coincidental that Minister Brereton announced that the government was going to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal. He said that the government proposed to bring the coal industry under the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. There was an unfortunate conjunction of circumstances at that time. It was widely interpreted as a preemptive and punitive attack on coalminers and on their union. But I am now convinced that the association of events was more coincidental than deliberate. However, it was unfortunate that the minister referred to what he described as the union's contempt for the tribunal's rulings in the context of that announcement about his proposal. There is overwhelming, undeniable and growing evidence that Australia's coal exports are being directed to buyers who play Australian coal suppliers off against one another to the disadvantage of Australian coal exporters, coalminers, the coal mining communities and Australia's export earnings. That loss of Australian export earnings could have amounted to about $30 billion over the last 10 years. That represents about 20 per cent of Australia's total net foreign debt. It could be as high as that. I believe it is a figure approaching that. I will have more to say about that issue later, but I simply make the point now that the Rae Taylor inquiry agreed to take the evidence of the coal mining executives in camera. Why did it choose to do that? Why was it prevailed upon to do that and why did it choose to do that? It chose to do that because of the concern that any adverse evidence given by coal mining executives to that inquiry about some overseas coal buyers would lead to possible punitive, retaliatory action against them by overseas coal buyers. There is plenty more evidence, and I will refer to that from time to time. In the Australian Journal of Mining in May of this year, the Executive Director of the New South Wales Coal Association, Richard John, was reported as having made this statement: Coal is no different from the rest of Australian industry and the inward-looking, industry-focused Coal Industry Tribunal is inappropriate to a leading export industry. An outward-looking, enterprisefocused system, as applies under the Industry Relations Commission, is vital to the coal industry's international competitiveness. His opening words were, 'Coal is no different from the rest of Australian industry.' Let me say very clearly, very firmly and very emphatically that it is different. The coal mining industry is the most dangerous large-scale industry in Australia, or for that matter anywhere in the world. Explosions, gas and roof cave-ins cause injury and death to hundreds of coalminers. I said earlier I was born into a coal mining community. I was born into a coal mining family in Pelaw Main on the northern coalfields. Every family in that town-it was a pit town-had the scars of either family injury or family death. The graves in the cemeteries of the northern coalfields bear testimony to some of the disasters which have occurred there. I said my father carted pit timber to hold up the roofs under which my grandfathers, my uncles and my cousins dug coal. My grandfather died of lung disease which had been compounded by coaldust. He left a young widow with seven children. My uncle also died in his early 30s from similar causes. In the primary school that I went to, when the pit whistle went during the day the class would freeze because the pit whistle did not go unless some accident or something similar had happened. The kids would wonder whether it was dad or grandad or Uncle Tom or an older brother who could have been injured or killed. So do not let anyone, including the Executive Director of the New South Wales Coal Association, tell me that the coal industry is the same as every other industry; it is not. Nor should anyone try to tell that to the people of Moura, where in the last 20 years I think about 35 men have been killed in a community of 2,000 people. Do not let anyone ever tell me that there is nothing special or especially difficult about the coal mining industry. Furthermore, all of these factors tend to occur in isolated or remote areas where coal is the only substantial economic support. In the area I come from, up until the 1950s there were 24 operating coal mines; there is now one and it has been open since then, all the others having closed. The closures were particularly difficult for those communities, which depended so exclusively on coal. The fact that we were close to Newcastle meant that other opportunities became available, but that is not always the case in remote areas. The coal industry is also the biggest export earner, so it is important to Australia generally. It provides $71/2 biIIion per year at the present time. Time will not allow me to go on to indicate other factors about the coal mining industry which make it unique. When an industry is unique and deserving of unique responses and unique arrangements, it should be provided with them. (TIme expired)",57
35,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise today to speak about the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment BiII which, as the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has so vividly pointed out, concerns the coal industry and the issue of the Coal Industry Tribunal, a specialist industrial relations tribunal dealing with matters inherently sensible only to the coal industry, its work force and its management. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has handled this particular matter particularly poorly. But that is not really surprising because the Minister for Industrial Relations has rolled over so many times in the last year and a half that it is now getting difficult to count them. This is just one more example of a Minister for Industrial Relations backflip. On this side of the House we have decided to call him the minister for chaos. On 18 October Hansard records that the minister said: People can attack me all they like over the Civil Aviation Authority or anything else, but no-one ever say that I have shirked a difficult reform or that I have shirked a difficult job. The minister also told Lateline in October: I am confident that at the end of the day, the Government will achieve its objective of mainstreaming the coal industry into the rest of the industrial relations system. But on 11 October he rolled over again. Why? Because John Maitland, President of the United Mineworkers Federation said, 'Laurie, it ain't on.' He told Mr Brereton that it was not on; the union was not going to let him do what had been recommended as far back as the Hancock commission. It was back in 1985 that the Hancock inquiry recommended full abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal. The federal Department of Industrial Relations at that time backed the inquiry and agreed with its recommendation to fully subsume this specialist tribunal within the general purpose industrial relations arena. The member for Charlton argues that this is a very special industry and a very special trade. I do not disagree with him, but so is the tuna industry, and so is the house building industry, and so is the multistorey building industry, and so is the cattle industry, and so is the sheep industry. We have thousands upon thousands of different industries around Australia. Logic tells me that the best industrial relations system would allow each workplace and each work force to negotiate its conditions of employment and get on with the job, but in Australia we have a centralised system to deal with these matters. The member for Charlton is right that industrial relations has a long history and that at Federation both sides of the House accepted centralised industrial relations mechanisms. Perhaps there was different emphasis on the issues, but for a very long time it was largely a bipartisan agreement. But this minister has not brought anything into the House that has been dealt with in a bipartisan manner. This issue today is just one more example of how divisive and how confused this minister is. What he has given us now does not fully subsume the tribunal within the Industrial Relations Commission but rather can brings it within the ambit of the Industrial Relations Commission as a specialist panel. The real hooker is that that panel must take account of prior determinations in the industry by the Coal Industry Tribunal. If the commission is supposed to operate properly, why on earth does it have to take account of prior decisions? Why can management and the coal unions not come to agreement about a particular aspect of their working hours, their pay rates or how the industry operates and take it to the commissioner to have it ratified? Why, if it decides to do something different, does it have to take account of prior decisions? It beats the heck out of me. This minister has a long history of having problems. Fia Cumming in Mates talked a little bit about Laurie Brereton back in his early days, when he was 22. She said: Apart from his smart jacket, Brereton did not look the part of an MP . . . he still rode a motor at speeds which terrified onlookers and the occasional passenger. I pranged the bike eventually, took a big piece of my side and had a couple of weeks off work ... I pranged the bike because I was just in too much of a hurry, that's all: I dropped it on a wet road, greasy road, just a bit too anxious to get somewhere on time. Nothing too serious; I just looked around for a while and decided that bikes were for temporary Australians, and I deserved a degree of more permanence than that. Bob Carr, on reflecting on this-and here is the interesting point-says: I remember Keating saying to us once, There's something wrong with a political system where this bloke could become Minister for Transport! Well, he did, didn'the? We are stuck with him as Minister for Transport, Minister for Industrial Relations and minister for backflips. How many have we gone through? It started with the Industrial Relations Reform Act, which was going to be the mother of change in the industrial relations arena in Australia. It was going to give employers who had non-union work forces the opportunity to negotiate directly with their work forces on strike agreements. It was going to reduce awards over time to core conditions and really expand the enterprise bargaining system. But what it did was re-regulate the industry. The member for Charlton said two things today that I want to talk about briefly. He said he was all for reducing legalism and regulation in the area of industrial relations. I agree with him; but legalism is exactly what the minister reintroduced into the system when be brought in the Industrial Relations Reform Act. The system is now so legalistic and so complex that even the practitioners cannot sort out how it is supposed to operate, and neither can the commissioners. They themselves are confused about what the limits of their powers are. The limits of those powers are becoming terribly concerning. Last week the Industrial Relations Commission gave the teachers' unions in Victoria the right to sit on a panel to determine which new teachers a principal at a state owned high school or primary bike, school will hire. The new Kennett government set up a system called schools of the future. That allows a committee made up largely of parents, with oversight by the education department, to hire its own principal, and it out allows the principal to select his staff. But the Industrial Relations Commission says, 'No. There has to be a veto over a principal having the right to hire his own staff.' If we spread that throughout the community, we will have to give the unions the right of veto over hiring for every private company and every public sector employer in Australia. Is that what the member for Charlton wants? I think it is probably not. It is increasing the regulation and the legalism of the system beyond acceptable bounds. The member for Charlton also supports compulsory union membership. I find those two views to be diametrically opposed. They are completely incompatible. In the first place, his view that we should have compulsory union membership is absolutely patronising. How about all those people in the gallery? How about the eight million Australians in the work force today? The member for Charlton says, 'None of you is capable of making decisions by yourself. You need a union bureaucrat to make the decisions for you. You have to have the protection of a union bureaucrat.' What a lot of nonsense. That is absolute nonsense, and it is absolutely opposed to his concept that we should have less regulation in industry. What does he want to do? Does he want to deregulate the industries and let the unions run the whole country? That gets right down to the crux of the matter of what the member for Charlton very possibly-I do not want to accuse the member unfairly-is indicating that he will support. The minister for rollovers",60
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member should address the minister by his correct title.,62
37,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister for Industrial Relations and Transport, who has rolled over so many times that I cannot count them, certainly did so with respect to the ANL issue. In August 1994 the minister said he could not give ANL away. Two weeks later he did a deal with the Maritime Union that is costing the government somewhere between $28 and $40 million a year. For what? We really do not know what. All we know is that he made an absolute statement, in public, that ANL was worthless and not of any account whatsoever. Then what did he do? He sold part of it, under what appeared to be questionable circumstances with respect to accountingMr Hollis- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have listened to this whole debate and I still fail to see how the sale of ANL has anything to do with the legislation before the House, which is Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), which refers specifically to the Coal Industry Tribunal. How the member for La Trobe can draw a comparison between the Coal Industry Tribunal and ANL is beyond me. Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest you direct him to confine his remarks to the legislation before the House.",62
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I have listened to the honourable member for La Trobe very closely. He was drawing an analogy between the conduct of the minister in relation to the coal industry and his conduct in relation to another industry. On that basis, there is no point of order.",62
39,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The minister rolled over on ANL because the unions put pressure on him. That is exactly what they did with respect to the Industrial Relations Reform Act. He had all those great ideas, but he took his eye off the ball. The union heavies came down on Bill Kelty and told Bill Kelty what the real story was: they were not going to accept what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had said on 21 April to the institute of company directors. They were not going to accept the legislation that the minister was proposing, and they rolled him over. Because of a rollover, we got all the legalism and regulation that the member for Charlton does not want. ANL was an absolute rollover. We have not yet heard the last of that either. I refer to waterfront reform. In May, the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994 was brought into this place to reintroduce an employees register to entrench preferences for existing waterfront employees. It absolutely contradicted everything that the government has said and promised that it would reform outdated practices operating on the waterfront. Time and time again, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations have come into this place and talked about what a wonderful experience the waterfront reform has been, how well we now perform and how we are moving more containers per hour. But the minister, under pressure from his union mates, wanted to bring back employee registers again. As I recall, the minister got rolled on the sale of airports. The minister said, 'We're going to sell Australia's airports.' What happened was that he went off to the conference down in Hobart and found out that he could not sell the airports, but the ALP might let him lease some of the airports. His proposal to privatise those assets has certainly been thwarted. I refer to the trans-Tasman closer economic relations with New Zealand. We had in place an agreement that New Zealand was going to be able to operate in the domestic market in Australia. All of a sudden, the minister and the Prime MinisterMr Hollis-I rise on a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, I heard your ruling before. As you are in the chair, I accept it. But, really, now that we are getting into an air agreement between Australia and New Zealand, I find it very difficult to see how that has got anything to do with the legislation that is concerned with the Coal Industry Tribunal. I know there was a wide ranging debate but, my God, this is just too far wide. I suggest you ask the speaker to confine his remarks to the legislation before the House.",62
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I have looked at the bill very closely and there are amendments of the Industrial Relations (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988. However, I direct the member for La Trobe to return to the substance of the bill.",63
41,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to do that. The point I was trying to make is that, in area after area, this minister is subject to intense pressure lobbying, either by his mates in the ALP or by his mates in the broader union movement. I think that is no better demonstrated than in statements that were made by John Maitland on 11 October, when he was talking to Monica Attard. He said: The minister had given us an undertaking that he would tell us what was taking place with the future of the Coal Industry Tribunal. That didn't happen. That did not happen. The minister did not go and talk to the unions as he promised to. Mr Maitland continued: This was essentially a sneaky act that took place this morning, I think essentially to catch us off guard. Secondly, I had specifically asked the committee-and that is the Economics and Industrial Relations Committeeof the ALP caucus, I assumefor the opportunity to address it on this specific issue. He was denied that, so he was not very happy about it. Monica Attard asked him then what he was going to do about this situation. She said: WeB, the Industrial Relations Minister, Mr Breretonit is Monica Attard talkinghas defended the changes to the Coal Industry Tribunal. He says the tribunal will continue to operate in a modified form for at least the years before it's integrated into the mainstream industrial relations system. That was on 11 October, and now we have a different situation again. So this particular proposal has changed and changed. I return to what the member for Charlton had to say earlier when he referred to the necessity for those people who want to work in coal mines and in the broader coal industry to be members of the union. It is clear the preference for trade unions is desired by the trade union officials, and the reason for that is fairly obvious: the more members, the more money; the more money, the more the control; the larger the bureaucracy in the union movement, the more control it has over the industry. It has been pointed out time and time again, however-by no lesser people than the Industry Commission and the OECD-that if Australia wants to be competitive in international circles it needs to free up its industrial relations system and needs to allow flexibility. Why do we need that flexibility? It is because specific areas such as the coal industry need to modernise their operations, need to modernise their thinking, need to modernise their approach. The individuals who work in that industry need to be able to participate in making that industry profitable. If they cannot, there will not be any jobs there tomorrow and there will not be any jobs for their children the day after tomorrow. Without an enhanced degree of flexibility we have little hope of modernising our economy and stopping the inexorable rise of interest rates, which shortly will start to kill off demand and slow our growth. Without basic, essential change to allow freedom of choice in our industrial relations system, we are not going to make the gains in the rest of this century that we desperately need to make in order to modernise our economy.",63
42,Ms HENZELL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Capricornia) (2.01 p.m.)I am delighted to speak in support of the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994, particularly in relation to the amendments that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) foreshadowed this morning. I oppose absolutely and unequivocally the next two amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). When one reads the three items in the proposed amendment it is seen as suitable for an MPI, as possibly it will be. My response to that proposed amendment is, 'Why not hit us with a feather duster or a limp lettuce leaf?' If the best that an amendment to a bill that we are seriously debating in this house can do is to admonish the minister, how is that going to effect good government or improve the working of a bill before the House? It is just a pathetic response to the fact that, as has been mentioned by my colleagues the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and-in the second reading speech-the Minister for Industrial Relations on this matter the opposition once more has nowhere to go. I will refer to the honourable member for Bennelong again later. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) mentioned the donation from the mineworkers union to the ALP. Shock, horror! Fancy, people make donations to political parties! One does not hear this side of the house getting up and saying that because the opposition got so many thousands of dollars from big business it is a captive. I was a recipient of wonderful support from the mineworkers in central Queensland and lowe them a great debt. It helped me to become the member for Capricornia. One can be sure that, irrespective of how much they supported my campaign, I would be representing their interests because I come from a coal mining community and, unlike some of the honourable members opposite, I know the difficulties, I have seen tragedies such as were recounted by my colleague the honourable member for Charlton. We have only to think about the current mining warden's inquiry into the latest Moura disaster to see why the coal industry sees itself as different and unique. The honourable member for Gippsland quoted some statistics. The way statistics are interpreted is the key issue, but I wish to comment on one part of the statistics in the sheet that I think has been incorporated into the Hansard. It is that 50 per cent of all disputes relating to working conditions, including safety, occur in the coal industry. That is a fairly important statistic. Why is that so? It is because of the nature of the work and the danger of the work. It is telling that miners do not strike over irrelevant issues. The miners union is becoming increasingly sophisticated. It strikes on issues such as the future of the industry. That was basically what the major protest in Canberra was about earlier this year. The miners were expressing their concerns about how coal was going to be marketed and how we were going to maintain the coal industry and the coal mining communities of this country. On the issue of work safety and working conditions, the miners have certainly been pro-active. I support that. Obviously those who have lost husbands, sons, fathers and friends in the latest disaster, and in all mining accidents, have suffered long-tenn hurt and stress. The impact on those people's fellow workers has also been critical. I have mentioned before in the House that in the mining towns where I worked I encountered miners from all over the country who had been affected directly or indirectly by mining accidents. Those miners carry a great burden in tenns of stress and ill health which affects them every time they go down the pit. It certainly affects their families. We are dealing with a dangerous industry. That is not to say that there are not other dangerous industries in the wider economic landscape, but there is no doubt that coal mining is a very dangerous industry. I refer to the 75th anniversary meeting of the International Labour Organisation which was held this year. That much maligned person, Mr John Maitland, was at that meeting. As a very important working member of the Safety and Health in Mines Working Party, Mr Maitland was given accolades by an employer representative on that working  about the importance of having the convention ratified. The convention will be further discussed in June 1995, following consultations with governments around the world. I am delighted to indicate that the Australian government is already participating in those consultations with, apart from the CFMEU, other industry groups. This government has always had a very strong commitment to International Labour Organisation conventions. I look forward to the time when this convention on safety and health in mines will be ratified by this government and will provide a benchmark on mine safety in this  John Maitland: Obviously, my preceding comments reflect philosophical differences between ourselves and some of the others involved in this process. Nevertheless, our discussions were conducted in an informative, cooperative and civil manner. Much of the credit for that goes to Mr Maitland, Worker member and Vice-Chairman. While we obviously have different viewpoints and methods, I sincerely admire and respect his devotion and dedication. The much maligned mine workers of Australia play an important role at the international level. Why is it important that, not just in Australia but around the world, we remind ourselves of the importance of safety and health in mines? Mr Bekes, the government adviser from Hungary and Chairman of the Committee on Safety and Health in Mines made a pertinent point when he said: it is considered that over 1 million miners suffer from occupational injury or disease, and around 15,000 miners are killed at their workplaces each year. Once again, the Australian miners are leading the way in improving safety for miners, not only in this country but around the world. I think we should be very proud of their progress in this matter. I want to go back to the contribution from the member for Bennelong, because he has some history of dealing at an industrial relations level with mine workers in this country. The best the opposition has done in this debate is have a go at the federal minister and accuse him of rolling over and backflips, and I will refer to that in a moment. At one stage the member for Bennelong, who is currently opposition spokesperson on industrial relations, was the federal Treasurer. He was Treasurer during a very famous taxation and housing dispute in Blackwater, one of the towns in my electorate. I must remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that coal miners have long memories and they have never forgotten the member for Bennelong and Doug Anthony coming to Blackwater. There were many weeks of industrial disputation, which, as you may recall, was to do with whether mine workers would be taxed on their subsidised housing. I quote from the Financial Review of 2 September 1980: The overall cost of the dispute so far has been calculated at close to $500 million, with most of the burden being carried by the major mining companies, BHP, CSR-Thiess, Central Queensland Coal Associates and the Utah Development Company. These companies have been losing in excess of $25 million a week since the strike began and all declared force majeure before it entered its fourth week. The mining unions last week attempted to offer the Federal Government a compromise under which their housing rental tax could be redefined as a housing allowance. However, this was rejected by the Government on the basis that it did not alter the position the miners found themselves in. It was the unwillingness of the federal Treasurer of the time to negotiate an effective compromise that led to major disruption to the industry and major loss of earnings to the mining industry, mine workers, the Queensland government and the federal government of the time. Of course, in the end a compromise was found and it was the then federal Treasurer who had to do a bit of a backflip. Finally the strike was negotiated when Dr Llew Edwards, at the time the Queensland Treasurer, found some information about previous housing taxation proposals. So let us see what the Australian of 4 September 1980 said in its editorial. It said: Meanwhile, the Treasurer, Mr Howard, the ministers he is leading along his crazy-paving path and his tax experts and draftsmen who are unable to produce a simple form of words to distinguish between genuine cases of deserved housing subsidy and tax dodging lurkies are being stupid and grossly inefficient. It is really all too stupid for words. Yet we have seen this elaborate farce played out on the national stage, at vast cost to the workers, the mining companies and the nation-and at incalculable cost to Australia's international marketing reputation as a reliable supplier. This was what was said at the time and here we have the same person in the chamber today, castigating the minister who has been able to negotiate a solution, accusing him of compromising. We have a number of the main players putting out press releases that are conflicting. Yesterday's Courier-Mail had the following headline on page 20: Howard slams tribunal axing I can quote directly from his press release, and that will give us some assistance. The press release bears this heading: Brereton rolls over on coal industry tribunal The member for Bennelong said in his press release: He has weakly acquiesced again by caving into their demand that the Coal Industry Tribunal be a separate panel within the Australian Industrial Relations Commission instead of fully absorbed within the mainstream. What did the coal owners have to say the very same day? An article on page 20 of the Courier-Mail dated 9 November stated: The Australian Coal Association welcomed the compromise. Its chairman, Bob Humphris, said the move would allow the industry to meet the challenges international competition. That puts paid to the comments of the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in his contribution. The article goes on to state: ""Employers are pleased the minister and unions have come to arrangements which all interested parties find acceptable,"" Mr Humphris said. ""We look forward to an era of greatly improved relations in the industry."" While the member for Bennelong and his colleagues who have spoken in this debate have been bagging the excellently negotiated compromise, the coal owners are getting on with the reality of the situation. In a press release, John Maitland from the CFMEU acknowledged the role of the minister. He stated: ""Also Laurie Brereton must be thanked. He is a tough negotiator but we've worked our way through it all,"" Mr Maitland said. However, Mr Maitland said the union had not got everything it wanted. ""We have agreed to disagree with the government on some matters,"" Mr Maitland said. The position of the CFMEU from day one of this dispute was that it wanted to make sure that the concerns and interests of its members, who provide through their labour a massive export earning capacity to this country, were addressed and that it could negotiate a solution that was in the interests of not only its members but also the industry and the others involved. This press release demonstrates how effective we on this side of the House have been. When we are faced with disagreements and difficulties we work to get a successful compromise. It is on the public record that my colleagues on this side of House, particularly those who represent coal constituencies, have been very active in assisting the minister and Mr Maitland to reach a negotiated solution that addresses the different views held by the parties. We have been able to achieve that because we work together. I am delighted that Mr Maitland had further consultations with the minister and the relevant caucus committees. This is what we do with all other issues of concern to the trade union movement. We do of not resile from that fact. I applaud the government's preparedness to enter into tripartite negotiations and consultations with industry and the trade union movement. It is a great pity that we do not see the same flexibility on the other side of the House. This inflexibility will be the cause of further pain and suffering for the opposition. Until the opposition is prepared to leave to one side its closed ideological positions, it is not going to be seen as having a great deal of credibility either in this place or in the media. It is very disheartening to find the opposition coming forward with pathetic arguments. I have not heard one decent argument from the opposition in this debate and that does not further the cause of good government. Members should note that at the same time as the member for Bennelong is castigating the minister he is also changing his views on his sacred cow-one that he has held very firm for a great deal of time-industrial relations policy generally. In the Sydney Morning Herald on 9 November, Michael Millett reports: The Federal Coalition is ready to abandon its ""big bang"" approach to industrial relations reform, discarding a key element of lobsback to improve its saleability in the run-up to the next election. The honourable member for Bennelong referred to the issue of reviewing the opting in provision. Michael Millett goes on to say: It was designed to trigger a mass exodus from the award system by automatically cancelling Federal awards (the so-called ""big bang""), forcing workers into contract bargaining if they could not reach prior agreement with employers on maintaining their existing arrangements. This was a key issue that went against the opposition in the run-up to the last election. The opposition tried what it could. Its last desperate press releases prior to 13 March indicated that the opposition knew it was on a loser. Whether or not people are union members, they were not prepared to see the safety that unions have given them over the years stripped away. Unless the coalition improves its track record on these matters it will not go out with a big bang, it will go out with a pathetic whimper. It appears the member for Bennelong might well have unrequited ambitions to the leadership, and it is a tribute to the desperation of the opposition that he is once again being resurrected as a possible opposition leader. That will cause more whimpering and pain for the opposition. I commend to the House the minister's bill with the amendments but steadfastly oppose the opposition member's amendment.",63
43,Mrs MOYLAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is interesting that the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), in speaking to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, has focused very heavily on the safety aspects and the particular requirements of the coal industry workers. The coalition and my colleague the shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), fully understand and support any safety initiatives that will make this a better and safer industry in which our workers work. So we do have a full appreciation of that issue. The opposition is concerned about the situation that arose in April this year when the federal government announced that it would abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal because it had outlived its usefulness. That statement was made because the coal workers, in April, did not go out on strike over improved safety and even pay and other conditions in their industry; they went out on strike because they were protesting over the discount coal prices to Japanese buyers. When their own tribunal ordered them back to work, they simply ignored it and carried on with the strike. The opposition is not talking about the changes and requirements necessary to look after the safety and basic working conditions of the coal workers of this country. We are talking about the flagrant abuse of instructions by a tribunal, in this case the matter of protesting over discounted coal prices to Japanese buyers. I think it is very important that we get this clear. The Australian people realise that this coalition is not about not supporting better conditions and safer practices, but about trying to deliver fairness and equity to all Australians in the industrial relations system. At that time, when coal industry workers were protesting over discounted coal prices to Japanese buyers, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was interviewed on radio. He made this comment: Well, let me say, it's been there for a long timethat is, the tribunaland I think it's done a very good job in many respects, but it's equally clear, as a result of the course of action of the Mineworkers' Union over recent months, that the union is not prepared to take any notice of it at all and its orders. And it's against that background that I think it's appropriate that it should be brought within the mainstream of industrial relations in Australia, and that is the Industrial Relations Commission. Those are the words of the Minister for Industrial Relations in an interview on the radio program PM on Tuesday, 19 April 1994. This bill is another example of the extent to which the federal Labor government will bend over backwards to satisfy the demands and conditions of unions, irrespective of the consequences of such action to the rest of the people in Australia. I wish to focus for a moment on the amendments that relate to industrial relations in the coal industry, in particular, the intention of the amendments. Within these parameters the bill seeks to amend the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and the Coal Industry Act 1946 make provision for the Commonwealth to sion reform the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes in the coal mining industry. For reasons which I will explain later, these amendments contribute little to the labour market reform that this bill purports to er, or to achieving high levels of productivity and international competitiveness in the Australian economy. Again, I would like read the statement made by the Minister (Mr Keating) in the One Nation document, which the government released 26 February 1992. The Prime Minister had this to say about a more competitive and stronger Australia: A nation, like all successful nations, where ers and workers pool their creativity and energy transform workplaces. I emphasise that he said 'employers and tribunal's employees pool their creativity and energy transform workplaces'. The Prime Minister made it clear that that is one of the strong agendas of the government. He went on to say: That is why I want to keep up the pace of change. I want Australia to be fiercely competitive in the world-so that we can deliver opportunity and care at home. I want us to be strong within, so we can be strong in the world-a world which too often does not compete fairly. I do not have any problem with that. I recogmainstream nise that if we do not have economic prosperity we cannot deliver the social programs that make the lives of all Australians easier and the social reform that all of us are happy to have. So I have no query with that at all. What I do query is the fact that, in the last years, the Prime Minister and this government have constantly harped at business about being more competitive, about getting its act together, about downsizing and about improving its whole approach to business. What we see the government do? We see it fiddle with a bill that should have been fixed 10 years ago. Even when the government does saying: bring legislation into the House to amend the current arrangements that have been talked ment about for 10 years, it still cannot get it right. I would like to address the operation of the coal industry before the tribunal. At present to the Australian Industrial Relations Commisand, since April this year, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia are responsible for almost all of Australia's industrial arrangements. The coal industry, however, has had its own industrial relations structure through the delivCoal Industry Act 1946. Unions and employers in the coal industry work within the specialist Coal Industry Tribunal, with its own to jurisdiction covering New South Wales, Prime Queensland and Tasmania. There have been criticisms of the Coal on Industry Tribunal. These arrangements have been subject to criticisms from various arenas in past years. The Coal Industry Tribunal has been unable to adequately handle industrial employrelations issues and it has been unable to to successfully settle disputes, mainly because the unions would not adhere to the coal decisions; they would totally ignore to them, as we saw in April this year. The United Mineworkers Union has been strong in often ignoring the tribunal's decisions. Another source of criticism is the selective and specialist nature of the tribunal. It falls outside the jurisdiction of mainstream Australian industrial relations and, as such, is not subject to the same standards, decisions or processes that govern other Australian industries. Employers in the New South Wales Coal Association have been calling for the coal industry to be brought into the for the last 10 years. As far back as 1985, the Hancock inquiry recommended that the Coal Industry Tribunal be abolished. That was recommended in 1985 in the Hancock inquiry. The coalition has always supported the position that the coal industry 10 should be brought into the mainstream industrial relations system and that the tribunal be abolished. The Minister for Industrial Relations has, do until now, made no attempt to hide the need for such reform. In fact, in that interview I have just quoted from, he openly supported it, Let me say today that I believe and the Governbelieves that the decision of the Mineworkers' Union to take industrial action each time they're dissatisfied with the outcome of coal price negotiations is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. It's doing great damage to this industry . . . .... the union is not prepared to take any notice of it at all and its orders. He said that in talking of the Coal Industry Tribunal. He said: I think it's high time that, given the contempt that the union has consistently shown for decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal, that we should bring the coal industry into the mainstream of industrial relations and bring it under the auspices of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and I'll be taking steps to put that into effect. They are the minister's own words. But what do we see? The minister's rhetoric is clear; he leaves no room for any misunderstanding as to his intention. As he stated, the reform that is required will be achieved only by fully abolishing the Coal Industry Tribunal and bringing the industry directly into the mainstream of Australian industrial relations, under the clear jurisdiction and control of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The government's policy has been put on the public record. However, if Labor's previous record is any guide, what it promises to do often bears little or no resemblance to what is actually done at the end of the day. It is all right to get up and talk about it and make a lot of you-beaut public statements about it; but, at the end of the day, people want to see some action. We are not in this place just to stand and yack away without delivering real reform and benefits to the Australian people. This bill is no exception. As for actual reform from these amendments, contrary to the minister's pronouncement and the government's clear policy commitment, the bill actually provides for the creation of a new specialist coal panel to operate within the commission. I have to say that these are gains, and I support the small gains that have been made. I know that employers in the industry also support these gains because they are a move forward. But, as a result of 10 years oftalking and working, these are very small gains indeed. They are just a few crumbs that have fallen from the table. The other part of the bill ensures that the new panel will have to take tribunal decisions into account when dealing with coal matters. On the surface, these amendments would appear to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal and bring the coal industry into the mainstream of Australian industrial relations. But appearances are deceiving. In reality, these amendments fail to achieve any of the reforms publicly promised by the minister. What the minister has done is to effectively maintain the status quo by moving the Coal Industry Tribunal into the Industrial Relations Commission but-wait for it-under a new name. It was only yesterday that I stood at this dispatch box and talked about the new names for measures within the Social Security Act; namely, the home child-care allowance and parenting allowances. Once again, we have seen this wonderful sleight of hand trick where all the government does is put new headings on everything, put them into language that is not understood by any of the people who have to use the service and say that it has made a wonderful reform. It just has not happened. The hypocrisy of the amendments in this particular bill lies in the fact that, whilst the name of the tribunal is to be changed, the new panel created to replace it will still be a separate and specialist body. The only substantial difference the bill makes is that the new panel will operate within the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, although, importantly, still effectively outside the jurisdiction of the commission. There will be no new members on the new panel from other panels within the commission. The same specialist members from the old tribunal will still sit on the new panel, and those members will not sit on any of the commission's other panels. Unfortunately, these amendments will do little more than make an unsatisfactory act somewhat less unsatisfactory. They will still leave the act as a flawed piece of legislation. It is certainly of no surprise to me that the minister's amendments, which are supposed to deliver the promised reforms, are not unlike the minister's recent handling of his other portfolios. Whatever happened to the government and the minister's promises to fully absorb the Coal Industry Tribunal and to bring this industry directly into mainstream industrial relations system under the clear jurisdiction and control of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission? All the bill confirms is that nothing has changed in relation to Labor's approach to government and the much needed micro-economic reforms that could deliver what the Prime Minister has promised here or what he said he wants for Australia-that is, for us to be strong within so that we can be strong in the world, a world which too often does not compete fairly. They promise everything and worry about it later. There will always be some excuse to justify the failure to deliver what was originally promised. Needless to say, the bill is far from satisfactory. One has to wonder why this breakdown has occurred. As I have said, we have seen a lot of rhetoric about the need for reform. It has been clearly acknowledged. It is on the record. More importantly, why has the government procrastinated for so long on the issue? What is the motive behind the seemingly absurd action? When one contemplates the hostile relationship that currently exists between the Minister for Industrial Relations and these particular union officials and others around the country, and when one considers the obvious contempt that some of these officials have shown for the minister, I suppose the answer becomes reasonably obvious. He does not want to rock the boats in those groups that have become the new elite in Australia today. I always find it fascinating and interesting when I sit on the bench to listen to the Prime Minister at the dispatch box slating the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), saying that he belongs to the Melbourne Club and that he is an elitist. These people have made elitism into an art form. They have been just amazing. This whole thing is about protecting sectional interests at the expense of all Australians, and that is just not on. The government has been doing what it does best, and that is kowtowing to the demands of its union colleagues and stitching up deals that give more power and authority, with flagrant disregard for the consequences of those actions for Australian industry and Australian people at large. It is obvious that Labor has reneged on its promises and weakened the amendments in this bill to keep favour with the unions. By ensuring that the Coal Industry Tribunal effectively stays the same organisation, although now under a different name within the commission, the unions are kept happy and the minister is saved from what would no doubt be another embarrassing and damaging confrontation with senior union officials and members of his own party. As I said before, I find it quite ironic that the Prime Minister has the hide to accuse the coalition of being a party of Melbourne Club elitists. I certainly was not. My father worked in the railways for many years. I am sure that many other colleagues come from similar backgrounds. There is nothing particularly elite about that. My father was a hard worker, and I am proud of what he achieved in his lifetime and of the example that he set for me. Not only does this bill highlight its watered down form; it reveals the weak and uncommitted approach that characterises the current Labor government when it comes to taking action to implement the required microeconomic reform that is so vital to Australia's economic competitiveness. One only needs to consider the recent decision by the federal government to exempt Australia's major shipping line from key provisions of the Trade Practices Act to realise the full extent to which Labor's short-sighted union agenda is corrupting essential competition reform which underpins the very essence of microeconomic reform in this country. There is no shortage of evidence to reflect current federal government policy, which is at odds with the policy of increasing economic competition. Here we have a government that has spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, again propping up a shipping line that the minister himself admitted was worthless and not able to be sold on the open market. Yet we hear time and again in this place and in other places the admonition-constant harping-by the government and its representatives that our industries, private industries and businesses ought to become competitive. The government moved a lot of tariff barriers because it felt our companies had to learn to stand on their own two feet. It is one rule for the government and another rule for the rest of the people out there, except for those who happen to belong to the elite club. They are okay because they are part of the boys' club. The implications for Australia of such actions are reflected in the absurdity of this bill. Yet they will be lauded by Labor's mates out there in the elite club. My concern is the implication this has for the hundreds of thousands of small business proprietors in this country who deserve to have delivered what the Prime Minister promised but are not getting any example from the top. I always believe that, if you are going to call on other people to improve or mend their ways, then the leader had better start taking note of his own advice and get on with improving his own lot. It is high time that the government set the lead and got its own management ship in order both in this government and outside. (TIme expired)",67
44,Mr FITZGIBBON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Hunter) (2.41 p.m.)Unlike the last speaker, the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), I do not find this legislation totally unacceptable. The debate on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is supposed to be about industrial relations, but instead it started out as a clash of philosophies and degenerated into a battle between two teams which either supported Australian coalminers or wanted to kick them. This has been a wide ranging debate, and I will continue in that vein. I guess you would have to say it has been a battle between political ideologues who know nothing about coal mining and members of coal mining electorates who understand the industry, know its harshness, know its dangers and support the position of the coalminers. Let there be no doubt about my position. The miners have absolute right on their side and they have my unqualified support. I congratulate the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) for being willing to listen to the arguments put forward by the miners and for agreeing to compromise so that we have been able to reach a solution which, though not perfectly satisfactory to me, seems to offer a good deal of protection for the miners. I will give a few facts about coal to set the scene. The coal industry is a $7 billion per year export industry. Australia is the world's largest coal exporter. We need a stable, efficient and prosperous coal industry. Under a federal Labor government, coal will remain strong and my workers will be treated fairly. They will not be subjected to the worker bashing that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and some of those opposite would care to inflict on coalminers. The member for Bennelong accuses this government of being soft on coalminers. Rubbish! I cannot help worrying when he calls us soft on coalminers. What degree of softness existed on the other side of the House when the bottom of the harbour schemes were flourishing? I would be very hesitant to accuse those opposite of being soft on big business. The member for Bennelong also predicted that I will lose my seat at the next election. He said that about 16 times and at every election my vote just keeps doubling, but we will forgive him for that. He has never been so good at predictions. The speech of the honourable member for Bennelong was a rather rambling one. It could have been a leadership speech. He hardly mentioned industrial relations or coal. That is not surprising. The simple fact is that the honourable member for Bennelong and many of those opposite have a tory view of industrial relations. While they might have that tory view of industrial relations, they do not dig down deeply. They do not try to understand the intricacies of an industry. I doubt whether any member on the other side of the House has any knowledge whatsoever of coal mining. I wonder whether anyone of them has ever gone down into the bowels of the earth. I wonder whether they have walked around in mud and slush up to their thighs. Mrs Moylan-Yes.",71
45,Mr FITZGIBBON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Pearce, who is at the table, says yes. I have a personal regard for her because I know her story. Our fathers were both in the railway industry. I am just sorry that members of my side did not get to her before some people on the other side did and won her over to their way of thinking. But there is time to change her, I am sure. It seems to me that noone on the other side, with the exception of the member for Pearce, is really interested in compromise. Those opposite love to feast on confrontation. I have been a representative in this place for 10 years and it is as plain as the nose on my face that they love confrontation. This government and a union compromised, and compromised sensibly. The Labor Party is a unified party. The parties of those opposite are not. We have a proud record of working with unions to prevent industrial disputes. Those on the other side love industrial disputes because they see them as a golden chance to bash the workers. The Libs and Nats do not really like coalminers because coalminers are one of the most politically aware groups of workers and they have one of the most politically active unions. Coalminers know where the Libs and Nats are coming from. They know that the Libs and Nats represent the 'top end of town'. Coalminers know that the coalition is determined to make them work harder and longer for less pay. According to the opposition, if that happened everything would be right with the world. God would be in his heaven and all would be right with the world. To solve all the problems of Australia the opposition would use the poor old worker. All he would have to do is work harder and longer for less pay and the miracle would then occur. Suddenly we would become a wondrous country. Coalminers know that the coalition seeks minimisation of miners' wages and maximisation of company profits. Miners know that and they vote accordingly-I think about 90 per cent for Labor. Miners are the natural enemies of tory ism and of those who want to rob workers of a fair day's wage for a fair day's work. Miners are sensible. They know that good industrial relations are a crucial component of good economic performance. Miners want good economic performance because they want to keep their jobs. It should not be assumed that all coal industry strikes are the fault of the mine workers. Today's coalminers are far more sophisticated than their forebears. I know there are ridiculous stories of the old days. For example, if a race meeting was on in Cessnock they would say that the pit ponies' breath was a bit off and have a strike. But we have come a long way since then. Things like that have become part of legend but are no longer true-if they were true in the olden days. Today's miners work hard. They strive to enjoy good industrial relations and, in most cases, succeed. The miners have good working relations with most companies. There are no real problems. We should look at the tremendous improvement shown in time lost through stoppages. There has not been a national coal strike in over five years. The miners have turned around, become almost respectable, and we cannot really regard them any longer as being quite so militant as they were in the past. Despite the fact that they are prepared to stick up for what they believe is right, we cannot expect them to kowtow to management decisions that are unfair, unreasonable and wrong. There are many good managers but, unfortunately, many of the managers whom I know and personally like have to obey the dictates of company directors. The poor old miner has been subjected to all types of abuse. We have heard a litany from opposition speakers who criticise miners because of their rate of pay. The conservatives claim they are the best paid workers in Australia. Australia has the most productive underground mines in the world and the second most productive open cut mines. Productivity increases since 1980 have averaged over five per cent per year. Australian mineworkers average 43 hours per week, probably the highest for any industry in Australia. They are working harder and longer because they agreed to make sacrifices to achieve restructuring. Because they have done that, our coal industry faces a bright future. The coalminers' wages would be less than the wages of those who attend Liberal-National Party fundraising functions-and the coalition does not complain about their incomes. Consider the dirt that the coal miner has to contend with underground. Consider the insecurity of jobs in the coal mining industry. Consider the deaths in the coal mining industry. A friend of mine lost her husband, and after five years of recovering from that she lost her son in a coalmine. If you drive around Wallsend, Cessnock and some of those places, you can name a person in every street who has died as a result of dust or a mining disaster. Before I spoke on this debate, the honourable member for Pearce referred to the deaths and injuries which occurred recently at Moura. Do not begrudge miners their salary. I can tell you that I am glad I am here. I would rather be here than down a coalmine. Studies carried out showed that mine labour costs are not due merely to miners. Some mines belonging to large mining companies have 30 per cent of all employees engaged in management and administration. The truth is that, despite increasing productivity, despite lowering working costs of production, despite working new shift arrangements, despite agreeing to other new work practices and despite the development and implementation of industry based training and multiskilling through the development of work models and industry training schemes, most underground miners have not had a rise in their base rate of pay since June 1991. In contrast, most workers have received wage increases and their productivity rates are well below those achieved by the miners. I congratulate all those miners who give time to mine rescue duties. I was at a dinner in Singleton last Friday night at which there were around 250 miners. All those men sacrifice their leisure time to go out and receive training in mine rescue matters. One fellow there, Ben Gumbleton-a man to whom I pay unlimited tribute-has given services to mine rescue operations for 15 years. That is a pretty wonderful achievement. Thank heavens the majority of Australians are now aware that coalminers are leading the hunt to facilitate the adoption of best practice in coal production, distribution and marketing, and occupational health and safety. Thank heavens the majority of Australians-and we must exclude those opposite-are now aware that coal miners are not to blame for the sale of coal to Japan at ridiculously low prices. A fairer price for our export coal means far more to Australians than does this legislation we are debating here today. If opposition members really want to improve the coal mining industry, let them sit down late at night and read some of the facts and figures about our coal exports to Japan and how we are played off a break by the coal purchasers in this country. Our managers of coal in Australia should hang their heads in shame. I make no apologies for supporting the mining unions on matters where they have what I believe to be total right on their side. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong belongs to the Middle Ages and will be laughed out of this chamber. I congratulate Minister Brereton, mines leader John Maitland, Tony Wilkes, Mick Watson, Ron Land and all other sensible people who know what it is like to work hard and be trampled on by some of the bureaucratic arrangements put into effect by the powers that control coal mining in this country. These guys have shown tremendous powers of negotiation. They have been loyal to their men. They have fought unreservedly and, although it is not the bill I would have preferred, I support the passage of this bill through the House. I invite all opposition members to come up to the Hunter Valley and go underground. Some of them may have already taken up that pleasure. Hundreds of thousands of people every year come to the Hunter Valley because, as all members know, we have the best wine in Australia and we are a fast developing tourist area. But there are other opportunities for those who visit the Hunter Valley. The honourable member for Bennelong would love to come up to the Hunter Valley and accompany me down a coalmine, sink up to his knees in slush and mud, and meet some of the best people in Australia. They would talk to the honourable member for Bennelongthey would probably be friendly towards him-but if he started talking about this industrial relations nonsense that belongs to the Middle Ages he would probably lose their attention. Although the honourable member for Bennelong might not get on too well with some people up there, I invite all members of the opposition to come up to the Hunter. I assure them that they will have a very happy discussion and a very enjoyable time with all of my coalminers.",71
46,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I thank the honourable member for Hunter for his cooperation. It being 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted. In accordance with standing order lOlA, the debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Wage Increases",74
47,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that in June he endorsed retaliatory wage claims to compensate for interest rate rises. Last Thursday, he claimed that the 15 per cent wage increase over two years being claimed by the Transport Workers Union was 'eminently affordable in national economic terms'. Does the Prime Minister stand by his statement that 15 per cent wage increases over two years are eminently affordable in national economic terms, or does he now subscribe to the view of the Treasurer, who told the House on Tuesday that such claims will be damaging to the economy and are not consistent with the inflation objective and that he hoped they were only ambit claims?",74
48,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition has noticed, but we have introduced into this country an enterprise bargaining system with a safety net. Mr Downer-No, I hadn't noticed!",74
49,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. He has not noticed. I am glad to have that confirmation. That explains the question. There is an award underpinning it for those unable to access it. A lot of enterprise bargaining is being done. Good managers and managements and good unions are getting together and drawing substantial productivity yields from businesses which are being split between wages and profits. The key question is: what is the productivity? Some of these claims are for one year, two years or three years. If they are over a longer period and there is a productivity yield, the cost to the company, at a period of high profitability-and hence, therefore, the carryon into prices and into the inflation rate-will be, of course, minimal. So the aim of the game is to lift productivity and to see that people making wage settlements do it in a way that takes account of the overall profitability of companies both from the volumes in the economy now and from the improved productivity. Hence, there should then be less impact on prices and on the inflation rate. That is as it will be in many cases. In some other cases, it will be less than that. It will be where companies are actually offering money free of productivity bargains. When I met some of the constituent unions of the ACTU yesterday, a couple had some very interesting stories to tell. One in the transport workers area said, 'Providing you put on a good enough show and tickle us in the right place, we will pay up.'",74
50,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The bosses said that, to the unions.",74
51,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The bosses said to the union, 'We won't just pay you. Provided that you put on a bit of a song and dance and then put a bit of mock pressure on us, we will pay up, and we'll pay this and pay that.' I made the point last week that this is a very big test of the maturity of Australian employers, because they now have the wages system that the major industry groups have always wanted; that is, one that is productivity based and enterprise bargained. But there is a responsibility on them to protect their profits and prices and to not pass on prices by making wage settlements which are unjustified and bear no relationship to the improvement in profitability and productivity. Mr Downer-So the unions should not make wage claims.",74
52,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. In the nature of an enterprise bargaining system, you will have a claim and a negotiation procedure. Mr Downer-Joint responsibility.",74
53,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously, claims are not necessarily agreements, but there will be agreements at some point. So, in the past, when we saw wage break-outs in the late 1970s and early 1980s, these were for overaward payments. In the 1980s, we saw wages basically held in line and inflation tracked down under the accord arrangements with a centralised system. That has gone for the large part of the work force. We are now in an enterprise bargaining system. With an enterprise bargaining system there is a responsibility on employers to know that they are now in the world of making arrangements themselves and there is no recourse to a centralised tribunal or jurisdiction. I made this point the other day. I noticed that a couple of commentators said, 'How dare the Prime Minister say that the employers have got a responsibility in this?' Is it not in for a dig to actually suggest that the employers might not be doing the right thing here or that there is an obligation on them to actually bargain and secure productivity arrangements and improvements and to not see an impact on their prices and the inflation rate? One commentator, who has said the same thing for the last 15 years, said, 'What's wrong with the wage arrangements? We still have the award underpinnings.' I am completely at a loss to understand what the award underpinnings have to do with anybody outside the safety net arrangements. The fact is that there is now a very heavy responsibility on employers to run this system maturely and effectively. There is no centralised tribunal sitting there to say to them, 'No, we're not going to agree to this' or 'Yes, we're going to agree with that.' There is no public interest test, as there used to be. Now this is on. They got the system they wanted and now they have to operate the system",74
54,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The system they have always wanted.,75
55,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Minister for Industrial Relations has just interjected, it is a system they have always wanted and there is now a very heavy requirement on them to operate it. The trade unions for their part understand that, after a long period of wage restraint, a low inflation rate is valuable. Let me say that this is another problem with the bond markets. The bond markets are telling all the people who believe in low inflation that they are factoring in a five to six percentage point inflation rate. Today, the Managing Director of Bankers Trust, a person who has made a real contribution to the financial industry in this country, said, 'Well, there's a judgment being made here about Australia's inflation rate. Yes, we have got a better inflation performance, but it's not over a long period of time. In the meantime, we're going to factor in a five to six per cent inflation rate.' It is pretty hard to go and say to an ordinary person on the factory floor, 'Listen, make sure that you've got less than a two per cent claim. Make sure it's all productivity covered and don't you cover yourself for the forward rate of inflation. But, mind you, in the bond markets it's okay. They can stick five toMr Downer-So what about the inflation rate? Mr Costello-What is the inflation rate factor?",75
56,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am making a rhetorical point.,75
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will not interject across the chamber.,75
58,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am making a rhetorical point. They say, 'Don't you factor in what you believe ought to be the inflation rate, but it's all right for the financial markets. We'll let them put in a five to six per cent inflation rate.' Then some of these jokers in the financial market have the hide to lecture everybody about the inflation rate. There is another point to be made here. There is no restraint whatsoeverMr Downer-Make a press release.",75
59,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not need to. I can do an oral press release because you have just given me the question. There is no restraint whatsoever in respect of executive salaries. Executive salaries have increased by 250 per cent since 1983. Executive salaries are going up. The bond markets are factoring in a five to six per cent inflation rate. They are then saying to trade unions, 'Now, you make sure that you don't put the two per cent inflation rate at risk.' Meanwhile, the employers are saying, 'Listen, if you put on a song and dance and tickle us in the right place, we'll give you the money without any productivity benefits at all.' Mr Downer-And you go down supporting the 15 per cent claim.",75
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition!,76
61,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the time when the employers have to grow up and stand up. This government and the trade unions got the inflation rate down to under two per cent for the employers, but they now have to help themselves to keep it there. Because we have never been in a position before where we have an enterprise bargaining system like this, we will see just how committed they are to low inflation and looking after their own profits and their own profitability. Unemployment",76
62,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the unambiguously good employment data released today. Would the Prime Minister please explain to the House the consequences of today's employment figures for the Australian economy?,76
63,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The unemployment rate last month fell to 9.1 per cent. This is the lowest unemployment level for 3112 years. The rate has now fallen by two full percentage points in the last year alone, which is unambiguously good news for the work force and the country. Mr KaUer-But look at the number out of work.",76
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Kennedy!,76
65,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Not only are these healthy trends; but in this case we will be exceeding the budget forecast of an unemployment rate of 9 1/2 per cent by the end of this financial year. Mr Katter-You cannot be proud of what,76
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Kennedy.,76
67,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the budget forecast we had an unemployment rate for the June quarter 1995 of 9.5 per cent. We are now at 9.1 per cent, less than halfway through that financial year. It is also very encouraging that the figures for the most disadvantaged people in the labour market, that is the long-term unemployed, those unemployed and out of work for 12 months or more, have fallen by a record number over the last year. As I said the last time. I addressed the parliament on this subject, we are seeing about a quarter of the jobs going to the long-term unemployed, which means the government's targeted labour market programs are working. The extent of the recovery and the fast job growth augurs well for a continuing decline in the budget deficit. The number of people on unemployment benefits, UBRs, has decreased by 9 112 per cent over the course of the last year. There are fewer outlays on unemployment benefit recipient payments and, of course, with more people in work, there is a better harvest of revenue from pay-as-youearn taxpayers and from companies. We have made the point before that these labour market programs are particularly important in getting the long-term unemployed back to work",76
68,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, but only for six months.",76
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bendigo!,76
70,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition is saying that we should have a lower budget deficit. Paul Lyneham put a question to the Leader of the Opposition recently, which was: Questioner-But you're going to have to find much bigger savings than cutting out waste and duplication aren't you? Mr Downer-Well, yeah, I accept that. Yeah, we will. Questioner-I mean billions of dollars worth. The interview continued: Questioner-It's going to be a lot. Mr Downer-No question of it. I might add that that was left out of the transcript of his remarks when they were published. The admission that he is going have to seeMr Costello-Oh, call in the Federal Police.",76
71,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. Mr Costello-You should put him in goal over this.,76
72,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is the person that does not tell lies. Mr Costello-You are the person who doesn't tell them!,76
73,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He was up the other day telling us something about red socks. He said: Listen, I think the political system just gets brought into disrepute if politicians go around telling lies. If they're asked a question, what colour socks are they wearing and they're wearing green socks and they say red-a blatant lie like that is completely unacceptable. Horrid, I would say. How dare you wear red socks and say they are green! The Leader of the Opposition was asked this question: Questioner-But you are going to have to find much bigger saving than cutting outThey have had this glib answer about cutting out waste and duplication. . . . you are going to have to have a much bigger round of savings than cutting out wastes and duplication, aren't you? Mr Downer-Well, yeah, I accept that. Yeah, we will. Questioner-Yes, I mean billions of dollars. The questioner goes on to say: Questioner-Too much Sesame Street. It is going to be a lot. Mr Downer-No question of it. Do you know where the savings are going to come from? They are going to come from transfer payments to the long-term unemployed. They are going to come from payments to the aged, to education, to health. They are the only places that these sorts of cuts in government spending to improve the budget deficit can come from. There is no point the opposition pretending otherwise, because some of us over here have had 12 years combing through the outlays and we know exactly what you have to do to be has saving that sort of money. The job compact which is now working to bring down the long-term unemployed figures is bringing them down in the context of labour market programs. Given the impending horrid job loss that the Leader of the Opposimarket tion is facing, he should hope that after next election the labour market programs of the Labor government are there to retrain him if need be. Budget Deficit",77
74,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Very funny. You should get Don Watson to write better jokes for you.,77
75,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,77
76,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Would you like me to give the oral press release now on the five per cent inflation?,77
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will get to his question or resume his seat.,77
78,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer yesterday's Access Economics monitor to him, which says: ... the October 1% rise in the cash rate was broadly in line with the futures market expectation. Yet, since then, the futures market has raised the expected 9O-day bill rate from 10.4% to 10.7% at the end of 1996. We suspect the reason is Prime Minister Keating's continued suggestions that little needs to be done to accelerate the fall in the structural budget deficit. In the light of that, I ask whether you will now admit that your failure to reduce the budget deficit has contributed to higher interest rates.",77
79,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What a silly question.,77
80,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,77
81,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Everyone knows that the bond market just bounces around according to what is happening in the United States. Mr Costello-Here is the report.,77
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,77
83,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, you might have noticed today that the bond rates have come down because the American market fell overnight. Mr Costello-Have you read this?",77
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The deputy leader asked his question; he might listen to the answer.,77
85,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Since the one per cent increase in official rates there has been some the upward movement in the United States market. We followed it in the way that the bond here seems to slavishly follow the the United States market. The US market fell overnight; we fell today. Do not try to read anything about the deficit into that; that has nothing to do with the deficit whatsoever. The fact that Access Economics says something does not make it right. This is something that you might have learned by now. Access Economics just might be wrong sometimes. The opposition perhaps ought not to regard everything that Access says as gospel. The government is concerned to ensure that we do not have higher interest rates than we need to have, and we will certainly be pursuing policies to try to ensure that interest rates are at no stage higher than they absolutely need to be. Of course, that has to be put in the context of a policy which has to ensure that inflation is kept low, and that is a prime policy prerequisite if we are to have sustained economic and employment growth. We all know that means that policy needs to be adjusted from time to time. There will be ongoing argument about the degree of the mix between fiscal and monetary policy. The government has made it quite clear that the position of fiscal policy will be considered further in the context of the forthcoming budget for 1995-96, and when we develop our strategy for that budget we will consider whether there is a need for further tightening of fiscal policy. In doing that, we should recognise that the process of tightening fiscal policy is continuing through the decisions made in the 1993 budget, despite the best attempts of the opposition at that time to prevent it by opposing some $3 billion worth of deficit reduction. Whenever the opposition calls for a further deficit reduction, we should remind it that, when it had a chance to support $3 billion worth of deficit reduction, it opposed it root and branch. Award system",77
86,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask the minister: is the government committed to retaining the award system as a genuine safety net for workers in Australia?,78
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am in a little bit of a difficult situation. The Minister for Industrial Relations is not on the roster for today. But the Leader of the House indicated yesterday, when the minister was not here on his rostered day, that he would be here to answer questions today. If there are no objections, I propose on this occasion to allow the Minister for Industrial Relations to answer the question. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that perhaps the roster system needs to be fixed.",78
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are no objections.,78
89,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Calare for his question. I can confirm that the government will retain the award system as a safety net. Of course, now, if you can believe it, so will the opposition. Yesterday, it sounded like the opposition waved the white flag as far as surrendering on industrial relations was concerned. It adopted the government's own language and spoke about major changes to Jobsback. On the ABC radio, we were all treated to the honourable member for Bennelong speaking aboutMr O'Keefe-The future leader.",78
90,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He was denying that any of his friends were involved in that; he was urging them to keep quiet-not to cause any waves. He was talking openly about the need for a safety net to guarantee workers' pay and conditions. Can you believe that-'a safety net'?,78
91,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you can pinch some of my language, I can pinch some of yours.",78
92,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Talk about our language! The House should understand that his so-called transparent safety net is vastly different from our sort of safety net. Jobsback will only guarantee a minimum hourly rate of pay, four weeks annual leave, two weeks noncumulative sick leave, and 12 months unpaid maternity leave. That is the end of the section; there is nothing after that. Everything else, under the coalition's transparent safety net, is up for grabs. That safety net is in very real contrast with ours, which sees the award safety net as the vital underpinning of enterprise bargaining. The member for Bennelong's latter-day conversion is not quite so transparent, as it coincides with his own drive to unseat the Leader of the Opposition. I hit a raw nerve yesterday when I suggested that the member for Bennelong had done a backflip on his Jobsback policy, as he went out of his way to again accuse the government of caving in on coal. The truth is that it could only really be characterised as a bellyflop; that is what it was. He has admitted that his 10bsback policy is deeply flawed and unjust and he has acknowledged-this is what he said-that he is considering dropping the key opt-in arrangement which would allow workers to go back onto awards by mutual agreement with their employer. It does not end there. His spokesman gave an interview yesterday evening with AAP and said that the review of 10bsback would include-wait for it againthe beefing up of unfair dismissal provisions.",78
93,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, we don't believe you.",79
94,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How about that one? And-wait for this one-it would include a new division of the Industrial Relations Commission to allow non-union enterprise agreements. What a little trimmer!,79
95,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We don't believe you.,79
96,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question, which the Prime Minister poses, is: how on earth could you believe them? Only the Sunday before last on Meet the Press, the member for Bennelong said under cross-examination that 10bsback would remain. He said that it would be 'essentially the same. You may present it differently, you may drop a major element. On the other hand, you might just change its presentation.' Really, how on earth could anyone believe him, as he scratches around looking for a few moderate votes to topple his leader? Families: Interest Rates",79
97,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You wouldn't believe any of Richo's mates! My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of government figures released yesterday which show that, in the International Year of the Family, his government's policies have led to a situation where one in 10 traditional families have both parents-not one parent-out of work? The figures also reveal that almost 19 per cent of Australia's children aged under IS-some 700,OOO-live in a family with no breadwinner. Does the Prime Minister agree that rising interest rates will only make the situation worse for these families who are the victims of Labor's policies?",79
98,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The transmission of that data was misleading and untrue.,79
99,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,79
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,79
101,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The headline in today's Australian is grossly misleading because it gives the impression that 10 per cent of traditional families have both husband and wife unemployed. That is not the case. The proportion of couples in traditional families who are both unemployed is 1.3 per cent-not 10. Although unemployment is still high, the unemployment rate for families with children has decreased over the last 18 months and will continue to fall. That is, as I indicated earlier, the growth in employment which we are seeing-the aggregate growth in employment and the growth in employment for the long-term unemployed-is having that impact. The Working Nation document is the largest, most comprehensive package of measures the Commonwealth has ever employed to deal with unemployed people, particularly those who have been long-term unemployed. In its first full year of operations, $2.2 billion will be spent providing around 650,000 labour market program places for unemployed people. Of course, we will provide a job guarantee with those. As well as that, on Monday I went through the benefits in terms of transfer payments to low income families and also the latest changes to be introduced by the government: the home child-care allowance and the generalised child-care rebate. In the white paper, Working Nation, the new parenting allowance for the spouses of unemployed people and low paid workers will help their family incomes and give families more choice for one parent to stay home and care for children. I might also remind the House that we have changed the taper on the benefit so that people now taking part-time or casual jobs will receive a top-up because there will not be a dollar for dollar withdrawal of the taper from those benefits. So I can understand the Leader of the National Party jumping on anything that he thinks is a miserable story to put around. But the fact is that he is wrong and the report is wrong. The proportion of couples in traditional families who are both unemployed is 1.3 per cent. You backed Access Economics in, and we saw the result in March 1993. So just stay with them. As a consequence, you will stay where you are. Constitutional Convention",79
102,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer him to reports in today's media about a proposal to hold a constitutional convention. Is it the intention of the government to support such a proposal?,80
103,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There were six constitutional conventions between 1973 and 1988. None of them produced changes of any significance to the Australian constitution. There has been one proposed by the Constitutional Centenary Foundation-a view put by it, by the Centenary of Federation Advisory Committee, and I believe that the Leader of the Opposition put such a view to his shadow cabinet last week and was rolled. Nothing will disguise the fact that there no policy to run off and say, 'We'll have a l00-year review,' as he said yesterday, 'of nation's constitution.' There is only one key question here for the opposition; that is, whether it believes in the need for an Australian head of state. That is the key question. Once you decide that question, then all of the other consequential changes become apparent to you. But the idea of going to a constitutional convention and having a talkfest about whether or not we can move to an Australian head of state while we are discussing the external affairs power and while we are discussing other Commonwealth incursions into states rights is not leadership; it is not decision making. It would be just a waste of time for a party that cannot",80

106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor!,80
107,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me say this to the Leader of the Opposition: the government will be holding no dialogue with the coalition until it declares a belief in the need for an Australian head of state-none whatsoever. All of this talk about an Australian constitutional convention comes from this manic view of the coalition that, somehow, the Commonwealth is illegitimate and that the states should be buttressed by changes to the constitution. The view is that the Liberal Party is just a complexion of state parties; it is not a National Party. Let me just demonstrate that. This is the Liberal Party's document, published for the agenda for the last federal council meeting, and the motion circulated with it. These are the policies for the next government. By contrast, this document that I now hold up is the Labor Party's policies, on the same A4 paper, which are now published in this book, and you can actually read through it: communications policy, economic policy, social policy. They are cogent, they are sensible. One point rolls from the other. This document is, in fact, the policies of a national party of government. It is not a mishmash of motions is for a set of state parties. I had not seen this document, but the Deputy Prime Minister our showed it to me and said, 'Have you seen the coalition's federal council agenda?' Mrs Bishop-Oh, tell us about uranium.",80
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Honourable member for Mackellar!,80
109,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He showed it to me, and I looked through it. I said, 'Yes, I have seen it. I saw it at a Labor Party conference in about 1963.' There is no thread of a policy here; this is all about states. Listen to this motion: The federal council agrees that federal-state relations need urgent review. States and territory governments require a guaranteed share of the tax revenue. The use of the external treaty powers of the Commonwealth government as a means of controlling the states should be stopped by amending the constitution, and any move by the Commonwealth to diminish the powers of the states It just goes on. The next one states: This conference calls upon the Commonwealth government to complete the transfer of state-like powers to the Northern Territory. New South Wales then had another motion: Where it is found that agreements conflict with Australian domestic law or affect the transfer of federal-state power within Australia ... There is no consistency. There is no framework of policy, no philosophical binding, no articulation of a policy after a philosophic introduction-just a whole lot of mishmashed unconnected motions. Another one from Western Australia states: To define and limit the operations of the external affairs power. Look how threadbare it is! This is a party supposedly heading for government, and all of this is about Commonwealth-state relations. That is where this whole notion of a constitutional convention comes from: your incapacity to be a national party. You are not a national party of government. You are a party of six state rumps which send in these unconnected motions that are cavilling at the Commonwealth's power, imperatives and prerogatives. There is no social policy and no economic policy. I keep it in the drawer. Even Acme Fightback at least had some coherence about it. Mr Downer-That is not what you said last year.",80
110,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have come to love this thing. There are some things that get to you after a while. Here it is! After you take the agenda off and we get down to it, to the federal council, this is all there is of the policy of the federal Liberal Party heading to a national election.",81
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order understanding order 145. A question was clearly asked about the government's attitude on the holding of a constitutional convention. I would have thought a little latitude to the Prime Minister in relation to the policies of the party would be acceptable, but this has gone beyond a joke. He is clearly outside the warrant of the question.",81
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister-in conclusion.,81
113,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The key point I am making is this: all of this impetus towards a constitutional convention is coming again from the rump view that states rights are central, that the national interest is not and that the prerogatives of the national parliament are illegitimate. That is the view you have. Yet, as I said here on Monday, there is no public view, there is nothing the pollsters are picking up, and there is nothing coming in the qualitative research which says there is a big groundswell of opinion against Commonwealth power. That is because the Liberal Party, after 50 years of its history, is still a party of six state rumps. This question about whether Mr Downer, Dr Hewson or Mr Howard leads the Liberal Party is immaterial. The party has had it.",81
114,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You don't make policy here; you make it at the casino.,81
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for 0' Connor.,81
116,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, you might as well.",81
117,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you look through the Labor Party's policy, it deals with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, arts and culture, communication, constitutional and legal affairs, consumer affairs, defence, economics, environment, ethnic affairs, external territories, foreign affairs. This is a policy of a mature party in government. The reason we are hearing about this constitutional convention is that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the courage to say that he believes there should be an Australian head of state, and he wants to blur it all by a chatteroo at some meeting called a constitutional convention which is basically about trying to diminish the Commonwealth's constitutional power. Let me make this very clear: there will be no dialogue between the government and the coalition until you accept the need for an Australian head of state. If you do not accept the need for an Australian head of state, there will be no constitutional convention and no contribution and attendance at it by us. Families",81
118,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. My question relates to the widening gap between rich and poor and the increasing inequality of opportunity in Australia under the policies of this government. I ask the Prime Minister: is it not a fact that, while there are more two-income families than there were a decade ago, there are also more families who have no earned income at all?

You can see it in today's employment and unemployment figures with the unemployment rate dropping to 9.1 per cent, which is below the budget forecast of 9 1h per cent which was to come in at the June quarter of 1995. Dr Kemp-What about population growth?",82
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Goldstein!,82
130,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So employment is the key driver of opportunity and equity. I have also indicated to you in respect of the long-term unemployed that we were getting about 10 per cent of the work force producing 10 per cent employment growth, reducing long-term unemployment in the 1980s. We are now getting about 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the people in the employment stream who were long-term unemployed, coming from the government's policies.

134,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is asking a question about equity when he would have driven the kids of working class parents into paying full fees which they could not have paid. Mr Thckey-You know that's a lie.,82
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor has already been warned.,82
136,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The same party said that it would disband Medicare and drive people back to private insurance and the same party said that it would tear into the outlays, including all the transfer paymentsMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order understanding order 145. The Prime Minister was asked a very simple question: had the rich not got richer and the poor got poorer? He should be answering that question.",82
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member was listening, the Prime Minister was asked an extremely long question by the honourable member for Goldstein and the Prime Minister is in order.",83
138,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is because of not simply income but also the impact of the transfer payments in a social wage, including, might I say, that now the work force are having six per cent of their incomes put away as savings under the accord in superannuation. That is left out of the equation, too. Go through these $6 billion direct payments, mainly to mothers: the social wage impacts of Medicare, rent assistance, housing, superannuationMr Richard Evans-Youth suicides.",83
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Cowan!,83
140,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To come here with partial data seeking only to measure incomes is no measurement at all. The fact of the matter is that those less well off in this country are much better off by virtue of the fact that this government has been in office, particularly over this period of the 1980s and the 1990s. If the honourable member wants to go out there running the philosophy of the last parliament, which is basically what the coalition believes in-that greed is good-at least he will go and get an honest vote for himself. All the other people who believe in that will vote for him. But for God's sake do not get up here trying to talk to us about social equity and opportunity for those at the bottom end of the work force when you would have tipped them off unemployment benefits after nine months, made them pay full university fees and ripped the labour market programs to pieces. You have to have a lot of front to ask a question like that but, where they teach you jokers, front is what they must teach you first. Superannuation",83
141,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports that the superannuation industry is seeking more certainty about the long-term future of superannuation policy? What action needs to be taken to achieve such certainty?,83
142,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER Mr O'Connor-And tell us how much money is left.,83
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will wait for a moment. The member for O'Connor has been warned once. He has been asked to desist. It is quite clear that he is looking for an early mark. This is the last time.,83
144,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the member for Bonython, I can say that I have seen a statement by the President of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia in today's West Australian in which he says: If we are to build real confidence in a system of private funding of retirement incomes-a system which is acknowledged as necessary because of changing demographics-it is time for a bipartisan approach to superannuation . . . He went on to say how he had been talking to the opposition and understood that it was prepared to reconsider its policy and that he was trying to assist it to do that. I guess that indicates quite clearly that the president of the superannuation funds association is saying on behalf of the industry that it is concerned that the opposition policy in relation to the superannuation guarantee, which is to cap the super guarantee at whatever level it is if and when it gets into office, is an inappropriate one. It is not only the industry that has concern about that. I yesterday released preliminary findings of some market research which we have undertaken which shows that there is concern in the community about the future possibility of a change in the rules relating to the SGC because of the opposition's policy about capping it at whatever level it is if and when it comes into office. So you have concern at the industry and community levels. That is a valid concern, given that not only was that the opposition policy at the last election but it also reconfirmed it in that document laughingly described as The Things That Matter. Today we see in the Australian an article by Dr FitzGerald headed 'Common ground on super could prove nation's saving grace'. He calls in that article for members of the opposition to adopt the full implementation of the super guarantee and to jettison this policy of capping it at whatever level it is if and when they get into office. His support for the super guarantee is in full accord with what he said in his report last year. He said that the superannuation guarantee would add over 11/2 per cent of GDP because of the compulsory aspect. That is a very important point. He said: The key element producing increased saving over the longer term through the superannuation tee is that it is compulsory, raising the saving many who without it would not be saving much in any form. That was his statement last year in producing his report on national saving. His article today goes on to say that the opposition's policy of not supporting that super guarantee and increasing compulsory saving is the wrong policy and that the opposition should change it. There is a lot of concern about the opposition's policy. Of course, at the level individuals in the country, of people would be affected by that policy, there great reason to be concerned. If the opposition were to get into office-and that seems highly unlikely-and implement this capping policy, it would mean a tremendous reduction in the retirement incomes of those people who are accident'. dependent on the SGC for their retirement benefits. As I indicated to the House earlier this year, if the opposition's policy were to be impleanother mented and assuming continuing low inflaIs tion, someone who was earning $600 a year at age 25 and who retired at age 65 would have his or her retirement income benefit reduced by $120,000. That would reduce retirement income by about a quarter. It would have a tremendous effect on individued? as in this country. So there is industry concern, community concern, a concern in relaLeader tion to national saving, and an impact on individuals in terms of their retirement comes which is very substantial indeed. This is obviously a policy that has to be changed. The opposition's policy at the moment is to go back to the policy that existed in the John Howard days, when the member for Bennelong was the Treasurer. He had a system of very generous tax concessions for superannuation. How many people were covered? About 40 per cent of the work force were covered by superannuation. Today, 89 per cent are covered. Who were that 40 per cent? Overwhelming they were the people on higher incomes. Lower income people, of course, had nothing from superannuation. The superannuation element is a very important aspect of how this government has guaran- looked after people on lower incomes by of greatly improving the prospects they will have for a higher retirement income. The opposition really should rethink its policy. It is a policy which is disturbing to the community and the industry. It is contrary to the need for greater national saving and it will heavily penalise many workers whose only access to superannuation is through the SGC. Aviation: Safety",83
145,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Transport. Firstly, does the of minister recall that, on 10 October, following who the Seaview Air accident, he was asked is whether he would ground the Aero Commander aircraft? The minister will recall saying that he was very confident that everything necessary would be done 'to ensure that there is not a repetition of this dreadful Given that, will the minister tell the House and the travelling public the results of his initial briefings on the cause of a new aircraft disaster near Cloncurry, where it appears two people may have lost their lives? it a fact that this new tragedy also involved an Aero Commander aircraft? In the interests of all those involved in the commuter airline industry, and those who use it, will the the minister today move to ground all Aero Commander aircraft and have them reinspect",84
146,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the of the Opposition, I can advise the House that an Aero Commander 680F, operatined by the World Geoscience Corporation of Perth, was lost and has been the subject of a search. Two people were on board. It was reported overdue whilst involved in low level mineral survey work yesterday evening at Cloncurry. The alarm was raised by the company at 9 p.m. last night when the aircraft failed to return from the day's operations. A night search was begun immediately and wreckage was sighted early this morning which is believed to be that of the aircraft. I have been advised, just coming into question time today, that, sadly, both of the people on board have lost their lives in the accident. I advise the House further-this is the advice of the Civil Aviation Authority-that the aircraft was a piston-engined unpressurised Aero Commander, different from the turbo-propped pressurised aircraft involved in the Seaview Air accident. I am further advised by the Civil Aviation Authority that it has no information-I repeat, no information-at the present time which would lead it to ground all Aero Commander aircraft operating in Australia. I am further advised that this model Aero Commander is not subject to the aileron 'snatch' service alert bulletin issued by the manufacturer for the aircraft model involved in the Seaview Air accident and which was the subject of a recommendation by the US National Transportation Safety Board. A Bureau of Air Safety Investigation team is on the way to that accident site, and I will advise the House when I have details of the accident report. Public Infrastructure",84
147,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development. Today the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a new EPAC task force on private sector involvement in public infrastructure. Can the minister advise the House of how public infrastructure funded by the better cities program is attracting major private sector investment?,85
148,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Lilley for his question. I want to refer particularly to an announcement by the Robina development group and the superannuation fund Commonwealth Funds Management of a $350 million investment in a new town centre in the Gold Coast. What is important about this investment is that it flows directly from a major piece of public infrastructure under the better cities program, that is, the rail line between the Gold Coast and Brisbane. That railway line is being jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the state, with about $400 million of public investment of which the Queensland government is contributing about $300 million. Robina and Commonwealth Funds Management have acknowledged that the rail link influenced their investment decision. They said: The Robina Town Centre will be a tenninus for the Federal Government funded $335 million BrisbaneGold Coast electric rail link due for completion in 1997, as part of the Better Cities program. It will be the site for a future public hospital, high school and government offices. This is a first-class example of the links between infrastructure and private investment. It shows cooperation between two levels of government-Commonwealth and state-and it provides a framework in which the Commonwealth and state governments can cooperate with local government within the planning policies for south-east Queensland. I was astounded to hear the remarks of the opposition leader at the assembly of local government this week. The opposition leader suggested-in terms similar to those of opposition spokesmen on previous occasions-that the better cities program was one that was top down and involved no partnership and no recognition of the importance of intergovernmental cooperation. Indeed, with a reminder of the rather famous term 'incentivation', which was introduced by a previous Leader of the Opposition, the opposition leader referred to a term which no doubt influenced his view of constitutional reform-'subsidiarity'. Apparently, subsidiarity means that the Commonwealth should show absolutely no leadership whatever and that, if the Commonwealth becomes involved in issues to do with state and local governments and if it becomes involved in issues that help to create better communities, as well as better cities, then somehow the Commonwealth exceeds its powers. It means that somehow the Commonwealth has got into areas that it ought to constitutionally stay out of; that it ought to have a policy of not being involved in. Yet, as the honourable member would know, even in his home state, only a few weeks ago we announced the Patawalonga project. This project, which is funded under the better cities program, involves cooperation between 11 units of local government together with cooperation with the state government that will result in a major clean-up of polluted river system. With the better cities program we are about ensuring that Commonwealth investment, together with state investment, in partnership with local government, makes a difference in a particular project alone but in the shapinquiry, ing, planning and development of a region. No region of Australia is developing more quickly than south-east Queensland. region of Australia demands more effective planning. We are effectively working with Queensland government to provide that planning. We are putting some dollars infrastructure investment into the development of infrastructure in south-east Queensland, that is leading to very substantial private sector investment. The announcement of the Robina development is a very important announcement. It shows the complete inability of the opposition to understand how to construct public policy in a way that recognises the legitimate role the Commonwealth working in partnership with other spheres of government. I commend this announcement today to all members of the House. It is an important one and it illustrates how our policies work very tively with the private sector the community and build a very strong community. Aviation: Safety",85
149,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Since the chief executive of the CAA has repeatedly given assurances regarding aviation safety, which were subsequently demonstrated to have misleading, do you still have confidence in the chairman, chief executive and board of CAA?",86
150,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is another 'Are you still beating your mother-in-law?' question. The fact is that this government has moved to create a new aviation safety agency to overcome what we saw as a deficiency in the structure of the Civil Aviation Authority and its responsibilities for air safety. At the moment, not only do we have that restructure taking place and not only are we a involved in a worldwide search for a new head of the aviation safety agency, but also we have not one, not two, not three, not four but five separate inquiries under way into these problems in the Civil Aviation Authority. There is a Bureau of Air Safety Investiganot tion inquiry, a coronial inquiry, a judicial an Australian Federal Police inquiry and, finally, a parliamentary inquiry that was given its charter at the request of the honourNo able member for Hume. So, with all that work under way, the the honourable member walks in here and asks me whether I have confidence in all the in elements of the Civil Aviation Authority. Clearly, where deficiencies have been reand vealed, we have acted. For my part, I will await the outcome of each of those inquiries-one, two, three, four and five-before I rush to judge further than I already have. Aboriginal Heritage Protection System",86
151,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Can the minister advise the House of the details of a decision by Commonwealth, state and territory Aboriginal affairs ministers to establish a process to effecimprove Australia's Aboriginal heritage to the benefit of protection system?",86
152,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question on a very important area of policy. I am pleased to report to the House some very good news that I hope will be welcomed on both sides of the House: last week, the ministers for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs from all states and territories met in Sydney and been unanimously agreed on a process that I confidently believe will lead to an improved the process of cooperation between all those governments, including the Commonwealth, with respect to the protection and assessment of Aboriginal heritage issues. I also think this process will certainty for industry and the wider Australian community. I should put on the record that this is an agenda that the Prime Minister set for this nation in the One Nation statement. It has been very difficult to get progress in this area of policy, but I believe that last Thursday's meeting is a very important step to making that progress. A significant aspect of the decision was the visit. recognition by all ministers of the interrelationship between the protection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and the reconciliation process. In the course of that meeting, the ministers unanimously endorsed a series of principles which were taken from a document produced by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation entitled for common ground. The significance of this is that that docuknow. ment was prepared with the very active cooperation and support of the Australian Mining Industry Council and a number of land councils. Indeed, it was welcomed by not only the government and the Australian Democrats but also the opposition. I believe this agreement by ministers is a very importany ant step forward to reaching that objective. am pleased to report the details to the House and to the member.",86
153,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is adMinister is in order. dressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of a report in today's press that drought emergency plans are being drafted by farm industry leaders for considermillion ation by the federal government? These plans reveal that animal breeding herds are already being reduced and that 70 per cent of animal stock in Australia could be wiped out, such the severity of this drought. Given that three months ago the government rejected the conincome support. cept of a drought fodder subsidy scheme, how does the Prime Minister propose that farmers with no fodder and very little income will preserve the nation's animal breeding stocks? Given the very rapid deterioration in the overall situation, is there any chance that will undertake to urgently review options for assisting farmers to preserve the nation's livelead to greater stock industries?",87
154,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have to give the Deputy Leader of the National Party marks for continuing to try. The fodder subsidy was rejected by all major farm organisations. Mr Tim Fischer-Not now.,87
155,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They knocked you off. Mr Downer-You should keep in touch with what is going on; not rely on a one-day,87
156,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked.,87
157,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said to you at the time, in contacts I have had with major farm organisations, their references to the leadership of the National Party is in the main Exploring entirely derogatory. Mr Downer-That is useless. You don't",87
158,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. I am just telling you. There was a time when there would have key been such a bond between the farm community and the National Party, but it has just gone. They do not see you representing them any more; they do not see you being relevant more; they do not recognise you any I more. They just think you are basically hobos and they do not want anything to do with you. Drought Opposition members interjecting",87
159,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime,87
160,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As you know, the government has put together a package of $164 over two years to assist with funds for those people in exceptional circumstances. Almost 4,000 applications for drought relief payments have been lodged with the Departis ment of Social Security, and over 1,500 of these have been approved. That is in terms of In terms of the rural adjustment scheme, there have been increased resources. The rural adjustment scheme is now a demand driven scheme, whereas before it was a cash limited scheme. If people want to avail themselves of he support under the rural adjustment scheme or debt and have an interest rate subsidy paid to meet it and then use those funds on fodder, it is entirely up to each farmer and grazier to make their own choice. What we found, and what farm leaders have said in the past, is that fodder subsidies have been rorted by the fodder suppliers. I do not know why the National Party feels that it is such a point of objection that farmers themselves make a decision as to how they wish to employ funds which they can get with RAS support. It is up to them to decide whether it should be into fodder subsidies or how it should go. Rather, what you want us to do is to get into the fodder business. There was a need for policy to address the problems of drought. The policy coming from you was fodder subsidies. One farmer said to me, 'I can't eat the fodder. I can't get out there and munch into it.' That is what he thought of the fodder subsidy. He said, 'A fodder subsidy is not going to help my kids stay at school.' They wanted income support, and they have got it. The Austudy farm assets test has been removed for families in exceptional circumstances. They have the non-cash limited driver of the rural adjustment scheme and they have increased resources for financial counselling to try to assist farmers to apply for benefits and to direct them into managing their resources where they think they can. I think the fact that nearly 9,000 certificates have been issued by RAS authorities to farmers in exceptional circumstance areas is an indication of how the policy is working. Those farmers who believe that they are viable, that they can take on carry-on finance and that RAS funds can meet the interest subsidy-by the way, another fib you have been putting around is that interest rates are rising and therefore the RAS payment will be of no benefit to farmers. In fact, the RAS payments cover the interest subsidy completely. You put these things around in all the farm journals, but, basically, you are losing it. The farm community sees the government being more interested in them than you have ever been. We have the policy to deal with their problems. As a consequence, you know there is a sea change occurring and that is why the National Party is polling so poorly in New South Wales at the moment. With a state election coming up in March next year, you are starting now to really wonder about yourselves. The government thinks it has got the right policy mix in place. There is no point the deputy leader banging a drum about the policy long since rejected by farm organisations, farm communities, farmers and graziers. Let us leave it to them to make judgments about how they best should use their funds and not get into the business of rorting fodder arrangements and fodder subsidies. Ecotourism",87
161,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the. Minister for Tourism. As the minister would be aware, the World Congress on Adventure Travel and Ecotourism is currently taking place in Tasmania. Can the minister inform the House what this government is doing to promote the sustainable development of ecotourism in Australia?",88
162,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I appreciate this question from such a well-known and keen bush walker as the honourable member for Lyons. I am sure all honourable members from Tasmania have certainly noticed that there have been 500 delegates from around the world and Australia in Tasmania for the World Congress on Adventure Travel and Ecotourism this week. The government has been very keen to encourage growth and expansion in ecotourism because people who are visiting our national parks and interested in learning about our wildlife tend to be people who stay longer and spend more money while they are here. We are very keen to encourage an expansion in this area through the government's $10 million national ecotourism program. Last Sunday a symposium was held in Hobart to look at ways of encouraging the use of innovative technology to reduce the use of energy, to encourage conservation of water and to improve the waste management practices of a number of these establishments. The government has been very keen also to establish a national ecotourism accreditation scheme so that we can seek to ensure that operators who do the right thing, who ensure that their staff are properly trained and ensure that their operations have a minimum effect on the environment do get recognition from consumers. We are also very keen to discourage the shonky operators who buy a four-wheel drive one day, hang up a shingle outside their office the next day and think that they are a qualified ecotourism operator. The government believes that, if we can get an accreditation scheme which is developed, owned and managed by the industry, its voluntary support is more likely to make it a success. The government is very strongly supportive of those who are working together, under the chairmanship of Janet Richardson, the President of the Ecotourism Association of Australia, to make that accreditation scheme a success. We believe that, if we can make this work properly, we will not only ensure that tourism is doing the right thing by the environment but also ensure that ecotourism is doing the right thing by the consumers as well.",88

The minister claimed that an AAP report said that a spokesman for me had said that changes to the coalition's industrial relations policy might include beefed up, unfair dismissal provisions and a new division within the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I have checked with my spokesman. He made no such statement to AAP. It is not our intention to include those provisions in a review of the policy. In fact, we believe the existing unfair dismissal provisions should be wound back so that there is equal treatment of employers and employees. When one reads the AAP report, it is quite clear that the reference to beefed up, unfair dismissal provisions and a new division of the AIRC were not words attributed by the AAP to my spokesman but were in fact a report of existing government legislation.

186,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The rising gap between rich and poor, especially No.8 of 1994in the Year of the Family. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",90
187,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Berowra) (4.15 p.m.)The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has evidenced in the last few days and today at question time an uncharacteristic degree of sensitivity about the government's record in relation to the disparity between the richest Australians and the poorest Australians. He ought to be sensitive on these matters. When we look at his party's record of concern in past eras and when we look at his own comments and his rhetoric in the early period of his government, we can only be extremely disappointed in the result that has been achieved. I want to do two things today: I want to put clearly before the parliament once more the government's record, because it is something that ought to be etched in everybody's mind, and I want to clearly debunk the myths that the Prime Minister and his Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) are trying to develop to explain away what is occurring in Australia today. Quite frankly, those myths that they are trying to perpetuate by repeating them over and over again do not bear any real scrutiny. I saw a very telling article in today's Australian headed 'Both parents jobless in lOpc of traditional families'. The Prime Minister took that report and said that the problem is with the presentation. He did not deny the figures. He wanted to try to dress them up in a different way so that nobody would understand what is happening in Australia today. So the points are very clear. During Labor's period in office, the gap between rich and poor has widened. There is an underclass of people-Labor's underclass-which has been trapped in poverty and lacking in hope. The reality is that it has been created by the policies of the government itself. The government has not got the policies to redress it. This underclass has come into existence largely because of the continued unemployment that we experience today. That was a problem of Labor's creation; a result of its policies; a problem which, despite its record, it has proven incapable of solving. This matter of public importance relates to families in particular. The plight of families in this the International Year of the Family was shown in the figures released yesterday by the government Statistician in an Australian Bureau of Statistics publication. The points are very clear. The starkness can be simply seen when we use those figures. In one in 10 couple families-that is the term the Statistician uses; I notice that the Australian still calls them traditional families-both parents are out of work. That is pretty stark. Almost 19 per cent-704-of Australia's children aged under 15 live in a family which has no breadwinner. One-quarter of Australian families-1.5 million-have no working member. The number of couple families-using the Statistician's formula-or traditional families falling into the category of unemployed and welfare dependent rose by 50 per cent from 1989 to 1993. Since this time, unemployment has dropped by only two percentage points, as the Prime Minister was reminding us today. This is notwithstanding the government's claims of a substantial economic recovery. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not expect that situation to improve. A spokesman for the bureau was quoted in the same article in the Australian as saying: When you come out of a recession, things get better for a small percentage of people; there is always a group who continue to suffer under the improving conditions. It is a pity that the Prime Minister did not consider the plight of these people when he gave Australia the recession that he told us we had to have. But the suffering which this government has placed upon families and which was outlined in the same article by Bettina Cass, the chairwoman of the national council for the International Year of the Family, needs to be understood. She said: . . . the plight of these families was the most urgent social issue facing the Federal Government. She was quoted as saying: ""The needs of families with unemployed workers must be of paramount consideration . . . About 50 per cent of the long-term unemployed have families; if we are ever going to get them back into the workforce we need to recognise their needs."" Very often, when I raise the question of unemployment, people come to me and say, 'Well, what would you do about it?' We know that the government does not think we have any policies in this regard. But what I want to point out is that even the government's apologists have given up on it. Only this week in the Sydney Morning Herald Ross Gittins, the economics editor, wrote an article under the heading 'Keating the Great on downhill run'. He made this very simple observation: The more you see of the Keating Government the more you come to the depressing conclusion that it's just not up to the challenge of managing the economy successfully ... The obvious instance is Labor's chronic case of fiscal fatigue. And this other quote, I think, deserves to be repeated again: My desk calendar says there's a Spanish proverb to the effect that ""what the fool does in the end the wise do in the beginning"". I read that and thought of our cocksure Prime Minister. But though Mr Keating's recalcitrance on fiscal policy is getting all the attention, the Government's loss of willpower on micro-economic reform is even more disillusioning. You see it in a succession of weak decisions which, though not major in themselves, add up to a Government that's given up the fight. I do not believe that there have been any more perspicacious, any more telling, comments about the government than those of Ross Gittins-a man, I have to say, whom I have frequently seen in all his writings as an apologist for the government. He has given up on it. I would remind people of what Helen Hughes said in this place because I thought her comments were even more alarming. When she was speaking before a parliamentary seminar on employment, she made the point that we are creating an underclass and that it is not an underclass that is of its own making but one that is being created by the way in which we run this economy. She went on to say this-and I think it is something that ought to be etched in the minds of every member of parliament and every Australian when they look at the government's policies of today: The second point I want to make is the Green Papers and the White Papers are not about employment they are about making unemployment palatable to the cornmunity and all I can say is that if we follow the policies of those papers then next time we have a recession unemployment will be who knows 12-14% or perhaps if we are a republic, we may be like the republic of Ireland where it is 15-16% because there is nothing in those papers that is real medicine it is as if the patient has TB and the papers are about bandages. I do not think there is any more telling comment about the government having given up. But, since Labor has come to power, the rich have become richer and the poor have become poorer. This is a fact. None of the Prime Minister's rhetoric-or I might say the minister's rhetoric-can disguise it. Taking inflation into account, the top 10 per cent of earners in Australia have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent since Labor took office, and over the same period real wages for the bottom 10 per cent of earners have fallen by five per cent. It is the policies of Labor that have polarised the Australian community into groups of high income earners and low income earners-and the gap is steadily increasing. Tables have been produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that amply demonstrate that. I would certainly like to read them, but that would only take up time unnecessarily. Professor Saunders, who directs for the government its Social Policy Research Centre, had this to say: Australia is among the most unequal of the countries studied . . . despite many claims to the contrary. Australia's wage system, selective income tested social security systemwhich the minister often says we ought to take into accountand heavy reliance on progressive income tax have not, in fact, produced a more equal distribution of income than elsewhere. This naturally leads to the central question of why this is the case . . . one that poses a fundamental challenge for those who view Australia as an egalitarian country. So there is the government's own adviser saying that the government's rhetoric is wrong. We have Ann Harding, whom the government quotes from favourably when it wants to justify an update to the Henderson poverty line. She recently put out her study, which I have quoted from before, to ACOSS. She is the head of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra. According to that study, Australia has one of the unfairest distributions of national income in the developed world. The top 20 per cent of our income earners get 42.1 per cent of total earnings, and the bottom 20 per cent get 5.4 per cent. When averaged out, the poorest 10 per cent of Australians have an equivalent income of $85 a week, while the richest 10 per cent have an equivalent income of $1,500 per week. The only Western country doing worse than Australia is Great Britain. The Harding study also shows that the difference between the rich and poor has got larger since Labor came to power. According to her, the rich have got richer at the expense of middle income earners, primarily because under Labor the incomes of the rich have accelerated while other incomes have barely changed. I encourage the minister to have a look at that again. Professor Harding also indicated that the nature of poverty has changed. The major poverty problem in 1983 was with the aged. Since Labor came to power, it is now a working age phenomenon. It is a working age phenomenon because of the unemployment crisis created by the government. I would like to hear the Prime Minister try to explain why we have one in eight traditional families falling below the poverty line, why poverty is increasing in almost every group except the aged, and why of all Australians living in poverty just one half come from traditional nuclear families. In this International Year of the Family, I think we would all like to hear that explanation. When confronted by these facts, the minister and the Prime Minister put two flawed arguments to bolster their claim. The first is that employment is increasing. When they have to explain these unfavourable studies, the second reason they give is that they have not taken into account the benefits of the social wage. I want to take up each of those points individually. Of the jobs created by the Labor government since it came into power, the majority have been part-time jobs, not full-time jobs. Full-time employment has increased by 14 per cent, while part-time employment has risen by a massive 70 per cent. If we look at the outcome, we see that, while it has lifted some incomes marginally, it is not the same as getting people into real employment. The white paper measures will only exacerbate this situation. Until the economy is restructured to create a significant number of full-time jobs, the current situation will persist. In relation to the growth in employment, it is largely a factor of population growth. It is not a factor of anything the government has particularly achieved. That is spelt out in the statistics that the Prime Minister gave us today when he reminded us all that unemployment is still at over nine per cent at a time when we are supposed to be coming out of the recession. The government has often stated that it has increased the social wage. I concede that there have been a number of benefits, which we have talked about, of marginal extension to family incomes. The home child-care allowance cashed out the dependent spouse rebate but provided little additional funds. But what the government fails to comprehend is that the social wage should always be the second best option after increasing employment prospects. The effects of social wage increases have been nullified. They have been effectively nullified by industrial relations constraints and the tax inefficiencies introduced by the government. The results of this are sad but simple. The costs of employing people are rising. We are not saving enough. We are not investing enough. The net effect is that the government is not creating enough employment to erode long-term unemployment in this country. It is not a question of saying, 'You have not taken the social wage into account. We found some way of bandaging up the problem.' It is a question of how you can address the fundamental problems facing Australia today. The biggest problem I had in preparing for this address today was the number of available studies and the choice among the mass of information that reveals what is happening today. The situation is clear: this government, notwithstanding all of its rhetoric or all it has said over decades, has created a situation in which the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. The only difference is that the government ministers are trying to join the rich. (TIme expired)",90
188,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have just heard a contribution from the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) on this important subject which, quite frankly, was factually wrong in almost every conceivable respect. I will tum to that in a minute. We heard the misquotation and systematic misinterpretation of papers and studies. In some cases the honourable member portrayed a picture which is the diametrical opposite of reality. That is not surprising given that the contribution of the opposition on social policy was described by Laurie Oakes, I think, as 'a characteristically lightweight effort'. I can only concur with that. I notice that the member for Berowra, seeking a definition of the 'welfare state', turned to the Penguin Dictionary of Politics. I suppose it is unfortunate that the Penguin Dictionary of Politics did not contain a definition of 'policy'. Maybe that would have been of some value. I want to contest the central claims of the opposition. I guess the starting point is that we have to acknowledge that during the 1980s, throughout the developed world, forces were operating which have tended to drive earnings differentials wider. That is the case, but you cannot just look at it from that point of view. The factors that led to that have been the subject of quite a bit of discussion and analysis. People talk about the impact of the globalisation. In effect, low paid workers in industrialised countries are increasingly in competition with workers in developing countries. Then there is the impact of technological change in the nature of work, and that has both an upskilling and deskilling effect, again tending to widen earning differentials. So, if you look at the raw information on earnings, there is some widening in this country. But that is a feature, as I said, of most developed countries, particularly countries in the Anglo-Saxon world. A number of those changes I referred to-the globalisation, technological change, the changing nature of work-obviously have very positive effects in a good many respects. But this tendency to widen earning differentials is obviously a negative. The relevant issue from the point of view of government is what is the impact of government policy on those things and to what extent has government policy either exacerbated or diminished those underlying trends of inequality? If you look at our effort in that area, there is no doubt that government policy has tended to diminish and, quite possibly, to have negated those underlying forces, producing increases in earning differentials. There have been a number of studies done which have made it very clear that the impact of our tax and social security transfer payments system has been to very significantly mitigate inequality. There is no doubt about that at all. Since this government came to office, there have been enormous improvements in the quality of the social security safety netincreases in targeted payments to low income families between 50 per cent and 100 per cent in real terms, real increases in pensions, very substantial increases in rental assistance, and increases in benefits paid to people who are unemployed. Across the board, there have been improvements in those areas in real terms and measured against any of the poverty lines currently in use, particularly the Henderson poverty line. The Henderson poverty line is a flawed construction. I will talk about that a bit later on. Whichever poverty line you care to choose, things have improved markedly. That is a very sharp contrast with the performance of the opposition. Key benefits fell in real terms during the Fraser years. The result during our tenure has been the diametrical opposite. The government has acted to promote employment growth-26 per cent, over two million-since this party came to office. Contrast that with the situation in New Zealand during the 1980s where the economy and employment growth were virtually stagnant for long periods of time and only in the relatively recent period have we seen reasonable employment growth in that country. In fact, employment growth in Australia in the five years or so towards the end of the 1980s was the most rapid in the OECD world. As a result of the recovery we are now experiencing, we have seen extraordinarily fast employment growth over the last few months. That, obviously, has a major bearing on living standards, inequality and levels of poverty. It is important to note that we have achieved this growth in employment in the context of an industrial relations framework designed to ensure equity in the distribution of the benefits of recovery. That, again, is in sharp contrast with the policies of the opposition. One of the things which is very clear from studies of inequality throughout the developed world is that in those countries where we have seen wholesale labour market deregulation and the stripping away of any semblance of a safety net the trend is consistently est towards greater inequality. That is the case, for example, in Great Britain where the so-called genie coefficient, which is a measure of inequality, is shown quite unambiguously. That country has experienced the worse growth in inequality in the developed world. Again, there is a very strong correlation between those unusually rapid deteriorations in terms of inequality and deregulated labour markets. The coalition would go along with a wholesale deregulation of the labour market. That is a central element of its policy. There is no reason, therefore, to suppose that things would not deteriorate very severely under its tenure. Where are the major cuts in the social wage, of the order of $10 billion or so, which the coalition has committed to, going to impact? They will inevitably be on low income earners. If we look at the whole set of proposals on families policy that we have seen float from the opposition, we see that the one thing the proposals have in common is their extreme regressivity-whether you are talking about income splitting, as proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), or about taking all the assistance for families and dividing it up per head, as suggested by Senator Minchin. There are a variety of proposals coming from the opposition. All of them would make the situation of those on lowest incomes worse. The opposition can say what it likes about this government's achievements-they have been considerable in improving the quality of the safety net-but the fact is that there is no ambiguity that coalition policies would severely worsen the prospects of people on low incomes. The opposition spokesperson talked about a number of studies which he claims support the coalition's position. What I and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have said consistently is that in considering these questions you have to look at a comprehensive measure of people's material well-being. It is not enough to look at money incomes. That is not disputed by any serious social researcher who has considered these matters. This is particularly so in a situation where over the 1980s there has been an explicit trade-off between the strong- growth in money wages and social wage expenditures. That has been a central feature of the accord framework. The various elements that bear on living standards have to be factored in. For example, if health and housing are taken out of the picture the level of inequality is increased by a factor of about 20 per cent. It is obviously the case that in considering this government's record we have to take into account the introduction of Medicare, the spread of child care, all the measures to improve the social security safety net, all the improvements in the housing assistance and so forth. All these things have to be factored in. There have been a number of attempts to adopt a more comprehensive approach to looking at these matters. In question time the other day I referred to the study by Peter Travers and Sue Richardson, which was set out in a recent book entitled Living decently: material well-being in Australia, published by Oxford University Press last year. In this particular study the researchers have gone out of their way to look at all the determinants of material well-being: access to services, the social wage, levels of home ownership, ability to make use of assets-as well as conventional cash incomes. I quote them again because I think it is very telling: Our chief conclusion is that at the end of the 1980s most Australians were indeed 'living decently'. Material affluence was at an all-time high. Australia was not the world-leader in equality, but it still ranked around the middle of the dozen most equal countries in the world. Australia is a world-leader when it comes to social mobility; that is, both privilege and disadvantage are less likely to be inherited in Australia than in any other country. There is disadvantage, of course, but one of our more positive findings is that disadvantage in one aspect of life is often offset by advantages elsewhere. They then go on to give a number of examples of that. They continue: Our positive picture of high levels of affluence and of relative equality is at variance with the 'gloom and doom' that is typical of many editorial writers and political and social commentators. One reason for this is that we use rather more complex measuring-sticks of affluence and of material disadvantage than are common in Australia. That is the central point: when you take this comprehensive view, the whole picture changes quite markedly. Another important study, released only very recently, was written by Peter Whiteford, the Senior Research Fellow in the Social Policy Research Unit at the University of York. His paper is called 'Income distribution and social policy under a reformist government: the Australian experience' and is published in a British journal called Policy and Politics. Again, the approach he has adopted has involved an attempt to look comprehensively at all the factors that bear on material well-being. I will quote a couple of excerpts from his article, which is a very rigorous analysis that, again, takes this comprehensive approach: In terms of the criticisms of the Australian Government policy in the 1980s, the conclusion of this article is that rather than substantial increases in poverty, falls in living standards, and increases in inequality, living standards were higher and inequality slightly lower in 1990 than when Labor took office. If poverty is measured by reference to a constant real poverty line, then poverty had fallen substantially. He then makes a very stark contrast between that situation in Australia and the situation prevailing in the United Kingdom, governed, of course, by a political party of the same persuasion as that of the opposition. The article continues on that specific matter: Whatever the caveats that must be attached to these comparisons, it is difficult to accept that the of these governments are similar. That is, the UK and Australia. It continues: The UK figures suggest a dramatic widening in income inequality. The Australian figures suggest a slight narrowing in income inequality. Clearly, important trends have not been incorporated in the microsimulation, and the results are partial. Nevertheless, the analysis is significantly more comprehensive than that of the critics. Again, he sums up the thrust of policy in this country by saying: It seems fair to sum up the ALP's record as combining egalitarian social policies with economic policies attempting to enhance efficiency, within the framework of a consensual incomes policy. They are the studies that have adopted this comprehensive approach, which is essential. It is no good just looking at earnings in isolation. Everybody who looks at the issue seriously accepts that. When you take that comprehensive approach, you get a very different picture. We are seeing the abuse by the opposition of the papers written by Dr Ann Harding. Dr Harding, it is true, is a stringent critic of the Henderson poverty line. This paper by Ann Harding that the opposition referred to does use the Henderson poverty line, which seems a bit strange. If honourable members read the paper by Dr Harding, they will see that she is very clear in saying that it should not be regarded in any sense as a definitive measure of poverty levels. She makes it very clear that it basically tells you where the hot spots are. Mr Ruddock-But it was indicative of the trend.",94
189,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me quote her: Thus, the following results are best used as a guide to poverty 'hot spots' and the relative problems faced by different groups, rather than as definitive estimates of 'poverty' in Australia today. Of course, that does not stop you from using and abusing the statistics as if they were definitive. I reiterate: the government's record since it was elected in 1983 has been one of repairing the tax base to remove inequitiesparticularly picking up capital gains, fringe benefits and various other elements that were completely, or effectively, ignored beforerecords and to systematically act to repair and improve the targeting of the social security safety nets with very substantial real improvements in the levels of payments going those who are worse off in our society. I repeat that we focused particularly families. Targeted assistance to low income families has increased in many cases by up 100 per cent in real terms. Comparing this country's and this government's performance housing. against a meaningful and appropriate international comparison, we look pretty good. expired)",96
190,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am dren delighted to have the opportunity to speak in this debate on a matter of public importance. But I am totally puzzled at how the minister at the table, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), can have the utter gall-the front, to use the word of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-to accuse the honourable people. member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) of being factually wrong. I find that totally inexpliof cable. The minister then introduced the smokescreen of the quality of the safety net. Then he said, 'Try to excuse the inequality income in this country. This happens anyare where throughout the developed world.' Let me tell the minister, before he runs away because he does not want to hear the that the Luxembourg income study which started in 1983Mr Baldwin interjecting",97
191,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, you should quote it accurately. The Luxembourg income study, which Australia joined in 1978, discloses quite clearly that, in the table ranking inequality, Australia is near the bottom. Of the health 10 countries in the study, we are right down the bottom with Germany and the United States. I was also quite staggered to hear the minister say-I am not quoting him exactly but this is the import of what he said-'You shouldn't consider poverty in terms of money. Income isn't all important.' The 20 per cent of unemployed people in my electorate would disagree with that. The minister said, 'Well, of course you've got to consider the areas health and housing.' I agree with that, sure, but there is a relationship between health housing and poverty. The fact that you are poor has an adverse impact on you in terms of poverty. An article in the Age stated that to more than 13,000 homeless people were housed in supported accommodation services. on One in four people who rent and one in four people under 24 years of age were living to below the poverty line. There is a reference for the ministers to talk about health and The first international study of single (Time motherhood has found that most single mothers are living in poverty and that chilfrom these families are likely to have a reduced life expectancy. Yes, health is associated with poverty. An article in the Age on 16 September this year states that poverty is a health risk. It stated that Australians living in poor areas have a far greater chance of getting sick and dying young than do more affluent The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare survey gives a disturbing assessment health disparities between the rich and poor. Men in poor areas are up to 70 per cent more likely to die early than are those in in wealthy suburbs. Women in poorer suburbs three times more likely to die from diabetes, and men in the same areas have a 72 per cent greater chance of committing suicide or facts, being killed in a traffic accident. Unemployment is also inextricably linked to poor health, with the death rate for jobless men between 25 and 64 years of age more than 16 per cent above the national average. How can the minister enter this debate and start talking about the relationship between money and poverty, and say, 'Oh, well, the and housing offsets the lack of money'? Mr Bruce Scott-He walked out of the debate.",97
192,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He did indeed. The report also said that the avoidable death rate for the unemployed is up to 130 per cent higher. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the people listening to debate: that is totally unacceptable. The minister says, 'Oh, well, you don't have to worry about money,' but if of you are poor you have poorer housing and you have poorer health. Men on low incomes and are six times more likely to suffer mental illness and twice as likely to get ulcers, and women on low incomes have a 50 per cent greater chance of suffering nervous tension and insomnia. So the minister should not tell me that it does not matter if we do not have the money because we have health and housing. All the evidence tells us that the health of people in poverty is far worse than the health of the rest of the community. Under Labor, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I want to present the House and the people who are listening with some vital figures that demonstrate what has happened over the last 11 years. Wealth is certainly a factor to consider when looking at the rich or the poor. In 1990, one per cent of Australians owned 19.7 per cent of all the wealth. The top 10 cent owned 52.2 per cent. The top 20 per cent owned 72 per cent of all the wealth in Australia. The top 50.5 per cent owned 98.4 per cent of all wealth in Australia. After 11 years of Labor, the bottom 49.5 per cent own only 1.6 per cent of the wealth. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Look at the distribution of wage income. This excludes the unemployed. If the unemployed are included, the figure becomes far worse. Research by Messrs Rees, Rodley and Stilwell shows that inequality has increased by over 25 per cent in the past 16 years. The share of the bottom 20 per cent of the population was 8.2 per cent in 1975 and down to 5.9 per cent in 1990. The share of the top 20 per cent-this is of wage income-was 34.2 per cent in 1975 and up to 37.3 per cent in 1990. Under Labor, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The share of taxable income is another excellent measure of inequality. Under Labor, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The bottom 20 per cent of taxpayers in 1978 and 1979 had 9.5 per cent of the taxable income. In 1989-90, it was down to seven per cent. The top 20 per cent of the taxpayers in 1978-79 had 35.3 per cent of the taxable income. In 1989-90, it was up to 40.2 per cent. Under Labor, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Mr MCGauran-All the Labor mates.",97
193,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is undoubtedly true. The share of total gross household income is another indicator. It is one the minister cannot argue with. People need money. From 1984 to 1988-89, there was a 15.3 per cent fall in the share going to the bottom 10 per cent of households. The top 10 per cent increased their share by 5.3 per cent. The bottom 10 per cent fell 15.3 per cent. The top 10 per cent increased it by 5.3 per cent. In 1989, the top 10 per cent of households in Australia received 8.5 times as much in total gross household income as the bottom 10 per cent. Eight and a half times more is equality, justice and fairness! That is Labor. Mr MCGauran-That's the Labor way.",98
194,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is the Labor way. Under the Labor way, the rich get richer and the poor per get poorer. I am not objecting to the rich getting richer. I want a society where everybody can improve, get a better income, increase their wealth and assets and provide for their children. I do not want a society where the elitists get richer and the poor get poorer. That is what we have under Labor. That is what all its policies have been directed to over the last 11 years. Take the percentage of gross household income. For married couples with one dependent child, in 1984 to 1988-89, the top 20 per cent increased their share of gross household income by 22.4 per cent. It was up from 32.5 per cent in 1948 to 39.8 per cent of the total in 1988-89. At the same time, the share of the bottom 10 per cent fell by 10.7 per cent. In summary, the top 20 per cent got 39.8 per cent of the total gross household income and the bottom 20 per cent got 9.34 per cent. Mr MCGauran-There is something very wrong.",98
195,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Very wrong indeed. Under Labor, the rich do get richer and the poor do get poorer. The recession has been particularly harsh for those on lower incomes. Look at gross income share. For 1991-92-this is the most recent figure available-the lowest 50 per cent of families received only 21.9 per cent of the gross income.",98
196,Mr LLOYD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Shameful.,98
197,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is shameful indeed. What sort of a country are we when we get to a situation where so many of our families are receiving so little of the cake? We in the coalition want a bigger cake so that everybody can get not only a better share but also a fairer share. Under Labor, for 11 years, we have had total inequity and a lack of justice and fairness. Under Labor, the rich have become richer and the poor have become much poorer.",98
198,Mrs EASSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Over the last few decades, social scientists have been arguing about inequity in society and the models that they have used. Professor Ann Harding was quoted before, but I would like to read a different quote from a paper that she presented in 1994 entitled Family income and social security policy. She points out the difficulties with the methods that are used. She states: . .. the traditional Henderson approach gives aggregate poverty rates which vary by up to 50 per cent, depending upon the precise methodological decisions made ... Based on the STINMOD model, and using the 50 per cent of Whiteford median income poverty measure, only 4.8 per cent of individuals were in poverty in April 1994. If one uses the 50 per cent of median income poverty line (which is $315 a week after-tax for a couple with two children, or almost $16,500 a year), there appear to be no sole parents and very few couples with children in poverty. All this analysis tells us so far is that the depend critically upon the poverty line used. She says: What conclusions can be drawn from the mass of data presented above? First, it should be clear that poverty rate measures are very volatile, with small movements in the poverty line or in social security payment rates producing large swings in poverty rates. Inequity and poverty in society are directly related to income levels, and the income is derived from employment. Let us look at today's figures. The labour force statistics of the Australian Bureau of Statistics that came out today point out that, seasonally adjusted, the unemployment rate has gone down from 9.5 per cent in September 1994 to 9.1 per cent this month. Mr Ruddock-How much was that again?",99
199,Mrs EASSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It is 9.1 per cent. Mr Ruddock-Is that good?,99
200,Mrs EASSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is certainly better than it was. We are certainly getting it down. The trend estimates indicate that employment continues to rise and is now 5.1 per cent higher than the January 1993 low point. Fulltime employment has been increasing since September 1992. Unemployment has fallen since September 1993 to 817,500 in October 1994, the lowest level since May 1991. This represents a 9.3 per cent fall in the year since October 1993. It is not unusual to see marked changes from month to month in a period of strong employment growth such as this, but the key issue is the unambiguously positive underlying trend. These figures confirm continuing recovery and further consolidation of the strong improvements in the labour market over the past 12 months. It is clear that, while we still have a long way to go, the government's policies are working and we are well on the way to beating unemployment. I would also like to point out that the unemployment rate in New South Wales fell to 8.8 per cent from 9.3 per cent in September. That is a very welcome result. The keys to employment growth can be found in the macro-economic environment. They are low inflation, strong growth of 4.5 per cent and results strong investment. Sustainable growth is needed, and we are achieving this. We are cutting unemployment. More white paper programs are needed. We have the job compact which focuses on long-term unemployment so that everyone gets a chance. We also need investment in human capital. I would like to quote from a paper delivered to the Evatt Foundation on 5 October by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). He talks about Working Nation. He says: Working Nation is about equity. It is about giving all Australians a share in the nation's prosperity. It is only through sustained growth that we will be able to make real inroads into unemployment. Already we are making substantial progress, creating 340,000 new jobs since the March 1993 election. Sustained economic and employment growth will only be possible with strong investment. The government has worked hard to create the right environment and incentives for business: · We cut corporate tax rates from 39% down to 33%; · We introduced generous investment incentives in One Nation through the investment allowance and through development bonds; and · In One Nation we committed substantial resources to upgrading road and rail infrastructure. These policies, combined with economic growth of over 4 per cent, the lowest inflation rates in three decades and record corporate profits are translating into higher investment. Working Nation is delivering additional investment incentives . . . infrastructure bonds . . . tax rebate. Working Nation reduced the concessional tax rate for pooled development. These are important initiatives, but the real emphasis of Working Nation's investment of $10.3 billion is on investment in human capital. We are extending micro economic reform into delivery of labour market programs and into the training arena. Our competitiveness as a nation, and our ability to deliver sustained economic growth depends on our ability to develop a world class labour force, one that is highly skilled and flexible. And we must tap into all of its potential, ensuring that the skills experience of the labour force meets industry needs. Over the last decade the government has transformed Australia's education and training system. The national training wage is up and running. New subsidy arrangements are in place. Training subsidies are more generous than they have ever been before. NETTFORCE (the National Employment and Training Taskforce) has been established and is delivering. I will make a comment about my electorate and the area consultative committees that are being established. The Inner Western Sydney Area Consultative Committee in my electorate has already been established. The document goes on to say: They will be and are providing advice on local needs. the effectiveness of government programs and how they can be improved and tailored to local needs. ACCS will also be providing advice on the establishment of new work opportunities. At the MTIA in September, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training said: But growth alone is not enough . . . To ensure that the long term unemployment are not left behind as the economy recovers. Working Nation's job compact will give every person unemployed for 18 months or more a job placement. In the 1990s we must ensure that growth is not constrained by skills blockages. It is for this reason that Working Nation is investing heavily in skills formation. I think the opposition has a cheek to raise these sorts of issues when, at the last election, it wanted to tip unemployed people off the unemployment benefit after nine months. This and government provides services to low income families. Earlier this week, when the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) asked a question of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during question time, he said: Over our period of time $6 billion has been transferred in family payments, particularly to low income families and to families on incomes up to the extension of the income test for the family allowance. There has been endless debate in this country about where a poverty line is these days. One thing is for sure-there would be a lot more people in poverty without two million jobs having been created and without these huge transfers in the budget having taken place, which the coalition is arraigned against. I will conclude by referring to Peter Trower and Sue Richardson's 1993 book entitled Living decently. They say: . By far the most important form of wealth is the family home: 75-80 per cent of Australians eventually own their own home free of debt and the house represents 55-60 per cent of total household wealth. . Wealth rises with education (about 10 per cent for each additional year) and age (about 2.5 per cent for each additional year up to age 58). This government has done more than any previous government to increase the levels of education. They go on to say: Thus, it is safe to conclude that Australia ranks in the top dozen or so countries in the world in terms of equality in the distribution of income. The evidence we have on the distribution of earnings is consistent with this assessment. Not only is Australia relatively egalitarian in the distribution of income, it is more so now than in the past. They go on further to say: This move toward a more equal distribution applies not only to income but also to wealth ... Were a more comprehensive measure of income to be used which embraced government-provided services such as health and education, the decrease in inequality over time would be even more pronounced.",99

202,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the ninth and 10th reports of the committee for 1994 relating to the midlife upgrade of Blarney Barracks, Kapooka, New South Wales, and the stage 2 redevelopment of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory. Ordered that the reports be printed.",101
203,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The first report which I have tabled involves the midlife upgrade of Blarney Barracks in Kapooka, New South Wales. The committee has recom1994 mended that the project proceed at an estimated cost of $21.5 million. Most of the buildings at Kapooka were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s and are now in need of refurbishment. Present working and living conditions at the barracks are below standard, with the rank and file and recruit kitchen not meeting building codes or occupational health and safety requirements. A need therefore exists to provide suitable working and living conditions for recruits and staff stationed at the barracks at Kapooka. While at the barracks at Kapooka, the committee was impressed with the green areas around the base. The committee compliments the Department of Defence on reticulated treated effluent from the sewerage treatment facilities being used to irrigate these landscaped areas at Kapooka. During the public hearing, concern was expressed that local industry would not be given the opportunity to be involved in the project. The Department of Defence has since held meetings with the building industry in Wagga Wagga and assurances were given that the construction manager for the project will not be tendering for construction works at Kapooka. The committee was advised by the buildings. Department of Defence that it intends to conduct a seminar with the building industry in Wagga Wagga to discuss forms of contract and tendering processes. The Department Defence advised that each package or trade element will be awarded as the result of competitive tendering process. Local panies should therefore be in a strong position to make competitive bids. The committee has recommended that the Department of Defence continue discussions with the building industry in Wagga Wagga and proceed with its intention of conducting as possible. a seminar for the building industry in the near future. The committee has commended the Department of Defence on its willingness to liaise with members of the building industry concerning the proposed works. The second report which I have tabled involves the stage 2 redevelopment of the Royal Military College at Duntroon. The has Royal Military College is the premier instituproblems tion for the training of officers of the Australshould Ian Army. It trains men and women in the skills of leadership, tactics, military law administrative procedures. The proposal examined by the committee involved the to the House. provision of modem and functional facilities to support the training objectives of the college, and comprises: a new logistics complex and headquarters building; extensions to the gymnasium, officers' mess, military instruction block and medical centre; the upgrading of playing fields and ovals, along with adjustments to the existing road network to provide safer and more efficient traffic circulation. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed at an estimated out-tum cost of $28.7 million. A significant element of the proposed works is the construction of a new logistics complex. The committee concluded that the existing complex is housed in inadequate and deficient accommodation and that it should be replaced. Another element is the proposed construction of a new headquarters building. The committee concluded that the proposed location and design of the proposed new headquarters building are consistent with the master plan and should be compatible with adjacent A feature of the redevelopment which those members who travel to and from Canberra airport-most of the members of this Houseof will notice when the work is completed will be the provision of a new main entrance. This a is dictated largely by the ACT government's comproposed duplication of Morshead Drive, which was examined by another committee some years ago. The committee has recommended that the Department of Defence and the ACT government should discuss coordination of road construction with a view to the work being undertaken concurrently as soon In connection with the upgrading of the playing fields, the committee was pleased to discover that the army has a pilot project under way involving the use of grey water to water the playing fields. If the pilot project proves feasible, substantial savings in water and funds will be achieved. The committee therefore recommended that, if no salinity emerge, the use of grey water be extended to all playing fields at Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force and Academy, as well as other defence establishments, where practical. I commend the reports",101
204,Mr HICKS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I commend the government on this expenditure of $21.5 million for the midlife upgrade of Blamey Barracks, just west of Wagga Wagga. I think it is fitting that it be called Blamey Barracks because, as we know, Field Marshall Sir Thomas B1amey, one of Australia's most famous soldiers, lived much of his early life in and around Wagga Wagga. I do not know if members of the House know that all soldiers in the Australian Army do their first recruit training at the recruit training battalion at Kapooka near Wagga Wagga. It is in that establishment that the foundation of many military careers have been formed and are being formed. More than physical exercise, drill and weapons training are taught there. It is there that those values and virtues that we hold dear in our Defence Force personnel are first formed-the virtues of self-discipline, respect for themselves and their own ability, respect for other people, and respect for the flag and Australian institutions. Wherever Australian soldiers go, they are highly regarded and highly respected for those virtues of courage and loyalty. With the peacekeeping forces we have had in the past in Cyprus, the Middle East and other places and, more recently, in Somalia and Cambodia, the initial virtues which are instilled in soldiers in Kapooka have come to the fore. I know that members of this House are always impressed with the calibre of Australia's youth, particularly those who have a desire to serve in our defence forces. From speaking to Lieutenant Colonel David Kibbey, the commandant at Kapooka, I found that he holds those views even more strongly than I do. He is absolutely amazed at the calibre of our young people. The expenditure on the mid-life upgrade is important, because it is important for our soldiers' morale that they know they are serving in a modern and high-tech force. This is in tune with the national training agenda of the federal government, which I think is also very important. It is no good coming from a school which may have computers into a Defence Force training establishment which just has chalk and a blackboard. So I regard this expenditure as being of the utmost importance. The alterations and additions are necessary also because, as the chairman of the committee, the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said, the main buildings were constructed in 196566. So the making of these alterations are long overdue, particularly in view of the antidiscrimination laws that have come in. These alterations reflect the change in social climate that has occurred over the last 30 years, particularly in the training of young women along with the men in our defence forces. The carrying out of these alterations will mean millions of dollars of disposable income for Wagga; the money will be spent there. The army already spends millions of dollars in Wagga, it employs 75 civilians in the area and, of course, graduations are often held there-I think almost once a week when the Kapooka barracks are working at maximum levels. Of course, families come to Wagga to watch the graduation ceremonies and they spend a lot of money there. I also sincerely thank the chairman and members of the committee for coming to Wagga and listening to the concerns of the army. I thank them also for listening to the concerns of those local contractors who in the past have felt left out of being able to put in tenders for some of the contracts, both big and small. Now that their fears have been allayed, they will be able to submit tendersand I think that is a good thing. I congratulate the committee on this report. I thank the committee for coming to Wagga and look forward now to the building and upgrading of the Blamey barracks, which I am sure will well serve not only our defence forces at Kapooka but also the Australian nation.

205,Mr WAKELIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No.2) amends legislation in three main areas: it brings the Coal Industry Tribunal into the Industrial Relations Commission; it brings in minor changes to senators' and members' allowances; and it alters voting and quorum arrangements within the National Health and Safety Commission. I will look mainly at the changes to the present Coal Industry Tribunal and the handling of the matter by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). The minister's handling of the matter is cause for concern. This bill represents the ethos of the Labor Party, of course, but also of concern is the very practical matter of the minister's workload being within his capacity or capabilities. It is on the public record now that the government and the Minister for Industrial Relations, on behalf of the government, have backed down from the original proposals to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal. The tribunal will become a separate part of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The minister cannot seem to make up his mind. He has had some difficulties, as we all know, with the air safety issue; and with ANL-worthless one day; valuable the next. The minister has demonstrated over the past month that he has been stretched beyond his limit. His current portfolios are too much for him to cope with. Turning to the record of the government on the Coal Industry Tribunal, on PM on Tuesday, 19 April the Minister for Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) said: I think that it's been very ineffective in recent times in stopping this type of industrial dispute This is the third of this type of industrial dispute in the coal industry we've had since September of last year. And I think they've been very difficult to stop. On 19 April 1994 Monica Attard, in an interview with the Minister for Industrial Relations, stated: The Federal Government has announced it will abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal as coal workers across the country strike. The Minister for Industrial Relations said: Let me say today that I believe and the Government believes that the decision of the Mineworkers' Union to take industrial action each time they're dissatisfied with the outcome of coal price negotiations, is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. It's doing great damage to this industry, and from the Government's point of view it is totally unacceptable. I think it's high time that, given the contempt that the union has consistently shown for the decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal, that we should bring the coal industry into the mainstream of industrial relations and bring it under the auspices of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. As has been said, the Coal Industry Tribunal has long been unable to stop industrial action. As we have just heard, the government has acknowledged that on occasions the tribunal is a toothless tiger. Indeed, at the time of the decision to abolish the tribunal, coal workers were on strike. I want to talk about the connection between the government and the union. It is part of Australia's history, and we are all aware of it. Let me quote the words of John Maitland when he talked about Minister Brereton and the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson. The Central Council of the United Mineworkers Federation gave Maitland the power to call an indefinite coal strike around 12 October 1994. Maitland tells reporters: Laurie appears to be the type of person that likes to engage in a bit of brinkmanship. I am now in a position to be able to engage in that same sort of brinkmanship. This is the way the Labor Party does business. The minister sounded very brave back in April, but when the heat really came on in October the minister and the government folded. The decision that the Australian people . . . have to make is whether this government is governing in the national interest and whether this government is for all the people. I do not think most Australians have to be Rhodes scholars to make up their minds about that. What the government constantly tells us is that this is only about a safety net. It is only about social justice. It is only about being fair. Fair to whom? Is it fair to militant minorities? Is it fair to those that make the loudest noise? Is it fair to the government's mates? Or is it fair to the majority of Australians? From the opposition's point of view, we have long said that it was absurd to have the Coal Industry Tribunal and the Industrial Relations Commission. To have separate tribunals to cover separate industries is an outdated system. However, as I said, the government backed down from the original plan to abolish the tribunal. Why? It backed down to the Maritime Union. The minister capitulated to pressure from the United Mineworkers Federation, and now we find the Coal Industry Tribunal is going to be an attachment to the IRC. From next year, we are told the Coal Industry Tribunal will become an industry panel within the IRC. The IRC will have to take into account precedents set by the tribunal's decision. Is there any evidence that bringing the Coal Industry Tribunal under the umbrella of the IRC will make unionists listen to it? Why should they change? Why should we continue to have a tribunal, albeit in a different form which for many years has not worked? As I indicated earlier, on 19 April the minister was waxing lyrical about what he was going to do with this tribunal. He said that he hoped 'all Australians would support the idea of an industrial umpire that covers all industry'. Clearly, the pressure got too much. He went on to say that he thought it was 'entirely reasonable in these circumstances that the commission responsible for almost every other area of IR in Australia should have an overview of the coal industry'. As I have already indicated, on 11 October the minister said on radio that it was 'absolutely appropriate and entirely sound to see the coal industry brought into the mainstream of Australian industrial relations'. Why then did he change his mind? Why later on did the minister decide to retain the tribunal as a panel within the IRC? I just have to keep coming back to it-it is everything to do with the union pressure and the union threats. The threat of that indefinite national strike-the Australian National Line strike was typical of that as well-was able to buckle the government. It was just the threat in the case of the coalminers. The Seamen's Union actually had to strike. With these threats, the unions then talk to the government. That is the crux of the matter. The CFMEU's argument is that the coal industry workers operate in a hostile and unnatural environment. After the Moura disaster, no-one is going to dispute that coal mining is a demanding and in many cases-I hope less and less cases-dangerous business. Safety is of paramount concern. But that is not the issue for this tribunal. The issue for the tribunal is about wages. Nobody is going to deny coal workers the opportunity to earn a decent wage-in fact, top wages-because they earn it. They should be paid well, but it is much more to do with the ability to twist the government's arm. Noone is going to deny them. There are millions of workers in this country who are able to negotiate arrangements, but they do not need a separate tribunal. As the minister said, it is time they came in under the same tribunal as everybody else. I will just go to some of the issues about unionism. Unionism, sadly, is about dependence, not independence. Debate interrupted; adjournment put and negatived.",104
206,Mr WAKELIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As I was saying, the difference in philosophy is quite profound. I think the great challenge for the Labor Party is that of justifying to the nation its rhetoric about defending the underdog in terms of fairness and the safety net",105

208,Mr WAKELIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, it has failed.

212,Mr WAKELIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Sixty per cent of that top half of electorates, ranked on income levels, are represented by Labor. Members of the Labor Party must talk with their tongues in their cheeks fairly regularly. How can they continue this line of egalitarianism? We on this side say good luck to them because we are not jealous. Let us not have this hypocrisy and double standards. Let us not have too much rhetoric about how the Labor Party is there to defend the poor and the helpless. This bill is really to do with the national interest. If we want to talk about egalitarianism and equity in this country, we should look to regional Australia. When we look through the 147 electorates we find the electorates with the lower incomes. This government has failed to address the situation of regional Australian electorates getting poorer. By international standards we do enjoy a very reasonable standard of living. But it is not about how much most of us have to provide for ourselves. It is really about equity. It is about the egalitarianism of our nation. The Labor Party has to come to terms with, and has to be able to explain in the clearest possible way, how it has become the party of the rich at the same time as it purports to be the party of the poor. Regional Australia is very much a part of those lower income areas. The issue the government continues to ignore is that of regional Australia and the reason there are lower incomes in those areas. It is simply its policies-particularly in the indirect tax and fuel excise areas, and also in the matter of industrial relations. When the Industry Commission brought forward its reports all it talked about was more flexibility in the industrial relations area. All it wanted was a little more flexibility because the cost of living was different in regional and metropolitan areas. It said that regional areas may be advantaged if more flexibility could be allowed within the award system. It is pretty straightforward common sense, honest sort of stuff. What was the response of the government and the ACTU?",106
213,Mr SLIPPER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Tell us.,106
214,Mr WAKELIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The response simply was, 'We can't touch it. It mustn't happen. We all have to earn the same. We must have the same award system as Melbourne, Adelaide or Sydney.' Mr Knott-It's called a safety net, sucker!",106
215,Mr WAKELIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Gilmore refers to a safety net. Did the government ever think about a safety net for the wool producers when they were going broke? Did it ever talk about a safety net for the 135,000 small businesses that went bankrupt during the recession we had to have? Did the safety net go to the young unemployed? Did the safety net go to that 35 per cent of young people who cannot get jobs because of Labor policies? The honourable member for Gilmore, in his inimitable style, would have us believe that they are the only true believers and that they are the only ones that can provide a safety net. It is a very sad matter. I have not checked the pecking order of income to know whether Gilmore is wealthy or middle income. But it is in the eastern states somewhere, and it probably is in the wealthier area. It is something the Labor Party really must think about. It must explain to the Australian people how it now represents 60 per cent of the wealthier electorates-the top half of the income earners of Australia. We have talked about the self-employed, the business interests and the young-surely constituencies that even the Labor Party might be interested in. They cannot bring the government to heel the way the mining union can. They cannot bring the government to heel the way the Seamen's Union can.

As the leader of the coalition in debates in the House on much of the legislation-and there has been an inordinate amount-I have had occasion to remark on the serious reservations we have had about the false sense of security being created. I do not intend to go over all of the previous arguments, but I will instead give a graphic illustration of the deception being perpetrated on an unsuspecting work force. It is necessary to remind interested parties of the previously expressed concern for those low paid, part-time, junior or itinerant workers whose retirement incomes will not be enhanced by Labor's superannuation guarantee charge. I will not dwell again on the crippling compliance costs on businesses generally and small businesses in particular.

221,Mr ROCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the House. Only the names of the individuals concerned have been deleted to protect the innocent, as the saying goes. I want to talk about a worker who earns about $40,000 a year. This person is in a contributing superannuation scheme administered by a large life company. As the table shows, over the 12 months to the year ended 30 June 1994 the worker and employer paid $3,040.47 into the individual's superannuation account. Accumulated funds in the account amounted to $5,682.18 at the beginning of the financial year, 1 July 1993. So over the year income was earned on an amount of up to $9,722.65-a modest sum, I think you will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker. But that is beside the point. Interest on investment income credited was a princely sum of $368.18, or 5.25 per cent. Not bad, we might say. These days, a return of up to 5.25 per cent is pretty good. But is far from the total picture. Labor's laws allow and even stipulate that charges and taxes are docked from accumulated funds. What are the charges in this case? They are for administration fees, insurance fees andwait for it-Labor's up-front contributing tax on the fund's earnings. In this case, the first two mentioned imposts-the fees-totalled $112.19. Labor's grasping tax grab was $277.31. There you have it. Interest earned was $368.18, and fees and taxation totalled $407.10. You would think at first glance that fees and tax exceeded income for the year and you would be dead right-right to the tune of $38.92. More importantly, you might start to wonder how on earth this fund is going to provide for the retirement of the superannuant. If taxes and charges outstrip the earnings of an established superannuation scheme, you would have to say in all honesty that all that could be expected is that the weight of contributions will be just enough to get a person means tested out of all or part of the age pension on retirement. What sort of crazy system is it when Labor's contribution tax is by far the main factor in driving down the superannuation benefits of an employee who is doing more than the government insists upon in providing for his retirement? Only a decade ago, 14 per cent of income put aside over the working life of an individual was enough to secure a livable income on retirement. Now, under Labor, it is 18 per cent and rising, largely because of Labor's legislated imposts and, in particular, the contribution tax. That, I suppose, is progress under Labor. But it also gives lie to the nonsense the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was going on with today in question time when he was trying to substantiate and justify a system which is plainly failing.

Consequently, I was given a poem called 'Ironbark Jack meets Ironbar Tuckey' which I would like to read to the House and into the Hansard. It goes like this: The old blokes sit and snigger And the women hide their grins For some folks have their rules And get comfort in their wins. Country folk are used to strangers With loud voices at the bar Expounding their self-importance To all, both near and far. But as tolerant as you can be The day will surely come When someone steps across the line And needs to be put on his bum. So it was when Ironbar Tuckey Met old Ironbark Jack. The fur and feathers they did fly And Ironbar hit the sack. For in New South Wales in Bowling Clubs Three rules you must observe: No politics, religion Or bad language should be heard. Now when the dust had settled, And Ironbar was in the street, Ejected by the management For what was described as 'indiscreet', Tuckey was heard to mutter as to the West he flew back, 'I'll keep away from Bowling Clubs And also Ironbark Jack. I would like to thank lronbark Jack for the service that he did for the people of Ulladulla. Vanstone, Mr Michael",108
223,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in the matter of a private grief which has some public ramifications. Last Saturday, the editor of the Sydney Review, Michael Vanstone, died of leukaemia. Michael was, among many other much more important things, my editor. Not only was he the editor; he was the chief journalist, the layout artist and the proof reader of the Sydney Review. He was a veritable Renaissance man, the ultimate multiskilled journalist. I take this chance to commemorate his life. He was a rare character. He was private, sensitive and difficult to draw out, but, once people had his trust, a loyal and great friend. Like the very best sort of intellectual, he could never be pigeonholed. His paper circuliterature lated widely amongst Sydney's ty, of which he was a great supporter. But it was always an intelligent support. It was support which saw the failures as well as the heroism in the life of that community and one which saw the pain and the struggle against itself which can affect that community no less than any other. Michael Vanstone is dead, but his legacy lives on in the shape of the Sydney Review and its sister publication, the Adelaide view, of which he was for quite a number of years the deputy editor. His legacy lives on, but it lives on under threat. The Sydney Review was part of Australia's smallest media empire-an empire comprised of just itself crushed. and the Adelaide Review. It was a veritable minnow in the company of sharks. I am all in favour of competition and newspapers trying to increase their market share, but competition must be balanced against the need for diversity. In Adelaide, News Ltd already holds 96 per cent of the newspaper market. It owns the only metropolitan daily, the only metropolitan weekly and all the suburban weeklies. This organisation, which holds 96 per cent of the existing newspaper market, is now entering into competition to get the last four per cent of that market. The Adelaide Review is a tabloid sized monthly magazine of ideas. It covers politics, literature, food and the arts. It circulates 40,000 copies per month compared with the 200,000 copies per day circulation of the also Adelaide Advertiser. As you would expect, the normal advertising rates of the Advertiser are twice those of the Adelaide Review. But all of a sudden the '1iser has launched a review of its own. The '1iser has launched a monthly, tabloid sized lift-out dealing withyou guessed it-the arts, food and literature. With five times the circulation of the Adelaide Review, its rival, the Adelaide Advertiser, is charging just 1.2 times the Review's advertising rate. For many years the Advertiser has had little interest in these subjects. Why now? If it wants to improve its quality and expand its own circulation, why has it not boosted its existing arts, food and coverage rather than launching an gay communiAdelaide Review clone? In Adelaide, News Ltd must surely qualify as a monopolist with deep pockets. Therefore, it is the special duty of the government and the Trade Practices Commission to ensure that the sheer size of News Ltd does not tum competition into annihilation. As a former News Ltd journalist, I am an admirer of Rupert Murdoch, yet that great Australian would add nothing whatsoever to his lustre Reand would add no glory to his reputation if his organisation kills a publication which, in its spirit, resembles the early iconoclastic Australian. lowe it to the memory of Michael Vanstone to ensure that his legacy is not Jobskills Graduation",109
224,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"My speech is a good news story. One of the more pleasurable duties of backbenchers is to officiate at graduations of participants of some of the labour market programs that are resourced by this government. Last week I had the pleasure of attending a jobskills graduation in my electorate was a particularly moving experience. graduands were a mixture of younger older Australians-both men and womenwho came together under this labour market program to position themselves skill wise for re-entry into the work force. At the graduation, some fine said about the Brotherhood of St and employers. Perhaps the most impressive part of this ceremony was the document tabled by the participants themselves entitled Dynamix: A group of mixed people, and indeed they were. They had a simple motto: Sense of gain aiming high. I would like to take members through this document. Those on the opposite side who want to rip the insides out of the labour market programs that this government has put in place ought to listen very carefully to how the participants of this labour market program described their experiation, ences. In this document, they listed their feelings and attitudes before, during and program. The attitudes that persisted in the group before they commenced the program were low self-esteem, insecure-no backup, no incentives, frustration, depressed-getting nowhere in life, boredom, angry with the system, confused and lack of confidence. members in this House who have anything to do with unemployed people would know that these are the feelings and the attitudes people who at a point in time are not able gain full-time employment. They described their feelings during the course as: Did things I never thought I could achieve Felt accepted Reacquainted with skills I already had New skills and opportunities Self assured I was getting somewhere Light at end of the tunnel Felt needed and acceptance Renewed Support-people in the workplace supported us There was people out there who cared-in particuin lar the Brotherhood and Guenter Sahr. Their expressed feelings after they had gone through the jobskills course and had prepared themselves as best they could to re-enter the of Geelong. It work force were: The Satisfaction and achievement and More incentive to keep going A new beginning There is life after unemployment Pleased that there was a position at the end words were We have skills to offer Laurence We now have something to offer Accomplished goals but now need to start again Sense of loss and uncertaintythat is because they were leaving the grouphonourable Contacts and opportunities Contrast the after situation with the before: they had an extremely negative outlook before they entered the program and they had an extremely positive one after they had completed it. As I stressed to them at the graduthis is just the beginning of a new day for them. I hope that they approach the marketplace with that optimism because I am after the sure they will succeed. I pay tribute to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the broker of this particular program. My thanks go out to employers in the Gee10ng area who sponsored this particular group: West Coast Learning, St Augustine's, Any Brotherhood of St Laurence, Back to Back Theatre, Corio Skillshare, Do Care Geelong, Salvation Army, Geelong Community Legal of Service, Deakin University Faculty of Law, to Ocean Grove Neighbourhood Centre, Deakin University Audio Visual Department, Deakin University Faculty of Arts, MCKillop College and South Barwon Skillshare. My heart goes out to these particular graduands and participants. They have done well in this course; they will do well as they enter the marketplace again. To Dynamix, a new beginning, I wish it well. Bushfires",109
225,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Fisher) (5.56 p.m.)Honourable members who watch the news would have seen the recent bushfire tragedy south-east Queensland vividly portrayed. Most of the bushfires were situated in the federal electorate of Fisher. At times like this when great adversity is faced it is wonderful to see communities, councils, emergency services and people generally pulling together and working together to assist those who are having difficult times. The tragedy could have been infinitely worse had these facilities and this cooperation not existed. Had the wind not changed, a major tragedy could have become a monumental tragedy. Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes at Bribie Island, Beerwah and elsewhere. If it were not for the common sense of those in charge, the situation could have been terrible indeed. I have asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on notice whether his attention has been drawn to this bush fire tragedy which saw evacuations, at least 13 homes lost and a declaration of a state of emergency. I have also drawn his attention to the danger of more bushfires occurring and the resultant potential catastrophe. I have asked whether he or a representative would visit the affected areas to inspect the damage. I have also asked the government to consider providing assistance to those who have been afflicted as a result of the bushfires. I have not yet heard from the Prime Minister, but I am hoping the government will favourably consider the difficulties being experienced by a very large number of people in south-east Queensland. It is interesting to note that during times great tragedy we often find great bravery. We have a large number of firemen, some of whom are volunteers and some of whom are members of the fire service. Fortunately, at this stage there has not been any loss of life in the Queensland bushfires. I would also like to pay tribute to the members of the Palmwoods Volunteer Fire Brigade for their bravery and for what they achieved without regard to the danger posed to their own lives. In particular, I will mention one of the volunteers, Clive Gauldie, who was responsible for saving the life of one of his colleagues, Neil Dingwall, who had joined the fire brigade less than 24 hours earlier. According to a local newspaper article, a Palmwoods volunteer firefighter was running for his life through a fireball on Tuesday when he stopped to take a burning colleague by the hand and lead him from the inferno. That firefighter was Clive Gauldie. During times of war and civil tragedy we find great bravery. The fact that Neil Dingwall's life was saved is a great tribute to the bravery of Clive Gauldie and others who risk their lives in their jobs. It should be recognised that more services need to be provided to rural brigades to enable them to fight bushfires.",110
226,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 6.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted.",111
227,Mr DUNCAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I require that the debate be extended.",111
228,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The debate may continue until 6.10 p.m. Vanstone, Mr Michael",111
229,Mr DUNCAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to respond to the comments that were made by the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) in relation to the sad death of Michael Vanstone, who was a friend of his and a friend of mine. At one time in his career Michael Vanstone was a research officer with the committee office in the parliament. I understand from staff here that he was very highly regarded and a free spirit. The last comment that was made to me is one of that I can certainly endorse. He was a very decent man and his passing is of great sadness to all of those who knew him and knew of him. As the member for Warringah said, Michael Vanstone was the editor of the Sydney Review and had earlier worked as the associate editor of the Adelaide Review. The editor of the Adelaide Review is Christopher Pearson, who is also a friend of mine. I understand that Michael Vanstone, on his deathbed, actually sought an assurance from Christopher Pearson that he would do everything in his power to ensure that the Sydney Review, much beloved by Michael Vanstone, would not be allowed to die. Christopher Pearson, as I understand it, gave him that assurance. However, the situation in Adelaide is that the Murdoch press has chosen to launch a monthly arts publication quite specifically-I do not think this could be denied-targeted at removing the one tiny piece of print competition it has in Adelaide. To recap what the member for Warringah said, in Adelaide the Murdoch press owns the Advertiser daily and the Advertiser distributed on Saturday, and the Sunday Mail. It owns the only non-free weekly publication and it owns all of the publications which are known as the suburban free weeklies. So in Adelaide there is almost a monopoly. The Adelaide Review is the only piece of print journalism that is available. Adelaide Advertiser has chosen to launch a monthly arts magazine, which will be, as we understand it, an insert to the Advertiser. For 200,000 copies, advertisers will only have to pay 1.2 times the rate charged by the Adelaide Review. Any student studying the trade practices laws of this country could see that this is an effective and targeted effort to deny the Adelaide Review advertising revenue and thus drive it out of business. The Murdoch press-News Ltd management should think long and hard about this strategy. I do not think it is a strategy which will serve its corporate interests nationally. Many people will be extremely unhappy about its attempt to drive the Adelaide Review out of business. I agree with comments that were made by the member for Warringah. Normally competition is a good thing; if one can do better then so be it. However, in the area of the media I think a very different set of principles needs to apply. I do not want to delay the House any further, but I simply caution Murdoch pressNews Ltd to think long and hard about this strategy. I think it is a wrong-headed strategy and one that will not serve it well. If it is successful in driving the Adelaide Review out of business, it is certainly not a strategy that will serve the people of Adelaide. I hope that will not happen and I am confident that the people who have supported the Adelaide Review in the past will show loyalty to it. I sincerely hope that the memory of Michael Vanstone continues on in the Adelaide Review and the Sydney Review. House adjourned at 6.05 p.m. NA NA Locks on Windows in Parliament House",111

231,Mr SPEAKER,INFORMATION,"The answer to the honour The able member's question is as follows: Yes. (a) It is estimated that there are some 2486 locks fitted to windows in rooms, corridors and public spaces. (b) Unavailable. Locks were not separately costed in construction contracts. (c) Yes. The ability to allow windows to be opened at will is determined at the design stage. In Parliament House the opening of windows would unbalance the air conditioning causing discomfort to adjacent occupants by reducing their air flow. Temperature control would also be adversely affected. Substantial cost in trying to rebalance the air conditioning and significant additional energy consumption would be incurred if the original design intent to keep windows closed was altered. (d) The locks were fitted to maintain security on windows that on occasions may need to be opened for emergency or maintenance related access.

233,Mr HARRY WOODS,AUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I Amendment Bill 1994 is a very important bill where government enterprises are going. This can be connected with a lot of other government deregulation, corporatisation-call it what you and opinions in that. It is worth looking firstly years. The corporation's 1992-93 annual report confirmed in productivity and efficiency: labour productivity and there was a record low level of time disputation. More than 92 per cent of letters achieved a $249.4 million profit, which was after including the community service obligations, the government. I think this shows that Australia efficient and in delivering a very good service Australia Post goes in the future. However, there is a conflict in the obligations requires that Australia Post operate commercially efficient. On the other hand, Australia Post is community service obligations, some of which, a conflict for the management of Australia Post worth looking at the issues of where the public interest is. The basic community service obligation of letter service at a uniform rate on an equitable not view that community service obligation community service requirement in the act is it is interpreted by various standards Its delivery standards say: first business cities or within the same cities or town environments; a metropolitan area and country locations within MAIN COMMITTEE 3117 Thursday, 10 November 1994 took the chair at 10.00 a.m. ANL GUARANTEE BILL 1994 this bill be conducted in the House.

Australia Post also a record. The return on assets was 14.8 per cent, and there was a $62 million dividend to Post has come a long way in becoming to all Australians. This bill is about where of Australia Post. On the one hand, the act to give a profit to the government and be required to deliver service obligations, so-called by definition, are unprofitable. That provides as to where it puts the balance. I think it is interest lies and how we get to what the public Australia Post at present is to provide a uniform basis for Australians. Most of the public would as that narrow. It is worth noting that that interpreted by Australia Post management, and that Australia Post applies to its business. day delivery within metropolitan areas of capital second business day delivery between the same state; second business day delivery NA 3118 between country areas of the same state; second different capital cities; third business day delivery and country locations in other states; and fourth in different states. In deciding that delivery frequency, Australia are based on the amount that it costs to deliver method of costing that is based on what is called per annum. As defined by Australia Post, the follows. If the cost is up two UBRs, urban between two and three, they get three deliveries week; between eight and 13, one per week. service obligation of a standard letter Continuing on with that, it is noticeable country areas, the cost is greater and the return certainly unprofitable in many areas.

That is Hilmer says that if governments choose to suppliers-in other words, if we choose not great extent-it should be demonstrated why of view. Hilmer put a bias against the public be demonstrated to be in the public interest. service obligations, I would rather say that interest to deregulate rather than the other way around. In respect of the CSOs, the community service in part, goes to the focus of CSOs. The amendment to 13 urban based rates-the multiple rate look at the speeches of previous opposition with the issues of substance. The issues of put on Australia Post to return dividends; and Post, which again puts pressure on its profit is also the question of the right way to fund occurs at present, or whether, as suggested by budgetary item. Another issue is the methodology obligations. All those issues are going to affect delivered. Those are very important points that the the economic point of view that deregulation, in the public interest. Hilmer seems to put forward is equivalent to economic efficiency goals. I Australia. The question to be answered is: how do by the long-term avoidable cost, because determining what the profit performance of CSOs is low, the allowance made to the profit MAIN COMMfITEE Thursday, 10 November 1994 day delivery between metropolitan areas of between metropolitan areas of capital cities business day delivery between country areas Post also arrived at a series of cost scales that a letter to a metropolitan delivery point.

It is on the management of Australia Post is to As I see it, there is continuing pressure reflected in the Hilmer report, where Professor restrict consumer ability to choose among rival to implement deregulation continually, or to a this is necessary from the public interest point interest in that case because he said that it must Dealing with Australia Post and community it should be demonstrated that it is in the public obligations, I noticed an amendment which, is about an additional service for the eight to 13-which receive one per week. I have had a members. The amendment really does not deal substance are as follows: how much pressure is how much deregulation is allowed into Australia performance and its ability to deliver CSOs. There CSOs-whether through the cross-subsidy, as Hilmer and I think the IC report, by a separate used in costing those community service the extent and the breadth of how CSOs are government must consider as we progress towards almost in all circumstances, is a good thing and the idea in his report that the public interest dispute that in some cases, particularly for rural we cost CSOs? The present method of costing is that is the allowance the government makes in Australia Post should be. If the costing of the performance of Australia Post is then smaller NA Thursday, 10 November 1994 than it should be. The long-term avoidable if the service is not provided. Using that prescribed was $46 million. There are more realistic ways of costing criteria of economists in the Treasury. It produces commercial terms. A more appropriate way would be to estimate the cash cost of the benefits to various groups in the community on a non-commercial were made on that alternative basis for 1992-93, costs: retail network losses for non-reserved access to postal facilities, $30 million; reserved publication losses, $11 million; and heritage million. That would give a total of $183 million. Australia Post is allowed by the government Australia Post would acknowledge a more realistic allowance for that. It would be a natural reaction down its CSO costs. Apart from that, there are other issues that sometimes in a more implicit way. Australia on its assets. It needs to maintain the extent and the expectation of the Commonwealth that to maintain Australia Post's financial viability which I have just mentioned, and other commercial matters. In addition, Australia Post is now required wealth. Those payments make Australia Post to equity ratio of a commercial enterprise. Last capital repayment. There are opinions that that ratio reaches a ratio of one to two. Under those pressures, and in light of the to me that the conflict between the need to CSOs is biased in favour of returning that commercial exist. It will be exacerbated by further deregulation because I believe the deregulation contained deliveries of the CSOs and the ability of Australia In fact, I believe it will increase that ability. I have already spoken about some of the proposed amendments. The opposition has taken 'Let's have two deliveries per week in those week.' What about people who are now receiving about those who are now getting two to three? are getting up to two? Should they get more? other services that are not now included in that need to be asked. Some people in remote and isolated Australia on a regular basis. What about them? Their situation MAIN COMMITTEE 3119 cost is the saving that can be made at the margin methodology, the cost of CSOs in 1992-93 CSOs. The present costing meets the needs or results which are not realistic in ordinary of measuring the real CSOs of Australia Post provided by virtue of government ownership basis. If an assessment of the CSOs it would indicate the following estimated services necessarily incurred to provide universal services cross-subsidy, $122 million; register¢ property costs, which are not included at all, $20 around $50 million. It is fairly obvious that cost of $183 million, and it is not getting for Australia Post management to try to push are affecting Australia Post in providing CSOs, Post needs to earn a commercial rate of return of the Commonwealth's equity in Australia Post Australia Post will return a dividend. It needs and it needs to consider the cost of the CSOs, to make capital repayments to the Commonborrow to a level that is seen as a normal debt year $200 million was requested as a first-off should be increased until the debt to equity IC report and the Hilmer report, it is quite clear return a profit and the obligation to deliver the profit. That situation will continue to of Australia Post. I support this bill in it does not upset the balance between the Post to act commercially and efficiently. substantive issues in terms of the opposition's an extremely narrow view of this.

264,Mr GEAR,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The number of Australian individual taxpayers who completed their tax return without professional assistance in 1992-93 was 26 per cent. The Australian Taxation Office is not able to provide statistics on taxpayers who complete their tax returns without professional assistance for other OECD nations. Banks: Bad Debt Tax Deductions (Question No. 1461) Mr Wakelin asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 1 September 1994: Further to the answer to question No. 459 (Hansard, 13 December 1993, page 3889), following enactment of the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No.3) 1992, what sums did banks claim between 1 July and 30 June 1993 as deductions under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 for cases in which (a) a portion of bad debt and (b) the total debt was written off.",157
265,Mr GEAR,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Taxation Office collects figures on bad debts claimed as a deduction against taxable income but cannot distinguish between partial and total write offs. Figures from taxation returns for the 1992-93 income year (l July 1992 to 30 June 1993 or substituted accounting period) show that banks claimed deductions for bad debts totalling $1,696 million. NA Kimberley Land Council (Question No. 1521) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 19 September 1994: Further to the answer to Question No. 1150 (Hansard, 27 June 1994, page 2029), what (a) was the nature of the training which the Kimberley Land Council has provided Aboriginal persons since 1990-91 and (b) were the funds provided under the Office of Labour Market Adjustment programs used for. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The approvals under the TAP-Training for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders program involved on the job training in administrative/clerical skills in four individual placements. Over the same period two wage subsidy placements were also made under Jobstart. (b) OLMA Regional Initiatives program funds have been approved for the Kimberley Land Council to conduct a study into the provision of training for Aboriginal people in the Kimberley and to develop a proposal for regional Aboriginal direction of post secondary education and training. The project is due for completion by the end of 1994. Fraser Island and Great Sandy Region: Compensation (Question No. 1540) Mr Truss asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 22 September 1994: Further to the answer to question No. 1328 (Hansard 23 August 1994, page 139) in relation to compensation for the cessation of logging on Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region, has approximately $6.2 million of Commonwealth funding been provided to the Queensland Government since the answer to question No. 293 (Hansard, 6 October 1993, page 1804); if so, what are the details.",157
266,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. As stated in the answer to question No. 293 (Hansard, 6 October 1993) expenditure by the Queensland Government as at 30 June 1993 was $10,214,203. Of the $16.5 million provided by the Commonwealth to the Queensland Government, this left available approximately $6.2 million. As at 30 June 1994, Queensland had spent $14,703,309 of the $16.5 million that has been provided by the Commonwealth (see answer to question No. 1328). Therapeutic Goods Administration (Question No. 1561) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) Are clients of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) waiting for more than eighteen months to have products listed or registered for sale in Australia. (2) Is it a fact that Cybergenics Australia submitty ted seven products and a cardboard box for listing in March 1993 but that the box has not yet been listed nor certificates for the is this a typical indication of the TGA's level of efficiency. (3) What steps will she take to redress the situation.",158
267,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The average time taken within TGA to list and register products depends on the type of product; in the area of interest the average time taken in 1993-94 for listing was 91 working days and for registration 67 working days. (2) Since March 1993, Cybergenics (Australia Pty Ltd) has had: eleven products listed or registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, and one application rejected as ineligible for listing. Three other applications, final details of which have been received between May and September 1994, are being reviewed by TGA in the light of further input from the company or its consultant. The rate of approval of individual product applications is strongly influenced by the quality of applications submitted to the TGA in the first instance. Applications submitted by Cybergenics (Australia) Pty Ltd had a range of deficiencies and were reworked by the sponsor before they met the statutory requirements for inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. (3) The efficiency of the TGA is reviewed through quarterly performance reports prepared for the Industry/Government Consultative Committee, comprising representatives of major industry associations and the Departments of Finance and Industry, Science and Technology. It is noteworthy that between the commencement of the Therapeutic Goods Act on 15 February 1991 and 30 September 1994 30,026 drug products have been registered or listed on the ARTG. Universities: Private Funding (Question No. 1629) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 11 October 1994: (1) Is he able to say what was the value of endowments and private donations to each universiin Australia in (a) 1991, (b) 1992 and (c) 1993 for (i) undergraduate courses, (ii) postgraduate courses, (iii) research work and (iv) other university products issued; if so, activities. (2) Has the Government adjusted funding in recognition of the availability of private funding; if so, what adjustments were made in each case. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Universities provide statements on their sources of income as part of their annual returns to the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Included in those returns are data on their income from endowments and private donations. This information is not provided to the Commonwealth in the disaggregated form which Mr Latham has requested. The following data detail the total income received by each university from endowments and private donations, for each of the years requested, as reported to DEET. The data, however should be treated with caution. This is because universities are in the transitional phase of changing from one method of financial reporting to another. By 1995, all universities will have changed over to more streamlined arrangements based on accrual accounting practices. As a consequence of the changeover, it is not possible to make comparisons between years for universities, or between universities in a given year.
