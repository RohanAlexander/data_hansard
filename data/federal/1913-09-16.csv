14,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I desire to put a question to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, and, in doing so, to explain that, on 11th instant, Senator Pearce, in another place, asked the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether he was yet in a position to give him any information respecting a contract between the Federal Government and the Government of Western Australia for the supply of sleepers for the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway? In reply, Senator MCColl, Vice-President of the Executive Council, said I have been able to get the information which the honourable senator desires. According to a memorandum I have received from the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, some 60,000 jarrah sleepers have been supplied under the agreement. The Powellized karri sleepers are not due until November next. There has been some delay in agreeing to the exact wording of the deed of contract, but the document is now with the West Australian Government for signature. In view of that answer, I wish to read the following telegram received by Senator Pearce from Mr Scaddan, Premier of Western Australia, and to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether he is in a position to explain this apparent discrepancySleeper contract not in hands of State Government.

I ask the honourable gentleman, as the custodian of the Commonwealth Constitution, which provides'for free intercourse between the States, if it is his intention to take steps to see that trade is made free ? May I explain that by the last sailing of the Wimmera, 21,000 cases of f r u it , mostly from the cool stores, were shipped to Sydney, that that f r u it is now being left to lie on the Sydney wharfs, and will rot unless it is immediately handled.",13
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Why is it being lef t to lie there ?,13
20,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Because of a strike there. I ask the honourable gentleman if he does not consider it the duty of the Government to take such steps as may be necessary to maintain freedom of trade and commerce between the States ?,13

23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not know that anything can be done in the meantime. We shall have to look into the matter carefully. It is a serious thing to have perishable products delayed on their way to market, and a strike is serious for all parties. I regret to learn that there is a strike. I thought that the terms and conditions of employment on the wharfs had been settled by the Arbitration Court, Castles"" and that no strikes were possible under its awards. We are frequently told that no award of the Court has ever been disregarded.",13
24,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"-Is there a Commonditions, wealth award in this case?",14

28,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs when we are likely to get the Bill dealing with the Excise revenue for sugar, which either has been lost or is at present in the pockets of persons who have no right to it?",14
29,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Bill is in course of preparation, and will be submitted at an early date.",14
30,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question relating to the arrangement which Was made between the ex-Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland when i Was agreed that the Sugar Excise Act Sugar Bounty Act should be repealed It was laid down that certain conditions should be complied with before proclaimshall ing the repeal of the Acts, and I have been informed that the conditions are not being complied with. Will the Minister communicate with his responsible officers - fcha t is, the Sub-Collectors Mackay, Lucinda, Innisfail, and Cairns - and find out from them the rates of wages being paid in the mills and elsewhere ?",14
31,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It was laid down in the original agreement that the State Parliabe ment should pass legislation providing - for certain industrial conditions. The State Parliament has passed those laws dealing with the industrial conditions, and the effect of the legislation is that ""the schedule of wages prescribed by the Act is regarded as an award of the Industrial Court. Therefore, any breaches of the award, or any failure to fulfil the conditions, is a matter for administration the State authorities in connection with their enforcement. It is not within the scope of the Federal authorities to quire into the conditions or any breach of them. However, if the honourable member will give me specific instances any breach or failure to fulfil the convery I shall be glad to make the necessary representations with respect to",14
32,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Tw o days ago, when I asked the Prime Minister a question in regard to the sugar Excise and the Prime Minister said, in effect, that my statement was merely ex - parte. matI now ask the Minister of Trade and Cushis toms to assure himself whether or not the conditions are being observed, by referring to his own responsible officers, sub-collectors, in the various places I have mentioned.",14
33,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member will see the difficulty of sending the officers on a roving commission of the kind indicated. If the honourable member will give me specific cases which may be within his knowledge, I shall be only too pleased to have them investigated.",14
34,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable gentleman can ask his officers whether the conditions are being carried out.,14
35,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman will see that it is impossible for the officers to go about investigating t the whole of the operations.

40,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"I ask. the Postmasterby General if the municipal authorities of North Sydney refuse to put a light in the clock tower of the local post-office? As in - North Sydney is a most important suburb, will the honourable gentleman make inquiries, with a view to having a of light put into the clock tower? It is inconvenient to have no light there.",14
41,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"If c is not the practice of the Department to provide clocks for post-office towers. That is left to municipal authorities and local residents. Clocks have been so provided at Geelong, and in many other places.",15
42,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he is evolving any scheme whereby he will be able to expedite telephone construction? He may be aware that in some cases construction has been postponed owing to the alleged congestion of work in the Department.,15
43,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"If any honourable member will furnish me with particulars of any case of the kind, I will have it inquired into. But I cannot answer a general question very satisfactorily.",15
44,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I think that, on F r i - as follows:-day last, it was announced that the Postmaster-General had decided to discontinue charging late fees on letters posted afc Tailway stations. I should like to ask the honourable gentleman whether any calculation has been made as to what in crease of staff will be required, or what the obligation to the Commonwealth will be, as a consequence of taking action in that direction.",15
45,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"- I do not think that any increase of staff will be required. The sorters on the trains w i ll sort the letters, as far as they can, and if the public post more letters than can be sorted, they will be carried on to the capital cities of the States, and will not go out u n t i l later deliveries. In announcing this change, we have asked the public not to take undue advantage of the concession.",15
46,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"A considerable time ago, when I asked the Minister of External Affairs whether he could inform the House of the relationship then existing between the Marconi Company and the Commonwealth, the honourable gentleman assured me that he was prepared to give me privately certain information which I did not seek. I should like to know whether he is now in a position to inform the House of the relationship and the differences between the Marconi Company and the Commonwealth Government?",15
47,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There is no relationship at present existing save that of l gants. The position isfchafcan examination was permitted, by the order of the Court, to be and has been made. We are simply preparing for trial, and doing all we can on behalf of the Commonwealth.",15

HIGH COURT REPORTS. Mr J. H. CATTS - Is the Attorney General aware that complaints have been made in the Supreme Court of New South Wales that decisions of the High Court cannot be obtained in print, and that, therefore, the administration of justice in that State is being delayed? Is it possible fco take any steps fco see fchafc the reporting of the judgments is undertaken by the Commonwealth ? I refer to remarks made in the Supreme Court with regard to the case of Fremiti v. Fremin. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It has often been the subject of complaint that the authorized reports of the judgments of the High Court are not published immediately after the judgments are delivered. But I would remind the honourable member that that is impossible, because the it i - authorized reports have to be carefully scrutinized by each of the Judges who have taken part in giving them, and that can only be done at times when their other duties will enable them to do so. The corrected proof is the final record of the decision of the law, but there are available to lawyers and Courts, some considerable time before the revised reports come out, reports which are usually quite accurate. Por instance, there are the Argus Law Reports, the Australian Law Times, and other reports which are very largely used.",15
51,Mr ARTHUR,Unknown,Onl y the Argus report.,16
52,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"At all events, there is the Argus Law Reports, which gives a very full, and usually accurate, account of the judgment.",16
53,Mr ARTHUR,Unknown,Does that apply to all the States?,16
54,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I believe that the Argus Law Reports usually gives all the decisions in the Supreme Court, as well as the decisions in the High Court.",16
55,Mr ARTHUR,Unknown,"I think there is no report published in New South Wales, and that is the trouble.",16
56,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"It would be a desirable thing to do, but I do not think that the Commonwealth ought to issue anything bhat is not an authorized and certified report. In my opinion, it would be foolish to do so, and the diffithat culty might be got over by fuller newspaper reports, or by some other means. For the reasons I have stated, the authorized Commonwealth reports cannot be published immediately after the decisions are given. HOME RULE.",16
57,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government have considered the desirability of forwarding to the British Parliament and people a message from the Parliament and people of Australia conveying their regret at the disloyalty of Sir Edward Carson and his ilk in threatening to train men to resist His Majesty's Government if a certain law is placed on the statute-book of Great Britain?,16
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No ; I have not considered it.,16

61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The engagement of an expert is not with a view to settling questions for Western Australia alone, but to obtain his advice generally on all the larger naval public works in the manner recommended by Admiral Henderson in his report.",16
62,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,That does not answer my question.,16
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I was going on to say, if I may, that we hope in a day or two to be able to announce the name of the expert, whom we expect to be here at a very short date.",16
64,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether the expert whom the Government are bringing out in connection with naval base work is already in association with the British Navy or associated with some engineering firm has been intrusted with the carrying out of similar harbour work?,16
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I hope to answer the question fully in the course of a day or two.,16

71,Mr RILEY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Is the Minister of Trade and Customs prepared to make a statement to the House in regard to revoking the proclamation for the quarantining of Sydney ? Does he know that as long as it is a quarantined area the business of Sydney will be congested and unemployment - created ?,17
72,Mr GROOM,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I have already made .several statements on this point to the House. We all regret deeply that there should be any suffering or loss in Sydney, but I would repeat that the loss being .sustained in that city is chiefly due to the existence of the disease there. The Commonwealth regulations only deal with . the passage of persons from that city to other States. All that we require, with the intention of preventing the spread of the disease, is the vaccination of persons going from the quarantined area to other States,",17
73,Mr CONROY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Is the Minister of Trade and Customs aware that there is no similar quarantine area in the world, and that the proper practice now recommended by all medical authorities is isolation and disinfection of the premises?

81,Mr GROOM,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,That is the opinion of the experts. I am guided by the experts in this matter.,17
82,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,You ought to be guided by your own common sense.,17
83,Mr GROOM,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"So long as the disease continues to exist in Sydney, and spreads, my advice is that it would be unwise, in the interests of the rest of Australia, to revoke the proclamation.",17
84,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Y o u are spreading the disease. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is the Minister of Trade and Customs aware that every day in New York, New Orleans, and other cities, more people are suffering from small-pox than are now suffering in Sydney, and that the only steps taken in those cities is to isolate the patients, and hang out a red flag. In view of the summer coming on, and the great things that are going to happen in Sydney shortly, is it not possible to remove the present ban of exclusiveness, so that honourable members may be able to go to that city by the 4th of next month?",17
85,Mr GROOM,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I have only the honourable member's statement of the condition of affairs in the United States, but if the disease of small-pox is always there, it is probably because the authorities do not take the same precautions that have been taken in Australia. My information is that all immigrants to the United States have to be vaccinated, and that in the Philippines, and other areas, the authorities, by vaccination and re-vaccination, have completely eradicated the disease from very seriously infected districts. Experience shows that panic vaccination is not enough, but that a steady course of vaccination and re-vacable cination is the best method for completely eradicating the disease.",17

Does he conthe tend that that has been done?,18
98,Mr GROOM,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,I do not contend anything. All that I know is that the State city. authorities in Sydney are acting on the the plague. lines I have indicated.,18
99,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,The Minister has been there recently?,18

106,Mr GROOM,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,I am afraid that I am not in the position to answer that question. I am inclined to think that they are really an amplification of the questions prepared by the previous Government.,19

Who selects or rejects the new and second hand books sent to the Library on approval ? 3. Are any books bought in duplicate in error; and, if so, what becomes of the duplicates ? 4. Will he cause to be prepared a return showing the amount of money expended by the Commonwealth in the purchase of books, and in binding, shelving, & c , since the establishment of Federation? 5. What duties have been assigned by the Library Committee to Mr Edw. A. Petherick?  chase of new or second-hand books? made it Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow: 1 and 2. New books are received from the booksellers on approval, and the Librarian examines these and makes three lists of them, recommending such books as he thinks should I be added to the Library. In addition, he and his principal assistant receive certain newspapers devoted to literature, which are examined, and recommendations made from them. Booksellers' catalogues, which are sent to the Library by all the leading London booksellers, are also examined for second-hand books whose acquisition is desirable. All recommendations of the Librarian are laid before a book selection committee appointed by the Library Committee, which endorses, rejects, or adds to the recommendations as its msmbers see fit. In addition, members' recommendations of books for purchase are also decided upon by the sub-cornmitter. 3. Many books already in the Library were also in the Petherick collection when it was handed over to the Commonwealth. A few duplicates in the twelve years since the Library was founded, and before the catalogue was complete, have been bought in error, but of many books it is necessary to have duplicates. And in a Public Library, such as the Parliamentary Library will become in the Federal City, it is very advisable to have reserve copies of a large number of books, especially of those relating to Australia which are now out of print. 4. Such a return can be prepared if thought necessary. 5. The Petherick Collection Act states that "" The said Edward Augustus Petherick is further desirous of being employed upon or in connection with the said collection, and such other duties and responsibilities as the Library Committee shall direct,"" and also "" The Commonwealth of Australia shall, so long as the said Edward Augustus Petherick shall be physically and mentally capable, and shall faithfull y perform the duties allotted to him by the said Library Committee, employ the said Edward Augustus Petherick upon or in connection with the said ' Petherick Collection' or the Library of the Parliament, with the title of Archivist.""  sole charge of the Petherick Collection, and has also authorized him to prepare for publication a portion of his Australasian Bibliography, so that the Committee may be able to consider the advisability of printing the whole of it. has not assigned him any duties which would bring him in any way under the direct control of the Librarian. 6. As will be seen from the answers to ques regard to the purchase of new books, but second-hand books are not bought, as a rule, if he reports that they are in the Petherick Collection. He has been frequently consulted as to the prices asked for second-hand books the purchase of which is considered desirable.

117,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [3.46] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will notice that in this Bill expression has been given to the policy of building up from existing things, and remodelling existing things, rather than of destroying and starting anew; and that, in order to endeavour to avoid any confusion that can possibly be avoided, we have made as few changes in the original Act as possible, consistent with administrative efficiency, electoral security, a free franchise, and a free press. I hope that honourable members will not be in any way discouraged by the number of clauses contained in the measure. A very considerable number of them are clauses of a purely consequential nature. Indeed, sir, this Bill in one respect is suggestive of those daringladies who are at present taxing the endurance of American magistrates by "" bumping up against "" the dress regulations of some of the States; because by means of these consequential amending clauses, the Bill , like the ladies to whom I have referred, has a pretty extensive* The covering of immaterial things. In order that honourable members may be able to separate, in their minds, the consequential clauses from the remainder It of the measure, I will give a bare recital of them. Clauses 3,4, 6, 9, 16, 21, 22, 23,. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 34 are either consequential in a verbal way or consequential upon some alterations effected by other portions of the measure under review. The clauses which aim at administra- fciye efficiency are as follow--numbers 5, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 17. I may add PAPERS. that all these proposals would necessarily have been suggested by the Electoral Officewhatever Ministry had been in power. No. 5 deals with the appointment of electoral inspectors. I do not desire at this stage to emphasize the point-which I am sure needs very little emphasis amongst honourable members; but I may say that the Chief Electoral Officer hasreported strongly in regard to this matter. Consequently, I think it is rather a matter for supplying honourable members with information from his report if they desire to have it during the Committee stage. Clause 7, dealing with the appointment of emergency officers to the position of Returning Officer and assisting Returning Officer, is a proposal that has become necessary owingto a defect that has been found to exist - in the original Act . Under the principal Act an appointmentcould be made only when a vacancy had occurred, 'and in cases where a Divisional Returning Officer or an Assistant Returning Officer had become suddenly ill it was not certain in law that a vacancy had occurred. The result was that the Electoral Office was placed in a very awkward position in the absence of the immediate opportunity of securing Executive action. The amendment proposed will obviate thatdifficulty. The next proposal of a machinery nature is that set out in clause 11. It aims afc preventing the glutting of the rolls immediately prior to a general election. The Chief Electoral Officer reports on this matter as follows: Unless the law is amended as proposed, it will always be impracticable, on the eve of an election, to make the necessary adjustments consequent upon duplications resulting from the errors of electors, and upon transfer and changes in the rolls to be used at the elections. the existing law, the Commonwealth Electoral Officers are unable, in the limited time at their disposal, to adjust a large number of these duplications (the result of errors by ' electors), which occur during the period immediately pieceding the issue of the writ for on election, and the Electoral Registrars are unable, in many cases, to remove the names of persons who have secured change or transfer of enrolment immediately prior to the issue of the writ. I may say that the statistical returns, when contrasted with the number of persons actually enrolled at the last general elections, show the pressing need for some such alteration in the machinery of the Act as is indicated in this Bill . If honourable members will bear with me for a moment, I would like to point out that whilst on the 31st May last there were no less than 2,885,000 names on our electoral rolls, only 2,710,000 persons of adult age, and eligible for enrolment, were estimated to be in the Commonwealth. So that there was the great surplusage of 175,000 persons to be accounted for, and it is to prevent any repetition of that sort of thing that the Electoral Office desires this provision to be included in the measure.",20
118,Mr WEST,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"It will prevent the names of persons who are entitled to vote being placed on the roll, too.",21
119,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I think that I can disregard that interjection. We do not want persons to be enrolled who have no right to enrolment. We desire every person whose name ought to be on our electoral rolls to have every chance of recording an honest vote, but we do not wish our rolls to be inflated with the names of persons who do not exist in fact. do we desire our rolls to be swollen by voters' names being duplicated. .",21
120,Mr WEST,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,It is better that a man's name should appear twice on the rolls than that he should be robbed of his vote.,21
121,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"What we wish to insure is that no man shall have two votes. I hope that the honourable member for East Sydney will not interrupt me, because I do not wish to be too painfully reminded of the courteous and distinguished gentlemen who used to represent that electorate.",21
122,Mr BURNS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,The Honorary Minister ought not to be insulting. Did he learn that at Oxford ?,21
123,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"No , I learnt it at nightschool. I am sure honourable members will see that the measure is a fairly comprehensive one. I wish to give them all the inforUnder mation that I can, but I do not desire to be interrupted by an honourable member who is not seeking information, but who is merely endeavouring to establish as a fact that which does not exist. The next amendment aiming at reforming electoral administration deals with the abolition of the 5s. deposit required in connection with objections to names which appear on the rolls. Other safeguards are proposed in its stead. The abolition of this deposit is intended to bring to the Electoral Department the assistance of every person in Australia in regard to these objections. It marks a very important step, but it does not wipe out a section of the Act which has been availed of to any appreciable extent. In deed, I am informed that the only case in which an elector has paid 5s. with the object of securing the removal of another person's name from the roll is that of a lady who felt it worth her while to prove that an elector whose name was given on the roll as Mrs Jones was not, in fact, Mrs Jones. Every other person has shirked the trouble of lodging a deposit of 5s. for the exercise of what, after all, ought to be a civic duty",21
124,Mr RILEY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Has the clause been framed on account of the experience of that lady ?,21
125,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"No . The Electoral Department realizes the value of getting, and desires to get, the help of electors generally to insure the removal from the rolls of the names of persons whose names ought not to be there. All the clauses with which I am now dealing have the Nor entire concurrence of the Electoral Office.",21
126,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Are they not suggestions of the Government?,21
127,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I can assure the honourable member that I am not in any way endeavouring to distort the facts. If he will do me the justice of hearing me throughout he can surely deal with these matters when the Bill has reached the Committee stage. The alternative proposition in this connection safeguards the rolls and the rights of electors quite as effectively as does the old Act . Honourable members will see that clause 68 is to be amended to provideThe objection may be in the prescribed form, and shall be(a) signed by an elector registered on the same subdivision roll in the presence of a returning officer, an electoral registrar, or a postmaster, and attested by such returning officer, toral registrar, or postmaster. In other words, before an elector can take the initial steps to get another elector's name removed from the roll he must see a highly responsible officer and make the necessary statement of fact, and any person who without reasonable cause signs such an objection will be liable to a penalty of £ 5 . The Department holds that this is sufficient to cover unreasonable and frivolous objections; but that it will not deter persons from coming bond fide to the assistance of the Department, with the object of assisting in the purification of the rolls. We have endeavoured to in troduce another reform in the Bill relating to objections to registration. As honourable members will perceive, enrolment and transfer are in the original Act placed upon a sub-divisional basis. In this measure we have followed the logical course by placing objections upon a similar basis. As a result, any person residing in a particular locality, and being aware that another elector has quitted that locality, will be able to assist the Department with his knowledge. I would remind honourable members that, in a country like Australia, some such provision is absolutely essential if we are to secure the assistance of the public in such matters.",21
128,Mr HANNAN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"What does the Honorary Minister mean by "" the public "" ?",22
129,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I mean the public. The term is a very clear one, and is, I understand, one which is in common use.",22
130,Mr HANNAN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,How many of the general public have the time at their disposal to permit of their going round to look for objections ?,22
131,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"If the honourable member does not want the Australian public to take any interest in the purity of our electoral rolls, by all means let him resist this proposition. He will then be in the position which he ought to occupy if he is honestly of that opinion. If , however, he does wish the public to take an intelligent interest in the purity of our electoral rolls, he ought to give them every possible facility to object to the names of persons improperly appearing there. If he does not wish to see double enrolments, if he desires an honest electoral system, of which the public may be proud, I take it that the only course that can be properly adopted, is that in which the Electoral Department now concurs. To draw attention to the size of some of our electoral elecdivisions, I might mention that Dampier embraces a larger area than the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Austria. Manifestly, it is impossible for an elector residing in that division to be certain that another elector who has left his neighbourhood has gone out of the division. Under the Act, an elector lodging an objection must make sure that the person whose name is objected to has departed from the division, but under the amending provision the person objecting will be asked to make sure only of a matter that can reasonably be expected to be within his knowledge-that is, of departure from the subdivision-and the Department will, under such circumstances, welcome assistance. Another administrative amendment which I am afraid will occasion my honourable friends opposite some displeasure, but which is none the less urgently necessary, provides for the abolition of Saturday polling.",22
132,Mr FENTON,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,The Minister has no chance of doing that.,22
133,Mr HUGHES,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"It is naturally proposed by the Minister to abolish Saturday polling, because Saturday is the day on which the electors have most time for voting.",22
134,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"We have taken the advice of our experts on this question, in stead of using our political power against their advice, and against the interests of efficient administration. This is what the Chief Electoral Officer says on the subject",22
135,Mr RILEY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"The Government have no hope of passing the Bill , anyhow.",22
136,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Is that a statement of fact?,22
137,Mr RILEY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"It has no hope, so far as I am concerned.",22
138,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,We have no hope of passing an electoral measure!,22
139,Mr TUDOR,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,The honourable member did not say that.,22
140,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I ask the country to take particular notice of what the rank and file of the Opposition says, and of what ex-Minisfcers are only too anxious to have contradicted at the earliest possible moment. This is what the Chief Electoral Officer has to say regarding Saturday pollingExperience ,has shown that Saturday is not a satisfactory clay for the purpose of polling, from an administrative point of view, inasmuch asi . A large number of ballot-papers have to be held over Sunday uncounted, and a considerable risk run of fire or other untoward accident, and difficulty is experienced in safeguarding the Custody of the ballot-boxes containing the ballot papers. That statement alone should be sufficient to make any decent patriot seek the earliest possible amendment of the Act . The Chief Electoral Officer continues The transport, telegraphic, and postal facilities are practically suspended on the following Sunday. Further he saysA very large number of persons are released from their avocations practically from midday, and other persons leave their homes for various reasons, with the result that the polling is very unevenly distributed, and congestion at certain hours is almost unavoidable. Those statements are worthy of the respect and consideration of honourable members, and I hope that what has been said in advance by honourable members opposite as to their determination to prevent this Bill passing will not be proved by our experience in Committee.",22
141,Mr RILEY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,W a it a little.,23
142,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"The clauses that I have briefly run through aim at better administrative efficiency, and would have been suggested by the Electoral Department, whatever Government chanced to be in power. I come now to the two main policy provisions of the measure, by which we destroy nothing, but by which we hope create - principles which are essential to any Liberal electoral measure. flower of Democratic initiative, the freedom of the press, is sought to be reinstated in this Federal measure; and the franchise is again to be extended to a large body of persons, from whom it ought never to have been taken away, persons who, lying on beds of sickness, or who, pioneering far from polling booths, are laying the milestones of our country's progress. There was never a more foolish nor more wanton thing done in this Parliament than the attempt of the last A d ministration to "" g a g "" the press. Honourable members opposite have often told w since the purpose for which it was done. But let us consult the pages of Hansard to see why it was sought to rob the press of its liberty. Let us take first the statement made at the time by the present Leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister. He saidThe honourable member for Ballarat wonders why a proposal of this kind should be made at all, but I will give him the reason. The honourable member then proceeded to describe the rise of his party, and the increase of its numbers, and added that it was "" practically without a press to defend it . "" For no nobler purpose, then, than to h it at a press that was criticising his party, the honourable member for Wide Bay struck at that basis of free institutions, the freedom of the press. But what could he be thinking of when he said that the party had no press to defend it? Did he forget that throughout Australia there are newspapers specially subsidized by Labour organizations which turn out, week by week, the most glaring betrayals of the truth that have ever been consistently published in any part of the world ? I do not wonder that he sought to deny the Labour press; but it , nevertheless, exists, and is paid for by the same forces that return him and his followers to Parliament. It was because he wished to curb the criticism of the other unsubsidized newspapers in Australia, Liberal and Independent, that he supported the electoral "" gag."" What the honourable member put in a guarded way the honourable member for Gwydir expressed unguardedly. He admitted that the Labour Administration was fearful of any criticism whatever regarding its methods. "" The press,"" he to resaid, "" cannot injure a party that is fighting to win a position, but it can, by its That misrepresentation of words and actions, injure the reputation of a party in power."" I can only say in regard to that naive admission that the present Administration fears no criticism. Ministers regard a free press as the basis of free institutions, and we would rather lose our positions as the result of unjust criticism than deny the right of criticism to the press. Here is another statement by the honourable member for GwydirI f we were to say outside what the journalists write of us, we would be called to account by the Courts of the country, but those who control the newspapers are too wealthy, and can command too much legal talent for it to be possible for us to attack them with much chance ef success. What is that but au admission that the press "" g a g "" was specially provided give the honourable member and his end of last week. brethren the opportunity to intimidate individual newspaper writers. comparatively poor men, who have not financial support commensurate with wealth of the organizations supporting the Labour party, are to be victimized, or to be driven by fear of consequences from expressing what they believe the truth . The statement shows that did they do so? the press "" g a g "" was devised delibethan rately by the Labour Administration as an engine of terrorization and victimizafor tion, and it is, therefore, one of the duties of this Liberal Administration wipe it off the statute-book. The honorto able member for Capricornia saidWe are not afraid of criticism, but let us know the man who utters it, and then, perhaps, we shall be able to put a little criticism on him, and defend ourselves the better. That statement is a further advance towards comprehension of the position of the Labour party The honourable member for Capricornia is going to put on the acid. We have seen him putting on the acid in connection with the reporting of the proceedings of this House, and most of us have regretted the exhibition. The Liberal party has been returned to power to put the acid on the Labour party's vitriolic methods, which will find no place in our dealings with the electoral law of the country.",23
143,Mr SHARPE,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,The Minister knowB what he was going to do if he had not been successful in the recent campaign. He was going to spend some money on the press of Australia.,24
144,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"That is the first news ifchat I have ever had of it , and the statement is just as wild and reckless as many of the other statements emanating from honourable gentlemen opposite in regard to the press. I think the very intelligible phrases of honourable gentlemen when they imposed this gag are sufficient proof that we are doing eminently the correct thing in taking it off, and I repeat that I would rather be ou the opposite side, the victim of unfair criticism, than deny to the press that free criticism which is really 'basis of free representative institutions. I now come to another question policy involved in the Bill , and that postal vote.

146,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I am glad to think they the are beginning to weaken a little on this matter; but the honourable member will remember the confidence with which they wiped out that privilege to the sick and to be the infirm only a few years ago. Why For no better reason that, out of 84,000 votes cast under this system in 1910, 49,000 odd were cast the Liberal party, whilst only 33,000 first odd went to honourable gentlemen oppoto site. For no nobler purpose than merely abolish a vote that was of no party advantage to them they actually denied to the sick people of this community the right to express their verdict on the counof the acid of try's affairs.",24

148,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"The attempt that was made by my honourable friends, and, unfortunately, for the time successfully made, to rob these persons of their vote had no nobler origin than a very selfish ambition to benefit themselves as the result of the power with which the people had intrusted them for another purpose.",24
149,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Are you sure that the Electoral Office, confirms that?",24
150,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I will say that the Electoral Office cannot see, and never has been able to see, any other means of giving the sick and infirm a vote than by the use of the postal vote: and I believe that the position, of the Electoral Office in this regard was put perfectly clearly and full y before the last Administration, which took its action, not because of expert advice, but rather in spite of it . Who are the persons now to be given the franchise ? If we endeavour to estimate their numbers we shall find, according to a rough estimate of the Statistician, taking the sick and the infirm into account, that no less than 77,000 persons in Australia may at any day want to use the postal vote or be deprived of their the franchise. Of women expecting within two months to be confined in Australia of there are, on a daily average, 22,000: is the there are 30,000 sick persons, and 25,000 persons, or in all 77,000 persons, whom for very decency this Parliament ought to be the first to consider and extend the franchise to. If honourable members will look at the Bill they wil l see that the classes of persons to whom the franchise is now to be extended are not only those who will be sick, but also those who will be absent from a polling place. The actual words of the provision areAn elector who(a) has reason to believe that he will not, at any time during the hours of polling on polling day, be within five miles of any polling place for the division for which he is enrolled; or (A) being a woman, will on account of health be unable to attend the place on polling day to vote; or (f) will be prevented by serious illness or infirmity from attending the polling place on polling day to vote, may make application for a postal vote certificate and postal ballot-paper. There are two classes; those who are pioneering the country's progress and are far removed from polling booths; and those who are sick or expecting to be ill.",24

163,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I think that, if honourable members opposite do not give us a chance of doing business, they will have an election very quickly, but I hope that we shall first have a chance of putting our electoral law in order. I have read to honourable members the list of authorized witnesses. Why do we specially choose these persons? Because, in connection with this vote, we place very material responsibilities on their shoulders. Take, for instance, the first duty of an authorized witness. Under the subject to a fine of £ 5 0 , or one month's imprisonment, he has placed upon him the responsibility of seeing that the postal voter makes proper application for his vote. He has to know personally the applicant, or satisfy himself as to his identity. He has to satisfy himself as to the facts set out in the application, and he must witness the proper signature of the applicant. The applicant, I may say, is equally liable to a fine of £ 5 0 , or one month's imprisonment, if he exceeds or evades any of the obligations under the Bill . Now, honourable members who have been saying of recent weeks that the electoral affairs of Australia are absolutely safe in the hands of the most honest public, I believe, that exists throughout the world, must surely be making a somersault with extraordinary celerity if they now say that specially authorized witnesses, subject to these fines, pains, and penalties, will deliberately do a dishonest thing to secure for some other person than themselves a benefit. Unless honourable gentlemen had their tongues in their cheeks during the last few weeks, they must recollect that it is nothing but hypocrisy and cant to suggest that these persons cannot be trusted in this regard. Let us see what next happens in regard to the postal vote. A f t e r having been specially witnessed by an authorized person, with all these safeguards, the application is sent to the Returning Officer, who, after he satisfies biniself that no previous application has been put in , whether for an absent voter's certificate or for a postal voter's certificate, can send to the applicant a postal voter's certificate and ballot-paper. When the ballot-paper reaches the applicant, he again has to call in an authorized witness, and to show the ballot-paper and the envelope to the witness. The witness is to see these things, but is specially instructed, under pains and penalties .amounting to a fine of £ 1 0 0 or three months' imprisonment, that on no account must he see or know how the voter votes j and-if it is a question of having to help an illiterate person-unde r the same pains and penalties he is bound down not to betray the information.",26

165,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"My honourable friend has not had this measure in Queensland Bill, before, and he knows it .",26
166,Mr SHARPE,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,A similar one.,26
167,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"This is one of the things which are most laughable in this connection. Honourable members opposite spent days and days in tirading against a Queensland Act when what they have to deal with is a Commonwealth Act, which, in the past, has been practically without abuse. A f t e r the placing of the ballot paper in the envelope and its despatch by the voter in the way set out, the vote is to go to the Returning Officer for the division, and his duty is to compare the signature on the application form with the signature on the outside of the envelope covering the ballot-paper, to see that the applicant is really the person who is voting. Righ t from beginning to end, therefore, the system is thoroughly safeguarded, and it is the safest method in electoral law of which I personally have ever seen or heard. But, in order that the last remaining shadow of doubt may be taken away in connection with the measure, we have introduced one reform in these proposals. Now, the voter himself may post his ballot-paper; he may make himself responsible for posting the document which he gets under the provision.",26
168,Mr WEST,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Will a sick person have to post the ballot-paper?,26
169,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"No ; but he can give it to his father or his mother to be posted. In the old days, we were charged with being responsible for the Act under which a justice of the peacethe class that is held up to universal ridicule, contempt, and contumely-coul d collect these ballot-papers in their envelopes, could know pretty well how the voters were voting, and then go away and lose the votes that were cast against their party.",26
170,Mr WEST,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Is it not a weak spot when we find that interested persons do the posting ?,27
171,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"That is why the provision is taken out of the Act , and as the honourable member agrees, I hope he will look into the postal voting provision with an open mind. That is the only variation in the Bill so far as the postal voting clauses are concerned, except certain amendments consequential on the retention in part of the absent voting provisions, with a fresh penalty in order to still further tighten up the latter. Honourable members opposite declare that it is almost inhumane to ask persons who are sick to interfere in party politics; and we have heard the honourable member for Cook make use of that argument with great force. It might be a fair argument, and worthy, at any rate, of passing consideration, if it were not for the fact that we do not propose to force people to vote, but only to give them an opportunity to do so. Further, the argument comes with singularly bad taste from a party that, at every election for the last six years^ has consistently endeavoured to worm its way to place and pay by appealing to the fears of the aged poor. If honourable members opposite think that the aged and infirm ought to be left free from party conflict, why do they constantly endeavour to work on the fears of old-age pensioners? We do not propose in any way to invade the sick room, but we do propose to give those who wish to exercise the franchise the right of which they ought never to have been deprived-the right to take an interest in the affairs of the country, which means so much to all of us. We have heard a good deal about justices of the peace as being men who, according to lionorable members opposite, are a particularly dishonest class.",27
172,Mr BRENNAN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Who said that?,27
173,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"If honourable members require exact quotations I shall give them some. For instance, the honourable member for Bass saidWho are the people throughout Australia that can afford to pay broken-down justices of the peace to canvass electorates? . . . - think the police would lend themselves to anything wrong, and I do not think any State-school teacher, who is privileged to do that work, did anything wrong, but I do believe that justices of the peace have done that which was wrong with regard to the spirit of the Electoral Act. Do honourable members opposite endorse that statement ? Well, then, let - us for a moment look at what has actually happened in the way of corruption in connection with the postal vote. I have given honourable members some indication of the enormous scope there is for corruption, and it was to be anticipated that there would be some few cases of malpractice. As a matter of fact, those cases are very few. From a return that I hold in my hand I find that the first charge made was against Henry Ellis, J.P., of Melbourne, but the case was dismissed. The first conviction, though the conviction was not ultimately upheld, was that of Stephen Barker, J.P., who is a member of the Senate, and a colleague of honourable members opposite.  in that?",27

177,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"The honourable member is also James Page, J.P. The next case I have is that of personating an elector to secure a ballot-paper. A lady was charged with this offence in Melbourne in 1903, committed for trial, but found not guilty in the Supreme Court; and in another case of a lady the charge was abandoned. It will be seen that, at the 1903 elections, when the safeguards were not so well known as they have been' I do not since, there were only four cases, without a single ultimate conviction. As I have already pointed out, the first person to be fined was a colleague of my honourable friends opposite.",27

In connection with the general election of 1906, a man was fined in the Gwydir electorate for attempted dual voting under the postal voters' provisions. It is obvious that anybody who plays such tricks under the system must be caught; and this, apparently, was a person who tried it on. Another man was fined £ 5 and costs, under section 1096, for having failed as a witness to satisfy himself as to the identity of an applicant for a postal voting paper.",28

What a slander on the electors of ivtelbourne! The next case is that of man named Noakes, in Calare, who was fined £ 5 for failing to satisfy himself to the identity of an applicant. That a pretty heavy fine, but one that is perly imposable for such an offence. improperly assisting an elector, a man was fined in Victoria, and another was fined for permitting an elector to be i m - Adelaide, properly assisted-for looking on at fault of another person. For making a O'Loghlin, false statement as a witness, a constable was fined in Victoria, and a charge 'made against a lady, but was withdrawn on the advice of the Law officers.

In the Wannon electorate, the very heavy fine of £ 2 5 16s. was imposed on a witness for failing to satisfy himself as to the truth of the statements of an applicant. I have given honourable members the whole of the records that we have in connection with malpractices under the postal voting provisions; and because of those few trifling cases, honourable members opposite would disfranchise 77,000electors. We are told that justices of the peace are persons who cannofc be intrusted with work of this kind. L et me inform the House that, so far as I can ascertain, out of fcrty-one justices of the peace in the Federal Parliament, thirty two are members of the Labour party. In Victoria, for instance, we have Senator Stephen Barker, who was the first person fco be fined; and, in Queensland, there is a regular nest of them. There are Senator Ferricks, Senator Maughan, Senator Mullan, Senator Turley, Senator Stewart, the honourable member for Brisbane, the ? honourable member for Kennedy, the honourable member for Herbert, the honourable member for Wide Bay, the honourable member for Capricornia, and the honorI t will be able member for Maranoa.  not "" g a m e "" to take up that wager! Mn. KELLY - If I am doing the honourable member an injustice, I shall be the a first man to withdraw the accusation, but I find him on the register, and, so far, as he has not denied the fact. In the case is of South Australia, the justices of the propeace in this House are the honourable For member for Hindmarsh, the honourable member for Boothby, the honourable member for Grey, the honourable member for Senator Guthrie, Senator the MCGregor, Senator Newland, Senator Senator Senior, Senator Story, and last, but not least, the honwas orable member for Darwin. In the case of Western Australia, every member of n conthe Labour party but one in the Senate is a justice of the peace, and amongst the brethren is the honourable member for K a l goorlie. My point is that justices of the are carefully selected as men t . worthy of confidence and credit at the I read of those names to prove that honourable mem5 , bers opposite recognise that the position to is indeed one to be desired and greatly for sought after, even by gentlemen who proto be scornful of all honours. Yet, in the face of the fact that thirty-fcwo out of the forty-one justices of the peace in the Commonwealth Parliament are members of the Labour party, honourable members opposite have the impudence to say that justices of the peace are a discreditable class who cannot be trusted with the exercise of the highly responsible and important duties to which I have referred, and whose political inclinations apparently are all on the side of the Liberal party! We now see how evenly those positions are distributed over the Labour party, and yet how unevenly they are represented in the Federal Parliament. I do not say, because of the fact that so many of them will be exercising these privileges, that the electors of Australia are not able to look after themselves if they do occasionally meet a justice of the peace who is not honest. There is only one member of the House whom I have not mentioned as being a justice of the peace, and that is the honourable member for Bass, who, most appropriately, appears on the register as hailing from Beauty Point. I come now to the steps taken under this Bill to safeguard the rights of a selfwelcomed, governing people to have a safe, sure, and partment, and one that will clean electoral system. Honourable bers will find in clauses 8 and 10 the of the provisions taken by the present Administration to safeguard our elecsystem. toral system. Under those provisions we seek to escape a repetition of the spectacle that some of us saw in the Parliament, when the majority sent here matter ? for other purposes did its best to escape the obligations resting upon it under Constitution and the Electoral Act to give the electors of New South Wales equal electoral boundaries so as to secure the principle of one vote one value. saw the Electoral Commissioners for New South Wales sending up scheme measure. after scheme, and scheme after scheme being sent back to them, until the Opposition publicly announced that i would hold up all public business until regulations are concerned, the rights of the electors in this regard were given a chance of expression means of legislation. That was the time that the party to which I have the honour to belong, during the whole of the life of the last Parliament, took such a step; and that step had to be taken because the Government of the day disregarded its plain and simple duty to the Australian people-the duty of giving, under the law of the land, the principle of one vote one value to the people who intrusted them with the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth.",28

186,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"When my honourable friend speaks, he speaks so timorously that one wonders why he is here. Clause 20 of the Bill seeks to surround the absent-voting provisions with reasonable safeguards. I believe that, whatever Government had come into power, it would have been forced to deal with this question. Under the absent-voting provisions, as proposed to be amended by this Bill, any person who wishes to vote as an absent voter will have to put in a prior application for an absent-voting certificate, and having done that he may vote wherever he likes under the absent-voting provisions. But there is this guarantee against any possible reckless abuse of the system- a guarantee I believe, by the Electoral Debe memthoroughly appreciated by all persons first desiring that we shall have, as far as possible, an absolutely faultless electoral",29

I do not want to then give them too many opportunities. My t honourable friend will see that, so far as another clause of the Bill gives the Parliament by penal powers in regard to breaches of only administration- a position which the Administration of the day has not hitherto occupied. Clauses 30, 32, and 33 provide penalties for wrong-doing under the Act; but clause 19 is the principal provision to secure the proper recording of the national verdict in Australia.

191,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Have I ever said anything else ? I am sure that neither I nor any member of our party has said anything else. What I do say is that the Leader of the Opposition must indeed be a disingenuous person if he can ask the people of Australia to believe that there is no occasion to safeguard the rights of the honest many from the invasion of the dishonest few, with regard to a general voting system, when he says, practically, that no justice of the peace in Australia is fit to be trusted with postal votingwhen he says that the postal-voting system is an engine for enormous and tremendous corruption. Although that system is hedged about with restrictions it is capable, according to him, of widespread abuse! A man who takes up those two positions shows that his opinion is no longer worthy to be seriously regarded. If the postal-voting system, hedged about with these restrictions, is pregnant and bristling with possibilities of fraud , in danger. I ask honourable members to consider the possibility of fraud under the present electoral system.

195,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"In my humble judgment, it has not been done, although there are some dishonest persons in the community. The records of the Courts bear witness to that fact. This country is the most honest on the face of the globe, yet, as in every other country, there are in Australia a certain number of persons who are ready tocommit offences against the law. We had in 1811 - the last year for which particulars are available-144,76 4 convictions in the Police Courts of this country, and 2,631 committals for t r i a l . These were not serious offences; they were triflin g Police Court offences. But the fact remains that a proportion of these men who will commit trifling offences against the law, might be led to commit what they might regard as trifling offences against the electoral system if they thought that honourable members opposite were in danger. Nobody believed at the last general election that honourable members opposite were The honourable member for West Sydney himself told the people, as reported in the Sydney newspapers, that it his party, instead of losing any, was going to win more, seats; and people who did They There was, in other words, no inducement to do any of the improper things that can has be done with absolute safety under the Since then some of these people have, unfortunately, found out the way to commit these petty crimes, and have learned of the safety accompanying any such breach of the law.

We say, however, that the mere existence in this country of a number of persons who are prepared to commit petty makes it absolutely essential that when the shortcomings of the electoral system have 'been displayed and the loopholes for fraud have been advertised throughout the land, both political parties shall see that the law is put right. I therefore ask honourable members to join with the Government in endeavouring to amend the existing Act in this regard. I do not say that any f r a u d has been committed. I do not know. All that I do know is that there was no inducement for fraud in any sense or form at the last election. There was on that occasion no keen or intense bitterness of feeling. But I do say that in the future, judging from present indications, we are. likely to have a far more bitter and intense display of feeling than we have ever had in Australia before; and I therefore ask honourable members opposite to assist the Government in putting the law right by adopting the provisions which we have inserted in this Bill . Under the measure, when an elector comes into the polling booth to vote, he or she will simply have to sign his or her name on the butt of the ballot paper. He will make one signature for the ballot-paper for the Senate and the House of Representatives. The ballot paper will then be given to him, and, after he has voted, it will be deposited in the ballot-box. The purpose of the signature is to insure that we may have no double voting. We shall be able, on the order of the Court of Disputed Returns, to contrast the signature on the butt with the signature of the claimant for enrolment, which will be kept at the central Electoral Office. This is simply an extension of the card system. We have not turned down the system already in force. We have engrafted on to the existing card system a means of attaining electoral security.

The actual nature of his vote can only be revealed before a Court of offences Disputed Returns-in other words, when there is an appeal against an election to the High Court. In no other way can the votes in question be traced. But where double voting is suspected we shall be able to check the signatures on the butts of the ballot-papers with the signatures on the application forms, and shall very easily be able to tell who was entitled to vote and who voted wrongfully.",32

228,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Yes , on the butt. These butts will be kept by the presiding officer. We shall have a long ballot-paper. The b u tt will be 6 or 8 inches long. The balance of the paper will be small. As soon as the elector has signed his name on the butt, the ballot-paper will be torn off, and taken to the ballot-box, and when the elector has voted he will fold it , and drop it in the ballot-box, with the same secrecy as prevails at the present time. The change which this system will make is that a comparison will be able to be made between the signature on the but t and the signature of the elector when he claimed to be enrolled. Furthermore, if an election is challenged before the Court of Disputed Returns, the Court wil l have the right to examine the ballot-papers and to compare them. This is a right which is necessary in order to .check the purity of any election in this country. Honourable members must recognise that, without a secure system, you cannot guarantee representative government. W it h a system such as exists, which is capable of abuse-eve n if it has not been abused-yo u will , undoubtedly, eventually have persons of a mischievous nature who will utilize that system to in fluence elections improperly by the recording of bogus votes, by impersonation, by double voting, treble voting, and quadruple voting.",32

"" The honourable member would say, "" I a m , "" and upon that declaration a ballot-paper would be given to him. He could not be deprived of his vote under this provision. But if , after that, the election was disputed and the Court of Disputed Returns ordered the ballot-papers to be examined, it would then find which vote had been improperly cast in the name of Sir Robert Best, and would reject the vote of the impersonator. Thus, by opening the ballot-papers afterwards, the Court would find out and discard the vote illegally and dishonestly cast.",33

236,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I think there will be a difficulty in identifying the voter, certainly. But the honourable member has to recollect that there will be no difficulty whatever in identifying the vote wrongf u l l y cast. The Court of Disputed Returns wil l be able to throw out that vote, and by that means we shall secure an honest vote in that particular electorate. imperThat is all we are endeavouring to do by this provision.

The main trouble and difficulty will be in the administration; but the administrative officers do not shrink from any trouble and difficulty that will give us a secure and pure electoral system. 4,000 polling places, at present, there are no assistant presiding officers at all. These are the country places, where ""not many votes are cast, and there will be plenty of time for devoting the little extra trouble which the new system will entail. But we shall require an additional 1,500 assistant presiding officers, and 1,500 poll clerks. Those officers can be provided, and will be provided. It is desirable that they should be provided, in order to obtain the additional security which we shall get if this Bill becomes law.",34

253,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Goo d heavens'! It will be endless!,34
254,Mr KELLY,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"It is estimated that the actual cost of inaugurating the new system will involve an increase of less than one-eighth. That is the estimate of the Electoral Office. But as against this the Act as a whole will lighten the duties of presiding officers very materially. At present, delay is caused in attending to in firm persons. Under the new system, those persons will be able to vote by post. We have all seen a polling booth held up for a considerable time while people who, actuated by a sense of public duty and patriotism, have, though infirm, come out to vote, were attended to-person s who have been driven by the action of our friends opposite to come to the polling booth and register their votes in person. These persons will now be able to vote by post- a privilege which any humane Government would have accorded to them before, instead of compelling them to drag their misfortunes out into the public gaze before they could discharge a public duty. I am afraid that I have made a somewhat rambling speech in in troducing this Bill . I am deeply in debted to honourable members on this side of the House, who, despite constant interruptions, have accorded me a patient hearing, which, under the circumstances, I could hardly have expected. I regret that my honourable friends opposite have not given me so free an opportunity as I should have liked to place so comprehensive a measure before them in proper consecutive order. But, at any rate, I have been perfectly frank. In I have given honourable members opposite the fullest information within the time at my disposal, and I ask them most seriously to consider the dangerous position which the country will occupy if , after a public advertisement of the faulty nature of our electoral system, we do not tighten it up, with a view to preventing the interests of the vast majority of Australian electors being invaded by a dishonest infinitesimal minority. In this Bill the Government seek to make our electoral system safe, our press free and fearless, and our f r a n chise the widest in the world. Debate (on motion by Mr EISHER ) adjourned. "" NORFOLK ISLAND BILL . SECOND READING .",34
255,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Angas-Minister of External Affairs) [5.18] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. In 1909 the honourable member for Darling Downs, who was then Minister of External affairs, introduced into this House a Bill for the taking over of Norfolk Island- a Bill which contains a great deal of information that honourable members will find helpful in considering this measure. I will endeavour, as far as possible, to keep clear of the ground which he trod on that occasion. I am sure honourable members will excuse me if , with a view fco completing the information which they should have, I refer to some documents connected with Norfolk Island. The preamble of this Bill is a long one, and fairl y expresses its object and the title of Norfolk Island. But to supplement the synopsis there given, I must touch on certain events and Orders-inCouncil. In 1788 Lieutenant K in g took possession of Norfolk under Royal proclamation. On the 28th February, 1814, it was abandoned. In 1826 the island was again occupied, and maintained as a place of detention until 1844. Then, by Act 6 and 7 Victoria, it was placed under the control and administration of Van Diemen's Land, as Tasmania was then called. That Act was described as "" An Act to amend so much of an Act of the last session, for the government of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, as relates to Norfolk Island,"" and under it the island was.severed from New South Wales and annexed to Tasmania. 1855, just before the penal settlement of Norfolk Island, the Australian Waste Lands Act was passed. It contained a provision empowering the separation of Norfolk Island from Tasmania. Order in Council was issued in accordance with the Act of 1855, dated 24th June, 1856, which in effect declared that from Che date of the proclamation, which was subsequently issued on the 31st October, the said island, called Norfolk Island, should be separated from the said Colony of Van Diemen's Land, now called Tasmania, and made a distinct and separate settlement. The Order in Council goes on to state, "" the affairs of which should, until further Order in that behalf by Her Majesty, be administered by a Governor, to be for that purpose appointed by Her Majesty."" The Governor in New South Wales was appointed by the Order, as the Governor for the purpose. Speaking generally, from the date of that proclamation t ill 1897, the Order in Council mained unchanged. During that period Norfolk Island was under the administration of the Governor for the time being of New South Wales. In 1896 Sir George Reid, who was then Premier of New South Wales, agreed to pay the cost of government;-that is to say, in effect, any deficiency between the revenue and expenditure of the island. About this time, 1897, the Imperial Government contemplated a change, and some little trouble occurred in the island. Its settlers did not know exactly what contemplated. Some thought that the titles of the lands vested in the original settlers were to be interfered with . In a few years, however, their anxiety, I think, was allayed by their actual experiences. On the 15th January, 1897, a proclamation was issued, from which I Island desire to quote a few sentences. It statesAnd whereas by an Order in Council dated the fifteenth day of January, 1897, made in pursuance of the said last-mentioned Act, Her late Majesty, after reciting that it was expedient that other provision should be made for the government of Norfolk Island, and that, in prospect of the future annexation of Norfolk Island to the Colony of New South Wales or to any Federal body of which that Colony might thereafter form part, in the meantime the affairs of Norfolk Island should be administered by the Governor of New South Wales as therein provided, was pleased to revoke the said Order in Council of the twenty-fourth day of June, One thousand eight hundred and fifty-six, and to order that the affairs of Norfolk Island should In thenceforth, and until further Order should be made in that behalf by Her Majesty, be administered by the Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of New South Wales and its Dependencies. An That was modified by an Order in Council on the 18th October, 1900, which was published 011 the 1st January, 1901, and the effect of which was to change the word "" Colony "" into "" State,"" so as to bring it into line with the fact that Federation had been accomplished. That is about how the matter stands at present, so far as title is concerned. In 1897, the question was raised as to what should be clone with the island, and it was pointed out that there could be 110 annexation by New South Wales or the Commonwealth except by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. But, by an Order in Council, the island can be placed under the control of the Commonwealth. When that Order in Council is issued, the administration of Norfolk Island will be transferred from re- the Governor of New South Wales to the Commonwealth, and become a Territory which will be administered by the Commonwealth in accordance with section 121 of the Constitution.. In 1909, the second reading of the Bill for the transfer of Norfolk Island to the Commonwealth was merely moved. It did not reach another stage. Subsequently, some communications were exchanged in regard to it between the Governor of New South Wales and the then Minister of External A f fairs. The Imperial Government was also was communicated with by the Governor of New South Wales as to the establishment, on transfer to the Commonwealth, of freedom of trade between Norfolk Island and Australia. The Bill , as it is now drafted, was finally submitted for the approval of the Governor of New South Wales, and it has recently been revived. It contains a provision which satisfies the Imperial authorities that we desire to allow the produce of Norfolk Island coming direct to Australia to be admitted free in all cases in which there is not an Excise duty on similar commodities here.",34
256,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,What of the island 1,36
257,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"No r f o l k Island comprises an area of 8,528 acres. It is of a fairl y mild and equable climate, the temperature ranging from 56 to 82 degrees, giving an average of 68 degrees. rainfall is 43 inches, the population 985, being composed of 568 males and 417 females, a disparity in the numerical proportions of the sexes that, according to thelaw of supply and demand, or to speak less profanely, of proposal aud acceptance, naturally gives the ladies, whenever the inevitable and fateful question is popped, a position of advantage. The island is compact, salubrious, and, I believe, in parts beautiful. It is no mereShadowy isle of bliss 'Mid-most the beating of the steely sea, but the home of a race of somewhat romantic traditions-sailors , expert whalers, men of the stamp of those whose seamanship, proverbial amongst nations, has extended the trade and the bounds of Empire.' I think honourable members are fairly familiar with the history of Pitcairn Island. About 1787, the Bounty, a sloop of about 250 tons, was commissioned by George III . , who desired to transplant some of the bread-fruit tree, of which a favourable account had been given by Captain Cook, who was in Tahiti in 1769, to the West Indies. On going Home, Captain Cook reported that in Tahiti he had found an amiable, peaceful population, a fertile soil, and a genial climate, and that there flourished there a f r u it which was exceedingly nutritious. Bligh was commissioned to transplant some of this f r u it to the West Indies. reached Tahiti , remained there about six months, and then started on his voyage. We all know that soon after a mutiny occurred on board his vessel. Some say that it was brought about by the stern and Draconian discipline of Bligh himself. Others say that it was due to different causes. At any rate, Bligh and his companions were turned adrift, and eventually reached the Island of Timor, and Christian, a man of virile and attractive character, although chief of the mutineers, some of whom belonged to the best and most adventurous blood of Great Britain-as might be said of many of the officers associated with Bligh-wen t to Tahiti, and, after calling twice at Tauis the area bonai, returned to Tahiti, and eventually, with seven or eight companions, started on the ocean to seek some uninhabited land-on e of thoseSummer Isles of Eden, lying In dark purple spheres of sea The there to spend, as Morrison's Journal said, the remainder of his days without seeing the face of any European except those who accompanied him. Honourable members may recollect that Byron's poem, The Island, was based on this episode of the mutineers of the Bounty. It is the poem which caused Ruskin to pay one of the greatest tributes ever paid to Byron. Ruskin extolled the poet's concision, directness, and sincerity, quoting in support of his opinion the passageA little stream came tumbling from the height And straggling to the ocean as it might. . . . While far below the vast and sullen swell Of ocean's alpine azure rose and f e l l . In 1856, Norfolk Island was vacated. Tb.3 Pitcairn islanders, finding that their island had become too small for them, petitioned for another home, and Norfolk Island was given to them. The island is about 480 miles from Auckland, 450 from New Caledonia, and 9""04 from Sydney, and is in latitude 29.3.4, longitude 167.58.6, the latitude being about that of Brisbane. It s area is 8,528 acres, of which 5,400 have been alienated in fee simple.",36
258,Mr THOMAS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"As it is twice as far from Sydney as from Auckland, would it not be better if New Zealand were to take it over ?",36
259,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I do not believe in surrendering what seems to be our He domain. I hope that the interests of Australia in the Pacific will be more manifest in the future, and I say it with the greatest respect to other nations, whose ideas of government, if applied, may tend as much to the amelioration and advancement of the natives as our own. Placed as we are, the greater the control we have of islands like Norfolk Island, the better it may be for the people there and here. And we must look ahead. In addition to the land alienated in fee simple, 967 acres are locked up i u reserves, 850 acres have been leased, and 1,311 acres remain Crown land, and unused, but 80 per cent, of the area is hilly, and part of it is heavily timbered. I find from looking at the map that in 1859 the island was parcelled out by Governor Denison into allotments of about 50 acres.. Only 400 acres are under agriculture. I do not wish to enter into the reasons for the backward state of agriculture, but I hope that under our fostering care it may develop; though it should be possible for people to be happy if they are secure, even where the population is comparatively small; and we do not wish to carry the f r e t and worry of modern life to Norfolk Island.",36
260,Mr ARTHUR,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Why not islanders in their native happiness?,37
261,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"As I have pointed out, it was stated in an Order in Council that when the Federation was formed, responsibility for Norfolk Island sbould be shifted to it frorruthe Government of New South Wales. The following is an extract from an interesting letter received by a colleague from a lady living on the island. The letter is dated 16th July last, and speaks of the principal cropsThey can grow anything in any quantityoranges, lemons, guavas, pineapples, yams, Kumeras, potatoes (three or four crops a year), strawberries, bananas, coffee, maize, wheatanything; but what's the use? It costs 4s. per case to send a case of oranges to Sydney, and 2s. a case duty. In 1903, Mr Oliver, appointed by, I think, Sir H a r r y Rawson, visited the island, and, reporting on its production, saidHowever, maize, among grain crops, and oranges, lemons (Lisbon), bananas, guavas, passion-fruit, melons, and custard apples, among . fruits, are at present the staple products of the soil, and with encouragements such as might fairly be claimed by the farmers, could be grown over very much larger areas, and in much larger quantities, than now. couragement of any kind, and, indeed, with the certain prospect of producing what he cannot profitably sell at home or abroad, or find some profitable use for, it is hardly reasonable to ask these farmers to increase their output of any State-taxed commodity. Since the establishment of the Australian Commonwealth, Norfolk Island exports have, as might be expected, shrunk in value in a very marked degree, and at present the excess in value of imports over exports is very nearly, if not quite, as 10 to 1. The island, therefore, is very far from being self-supporting, economically considered, and but for the Melanesian Mission and Cable Station, expenditure on local products would exhibit a most unsatisfactory balance-sheet from a business point of view. The island has a capital of £5,700, of which £4,800 is invested in the funded stock of New South Wales, and bears in terest at the rate of 3 or 3£ per cent, per annum. The stock is redeemable only with the consent of the New South Wales Government, but possibly, as in taking over the island we shall relieve the State of an expenditure of more than £1,500 a year, its Government may consent to the redemption of the stock, in which case it should be possible to re-invest it on terms giving a return of I or 1 per cent. more. The revenue from all sources for the financial year beginning 1st July, 1912, and ending 30th June, 1913, was £2,520 0s. l i d . , leave the and the expenditure £2,319 l is . 5d., showing a surplus of £202 9s. 6d. I need not give figures for other years. The revenue of the island was made up in this way:-Interes t on funded stock, deposits, and loans, £ 2 7 3 ; Customs duties, £ 4 6 0 ; postage stamps and postal notes, £ 1 9 7 ; land revenue, £ 1 0 8 ; timber royalties, fees of Court, and other revenue, £ 1 8 2 ; and an annual grant from New South Wales, £ 8 0 0 ; making the total £2,020. When the necessary deductions and additions are made, we get the total revenue for the financial year £2,520. New South Wales, besides making an annual grant of £800, pays the salary of the Chief Magistrate of the island, £ 4 5 0 ; that of the principal teacher, £ 2 5 0 ; and that of the teacher's wife, £ 3 0 ; so that the minimum outlay which we shall be called upon to meet if we take control of Norfolk Island, and of which we shall relieve the State of New South Wales, is £1,530. For the financial year ending 30th June, 1912, the imports from New South Wales were valued at £ 8 , 2 9 6 ; from New Zealand, £ 8 1 0 ; a total of £9,106 . The exports were, to New South Wales, £ 7 9 8 ; to the Without enSouth Sea Islands, £ 4 3 2 ; and to New Zealand, £ 1 3 5 ; a total of £ 1 , 4 1 5 . I think that the Customs collected in Sydney amounted to £ 3 7 5. The two principal exports were, I think, whale o i l , £399, and skins, £287. I have not the other figures, but those figures, with the quotations I have already given, show their general character. As stated by Mr Oliver, in his report of 1903The volume of Norfolk Island trade can never be considerable. Any increased output must be considered more particularly as of benefit lo the producers of the island rather than as coming into competition with the productions of the Commonwealth. They cannot touch us; and, as I said, the amount of Customs duties realized is exceedingly small for a place of our standing to seriously consider.",37
262,Mr SAMPSON,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,How are the Customs duties levied ?,38
263,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"B y the Governor of New South Wales, who has absolute power. As I mentioned, in 1896 New South Wales took upon itself the responsibility for the deficiency in the revenue, and since then I think the Governor has always consulted the Government of New South Wales. As a matter of fact, under the documents I have referred to, the Governor really is Administrator of Norfolk Island, but, I think, he does recognise the essence of responsible government through the Governor in Council, although ""responsible is not absolutely mentioned in any of the documents. « The communications are principally i i the hands of Burns, Philp, and Company, and are not very frequent. I might give honourable members some idea of the class of legislation which has passed. A sort of Constitution was esrespect tablished by the Order in Council of The first clause provides for the appointcent, ment of a Chief Magistrate1. The Executive Government of Norfolk Island shall, during the absence of the Governor, be vested in the Chief Magistrate, appointed the Governor from time to time, who shall hold office during the pleasure of and shall reside on the island. That p r a c t i c a l ly means always, in g necessarily in f r e q u e n t . The Governor may from time to time appoint some person who shall, if the Chief Magistrate should die or be absent from island, or become incapable of acting in office, have the powers, and perform the conferred and imposed on the Chief Magistrate until a successor is appointed, or during such absence or incapacity as aforesaid. 2. The Chief Magistrate shall, in pursuance of the authority hereby vested in him, exercise a general supervision over the affairs of island, and shall from time to time, and required by the Governor, report to him as to the condition of the island and all matters ring therein, and shall carry out any instrucCouncil, tions given him by the Governor. that power of alienating, leasing, or authorizing the occupation or use of waste lands of the Crown shall be exercised by the Governor alone. I now come to the Council clause, which, subject to the Governor, controls the affairs of the Island.",38
264,Mr THOMAS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Will freehold be allowed there ?,38
265,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"The Bill contains no provision on that point. I gave the figures deliberately to show how comparatively small a question it is. There are only a little over 1,100 acres of land unsold. As the area under freehold is 5,400 acres, practically, the freehold has gone. I wish that had not occurred. I do not believe in small places being handed over to outsiders; but that is not the case in regard to Norfolk Island, and I hope it will not be. I deliberately went into their history to show that these men were transferred under exceptional conditions to Norfolk Island, and that they did regard it as their place of settlement, and not subject to outside exploitation.",38

267,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,No .,38
268,Mr THOMAS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"We could say that the 1,100 acres shall not be alienated.",38
269,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I do not think there is been much in that suggestion, with all due to my predecessor and his ideas in 1897. the matter. When we find that 80 per of the unsold land is fairly good, but hilly and partly timbered, there is very little left for us in a Parliament like this to quibble about. by The total area of the island is, as I said, 8,528 acres, of which about 5,400 have the Governor, been sold in fee-simple.",38
270,Mr SHARPE,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"The holders are not previsits bepared to forfeit the land, are they ?",38
271,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Why should they be asked to do that? Let us not be led into the digressions on a point of that sort. The his Executive Council consists of a president duties, and six other members. Two of the six members are required to be elders-a n elder, I believe, is a person twenty-five years of age-and must be of the age of thirty years or upwards, elected by the the elders. The president and the four other when members are appointed by the Governor. occurThere is a secretary to the Executive and as to its powers, shortly Provided stated, these include(a) Care, control, and management of public roads. (i) Care and management of such commons and public reserves, and the care, construction, and management of such public works as may be intrusted to the Council by the Governor; provided that the Governor may revoke any authority granted by him in this connection. The Council may, with the approval of the Governor, delegate its powers to any person or corporation with respect to any specified roads, commons, or reserves. It has ample power to make by-laws.",38
272,Mr FLEMING,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,It is just like a shire council.,39

276,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I think we may proceed too quickly. I am a thorough believer in responsible government. If there have been any troubles at No r f o lk Island to an extent it may have been from the lack of a sense of local responsibility, which comes fro m the outside control of the Governor, who cannot, in the nature of things, often visit the island.",39
277,Mr ARTHUR,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Then they are the descendants of mutineers, too.",39
278,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Yes , but in a good sense. I hope that that word "" mutineers "" will not be attempted to be used invidiously. I have such a respect for honourable members opposite that I hesitated to pay a compliment to them by taking a quotation from a book on the character of descendants about 1856, of these so-called mutineers, which I read a few nights ago. Perhaps I ought to read the extract, and as they listen, honourable members will see almost the counterfeit presentment of themselvesTheir modesty of demeanour, urbanity of manner, affectionate disposition, and personal appearance I am looking direct at the honourable member for Barrierhave won for them the esteem and admiration of all who have visited them. Their extreme absence of suspicion Which, of course, never characterizes the Opposition in regard to any matter of administration at presentrenders them peculiarly liable to f all a prey to designing individuals, and it is sincerely to be hoped, now that they are to be brought into contact with more of the evil existing in the world, they may be preserved from its injurious effects. They place implicit reliance in every word that is said, as they have not the slightest idea of anything in the shape of a joke, and if they do afterwards discover that anything has been told them with this intent, it is set down as a falsehood. At all events it is a very high tribute to the character of the islanders. A man who speaks the truth is less likely to suspect others of falsehood.",39
279,Mr HIGGS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,That is why we hesitated when your side was charging us.,39
280,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"That , perhaps, is why questions are asked sometimes for three-quarters of an hour nowadays. The Deputy Administrator gets a salary of £450 per year. The Deputy Administrator was a Mr Murphy, in Sydney Captain Elliott, the Chief Magistrate, is, I think, about to retire, and Mr Murph y thin k it is to take his place at £ 6 0 0 . There is a Government medical officer with a salary of £200 and quarters, and the right of private practice. Dr Patton also receives £ 1 2 10s. a year for acting as Government auditor. There are teachers of schools, &c. It will be seen that there is not a big staff. As regards the legislation that has been passed, I went through the documents and found that about sixty-four Orders in Council have been issued. They deal with such matters as Customs, registration of titles, births, marriages, and deaths, commons and public reserves, liquor permits, pasturage, enclosure of lands, extirpation of noxious weeds, and public schools.",39

282,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"No n e ; it is a model place in many respects. I think I would weary honourable members by mentioning the jurisdiction of the Court. There is a provision that a question affecting land cannot be finally dealt with by the Chief Magistrate, whose jurisdiction otherwise is fairl y wide.",39
283,Mr ARTHUR,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Who deals with it?,39
284,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"It must be dealt with by the Governor on report. As a matter of fact, the appeal provision is that, if there is an appeal-and that lies in all cases where £30 in value is involved-the appeal is sent by a sort of case stated to the Governor, who nominates some one to hear it , probably one of the Judges in New South Wales. The Bill contains a provision vesting jurisdiction in the High Court, and doubtless all these cases will go before the High Court or, if necessary, some other Judge appointed by the Executive. The question of land title would be dealt with similarly by the Governor. He would get his advice from the Judges on the matter.",39
285,Mr ARTHUR,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I suppose there is very little litigation! Mr Glynn"" - Ver y little, I think. There may not be the same necessity for lawyers there as here. The Ten Commandments were not created for that purpose-onl y on account of the prevalence of sin. As regards the lands, the leases are for twenty-eight years, subject to renewal under certain conditions. No one can hold more than 25 acres for cultivation and grazing unless the Governor, in special circumstances, permits that to be done. And there are provisions against aggregation beyond the declared area. There is a provision- I have not been able to find the Order in Council-that every person after a residence of six months must pay a tax of £ 3 to the Council or do fifteen days' work on the roads. As regards the liquor Ordinance, lionorable members may wish, perhaps, to take some guidance from it . Regulations were issued on the 21st September, 1904, as follow2. All beer, wines, and spirits landed on any part of Norfolk Island shall be consigned to, or to the care of, the Chief Magistrate, and will, on landing, be taken possession of by him, and will not be issued by him except in pursuance of a permit. 3. Permits will be granted either for the supply of liquor to be issued by the Chief Magistrate on demand by the holder of the permit, or for the periodical supply of liquor to be so issued in small quantities to such holder for a period not exceeding one month. 5. Permits to the Melanesian Mission and to the Cable Station will be granted only on the condition that liquor shall not be supplied to any person not being a member of the mission, or permanently employed in the mission or cable station. The heads of the mission and of the cable station respectively will be responsible for the observance of this regulation. 8. Permits to persons other than the Melanesian Mission or Cable Station will only be granted on and in accordance with a certificate signed by the Government Medical Officer in charge that the liquor is required for medical purposes only, in case of sickness, old age, or other debility. It practically means the existence of a teetotal island, so far as I can see. A good deal of development may have to take place.",40
286,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"There able harbour yet, is there 1",40
287,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"No . I do not know what has been done since the report of 1903, which laid stress on that matter. Two wharfs have been put up, but I do not think that the wharf and jetty contemplated then has been erected. There has been some, but there seems still to be a good deal of work to be done in the way of keeping down noxious weeds, and in general development, so as to encourage the slight use made of the soil; but the people have been hampered by the fact that they could not compete with Australia under the - duties that obtained, and I hope that by allowing the produce to come in free we shall remove the chief obstacle to commercial development. As regards the Bill, there is very little that I need tell honourable members. It provides for acceptance of Norfolk Island as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth, as provided in clause 3. That will take place when the Order in Council has been issued by the Imperial Government and a proclamation accordingly made. The existing laws will continue until modified or repealed. There is a provision for a jurisdiction in the High Court, which I have also mentioned.",40
288,Mr ARTHUR,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,What Acts do the Government propose to extend to the island ?,40
289,Mr GLYNN,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"That , I think, is a matter to be dealt with in an administration Bill ; at any rate, I do not see any necessity to enter upon it at present. The existing Acts are the Imperial Acts adopted, together with some of the State of New South Wales, supplemented by sixty-four Orders in Council. It will not be necessary to apply many of our Acts at present, though I must say that the people of Norfolk Island have kept fairly up to date in some respects. They have adopted our Copyright Act of 1911, and have also passed legislation for the protection of young girls. I have already dealt with the chief provisions of the Bill excepting clause 15, which provides that duties of Customs shall not be chargeable on goods imported into Australia from Norfolk Island if the goods are the produce or manufacture of the island, are shipped direct to Australia, and are not goods which, if manufactured or produced in Australia, would be subject to is no suitany duty of Excise. As to the reason for taking over the island, one is ample, namely, that it was an obligation contemplated in 1897, when the Order in Council was passed placing the island under New South Wales. Then the island is an important repeating station of the Pacific Cable Board, and the operations of the cable we hope will extend when the Panama Canal is opened.",40

TniRD READING . - Motion (by Sir JOHN FORREST) proposed - That this Bill be now read a third time.",41
303,Mr FENTON,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Maribyrnong) [6.8] Has the Treasurer, at any time during his long parliamentary career, and especially in this House, ever taken into consideration the desirability of altering the date for the ending of the financial year ? I unof derstand that in Great Britain , the financial year finishes on the 31st March; but, apparently, the Commonwealth has simply followed the lead of the States in ending the year on the 30th June, which, in my judgment, is a very awkward time. It is the coldest time of the year, when employment generally is very slack. U n of fortunately, State Treasurers, and some Federal Treasurers, show a great desire, the close of the financial year, to operations, and to suggest that applications for money for public works remade by heads of Departments should be held over until the new year. This means great delay, for, before money can be made available in the new year, two or three months may elapse, during which time there is considerable want of employment. Under the circumstances, I think the Treasurer might consider the feasibility altering the date, because it so happens that private employers seem inclined take the cue from the Government, and also curtail operations. I understand that the Treasurer has some further informato tion to impart to us on the t h i rd reading of this Bill , and we know that he usually gives us the fullest information possible in regard to financial measures of which he may be in charge. When the surer came into office, towards the close of the last financial year, there was a surplus in prospect; and I that he himself gave orders that all possible accounts should be paid prior to the 30th June. I say that, not so much by tion way of criticism, as to show how someing times, even for party political purposes, it is desirable to have as big a surplus possible, while on other occasions it may be desirable to limi t the surplus. I honourable gentleman had been in office all the time, and knew there was the possibility of a fine surplus, he might, June. under the circumstances, have felt in clined to request the heads of Departwere ments and others to wait unti had closed for the money they required. There is too much of a desire on the part of Treasurers, both State and Commoncan wealth, to show what wonderful finantime ciers they are by finishing with as big surplus as possible; but this often entails considerable hardship. In the large numbers of men are thrown out of employment at the coldest and most severe time of the year, and an alteration of the date would obviate considerable distress. My own opinion is that would be most advantageous to observe the calendar year, and finish on the 31st December, when the weather is more obtain genial, and employment, as a rule, plentimoney. f u l . Our harvests are then being reaped and garnered, and there is much other to pay. work of the kind that can be carried on only in the fine months.",41

If the financial year closed on 31st March, to there would be no reason why we should not meet in A p r i l , except the position created by the Constitution in regard the election of senators. But I am looking at this matter from the point of view of employment.

I did so with all reverence for his keen legal acumen. I full y expected that he would be able to remove the mysteries surrounding the subject in my mind. But after he had spoken I quite realized that if four lawyers had addressed themselves to the question instead of two I should have been, not merely mystified, but paralyzed. The Treasurer has a habit of looking over to this side of the House with a reproachf u l air as if we were of the moleskin pants, the flannel shirts, and the slouch hats order, who represent the views of the multitude, understand nothing about finance, and therefore are not competent to discuss the merits and demerits of a Bill of tffis character. I should like to remind the right honourable gentleman that there are none in this community who understand more about finance than those who have been reared by a mother who has had to spend the wages of a toiler. There are no greater financiers than the wives of the workers, who are practised in making thirty shillings go as far as two pounds will go in the hands of others. We have a practical acquaintance with finance that is not enjoyed by honourable members opposite. The Treasurer has tried to make it appear that to embody provisions regarding a Supply and Tender Board in an A u d it Bill is quite consistent with ordinThe ary usage. I can only say that I am sorry that, having had time since last week to reflect, the Treasurer has not had the wisdom to withdraw the Supply and Tender Board clauses from the Bill . He would be wise even now to apprehend the responsibilities of his position, and to realise that by forcing the Bill through he will be making a serious mistake. What makes it worse, the Supply and Tender Board is to be established by regulation. Honourable members know what that means. We all know that departmental regulations are poured in upon us by the hundred. To read them all is more of a task than it would be to follow Jack JohnIf son through his peregrinations in the fistic world, or the Prime Minister in his perambulations through the country when he Externalis denouncing this party for wasting time on non-contentious measures. This Bill non-contentious! Does any member of this House think that it is ? To put provisions regarding a Supply and Tender Board in an A u d it Bill is a departure from the custom and usage of Parliament throughout the British Empire. It is our duty as the watch-dogs of the people to be on the alert and to protect their interests in matters of finance. The Treasurer professes that the Bill is only required to enable him to tide over a time of difficulty which may arise when Parliament is not in session. But he has not told us whether he_ wants fco use the power next year. Is it possible that the right honourable gentleman has some premonition of disaster threatening his occupancy of his present noble position ? Surely he does not imagine that next July it will be necessary for him fco get Supply in order to enable him to carry on t ill August. Surely this is not a covert move to protect his party and keep it longer in recess than the country would wish ? I see the .Prime Minister sitting there, cool, calm, and collected. He has been recently charging the Labour party with obstructing legitimate, business. If he had a shred of conscience left he would apologize. Now the honourable gentleman is leaving the chamber. There is one thing that always marks the course of a man who has not the courage to face his opponents. As soon as he is confronted with them he turns tail. The Prime M in ister goes out and leaves the Treasurer, the weak man of the Ministry, to bear the brunt of the battle.

The Postmaster General must have been warned by telepathy, and informed his chief. However, I am glad to see the honourable member for Parkes here, because, although he has never known it , I have knelt invisibly at his foot-stool, studying the words of wisdom that fell from him on questions of finance, and I thought, when this measure came before the House, that my education pect would be advanced a further step; but have waited in vain for his pearls of of this character. wisdom. He has protested time and again against legislation by regulation, but he sits still as a statue. What has him into silence? l f there was one who might have been expected to assert himself, it was the lionorable. member. I have always felt that when I failed he would succeed; but now we listen in vain for his utterances. Is the Treasurer prepared to remove what is objectionable from the Bill ?",46

359,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"The Treasurer has grown callous to the welfare of the people. Nothing but callousness could produce such a characteristic as we see in the Treasurer to-night. Will he tell me who are to constitute the Tender and Supply Board; will he give me an insight into the personnel of the board; will he say whether auy outside persons are to be appointed, or whether it is to Be composed of public servants or not? Not a word will he say. That is the sort of treatment we get when we plead for information. We are trying to solve the problems of this community, to understand the provisions of the measure, and to ascertain in - what is in the mind of the Treasurer, but a corkscrew will not draw the information out of him. I do not know whether he is looking for the information or not, but I hope that he will find it very shortly, as I am getting tired of appealing to him. In my judgment the Government has started off in a manner which is destined to overwhelm it . An y Government that begins by resorting to legislation by regulation is foredoomed. If the Treasurer would only hearken to the words of wisdom which fell from the honourable member for Capricornia, the pleading way in which he put his case, and the logical manner in which he represented the equities of this proposal, he would announce to the House, I feel sure, that he intended to get this Bill amended in another place.",46

I would not ask my worse enemy to submit to a proceeding of that kind. I have too much respect for the Treasurer, even though he is fathering a piece of legislation which I would not like to father, to ask him to withdraw it . He takes my remarks quite calmly. The country may go, the finances may go, and the Auditor General may take control of everything. Here is a Bill which hands over to that officer, not only the right to audit the public accounts, and give a true representation of the finances, but also the right to regulate the purchase of all supplies for the Commonwealth, and their distribution through ihe different Departments. Here is a man who, while on the one hand he is to be charged with the duty of directing the way in which' purchases shall be made, stores be issued and checked, has to audit that which he directs. What au anomalous position that is! The Treasurer is not acting fairly to the Auditor General. I have met that officer. He is only an Auditor-General; he knows nothing about anything else; he has devoted his whole life to the question of auditing. When it is proposed to hand over to a specialist a foreign duty, of which he knows nothing, there is a danger to the community. It is not fair to the Auditor-General to tell him that he is to be "" boss "" over the purchasing of stores, the distributing of them, the checking of the audit, and the analyzing of the provisions of this great measure. I ask the Treasurer, out of his humanitarian sympathy, to have a little thought for that officer. Has the Auditor-General in dorsed this Bill as the head of the Electoral Department has agreed with every provision in the Electoral Bill ?' Has this Bil l been drawn by the Auditor-General as the Electoral Bill has been drawn by the electoral officers, according to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs? If the Auditor-General has told the Treasurer that this measure is necessary, he must have been not quite in his right mind, because he is taking upon himself a responsibility too great for any man, or dozen of men, to be charged with. I want the Treasurer to think over this matter. In days gone by, I have appealed to him, and he has not only listened, but paid attention. been open to conviction at times.",47

Has it become a disease with the Prime M i nister to ever go on prating about the action of the Opposition in that regard ? The Treasurer may well look at me. I know that he does not agree with the Prime Minister in leaving his seat in the chamber and shirking the responsibility which is his. I know that the right honourable member is quite prepared to carry the whole load on his broad shoulders; but I do not want him to bear a load which he is not entitled to carry.",47

Through you, sir, may I make one final appeal to the Treasurer before he commits this act irrevocably? May I ask that he should retrace his steps, and that a Bill of this character should be put into the waste-paper basket at once, and another measure prepared more in accordance with the necessities of the times ? If he cannot for shame's sake consent to back down at this stage, will he consider the advisability of asking another place to cut out the objectionable clauses, to t r i m the measure in such a way that it will be acceptable to the people ? Will he do credit to the Government, or will he allow the Government to go down to posterity denounced as one that had endorsed, when in Opposition, the principle of legislation by regulation? W it h all seriousness, I say that this is one of the most perplexing problems that have ever been offered for consideration by honourable members, and it behoves every honourable member on this side to do his duty. He has I am unable, apparently, to move the Treasurer. 1 know that I am feeble. I realise that my appeal is not strong enough; but there are on this side honourable members who can appeal with tears in their eyes which will move the Treasurer to submit.

I am positive that the Whip would not be here but for an inspiration from the Prime Minister, to indicate to the Treasurer that he would be wise in backing down, even at this late hour. Whilst the visitors from the Mother of Parliaments are in this State, in the name of all that is holy, I ask the Treasurer not to tempt them to condemn us by the action which he is perpetrating here to-night. Think what they will convey to the Old Country when they find that the Treasurer is prepared to foist upon this Parliament a measure for the auditing of the public accounts which will enable a Supply and Tender Board to be created ! Why, sir, the members of the House of Commons here will feel that we are in our infancy or dotage; but, however they feel, I appeal to the Treasurer to hide the Bill from their sight, not to allow this discussion to come to the ears of men who belong to the Mother of Parliaments. Let us all hold our reputation as men of common sense, who understand what sort of legislation should be enacted in this country. My constituents do not, and never will, understand the Treasurer, but they understand their representative, and when they read of my appeal made here tonight to the Prime Minister and Treasurer, they will say, kind of men are these who could withstand the appeal of our member?""

We have had three different explanations-on e from the Treasurer, one from the Prime Minister, and one from the Attorney-General-and we find one gentleman saying that the Government were not going to make use of this clause, the other saying that they might do so, and the third saying that they would. I do not know how this clause will be regarded and treated by another place; but, at any rate, it ought to be enacted in another Bill . I was very glad to hear the Treasurer say the other evening that it was impossible to spend a penny without the supervision of the Auditor-General. 1I have informed .the honourable member for Gippsland that I intended to refer further to his utterances in this connection, and to show whether or not this or any other Ministry have handled the of money of the country in a way that it should not be handled.

The honourable member for Gippsland, the other night, said that upthe quotations I read were from a newspaper which was practically a Labour paper, and that they were not reliable.

In the issue of 12th May this year the Argus thus reports the honourable member for Gippsland, at Mirboo North, speaking on the BudgetIn that there was an item of £90,000 for contingencies and £50,000 for miscellaneous expenses. What was the difference between those two items? Altogether there was £4,000,000 spent for which there was absolutely no information given. n That is absolutely incorrect, because every and penny must be accounted for to the We have recently had a two Supply Bills before us, and the accercounts for every penny of the contingency and miscellaneous expenditure provided in those Supply Bills must go through an the Auditor-General's Department. The first statement. I made was that the honourable member for Gippsland saidMr Bennett said he would challenge any one to say he made a different statement at Swan Reach to what he did at Bairnsdale, and quoted figures showing items of expenditure totalling £4,000,000 for which there was no adequate return",48

What was the expenditure for, and where did it go to? Six persons had signed one letter, and he maintained that if they had been able to grasp and remember the item they challenged they would be able to remember all the figures he quoted. Instead, they merely said "" thousands of pounds here"" and "" thousands there."" They evidently had not grasped the figures. INTERJECTOR - You mentioned thousands.",49

382,Mr TUDOR,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I do not know whether that is so or not. The honourable memought ber for Gippsland is thus reportedMr Bennett then referred to the extravagance of the Labour party. He quoted the following items from the 1912 Budget :-Item s tingencies, £1,090,000; items of miscellaneous, £50,000; sixty-six items of petty cash, the sums trick. ranging from £ 2 to £6,000, making a total of £45,000. A new item was the Prime ister's Department, and that cost £50,000, another new one, items towards cost, totalled £1,000,000. In connection with these figures, the Auditor-General complained that the balance sheet only came before him nine months after it was due, and the time then at his disposal did not permit of him going f u l ly into the items. The people were entitled to know what became of this money-ho w it was used. The Auditor-General has never said that the items only came before him nine months afterwards; what he did say, as the Prime Minister quoted, was, that, on this occasion, Parliament was not in session when he presented his report. The first report of the Auditor-General, for the year ending 30th June, 1901, was presented on 25th May, 1903, a year and eleven months after the expenditure. The second report of the Auditor-General war presented after a similar interval. I have taken the trouble to look up .the dates on which the Auditor General's reports have, been presented; and all the reports, with two exceptions, have been presented, either on the last day of sitting in the session, or the day before, and only on one occasion has the report been presented in time to have any discussion upon it .

I wish to quote a letter from the South Gippsland Slwre Echo, published last week, a copy of which has been sent to me by an unknown correspondent. The letter contained the followingThat Mr Bennett has had the audacity deny that he ever uttered statements made four months ago is not a very high compliment to the electors of Gippsland, and is serious reflection on the conductors of and respected newspaper published at Yarram, the Standard, which reports him as having said:-""Who received this sum no one knows; it amounts to over £3,000,000 sterling."" Mr Bennett deny the accuracy of the Standard report, and, if he does, did he issue a tion of it in the press prior to May 31st? had plenty of time to do so, but I have yet to learn that he did. Tf, however, any exists of the accuracy of the Standard report, let it be dispelled at once. I have before the transcript of a report taken of Mr Bennett's speech at Meeniyan, only a few weeks prior to the election, in which he is reported to said :- "" Altogether, a sum of over three lion pounds has been spent, and no one knows where the money has gone."" The honourable member proceeded :- "" If the directors of a butter factory or a bacon factory had done thing like that they would be prosecuted sent to prison.""",50

I take the word of the Treasurer that every penny spent, from the inception of Federation until today, has been accounted for to the Auditor-General. When, for political purposes, a man tries from the public platform to make his hearers believe that millions have been spent by the party in power in a way for which there is no warrant-that they have practically taken the money out of the Treasury and used it for some unauthorized purpose-h e must know that he is stating that which is absolutely false, because every' penny must be, and has been, accounted for. If the honourable member did make this statement, that £3,000,000 had disappeared, and that if members of the Ministry of that day had been directors of a butter or bacon factory, they would have been prosecuted and gaoled, he was stating that which is absolutely inaccurate. Every penny has been accounted for. I rose mainly to reto fute this statement, because the people of only Australia have a right to know that, no a very matter what party is in power, every an old penny of public expenditure must be audited by the Auditor-General. I am as bitterly opposed to the present Ministry Does as they were to the late Administration. They were anxious to get us out of office, correcand we are anxious to turn them out.

When doubt statements such as those I have read are made and are scattered broadcast-state me ments that a set of Administrators are alleged to bave made away with millions have of public funds-w e may expect to find milthe people saying of Australia that which is said of other countries. It is when the fight is hot, and wild statements are anymade, that we are in duty bound to step and forward and to try to protect the honour of every m a i in public life. I think that Attorney-General, bitterly as he may oppose us, and bitterly as we fight him, will credit the late Administration with absolute honesty. I am sure that he would not say, either inside or outside this House, that a penny of public money had ever been spent by any Administration in respect of which an accurate account had not been kept and audited by the Auditor-General.

Both sides of the House are anxious that a Supply and Tender Board shall be established at the earliest moment, so that proper control may be exercised, over the purchase and distribution of supplies. But the Government, in tacking on such a provision to the Audi t Bill , gave rise to the impression that the Auditor-General would have something to do other than the mere auditing of public accounts in relation to this board.

If there is one thing more than another against which this House should protect itself it is legislation by regulation.

431,Sir JOHN FORREST,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,The late Minister sent out hundreds of regulations under the Defence Act.,53
432,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I cannot justify what has been done by others. Hundreds of regulations are issued every year, and I do not think they are read by a solitary member of Parliament, except by the Ministerial heads who are responsible for them. It is one of the faults of our parliamentary system that we allow so much to be done by regulation. I admit that there are some things which cannot be very well controlled by Parliament. The Government should have power to make regulations in such cases; but when we can give a clear idea of what we want, as in this case, it is not wise to provide for doing it by regulation. Under the circumstances, I enter my protest against the third reading of the Bill .",53
433,Sir JOHN FORREST,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Swan-Trea surer) [9.18] - All the arguments that we have heard to-night, .with the exception of a few observations from the honourable member for Maribyrnong, have been stated before, and I do not propose to allude to them again. In regard to what the honourable member for Maribyrnong said, I quite recognise that our system is not perfect, and that the Estimates and the Appropriation Act are passed too late in the year. But we have not been able to overcome that difficulty up to the present; indeed, difficulties will arise whatever we do. If we followed the honourable member's advice, and terminated the financial year in March, we might have the Estimates brought before Parliament at the beginning of July. But, even then, Parliament would be no nearer to them than it is now. The financial year would be nearly half over before the Appropriation Act was passed.",53
434,Mr FENTON,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,The House could then meet earlier.,53
435,Sir JOHN FORREST,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"The object is to bring the finances before Parliament as soon as possible, but whatever we do there is a difficulty in the way. When I first entered Parliament in Western Australia, the financial year ended on the 31st December. Parliament used to meet in the middle of the year. The Treasurer had [47]- 2 to estimate the revenue, not only for the remainder of the financial year in which the Budget was delivered, but for the whole of the coming financial year. That is to say, he had to estimate the revenue for nearly eighteen months. That waa very inconvenient. It is necessary thafi the Treasurer should know the total amount of revenue and expenditure for the past financial year when estimating for the next financial year. I admit that the Commonwealth system is inconvenient from the Treasury and departmental bookkeeping point of view, because the half year has gone before the final appropriation takes place. But I am not prepared at the present moment to say that the limits of the financial year should be altered. All the States are in the same position. Their financial year ends on the 30th June. It would be inconvenient if the Commonwealth's financial year ended on a different date from that of the States. I do not think that a Treasurer would deliberately hold back accounts from payment towards the end of the financial year for the purpose of making the finances look better. He could not hide what he was doing from the officers of the Department, and it would soon be apparent to any one examining the accounts, and especially to the Auditor-General. The public creditor would complain that he was doing it for political purposes. The law, as well as the usual custom, is that all accounts that are ready for payment on the 30th June shall be paid then. 1 do not recall any case in which that has not been done. If the revenue of the year is falling off, or is not coming in as anticipated, care is taken not to commence works as early as might otherwise be done, in order that the whole of the expenditure on those works might not fall due within the financial year. That might even be done when works had been authorized by Parliament. Indeed, it is quite right that a Treasurer should not embark on works, although he may have a vote of Parliament for them, unless he can see his way to pay for them. T have myself, as a State Treasurer, delayed works because the revenue was not coming in satisfactorily. A f t e r all, the management of the finances of a country is a business affair. A Treasurer should manage the finances as he would manage his own affairs. He should not spend money which he has noli got, and should not authorize unless he can see his way to meet it. From that point of view, to delay works is perfectly straightforward, and there is no subterfuge about it. Within my own experience as Federal Treasurer, we were short of money in the year 1909-10, owing to the introduction of old-age In other years we have always had enough money. There was always a balance to spare out of the one-fourth Customs and Excise revenue which, under the Braddon section, we were permitted to retain for Commonwealth purposes; and we always returned to the States more than we were compelled to return. The general desire at that time was to assist the States as much as possible. But a change came over the spirit of the dream. Afterwards all that was available was appropriated. the year when the old-age pensions were introduced, the Government were placed in the position of not having quite enough money to meet engagements. arrangement was made by which the Commonwealth returned to the States 25s. per head of the population, that left the Treasurer with an immense additional revenue for Commonwealth purposes. I can see no such objections to fchis Bill as the honourable member for Kennedy sees. There is no objection to regulations for such a purpose. I have before me the regulations made under the Public Service Act of Victoria for the control of stores. board administers the matter. propose thab when necessary a board shall be established for the same purpose, and that the Auditor-General the same statutory power over stores as well as over funds. The Auditor-General has to audit the whole of the expenditure of the Commonwealth. extraordinary occasions, such as the impossibility of getting the voucher, the Auditor-General reports to the Treasurer and asks him fco allow the account to be passed without the voucher. I can see no reason why this power to make regulations for the purpose of the control of stores should not be contained in the Audit Act. Ifc is the power that is needed, and I do not care what Act provides the power. toria it is provided for in the Service Act. We propose to provide for it in the Audit Act. In any case, the Auditor-General will scrutinize affecting the control and issue of public Sir John Forrest. expenditure stores just as he scrutinizes accounts in regard to the expenditure of money. He will have no more power over this matter than he has over any other financial transaction of the Commonwealth. Every Treasurer has experienced inconvenience in meeting accounts which fall pensions. due at the beginning of the financial year. If Parliament were summoned to meet a month before the close of the financial year, there would be no need for this Bill . It has been urged, but I do not think seriously, that we desire to force the measure through the House. We have no such desire. Naturally, we wish to carry it ; but to suggest that we are particularly interested in that direction is not justified. Our one object is to make the machinery of governBut in ment run smoothly, not for our own advantage, but for the advantage of the Commonwealth. Question resolved in the affirmative. Then a new Bill read a thir d time. BUREAU OF AGRICULTURE BILL. and SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 5th September (vide page 937), on motion by Mr. JOSEPH COOKThat this Bill be now read a second time.",53
436,Mr RODGERS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"Wannon) [9.32] - I rise to support this measure with enthusiasm, and to compliment the GovernA ment upon its early introduction. AusHere we tralia is a land of production. I listened attentively to the remarks of the Prime Minister in moving the second reading shall have of the Bill , and I gathered that its object is, not to establish a costly Department which will be encumbered with demonstration work, but to develop the science of On rare, agriculture, and to place at the disposal of our primary producers the best world-wide information that it is possible to secure. It is a measure that brings us back to the genesis, so to speak, of the science of agriculture-to the work undertaken by that eminent man, Sir John Bennett Lawes, at his Rofchamsfcad Estate, some sixty years ago. Then the American States set to work. There, however, the position is rather different from that which In Vicobtains in Australia. The first effort in Public developing the science of agriculture in. the United States was undertaken by the Federation. Here, the first work in that accounts direction has been done by the various States. I wish to place on record my appreciation of the work which they have been able to perform with the limited funds at their disposal. I hope that there will be healthy co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth in this connection. I am certain that the Prime Minister was right when he said that the object of the Government was not to in vade the field which is at present being covered by the various State Agricultural Departments, but rather to widen the scope of the science of agriculture. The States, by reason of their financial position, are somewhat cramped in their efforts. The operation of each State is naturally circumscribed by financial considerations, so that, under their guidance, there can be neither the acquisition nor dissemination of knowledge that is possible under the Commonwealth. I take it that this Bill has two objects in view. the first place, it aims at increasing the production of Australia; and, secondly, at dealing with the pests diseases which are common to plant and animal life here. Take the production of wheat, for example. The most common pests which affect wheat are red-rust, flag-smut, ball-smut, takeall, white-heads, and the wheat grub. I may tell honourable members that I have had a recent experience of the ravages of the wheat grub. It was my bad fortune, on returning home about a fortnight ago, to find that I had lost about 300 acres of self-sown wheat through the depredations of this grub. My experience is not a singular one. In many parts of the northern district this year the wheat crops have been very much affected by the grub, a specimen of which, by the way, I submitted to Mr French, the Entomologist, who describes it as the climbing cut worm. The ravages of this one pest alone may reduce the value of the production of Australia in one year by hundreds of thousands of pounds. I may be pardoned for mentioning, as an illustration of my good fortune, that, round a paddock of wheat adjacent to that to which I have referred, I seeded a chain of oats, which proved an effective barrier against the grub.",54
437,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Were the oats sown with that object in view?,55
438,Mr RODGERS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"My action, was prompted first by a desire to obtain clean seed oats, and secondly by the assurance of my neighbours that it formed an effective barrier to the grub. Here is the result of a practical effort. The fact that the grub did not thrive in the oat crop, when conveyed to the scientist, may lead to some valuable discoveries. I come now to f r u it cultivation. We all know that fruit-growers are subject to very many pests, and the last word in the methods to be adopted for their destruction has surely not been uttered. What the little lady-bird was able to do in America in connection with the scale there illustrates what may be accomplished if science has full play in Australia. I come now to the natural enemy of lucerne. In our district, it is a new arrival, which is known as the lucerne flea. If this little flea gets its way amongst the lucerne of Australia, very serious results will follow. Let me touch now upon the veterinary side of the project. Sheep, for example, In are affected with many diseases, notably fluke, tick, maggot-fly, lung-worm, anthrax, and foot-rot; while cattle are and attacked with pleuro, tick fever, contagious abortion, and tubercular trouble.",55

441,Mr HIGGS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Does the honourable member wish to rob the States of their powers ?,55
442,Mr RODGERS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"No . I wish rather to increase the opportunities of the States to cope more effectively with these diseases. The point which impresses me most in regard to the establishment of a Commonwealth Bureau of Agriculture is that Australia is competing with many other nations for land users and agriculturists. How are we to attract them to our shores ? By being in a position to put the best proposition before them. There is no patriotism about the man who is looking for the best spot to land upon. If we can increase the production of Australia in any one of the lines to which I have referred, we shall render good service to every one engaged upon the land here. We shall also do good work for others outside, including the supporters of my honourable friends opposite, in increasing employment and cheapening food supplies.",55
443,Mr HIGGS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,Where would the honourable member get his experts?,55
444,Mr RODGERS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"I would allow the Government to roam all over the world in search of the best brains possible, so that they might be put at the disposal of Australia. We shall have to establish a Department of Agriculture in connection with the development of the Northern Territory. Why not let the expense so incurred be of benefit to the whole of Australia? There should be proper co-operation between the State and Commonwealth authorities. The Prime Minister has wisely suggested that we should get the best experts in the world. I do not reflect in any way on the experts now in the service of the States. If the Commonwealth positions are sufficiently attractive, and they are suitable for the work, T hope that they will come to us.",55
445,Mr SHARPE,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,But where are you going to get the land ?,56
446,Mr RODGERS,NUMBER OF TRAINEES CONFINED IN BARRACKS OR,"The lands of Australia are reserved to the States by the Constitution, and we must co-operate with them. My idea is that the Commonwealth Department should acquire all possible knowledge, and disseminate it , using State organizations to demonstrate its value. I have already spoken informally to State officials, who welcome attempts to throw more light on the science of agriculture. Victoria, for example, should not be confined in matters of research or of demonstration to her own territory, and it seems to me that the widest investigation can be made by a Commonwealth Bureau. What a great advantage it would be Australia if the Bureau could provide our pastoralists with knowledge that would enable them to make two blades of grass grow where one grows now. It is not sufficient merely to kill the timber on a piece of land; much more can be done to improve its pastures. Cultivation and the use of manures may produce 2£ tons of fodder where the natural pasturage would not amount to more than 5 cwt. Surely honourable members see what a wide field there is for increasing our knowledge, and thus increasing our wealth in this and other directions. But as I did not know that the Bill would be called on to-night, and as the hour is getting late, I beg leave to continue my speech on another occasion. Leave granted; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT.

Not only did the Treasurer move an amendment in the Bill as the result of criticism, but after more criticism he moved a further amendment.

We will allow any measure of a like character, which is calculated to advance the interests of Australia, to go through with reasonable despatch; but, of course, if the Prime Minister, prompted by the Imperial Caesar I spoke of this evening, brings down contentious measures for the purpose of making political capital out of them, he will be met with full and free debate.
