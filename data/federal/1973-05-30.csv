0,NA,Unknown,shipping service and for this purpose to negotiate with the owners of the ship Straitsman which was specifically designed for this service. Mr Martin-Davis ?,90
1,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"Davies . I do not know whether he signed his name correctly or not. That is the name on the telegram. This telegram is an obligation to assist Captain Houfe in maintaining the King Island service. Captain Houfe built that ship specifically for the port of Grassy, recognising that the Commonwealth and the State had agreed to construct a new port. He invested a lot of money personally in having a new ship built in Cairns, Queensland, at a cost of $2m. He ran into a great number of difficulties right from the outset. Indeed, the ship was never given a real opportunity to prove itself. But that opportunity was to have been given to it by a Labor government. For our part, when we were in government, we said clearly that our obligation in respect of King Island would cease when we met the financial requirement to assist in the development of the port and that the State Government should then-and I agreed to this-dea l with the problems, if any emerged, in the shipping service. But the Opposition of the day, the Labor Party, sent that telegram clearly stating that it would pick up with this problem and would assist Captain Houfe in overcoming his difficulties. That is the real tragedy of this Bill. It has not gone unnoticed either. I notice that James V. Ramsden of the 'Financial Review' in an article on 27 March noticed it. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you with your kindly worldly ways would have noticed the change of face and the change of heart by the members of the Labor Party. You, sitting in that Chair, must be a sorry man to see such a policy breakdown, such a destructive act and the capacity of the Labor Party to turn its back on a clear commitment. You must be a broken man tonight, Sir, having to sit in that Chair and listen to this debate. I know that if you were not sitting in the Chair you would be on your feet demanding that the Labor Party's obligation be fulfilled. I am sorry that the honourable member for Braddon has let you down, Mr Deputy Speaker, when he was on your batting team but he did not in fact do what clearly you would have done. It seems to me a tragedy that you happen to be sitting in the chair at this point of time. come back to the article by James V. thought Ramsden. He said that there were a number of contradictory points about this whole affair. The first point he made is: Signed Ron Davis, MHR The present Labor Government promised unequivocally while in opposition that if it was elected to power the ANL would be directed to take over the King Island service and would negotiate with the owners of the Straitsman. The next point he made was: The ANL and the Federal Government are now most reluctant to honour this promise in view of tha losses which the ANL says it would make on the King Island-Stanley-Melbourne service of between $400,000 and $500,000 a year. Another point was: The ANL and Holyman-Union-Bulkships all say that if they had to undertake the service they would use the Straitsman for that service. I am sure you will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there are a number of contradictory points and it must be breaking your heart that you cannot speak on this Bill. I wonder that somebody has not offered to relieve you in the chair in order that you might speak on it. Mr Ramsden went on to say that the Minister for Transport had agreed that: The Straitsman was an uneconomic proposition for the King Island service. It surprises me that the Minister would be so unkind as to say that. As I recall the position, the Minister for Transport had not, in fact, seen the report given by the Australian National Line. He said so publicly himself. He had not seen the report given by the ANL on 29 March but by that time he had taken the decision not to use the 'Straitsman'. On 4 April he said that he would ask for a copy of the budget for the use of the 'Straitsman' in the service. But the decision had already been taken. It really horrifies me that the Minister should act in this unkindly way to Captain Houfe who developed this service and ran the 'King Islander' for so many years and replaced it with a ship specifically built for the new port. I am sure that you will agree with me, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is a matter of ratting on an undertaking-ratlin g on a promise. That the honourable member for Braddon should sit in this chamber and even mention Captain Houfe's name surprises me. Mr Davies- I did.",90
2,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"The honourable member did. It surprised me that he should mention it in I such a lighthearted way. I should have that he would have torn the Minister apart for breaking his promise but what did he say? He just said: 'The Minister has accepted it and we have to go along with that. Tut, tut! Bad luck Captain Houfe. You might go bankrupt over this but the Minister has accepted it and I don't care any longer about it and that's the end of it'. Mr Davies-Why does the honourable member not try to be fair?",90
3,Mr NIXON,Unknown,I am trying to be fair. The honourable member sent the telegram to Captain Houfe giving a specific undertaking yet he is not prepared to stand up and be counted on the issue. I am surprised both at him and the Minister turning their backs on Captain Houfe in this way.,91
4,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I would ask the honourable member to come back to the Bill which deals with a harbour installation.,91
5,Mr MXON,Unknown,"I shall respect your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. I submit that if the honourable member for Eden-Monaro can talk about people losing buttons off their coats and ing 5.5 gallons per day and the captains of ships running out of whisky my remarks are relevant to the Bill. With your knowledge of this question, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you would recognise that my remarks have been much more relevant to the Bill than those of the honourable member for Eden Monaro. I plead with you to let me make a passing reference to this subject. I felt that I should make this passing reference to this very serious subject which does not directly affect your constituents, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the constituents of the honourable member for Braddon. I point out that the honourable member for Braddon gave a clear undertaking to the people of Grassy and Captain Houfe that the Labor Party was going to do something. They have not done it. They have plainly broken their promise. This Bill provides money for the construction of a port to enable a ship to sail in and out of the harbour but the Government has turned, its back on the ship. From the second last news which I have received on this matterthere have been occasional changes-the Government was going to bring in an imported ship. But I understand that the Minister for Transport has seen the wisdom of my speech on this subject on an earlier occasion and he is now seeking an Australian ship for use on this service. Is that correct? Mr Charles Jones-The Standing Orders do not permit me to interject.",91
6,Mr NDXON,Unknown,I am seeking information. I understand that the Minister has now recognised his earlier mistake and that he is prepared to seek an Australian ship. Why does he not use the 'Straitsman* for this service? Why does he not table the report of the ANL which was produced months ago? Is this the open government that we hear so much about? I think that the ANL gave a report on this about the end of lanuary or February. Mr Charles Jones-The honourable member said a while ago that I did not have the report in March.,91
7,Mr NTXON,Unknown,The Minister said he did not. The report was to hand at the end of February. Why does not the Minister table the report so that we can see what the ANL has to say on this subject? Is it true that the ANL was not allowed to talk about tonnage or to really get down to a proper budget in regard to this service? That is the sort of information drinkwe want to find out. Captain Houfe's whole financial future has been jeopardised. The Minister is not being open about this matter yet honourable members opposite talk about open government. These are the questions that remain unanswered. I hope that the Minister will tonight put the propositions clearly to us as to what is going to be the future of the shipping service to King Island. Mr Whan-Are you for or against the harbour?,91
8,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"I helped to negotiate arrangements for this installation under the Bill which is before the House so do not tell me anything about it. What I want to know is what flows out of this Bill and the shipping service to King Island. There has been much disappointment for a number of people who are involved in this matter. We have not heard clearly what the facts are from the Minister. I hope that tonight he will take the opportunity, with your tolerance Mr Deputy Speaker, to give us a proper explanation. I know that you, Sir, are looking forward to it because I know that you have not heard it either. It is therefore important that the Minister for Transport should tell us clearly what is the future of the shipping service to King Island and what is happening in regard to the 'Straitsman'. How is Captain Houfe to be compensated for the money which he invested in the 'Straitsman'? With those few words may I say that I support the Bill?",91
9,Mr CHARLES JONES,Unknown,"in reply-After listening to that humorous speech by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) and taking into consideration that he has a reputation in this House of being a dour old campaigner with no humour in his soul, to sit and listen to his speech interspersed with giggles and laughter by him one can understand just why he made the speech that he did make. One could honestly believe that he was a new member in this House who had had nothing whatever to do with the 'Straitsman'. Yet when the Grassy port was mentioned the honourable member said: 'Oh, that was mine.' He poked out his chest. But what he did not do was to tell us what went on in the last 6 months of his reign as Minister for Shipping and Transport. He was in charge of that portfolio when Captain Houfe brought this ship into service on 1 May 1972 and in the 7 weeks in which it operated the company allegedly lost $90,000. What did the honourable member for Gippsland and the former Minister for Works, Senator Wright, do about this matter? I almost forgot about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) who also made one of his hypocritical speeches in this House tonight in which he criticised me for what I have allegedly not done in this matter. Yet they are the guilty men. You know that, Mr Deputy Speaker, and everyone else knows that they were the people who allowed",92
10,Mr GILES,Unknown,"I rise to order. I think there has been a clear implication that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been termed 'hypocritical' by the Minister. I would ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to demand a withdrawal of that remark.",92
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Duthie) That is against the Standing Orders.,92
12,Mr CHARLES JONES,Unknown,I did not call him a hypocrite. I said that his speech was hypocritical. Mr Keith Johnson- I heard quite distinctly what the Minister said. He said that the honourable member spoke in a hypocritical fashion.,92
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I think the Minister could rephrase that sentence.,92
14,Mr CHARLES JONES,Unknown,"I said it was a hypocritical speech. I do not think that is unparliamentary. Mr Nixon- I rise on a point of order. I have had some experience as to what is and what is not unparliamentary. Sir, may I suggest that if you look up the records I will send you a copy as I have been getting them from the Parliamentary Library lately-yo u will find that the word 'hypocritical' is unparliamentary. I suggest that the Minister should retract it. Mr Martin- I would like to speak to the point of order. There is some doubt as to whether or not the word 'hypocritical' is offensive. For a start it depends on who the person is to whom the word is addressed. Mr Donald Cameron-That is another reflection. Mr Martin- I have not made a reflection on anyone. Being a Christian I would never reflect on anyone. But my point in speaking to the point of order is this: Maybe the Minister did not mean what he said; maybe he meant to say 'pharisaical'. With your knowledge of the Scriptures, you may think it was afitdescription.",92
15,Mr CHARLES JONES,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, may I withdraw the remark because I want the debate to proceed?",92
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Yes .,92
17,Mr CHARLES JONES,Unknown,"I would like just to give a few facts on this matter. I just outlined to the House that the 'Straitsman' commenced operation on 1 May 1972. The honourable member for Gippsland and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were senior Ministers in the former Government which allowed this ship to be tied up. I would like to give the House a few more facts. On 16 June 1972 the Premier of Tasmania sought a grant of $300,000 from the Commonwealth. On 5 July the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon), rejected the request. Further approaches were made to the then Prime Minister and as late as 30 August the Prime Minister again rejected an approach for financial assistance for the Tasmanian Government to assist Captain Houfe. To listen to these 2 honourable members speak in this place in the way in which they have spoken tonight one could come to only one conclusion-that is, that they were completely innocent and had nothing whatever to do with the 'Straitsman'. One must come to the conclusion that they had nothing to do with the ship being taken off the run in the first place and that been most open hearted and generous in making untold grants to the company concerned and to the Tasmanian Government to maintain the vessel. The honourable member for Gippsland and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are critical of what I said late last year. It is perfectly true that my Party made a decision about what we would do. We decided that we would instruct the Australian National Line to enter into negotiations to purchase the 'Straitsman'. We said that we would require the ANL to reinstitute the service. But upon making inquiries on becoming the Government we found that the information which had been given to us and which came I believe from Captain Houfe was not factual information. So we had made a decision on information which was not factual. Therefore, I do not feel bound to honour something which was not based on correct information. When someone passes you incorrect information, are you bound to honour a decision which you made on that information that came from the person who is now complaining that we would not honour our promise? One of the early actions I took on becomother ing the Minister was to ask the ANL to give me the necessary information and to prepare for me a report so that I could make a decision as to what we would do with the 'Straitsman'. I did that on 18 December, the day that 1 was elected as a Minister. On January I received a report from the ANL which advised me that we would lose, on the present freight rates, $500,000 a year. ourable members should bear in mind that the ship only cost $1.2m. I questioned the officers. I kept the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) informed of what was happening. The honourable member for man' Gippsland said that the honourable member took no interest in this matter. I can assure him that the honourable member for Braddon has nearly worn out the carpet in my office from walking in and out wanting to know what was happening. He has never been off my back about this matter. The honourable member has carried out his responsibilities the member for Braddon in an endeavour to get a shipping service for King Island. To criticise him in any way is completely time unfounded and unfair because I know what he has done in regard to this matter. As have said, he has never been off my back to they had do something about this matter. 1 drew the attention of the honourable member for Braddon to the report of the Australian National Line when it was made available to me. The honourable member said it was not factual and that there was additional freight which he was certain would be available. I arranged for an officer of the ANL to go to Tasmania and to King Island with him and they were able to get together an additional $28,000 worth of freight. The report then was in this condition: If freights were left as they are at the moment we would have lost $500,000 a year on a ship that cost only $1.2m; if we increased freights to return us $100,000 that would bring the loss back to $400,000; and with the additional freight that the honourable member for Braddon was able to get, the final figure for the annual loss on this ship would have been $384,000. Facts contained in the ANL report show that the Labor Party had not been given the correct information from Captain Houfe. I am not able to table the report because it contains a lot of confidential commercial information which belongs to the ANL. I do not propose to make information concerning the general administration of the ANL available to every shipping company in Australia. My predecessor will know what the position is. Since then we have had numerous discussions. On 15 February I had discussion with Mr Batt, the Minister for Transport in Tas9 mania, and the Premier of Tasmania. Mr Batt wrote me a letter on 16 February. The Treasurer (Mr Crean) and I had discussions with Honboth him and the Premier of Tasmania on 20 March. We put a proposition to them. Let me underline the important point that the Premier and the 3 Ministers who attended this meeting unanimously agreed that the 'Straitswas not the most suitable vessel for this job. The Treasurer and I made an offer whereby Tasmania could charter a ship for a short time or buy it. We told them that we would provide the money by way of loan so that they could charter or buy the ship. We pointed out that we would accept responsibility for half of the loss. We were resigned as to the fact that there would be losses on the run. We then agreed that they could operate the ship for 2 years and at the end of that they would replace it with an Australian built ship. We said that we would again make I special loans available to them so that they could first of all purcnasc Jther a ship from overseas or a ship operating on the Australian coast and then build a ship in an Australian yard. That decision was reached on IS March. On 20 March there was further correspondence between the Premier of Tasmania and myself, as was the case on S April. So this matter has continued to move. But I was not and am not prepared to recommend to the Government that we should purchase the 'Straitsman' and lose the money which I have already outlined to the House. We on this side of the House have done our damnedest to make sure that King Island has a shipping service. As late as 25 May I again wrote to the Premier to inform him of the terms of an agreement which the Treasurer and I were prepared to recommend to Cabinet. We said that we would provide money by way of loan so that Tasmania could acquire a ship, whether it be a second hand Australian ship or one from overseas, and that if a ship from overseas was purchased they subsequently would have to build one in an Australian yard. We have done all we can to make sure that there is a viable shipping service. We forthwith. have not closed it down, as the honourable member for Gippsland and the Deputy a third time. Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) did when they were Ministers in the former Government. We have attempted to give the people a shipping service. We are still prepared to make money available to the State so that the people can have a shipping service.",92
18,Mr NIXON,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",94
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Duthie)Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,94
20,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"I do, on 3 counts. The Minister for Transport and Minister for Civil Aviation (Mr Charles Jones) said that I was laughing about the Bill. I was not laughing about the Bill; I was laughing about the interjections that were being made. I regard the BiH as being a very serious matter. That is the first count. The second count relates to the Minister's statement that the previous Government refused to provide $300,000 to assist Tasmania in providing a shipping service to King Island. In fact what happened was there was a Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting at the same time as the request cama in and Tasmania was so generously dealt with, as was acknowledged by the Premier of Tasmania, that there seemed to be no need to proceed with the earlier request. Finally, th© Minister claimed that I said that the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) had no interest in this matter. That is not what I said. I am fully aware of the honourable member's real interest in this matter. He not only has tramped the corridors of the Minister's office but also tramped my corridors when I was Minister for Shipping and Transport. I do not question his sincerity about or interest in this matter. But the fact remains- > this is the point I was making-that he is the man who was guilty of sending the telegram. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved Bill (on motion by Mr Charles Jones) read NA BILL 1973 Motion (by Mr Daly)-by leave- agreed to: That the resolution of the House this day making the second reading of the National Service Termination Bill 1973 an order of the day for the next day of sitting be rescinded and that the second reading of the Bill be made an order of the day fbr this sitting. Second Reading Debate resumed (vide page 2879).",94
21,Dr FORBES,NATIONAL SERVICE TERMINATION,"As this measure does no more than duplicate for public relations purposes action which has already been taken, the Opposition has no interest in it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Barnard) read a third time. PRICES JUSTIFICATION BILL 1973 Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Motion (by Mr Crean) agreed to: That the amendment of the Senate be taken into consideration in the Committee of the Whole with. In Committee Senate's amendmentAfter sub-clause (7) add the following sub-clauses: '(8) The Tribunal may, by resolution, authorize Chairman to exempt a specified company, or panies included in a specified class of companies, either generally or otherwise, from the application this section and may, by further resolution, authorize the Chairman to revoke such an exemption. '(9) An exemption, or the revocation of tion, under sub-section (8) shall be in writing and a copy of the exemption or revocation shall be published in the Gazette, and such an exemption or revocation takes effect on the date of publication of the copy. '(10) Evidence of an exemption, or of a of an exemption, under sub-section (8) may, in any legal proceedings, be given by the production of the Gazette purporting to contain a copy of the exemption or revocation.'.",94
22,Mr CREAN,NATIONAL SERVICE TERMINATION," I move: That the amendment be agreed to. In introducing this amendment in the Senate the Government took into account various representations it had received concerning the Prices lustification Bill. The Government recognised when it introduced the Bill that there could be room for improvement as the Bill broke new ground and we could not be certain that it would meet all eventualities. The amendment proposed will enable the Prices Justification Tribunal to exempt a company or companies, either generally or otherwise, from tije requirement to notify the Tribunal of proposed price increases and proposed prices for new products, and to refrain from implementing the proposed new prices for up to 21 days. The provision for exemption 'generally or otherwise' means that a company may be exempted in respect of all goods and services in which it deals, or in relation to particular goods or services or classes of goods or services. This will provide scope for overcoming a potential problem for companies such as department stores, and no doubt some manufacturers, selling many thousands of products of many kinds. There could be a large administrative problem for such companies and for the Tribunal if a price clearance had to be obtained for every one of the great number of items handled by such companies. There could also be problems if the companies had to refrain from putting the goods on sale until a price clearance was obtained from the Tribunal. There would be a particular problem in relation to perishable goods, such as meat, forthpoultry and vegetables, which are seasonal goods whose prices vary frequently, and which would be unsaleable if sales were delayed for up to 21 days. The proposed amendment would exempt the company or companies concerned the only from the requirement to notify new prices comand not implement them for 21 days. It would not exempt such companies from the Act as a of whole; the Tribunal would still have the power to inquire into their prices if it so wished. I an exempcommend the amendment to the Committee.",95
23,Mr LYNCH,NATIONAL SERVICE TERMINATION,"The Opposition's position in respect of this Bill has been made clear both in this House and in revocation the Senate. However, the Bill has been returned to this House with an amendment moved by the Government in the Senate which has been described in the early morning Press as a watering down of the Bill. In fact, the 'Australian' of this morning commented: The Federal Government yesterday introduced an amendment to its controversial Prices Justification Tribunal legislation, which will severely restrict the operation of the tribunal. In the view of the Opposition, the amendment is a manifest public confession by the Government of the inadequacy and precipitous nature of the Prices lustification Tribunal legislation which this Government has brought down. It is a proposal which we believe to be unreal and impracticable, establishing a huge and cumbersome bureaucracy which will deal with the symptom and not the real cause of inflation in this country. The amendment adds three new sub-clauses to clause 18 which deals with the notification to the Tribunal of proposed increases in prices of goods or services. The amendment is in fact one of the most extraordinary alterations which this Government could have made to a major legislative proposal. Quite simply, the Government proposes that the Tribunal, under its own authority, may exempt companies from the major requirement of this legislation which is that companies must provide notification of rises in the prices of thengoods or services. This of course is an enormous discretionary power when it is the clear intention of the legislation to require all companies with an annual turnover in excess of $20m to justify and make known alterations in their pricing structure. Moreover, this disthe cretionary power is to be exercised by the Tribunal without any apparent reference to the Government or in fact to the Parliament itself. The amendment arises simply because the Government has come to realise that the terms of the Bill introduced into this Parliaof ment are in a practical sense completely unworkable. The procedures outlined in the Bill are, of course, an administrative nightmare, far beyond the resources of the type Tribunal this Bill contemplates. We believe that a responsible Government would recogliable nise that this legislation, which was prepared in such great haste, ought to be withdrawn and given the degree of consideration which the Government believes it requires. It is in fact simply irresponsible to amend it by provision which provides for such wide-rangceived ing exemptions and in fact defeats the real purpose of the Bill. The amendment provides no guidelines as to the criteria which the bunal might adopt in providing exemptions under the Act, nor does it specify any particcourse, ular circumstances in which the Government would consider exemption to be warranted. The amendment will add to the already very considerable confusion felt by the busicapitulates ness community concerning the terms of what this Government regards as a significant The Opposition is fully aware that the operation of an effective Prices Justification Tribunal is a very substantial task. Any organisation which is established to monitor the pricing behaviour of such a substantial sector of economy must itself be correspondingly large. It has been estimated that to effectively operate the tribunal would require a staff in the region of 1,000 personnel. It is, of course, this realisproposed ation which no doubt in part has prompted the stem Government to amend the Bill in this very ence drastic fashion. The Government did make one concession to administrative sanity in preparon ing this Bill and that was tb exclude companies tribunals whose annual turnover does not exceed $20m. This provision, although a concession administrative reality, actively discriminates on the basis of size of enterprise and type of industry and not according to degree of responsibility for inflationary pressures. this provision provides a facile solution to dilemma which is facing this Government it makes a mockery of the intention of this which is to restrain inflation. This type arbitrary formula to exclude companies from provisions of the Bill could only be justified, in an economic sense, on the premise that the excluded companies bear a minor responsibility for inflationary pressures. This we know to be unsubstantiated by fact. The amendment moved by the Government suffers from the same fallacy. That is that the Tribunal may now exclude companies on the basis administrative expediency rather than proper economic criteria. Because the Tribunal has been granted the of substantial discretionary powers incorporated in the amendment to clause 18, it now becomes to all the undesirable aspects associated with political and industrial lobbying. The Opposition believes that the amendment represents a recognition by the Government of the unworkable nature of this Bill. We believe that a the Tribunal is an inadequate and miscondevice as a method of controlling inflationary forces. It represents in fact an abrogation of Government responsibility to Triface up to the critical nature of Australia's inflationary difficulties. No Government, of can command credibility in the field of economic management when it is unprepared to sedulously pursue non-inflationary fiscal and monetary poUcies, and no Government can command respect when it continually to the inflationary demands of the trade unions without consideration of the Bill. national interest. There has been widespread Press coverage of the fact that in recent days a major economic conference held in Adelaide has the drawn from those economists present very sharp criticism of the nature of this Bill. Tho 'Financial Review' reported on Friday 25 May: The Commonwealth Government's hopes that its Prices Justification Tribunal will help to inflation were scathingly criticised at a conferof professional economists in Adelaide yesterday. A succession of speakers commenting on a paper the problems and policies of price justification described the Tribunal as being, in effect, a useless paper tiger and a propaganda method of diverting attention from the real problems. to One leading economist at that conference described the Prices Justification Tribunal of this country as akin to 'putting the cart before the horse, and then shooting the horse'. The While Treasurer (Mr Crean) would be very interthe ested in a paper which was presented to that Bill conference by Mr V. C. Routley, the Prinof cipal Executive Officer of the Department of Labour. I indicate here that he obviously was attending that conference in a private capacity. The comments Mr Routley made in a very detailed paper on the problems of price justification tribunals and incomes policies generally would bear attention by the Government because they are exceedingly critical of what we believe to be the nature of this Bill. I will not speak at any greater length because I am to be followed by the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony). I know the Government would like to have this Bill through before the close of business and before we proceed with the adjournment. I indicate that it is Opposition policy not to oppose the Bill by a vote in this House because this is a Government which is digging itself deeper into the economic mire; and if that is its policy it will need to bear the full responsihelp bility of those programs in the future. The Bill and the amendment before the House are unreal and impracticable and will do nothing to solve the cause of inflation in this country.",95
24,Mr ANTHONY,NATIONAL SERVICE TERMINATION,"The Government has moved an amendment to clause 18 of the Bill involving an addition of 3 subclauses. The need for these amendments, I believe, is a reflection of the hasty, ill-thought out manner in which the legislation was drafted and now the Treasurer (Mr Crean) finds that the Prices Justification Bill as it presently stands is essentially unworkable. The proposed Tribunal would be liable to examine prices for a whole range of retail products and would have legal force to prevent retailers from creasing their prices for a period of 21 days. The amendments as designed give the Chairlation man of the Tribunal power to exempt a speciprice fied company, or companies included in a specified class of companies, from the requirefied ment to notify the Tribunal of proposed price increases. This amendment would seem to overis come some of the more obvious machinery defects of the Bill, although I suspect that it is still inherently defective. The companies referred to in the amendment are those which have a turnover exceeding $20m a year. ThereTreasurer fore the amendment is seen essentially as incomplete answer to the Opposition's objecticular tions to the machinery defects of the legislation. In my previous speech on the Bill I pointed out the absurdity of the requirement that vidual items handled by significant companies should be individually subjected to price examination by the Tribunal. This amendment abuse of power. is an incomplete answer to the objections I raised in my speech at the second reading stage. The Government is obviously intent on setting up the Tribunal as soon as possible. There is no need to emphasise the fact that its terms of reference will make it almost unworkable. I believe that the basic concept of the Tribunal is quite naive and nothing more than a rubber stamping operation.",97
25,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NATIONAL SERVICE TERMINATION, Order ! The Chair has been rather tolerant about the scope of the discussion on the amendment which is before the Committee.,97
26,Mr ANTHONY,NATIONAL SERVICE TERMINATION,"Than k you, Mr Chairman. I will not oppose this amendment on the assumption that any improvement at all will the measure before the House. However, it does not go nearly far enough in trying to overcome some of the grave anomalies it contains. I do not know how a large company that has a multitude of operations involving the pricing of the products it sells and possible increases in handling charges can have all such matters referred to a prices justification tribunal. It is so clumsy and cumbersome that it makes the operation almost impossible. The problems confronting the Tribunal in the practical application of its functions are probably but a faint and inadequate indication of the problems which will confront it in carrying out its terms of reference. However, my major misgivings relate to the indiscretionary power given to the chairman of the Tribunal in the proposed amendment. On the one hand the Tribunal is required by legisto investigate companies in respect of movements; on the other hand it is now given discretionary authority to exempt specicompanies from the requirements of the legislation. It could be that at this stage this the only practical way by which the Government can escape the consequences of the ill considered legislation but the legal implications are, to say the least, quite disquieting. I think it would be a useful safeguard if the were to give his approval when it an was required to allow exemption to a parcompany.

27,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order ! It being 10.15 p.m. in accordance with the order of the House 1 March, I propose the question: Tbat the House do now adjourn.",98
28,Mr FOX,ADJOURNMENT,"On 29 February last year the then Leader of the Opposition, who is now the Prime Minister (Mr transcript Whitlam), moved a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister of that time. The words of his motion included an accusation that the Prime Minister in answering questions withconference out notice had deliberately misled the House. During the course of the debate the then the Leader of the Opposition stated that he had directed to the Prime Minister a simple enough question requiring a straightforward answer. He complained that instead of giving a straightforward answer the Prime Minister had chosen to give a tortuous and smart-aleck reply. I share his dislike for smart-aleck replies. For that reason I do not appreciate the smart-aleck reply the Prime me in answer to a question which I directed to him on 15 May. It was surely a simple enough question requiring a straightforward and simple answer. I asked: Is the Prime Minister aware that last Wednesday's issue of the 'Canberra Times' carried a report Press conference which he held on the preceeding day? Is he aware that the report stated that, answer to a question directed to him about whether he had received any response from the Chinese ernment to his protest note on the nuclear tests, said that the protest to China was oral so there would be no written response? Is the Prime Minister aware that on last Wednesday's 'A.M.' program Dr Fitzgerald, Australia's Ambassador to China, that his predecessor, Mr Cotterill, lodged a note with the Chinese Assistant Minister? Is this another instance of the Prime Minister not being informed of actions taken by his Ministers or departmental officers on matters which are under direct control? That was a simple enough question requiring a straightforward answer, but the smart-aleck reply given to me by the Prime Minister was as follows: I did not read the newspaper account. I did not hear 'A.M.'. The reply certainly was not tortuous but undoubtedly it was a smart-aleck reply. The Prime Minister knew perfectly well what he had said at a Press conference on 8 May in answer to a question directed to him by a pressman. It was not necessary for him to read the report of the conference in the daily Press to know that he had stated unequivocally that the protest to China was oral and that for that reason he did not of expect a written response. I say that he did not need to read the newspaper report of what he said because he later issued a transcript of the entire Press conference. The relevant question and answer are stated in the issued by the Prime Minister's Department. The transcript states quite clearly that the protest to China was oral so that there would be no written response. The was held on Tuesday, 8 May, so that the Prime Minister no doubt would issue transcript a little later that day. As Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs he should have been aware that the Ambassador to China whom he appointed had stated in a radio interview that a protest note had been lodged with the Chinese Assistant Minister. If he were not aware that a note has been lodged he should have been so aware and that is the whole point of the question which I Minister gave directed to him. Later in the day on 15 May during question time in the Senate Senator Marriott addressed a question to Senator Willesee who represents the Prime Minister in the Senate. He asked of the whether the Australian Government had made a protest to the Chinese Government about in that country's nuclear atmospheric testing, Govwhether there had been a protest and whether he it had been verbal or written. Senator Willesee replied that a protest had been lodged and that it had taken the form of a letter from the stated Foreign Minister to the Chinese Foreign protest Minister. The Prime Minister, who is also Foreign Minister, must have written the letter his of protest himself. Yet, he chose to give me his the smart aleck reply that he did. This might be good enough for the honourable member for Werriwa but it is a long way from being good enough for the Prime Minister. However, it is in line with the misleading answers which he gave to a series of questions which had been directed to him and the Minister for Immigration (Mr Grassby) by the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair)questions regarding the proposed visit to Australia of Mr K. T. L i of Taiwan. On 3 May 1973 the honourable member for New England asked the Prime Minister: . . . on what terms and conditions will Mr K. T. Li be allowed to enter Australia in order to participate in this regional conference? The conference referred to was of the Pacific Basin Economic Council. The Prime Minister replied: He would undoubtedly be able to come to Australia under the same conditions as any other person from Taiwan, that is, in any unofficial capacity. Mr Li subsequently applied for a visa but his request was refused. On 10 May 1973, during question time, the honourable member for New England directed a question to the Minister for Immigration asking why Mr Li's request had been refused in view of the Prime Minister's assurance that provided he appUed in an unofficial capacity Mr Li would be issued with a visa. The Minister promised to make inquiries. On IS May 1973 the honourable member for New England again directed a question to the Prime Minister asking him how he reconciled his change of attitude with respect to the refusal to grant a visa to Mr Li. The Prime Minister's firm reply on 3 May was that Mr L i would be issued with a visa provided he came to Australia in an unofficial capacity. The Prime Minister, of course, by that time had received his orders from Peking and he sought to blame the honourable member for New England for, as the Prime Minister said, blowing Mr Li's cover. He must have known that the honourable member for New England blew Mr Li's cover- I am using the Prime Minister's words-in his original question. The Prime Minister's assurance that a visa would be issued to Mr Li, provided he came to Australia in an unofficial capacity, was given with the full knowledge that Mr Li was at that time Minister for Finance in Taiwan, because the honourable member for New England said so, and also with the knowledge that a reception had been given in this Parliament on the previous day to representatives from North Vietnam. As I said earlier this conduct might be good enough for the honourable member for Werriwa but it is far from good enough for the Prime Minister of Australia.",98
29,Mr MATHEWS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to say a word of thanks to the Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) and to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Bryant) for the expedition with which they acted in the matter of the health of Aboriginal children in East Gippsland, demonstrating that at least on the part of the Australian Government there is a readiness to recognise problems when they occur. The truth about the health of Aboriginal children in East Gippsland has begun to emerge despite the efforts of health authorities in Melbourne to suppress it. The Health Officer of the Tambo Shire, Dr H. M. L. Murray, revealed yesterday that in the East Gippsland hamlet of Nowa Nowa alone there are 16 children under the age of 11 who are infested with scabies. Of 5 of the children he examined yesterday he said: Two were so messy that I have not the faintest clue. Their skin was a mass of discharging sores. This is the condition which the Assistant Chief Health Officer of Victoria, Dr B. P. MCCloskey, regards as 'not a serious health problem but a minor health nuisance'. While Dr Murray was making his disclosures, Dr MCCloskey continued to insist that there was no health problem. He accused me of overdramatising the situation. He asserted that among the 54 students at Nowa Nowa there were only '2 confirmed cases of scabies and 5 doubtful cases'. I received today a copy of a letter sent on 27 May by one of the Aboriginal women to whom I was introduced at Nowa Nowa to a friend in my electorate. She wrote: I myself think the scabies are getting worse not better. My sister's family at Warragul are in a terrible state with the horrible skin disease. It's like a mange the children can't stop scratching. It's also at Bruthen, Bairnsdale and Lakes Entrance. If Dr MCCloskey is unable or unwilUng to recognise the gravity of the situation he should resign his high office in favour of someone who will take a less supine approach. The Assistant Chief Health Officer of Victoria should be giving more time to improving the health care delivery for which he is responsible and less to public controversies which are properly responsibilities of the Victorian Minister for Health and the Victorian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Controversy should not be something at which public servants play while public services decay. The Aboriginal people of East Gippsland have no faith left in health services provided by the Victorian Government. They regard officers of the Victorian Department of Health and of the Victorian Department of Aboriginal Affairs not, I am sorry to say, as friends but as enemies. I was told at Nowa Nowa: A woman had to take her S children to Bairnsdale to be immunised. She told the sister who was visiting that she had no car and couldn't afford the bus. The sister told her 'I'm sure you can hitch-hike'. I was also told: They have objected to the Save the Children Fund people de-lousing, worming and treating the scabies of children and also to them giving meals. I was also told: What we've got to do is to say that all responsibility for Aboriginal people should be taken by Canberra. Dr MCCloskey was quoted this morning in the Melbourne 'Age' as calling on the Federal Government to provide his Department with finance for which it asked on 6 April 'to appoint a medical officer as a health educator in the area'. He was quoted as saying: We asked for finance to provide a health educator through the State Department of Aboriginal to the Commonwealth Department about seven weeks ago, but we haven't even received an acknowledgment of the request. The finance to which Dr MCCloskey refers was requested to provide the car and salary for an officer who would operate not in East Gippsland alone but throughout Victoria. was requested not to provide the health care services for which a need so clearly exists to provide yet another health educator of sort already familiar to the Aboriginal people and rejected by them. It was requested not as a matter for immediate action but as a routine item in the 1973-74 finance program. It not ignored but rather made the subject discussions between the Australian Governknew ment Departments of Health and Aboriginal Affairs and their Victorian counterparts. I rise tonight, as I said at the outset, thank my colleagues the Minister for Health and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for action that has been taken already in the light of my request that Australian Government have medical staff should be sent as a matter of urgency to the East Gippsland area. The Assistant Director-General of the Department of Health, Dr W. A. Langsford, will visit Lake Tyers and neighbouring centres next debate week to inquire into the health of their Aboriginal citizens. At the request of Langsford, a medical officer of the Victorian Department of Health went to Nowa Nowa today to investigate the incidence of scabies among the children at the Nowa Nowa school and the Save the Children Fund kindergarten. I hope that this activity will lead before long to the establishment of the permanent medical centre through which alone an adequate standard of health care can be made available to the Aboriginal people of East Gippsland. I hope that it will lead to a situation in which scabies is something about which Aboriginal children may read but from which they will never suffer.",99
30,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight because this is probably the last opportunity on which I can say something in summary about the events of the past few months. We know that when this Government came to power it did many things by administrative action. Some of these were far-reaching things for which there was no mandate. Since that time there has been a gradual sense of disillusion coming over the community, partly because the truth was realised that this Government was under the control of outside Affairs forces. Some honourable members may have seen the appearance of the television program 'Federal File' last Sunday of a Mr Hartleyhe is a senior member of the Labor organisation-wh o quite openly boasted that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and the Government here would be compelled to do the It things which the trade union officials, unelected by anybody except their members, but told them to do and that they would decide the matters of the foreign policy of Australia. There has been disillusion also because of the veering to the left of the Government was which was not in the mandate it received of from the people and about which the people nothing. I am sure that the result of the Victorian election, which would be the pattern in other parts of Australia, measures the to amount of the popular disillusion with this Government, which is a temporary Govern the ment. It no longer has popular support. But tonight I want to refer to the things which happened inside the House and the way in which the House has been hustled by the Government. Bills have been going through in succession without proper debate in this House. Some of them have had no Committee at all because the guillotine has been applied to them. The Government has not Dr allowed them to be debated in Committee. My concern is not just with the number of Bills but with the importance of some of them. Far-reaching Bills such as the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the Pipeline Authority Bill, the Prices Justification Bill and the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill have been put through this House without Committee debate or with only very inadequate and incomplete Committee debate. This is an absolute scandal. Some of these Bills are very far reaching. Some of them have been very badly drafted. I am reminded of the line in Aristophanes in regard to the conduct of another man-it would be well known to honourable members iriBet vopovg wonep OKoXia yeypantUvovs, He churned out Acts of Parliament that am sounded like pop songs. eti'6ei vcuovs* toonep OKoXm yeypauuevoos*",100
31,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! I am not too sure prevarications. whether that is parliamentary.,101
32,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I may thought that your scholarship would adequate to meet that contingency.",101
33,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"No , it is not.",101
34,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,I can assure you that the line is one from Aristophanes and is therefore entirely in the best parliamentary tradition.,101
35,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I will take your word for that.,101
36,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"The concern is not incident just with the number of Bills but with the importance of the Bills. We have had a flood of legislation. One Bill was brought apparently for immediate passage. There is not only the question of Bills but also the question of bad faith in the House. HonourPrime able members may remember that I introdoing so. duced a private member's Bill. It should have been voted on on non-party lines if there was any good faith. But no, honourable memcountry, bers were not even allowed to read it. killed by a Caucus vote which had been predetermined by the Government. ernment says 'At least we are allowing a vote on your private member's Bill' when all it has done-eve n the Minister at the table obviously had not read it-is decide to kiU it. This is the kind of bad faith, hyprocrisy and pretence that is characteristic of the way in which Government runs the affairs of this chamber. Let me refer to the questions which the Prime Minister has answered, or failed to wer, at the table. A few moments ago the honourable member for Henty (Mr Fox) to detailed one of these instances. I suppose the polite thing to do is to caU the Prime Minister's repUes evasive. That is a polite word and, as you know, Mr Speaker, it is a parliamentary word. I will refrain, because of you, from calling them deUberate lies.",101
37,Dr FORBES,ADJOURNMENT,Blood y lies.,101
38,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"No , I cannot use the words I would Uke to use.",101
39,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! I heard that remark. Honourable members should contain themselves and not use such words.,101
40,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes , Mr Speaker. I telling you that I wiU not describe them as Ues because that would be unparliamentary. But if they had occurred outside this chamber I would describe them as outrageous lies and",101
41,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member call him a big fibber but he cannot call be quite him anything else in here.,101
42,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"He is a big man, at least in stature, and he is, as you say, a big fibber. I come now to the serious matter of the violation of pledges which have been given by the Prime Minister at that table. The Prime Minister broke his word to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) in regard to the amendment to the States Grants Bill. He did break his word. I heard it. I heard the at the table. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister is not a man of his word, and the country is now starting to understand in here, that it has elected",101
43,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable member is making a personal reflection on the Minister. I ask him to refrain from,101
44,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I will say that the now knowing what is the character It was of the Prime Minister, regrets",101
45,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! That is still a Yet the Govpersonal reflection.,101
46,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"The country is coming to regret what it has done in putting him into office. I will not go further than that out of respect for the Chair. But I think that the the result of the Victorian election shows the change of heart in the country. It is not just a question of the way in which this Parliament has been hustled in regard to the ansdebates that have been brought on and the inadequate consideration that has been given important Bills; there are also the sins of that omission, and they are very many. Most important matters have not been debated. I referred a moment ago to the new orientation of Australia's foreign policy to the left-left wards all the time. Yet there has not as yet been a major debate on foreign policy in thi? House. I am told that there is to be a token debate of an hour or two tomorrow. That not enough. It is only a token and it does not meet the realities of the situation. Then we have had all the brouhaha of the nuclear tests. That is fair enough but we want a debate in this House. The Government thinks that the matter is important enough send our Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) overseas to stir up the International Court of Justice, but there has not been a word mentioned in this House. It is important that this House should remain the centre of govmuch ernment. After all, the Government office because it is responsible to this House and has a majority in this House. But the Government has treated this House with conpurchase? structive contempt in this manner.",101
47,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,102
48,Mr BENNETT,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak on a matter of which, unfortunately, have personal knowledge. I suppose all of from time to time as members receive comfriend plaints from constituents regarding their lems as consumers with various firms, and do all that we can to assist those unfortunate constitutents. But it becomes difficult you yourself are involved. It is terribly diffiparts cult not to allow your own personal distwice, pleasure to make you unreasonable. I am that situation. However, since I have spoken widely around my electorate supporting plaints continue to come to light in relation to the firm with which I have experienced difficulties. In 1968 I had the good fortune to purchase a Volvo car which over the ensuing years did in excess of 120,000 miles without clutch problems, towing a heavy electoral caravan, towing a heavy trailer and towing other cars which had the misfortune to break down or become bogged on the Nullarbor. In fact, the car did 120,000 miles of solid, hard work with its original imported clutcb. However, all items eventually wear out. It was when the clutch wore out that a tragic error was made. The vehicle was given to a firm representing itself as experts in clutch and brake repairs. The cost, in excess of $130, was promptly paid and just as promptly, some 1,693 miles later, the replacement clutch failed. The firm conserve cerned, a Repco subsidiary, Carbon Brakes Ltd product. - of WA, gave a 3,000-mile guarantee, and subsequently the experts decided that the vehicle had been misused, thus causing the failure of the locally manufactured parts. The comis pany offered a concession on labour, parts, etc., of $70 to do the job again, but of course would give no assurance that the replacement part would not fail again. Thus some $200 was paid for what I would call a botch job to a vehicle that had proven that with original to imported parts it would return a tremendous mileage. So, of course, I do not intend to be caught twice. I will have the vehicle returned to its original design and have the repair done by the distributors of the vehicle at a higher figure, but at least I will be able holds to reach Canberra in the car. This is all right for me. What of the ordinary man in the street up to his neck in hire Mr Bourchier-He drives a Holden.",102
49,Mr BENNETT,ADJOURNMENT,"He may. What of the man who has a family to maintain and who needs transport for his work? He is at the I mercy of such people. When one talks around us one hears such comments as this: 'Yes, a had a job done there. It was satisfacprobtory for 8,000 miles, so it was out of warwe ranty. What could he do?' One also hears of the new and used car distributor who laughs when and says: 'They supplied us with so many that failed, and we had to do the job that we refused to pay them'. One in becomes quite rueful about not making inquiries about this firm earlier, believing its comadvertisement and being trapped. We can all be wise after the event. Some time ago when speaking on another matter I raised the need to register repair people, to exercise some form of control, because who can afford the legalities which are currently needed to retain redress? Only very few would risk throwing good money after bad. No doubt this aspect is traded on by these experts in fobbing people off. It is no good protecting these people with tariffs if their protection is to be misused to fleece the pubgood lic. If their product is not as good as the original, let them be honest and admit it to the Tariff Board so that steps can be taken to ensure that a workable replacement is available at a similar cost to the customer until such time as they are able to ensure the durability of their parts and workmanship to prethe good name of the overall Australian But I repeat that the whole question of automotive repair and standards needs urgent review. As things stand now just about anyone who claims to be able to repair is able to open a business to repair. The unfortunate wno suffers from his mistakes is the consumer motorist. As I pointed out earlier, it is difficult not to become angry in these matters when personally affected but when one thinks of the people who are similarly caught, who perhaps do not have the resources to finance the achievement of justice in this type of problem it could well lead to the loss of vehicle through inability to meet both repair costs and repayments. But, more importantly, when firms such as these deal not only with clutches but also with brake systems such faila ures could well lead to tragedy if the braking systems were involved. The sooner that examination, registration and grading of repairers take place the sooner a step towards road safety will be taken.",102
50,Mr CORBETT,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to draw attention to a few matters that I feel should be ventilated. Firstly, refer to cash on delivery charges on articles sent through the Post Office. I do not know for how long the present rate of charges applied, and I do not suggest that it has changed in recent times. In other words I am not blaming the present Government for matter about which I am concerned but nevavailability ertheless it should be looked at. Since a royal commission is being conducted into the affairs of the Post Office, although evidence has closed I hope that the Postmaster-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) might look into the matter or perhaps even include it for considerwas ation by the royal commission. The case drawn to my attention involves order for 4 small special screws for a power drill. Their size was i inch by 7/32 inch, special thread. They were unobtainable in having Queensland. This is another matter about which I wish to speak. I regret that so often people have difficulty in getting parts for types of machinery. These small screws for a power drill were unobtainable. The agent offered to get them up from the arrived in Brisbane and were posted up to my constituent c.o.d. The actual cost of the screws was 24c. The c.o.d. charges that the committee. constituent had to pay when he received the screws were 72c. This seems a pretty severe charge to be placed on a small item which was so light that it required only a 7c stamp to mail it. Mr England-They put the screws on him.",103
51,Mr CORBETT,ADJOURNMENT,"That could well be. I know that there would be some cost related to registering this item and perhaps giving a receipt but it seems excessive to me that an item which cost 24c and which was posted in a very light packet which cost only 7c to post should attract a c.o.d. charge of 48c. I am pleased that the PostmasteM3eneral is in the House tonight. I put it to him that it is an excessive charge. We sometimes hear that the people in the cities are subsidising the people in the country. If the Post Office cannot make profit in providing a c.o.d. service at that rate I am wondering what it would charge to make a profit. I believe that it is a little excessive and I would be pleased to have that matter investigated. Another point to which 1 draw attention is the general availability of spare parts for tractors and farm machinery. I have mentioned this matter in the House previously. I When I mentioned it I put dealers on notice that if I were to get more complaints about modern machinery for which parts were not has available I would name the firms concerned in this House. This is a pretty drastic action to take because it would be adverse publicity the for such firms. I am not happy with the of parts for some tractors and farm machinery. I say again as a second warning that if firms are to provide machinery it is up to them to provide a fair and reasonable range of parts at consistent prices. Another complaint I received very recently about a big variation in the prices charged for similar parts. I draw attention to it because an this is one of the few ways in which people who feel that they are being victimised or excessively charged can have a chance of their voices heard. I know that a committee has been appointed to review prices but that would probably take a fair amount of time to come into operation. At any rate, I am all not going to wait for it. If my constituents are disadvantaged, as I feel they are, unreasonably in any way I am quite happy to ventilate South. They the matter in this House.",103
52,Mr HURFORD,ADJOURNMENT,It is a pretty efficient,103
53,Mr CORBETT,ADJOURNMENT,"The committee of which the honourable member will be chairman may be able to deal with these things; I mention that in passing. I will have a look at how the committee works and if it seems to be working satisfactorily I will be happy to make use of it. To give an example of the range in price and the very high increase that has occurred, I should like to cite just one case. The owner of a modern car of a popular make lost a hub cap which had to be replaced. He asked for a quote and the price given was $20 and some odd cents. A matter of only a week or two later a price was obtained from the same firm for the same type of hub cap and the price quoted was $30. It seems to me that the original price was fairly high anyway, but to think that it should be jumped up by that amount of money for that item seems again to be excessive. Perhaps I might keep the honourable member for Adelaide and his Committee busy with these sorts of complaints. The main reason I raise this is that I do not want to take any drastic action without giving some notice of it. I put all the people and firms concerned on notice that I certainly will be quite prepared to name them if I feel that there is any injustice being perpetrated. I want to see them keep their prices within reasonable limits. The other matter I want to raise tonight is a matter I have raised before, namely the Pike's Creek dam. I have mentioned this matter on a few occasions. The construction of this dam was an undertaking given by the previous Government. It was to be constructed in conjunction with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland. I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in the House about this matter not long ago. Incidentally, I did tell the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) that I would be speaking on this subject tonight. The Prime Minister said that he hoped to be bringing this matter to the Parliament. I do not want to be unkind in any way, but I am becoming very concerned about what I feel is undue delay in bringing this project to fruition or in having a decision made on it. The Minister for Northern Developmentthink he may have left the chamber, but I it quickly. noticed that he was here earlier-complaine d recently about the progress in regard to some water conservation project in which he was interested. He said that he was disappointed that further progress had not been made. Pike's Creek dam project had progressed quite far enough under the previous Government. I believe that the only reason legislation was not introduced io complete the project was that the previous Government was taking every care to see that a cost benefit analysis justified going on with the project. Dr Gun-It had a cost benefit analysis in 1970. Sir Reginald Swartz told me that by letter.",103
54,Mr CORBETT,ADJOURNMENT,"1 wonder how the honourable member who is interjecting would have felt when the Chowilla dam project was dropped and the Dartmouth project took precedence over it, if the Government had given an undertaking and had decided not to go on with it after the undertaking had been given? The 2 State governments concerned have undertaken a cost benefit analysis of the project. There was a further cost benefit analysis made by the Commonwealth after the one made in 1970. An environmental study also was made, I understand. Anyway, all these steps were taken to make sure that this was a worthwhile project. The honourable member who has interjected does not know anything about it anyway. He would be much better suited to stick to something he knows something about. lust because he happens to know about one investigation he regards himself as an expert in that field. There is no doubt that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. The honourable member's remarks give a striking example of just how dangerous it is. He obviously does not know the full ramifications of this scheme at all. The point is that the decision to continue with this dam project is still being delayed. I hope that the Government will honour the undertaking. If we reach a stage where governments are not prepared to do that, it will be a sorry day for Australia. I believe that the New South Wales Minister concerned was prepared to consider with the Queensland Minister concerned whether the States could go it alone. That is how desperate they were. The delay has continued. It is becoming impracticable to go on with this project because of the time of year. I believe that there is a real obligation on the part of the I Government to make a decision and to make",104
55,Dr GUN,ADJOURNMENT," I do not think that today should be allowed to pass without making mention of the fact that 2 The historic and momentous documents have been presented to the Parliament. One is titled 'Community Health Program for Australia' which is a report from the National Hospitals and Health Services Commisson Interim Committee. The other report is entitled 'Schools in Australia* and is a report of the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission. As I have said, these are momentous reports. The Committees concerned were both headed by very knowledgeable and greatly respected people within their own disciplines. We are very fortunate in Australia that we have these 2 eminent people heading their respective Committees. Subsequently they will head the Commissions concerned. I refer to Professor Karmel, who will be the head of the Australian Schools Commission. The Australian Hospitals and Health Services Commission will be headed by Dr Sidney Sax, who is at present the Chairman of the National Hospitals and Health Services Commission Interim Committee. The report on Australian schools is an excellent document. I have not had time to examine it in detail, but from what I have seen of it already I know that it is a magnificent blueprint for education for the 1970s. It is not just an ad hoc survey like the survey that was commissioned by the previous Government. It has all the details we need a dynamic program for education in the 1970s. In the report is an estimate of the immediate needs in schools and itemised details of what is needed. The report sets how we should collect the data for an ongoing appraisal of the needs of education. There are recommendations on how to meet those needs and the estimated costs involved. There are firm recommendations on the administration and the structure and the funcpoint tions of the Australian Schools Commission. The report contains an excellent system by which the Committee ban indexed the recurrent resource use of schools throughout Australia. They have used this system the needs and how to bring the facilities in schools up to a certain target by 1979. The report sets out the urgent needs for 1974 and 1975. It outlines the problems of all the various areas such as the problems of schools with socio-economic disadvantages.",104
56,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! I should like to remind the honourable gentleman that the debate on the schools report has been made an order of the day for tomorrow.,105
57,Dr GUN,ADJOURNMENT,"In that regard, I might also mention that the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has also spoken about foreign affairs today. That is also a subject set down for discussion tomorrow. Be that as it may, I want to make only passing reference to the subject. I do not think the occassion should be allowed to pass without mentioning the snide remarks of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when he spoke on this subject earlier today. In the report of the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission at page 87 he found a sentence which stated that category A schools, which are a small select group of schools in the non-government, non-Catholic sector, already use a volume of resources that well exceeds the 1979 target and that the Committee believes that Government assistance to those schools cannot be justified. Did the honourable member for Wannon bear in mind the great blueprint of this document for underprivileged schools? He said not a word about that. Did he have anything to say about the new deal for handicapped children? Not a word. Did he have anything to say about the needs being met for migrant children? He said nothing about that. What about the new deal for primary school for libraries? There was not a word said about that. All he is concerned about is protecting this small group of elite schools. What did he do? He made a personal, despicable and out shameful attack on the Chairman of the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission, Professor Peter Karmel, under the veil of making an attack on the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley). Mr MACKellar- I raise a point of order. I out, through you Mr Speaker, that you did tell the honourable member for Kingston that this matter was to be debated tomorrow. You advised him that he should not deal with it. He is disregarding that advice from you. to estimate This is out of order.",105
58,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! I asked the honourable member to keep away from discussing the report.,105
59,Dr GUN,ADJOURNMENT,"I am just taking exception to the despicable remarks made today by the honourable member for Wannon, when he made a personal attack on a public servant who is unable to defend himself. It was thinly disguised as an attack on the Minister for Education. Professor Karmel, as we know, is probably the most accomplished person in his field in Australia. His integrity is without question. I believe that the honourable member for Wannon should be made to apologise. On the question of the community health program for Australia set out by the Committee headed by Dr Saks, I believe this report commends its attention to everybody in Australia and I would particularly commend it to those gentlemen from the Australian Medical Association whose contribution to community health resources will be announced tomorrow when they announce their fee increases. I hope that when they announce those increases 14509/73-R-[110 ] that they will give some indication that they are paying regard to what is after all the purpose of a health policy, namely, to provide a system of integrated community care for the whole community.",105

Registered Medical and Hospital Funds Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (I) In view of recent allegations of the misuse of funds of N.S.W. Building Societies, will he investigate the use made of the large reserves of registered medical and hospital funds. (2) Since his appointment as Minister, has he found any evidence of misuse of contributors' funds. (3) If so, what are the details. Mrffiayden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Since the amendment to the National Health Act in 1970, details of assets and liabilities of registered medical and hospital funds are required to be presented hi an annual report to Parliament. The investments of funds are set out under broad headings which show that surplus funds are, in the main, held in trustee type investments. I would point out that in winding up the present unsatisfactory voluntary health insurance system, the Government will be carefully examining the manner in which the reserves held by funds are to be utilised. (2) and (3) Allegations have been made from time to time as to the misuse of contributors' funds, for example, in meeting the costs of publications directed to political purposes, printing over-lavish reports, the provision of an aeroplane and lavish motor cars for use of staff and unnecessary competitive practices amongst funds. It is known that H.C.F. of Sydney sent four delegates to the last International Federation of Voluntary Health Service Funds. They were Mr D. S. I . Burrows (Chairman of the Executive Committee), Dr L. L. Wilson (Member of the Executive Committee), Mr R. J, Turner (Director) and Mr V. A. Hilton (Development Manager).

62,Mr GRASSBY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The service does not differ from the proposal announced by the previous Minister in his statement to Parliament on 31 August 1972 and which was first mentioned formally in Departmental files in February 1972. In my statement to the press on 16 February 1973 I gave details of the new service and announced that I would open it at the Melbourne office of my Department on 19 February 1973 which I did. Depsrrment of InramignElkMni Multilingual Weffere ©finesses (Question No. 355) Dr Forbes asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: In what way does the new system whereby members of a special team of trained welfare officers and interpreters visit migrants in the home, school and workplace, announced by bim as an initiative of his Government, differ from the proposal on the same subject announced by the previous Minister on 31 August 1972.",108
63,Mr GRASSBY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The proposed appointment of 48 multi-lingual welfare omcers to provide a welfare and interpreter service to migrants in the community generally and in schools, to which I referred in my statement to the press on 11 March 1973, does not differ from the proposal announced by the previous Minister in his statement to Parliament on 31 August 1972. In my statement on 11 March I said that the Department would be seeking approval (of the Public Service Board) to appoint the officers concerned. The concept of bilingual or multi-lingual welfare officers is not however new. The already existing welfare staff of the Department includes some 65 per cent of persons born overseas or in Australia from ethnic background and with fluency in other languages. The majority of these appointments date from the late 1960s, though the first was made in 1963. Drug Advertising (Question No. 453) Mr Street asked the Minister fox Health, upon notice: Has hit Department consulted with any of the relevant committees set up under the Therapeutic Goods Act on the possiblerestrictionof drug advertising; if so, what committees have been consulted and when; if not, wby not.",108
64,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Drug Evaluation Committee was (Quesuon No. 435) consulted in December 1970 about the advertising of goods in medical and allied journals ana concluded that control of the content of such advertisements was necessary. Tbis resulted from the opinion that many such advertisements included undesirable and unsubstantiated statements, and provided no information about contraindications, precautions or side effects of the advertised goods. Other Committees set up under the Therapeutic Goods Act have not been consulted on the possible restriction of drug advertising because(a) they are set up to advise the Commonwealth alone, and not the States which would be responsible for introducing a significant proportion of the relevant legislation; (b) their charters relate specifically to standards and, although covering aspects of labelling and packaging, the charters are not sufficiently comprehensive to include the total concept of advertising control that is proposed. Standards do not cover aspects relating to side effects, hazards, efficacy, etc. Since the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee was established to advise only the Federal Minister for Health and since his Department has no control over the advertising of therapeutic goods in medical and allied journals, its recommendations were referred to the National Therapeutic Goods Committee. This Committee, established by Order in Council, consists of representatives from the Federal and each State Health Department, and was established to advise the Commonwealth and States on action necessary to bring about co-ordination of legislation and administration of controls over therapeutic goods. It was not appropriate to establish such a Committee under the Federal Therapeutic Goods Act 1966. The National Therapeutic Goods Committee widened the scope of the subject to cover all advertising of therapeutic goods, in the light of recommendations of other bodies such as the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse and the House of Representatives Select Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits. This Committee has been responsible for formulating the Proposed Requirements for Advertising of Therapeutic Goods and recently was authorised by the Australian Health Ministers to discuss the draft with all interested parties before finalising any proposals, which would be subject to final approval by all Health Ministers. Discussions with appropriate bodies are currently in progress. A copy of this draft document will be made available to any Honourable Member interested in its contents. Trade Unions: Representation on Government-created Bodies Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labour, upon notice: (1) Is it his intention to ensure adequate representation of trade unions in the managements of (a) banking and insurance, (b) mass media, (c) communications and transport, (d) natural resources development and (e) secondary, industry. (2) If so, will he clarify what is meant by adequate representation and what action bas been taken to implement his intention. (3) Will he indicate what the present level of trade union representation is with respect to the organisations listed in part (1). Mr Charles Jones-The Acting Minister for Labour has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: There are constitutional limitations on the Commonwealth Parliament's power to legislate to put on private enterprise a requirement of a kind mentioned in the honourable member's question and in the circumstances such legislation does not appear feasible. In relation to Commonwealth bodies I refer the honourable member to the answer to his question No. 456 (Hansard, 3 May 1973 pages 1742-3). Public Servants: Comments on Official Matters (Question No. 467) Mr Donald Cameron asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) What steps has the Government taken to implement its election policy undertaking to reduce restrictions on public servants to the minimum necessary for the conduct of the affairs cf government. (2) If no action has been taken, when is it proposed to implement this undertaking.",108
65,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Considerable work has been done by departments in preparing an outline for the legislation, which will give uie Australian public greater access to official information and documents and ensure that undue secrecy in public affairs is avoided. In this task they were assisted by a visit of Mr A. Mondello, General Counsel of the United States Civil Service Commission. Legislation is also under consideration designed to ensure that criminal sanctions now imposed by the Crimes Act for the unauthorised disclosure of official information are replaced by legislation of the kind recommended last year by the Franks Committee in the United ICingdom. The Pubhc Service Board will be having discussions with staff organisations with a view to completing the review of Public Service Regulation 34(b) which deals with the question of public comments on official matters by public servants.

(2) Can he also say which municipalities in Australia have local government ordinances controlling noise; if so, what are the restrictions imposed by these ordinances.",109
67,Dr CASS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICCE,"The answer to the right honourComprehensive able member's question is as follows: (1) The major legislative provisions are to give regulatory power to guard against excessive noise which may have an adverse health effect or have a nuisance value. The Acts do not specify noise levels, such levels being Included in the Regulations derived from the Acts. The following is the situation applying to noise control legislation.

Victoria Mr Whitlam - The answer te the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The question I wag asked, to which the honourable member refers, was 'Are you prepared to reveal correspondence between your Ministers?' My answer was then, as it is now, 'The question has not arisen'. The correspondence concerning Croatian terrorism between Ministers of former Governments which was Tasmania tabled illustrated the differences between Ministers which stultified those Governments. There has been no difference between Ministers of this Government on that subject. Age Pensions: Cost of New Rates South Australia (Question No. 628) Mr Garland asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: With reference to my question No. 207 (Hansard, 15 March 1973, page 672) regarding the estimated additional annual cost, by single years of age, of paying age pensions at the new rates to all persons qualified by residence and age, is this information now available and will he make it public.",111
