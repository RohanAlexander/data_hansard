0,NA,Unknown,"to make them a means of gaining a party advantage for himself, - any more than I Would seek to make them a means of gaining a party advantage for those on this side of the House. I am astounded at the right honourable member's address to the Chamber; seeing that he has thought fit to ignore the message which I sent to him, twenty minutes or half-an-hour ago, by the honourable member for Mernda, to inform him that the Speaker, after full consideration of the authorities had decided on. the course he would probably take if the proceedings of the House had not closed by 1.2 o'clock to-night.",159
1,Mr REID,Unknown,I had 110 assurance of kind in regard to the Speaker having decided on any course at all.,159
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Mernda left me with that information, and returned to me with the information that he had imparted it to the right honourable member for East Svdney; and I believe the honourable member for Mernda. I make no imputation on any other honourable member.",159
3,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable ""member for Mernda did not introduce the Speaker's name into the communication. He brought the message from the Prime Minister.",159
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The message was from me and not from the Speaker; but the message from me was simply that, if nothing interrupted the debate before 12 o'clock, the Speaker, having considered the question and also the precedents-on e of which existed in the State of Victoria-for suspending a sitting under special conditions, was prepared, in accordance with his powers and the obligation due to the day we are approaching, to leave the chair at midnight and resume at midnight tomorrow. I sent that information to the right honourable member for East Sydney as soon as I had obtained it , because I thought he, and those he represents, were entitled to know. I sent that information,, accompanied with a message, to which I have not even now received an answer. That message was to the effect that, in view of the strain imposed by this long sitting on you, Mr. Speaker, upon honourable members, and the officers, I was perfectly: willing, if the right honourable gentleman consented, to ask you to suspend the sitting, if you thought it well to do so, until half-past ten o'clock on Monday morning. Such an interval would, I thought, give you, and all of us, that full measure of rest to which we are entitled, and enable us to renew our business refreshed, at the hour I have mentioned. That was the clear and unmistakable message which _1 sent. I received the answer that it had been received, and would be considered. I regret to find that the honourable member for Mernda, after delivering the messagq, left the House, because. I expected he would have been here now to hear this statement. Under all the circumstances, I fai l to understand why the right honourable member for East Sydney, in addressing; the House, was not candid enough to say that he had received the message, and whether or not he was willing to accept my suggestion. If the right any honourable member was not willing, I did not propose to ask the House to depart in any way from the procedure which the Speaker considered to be within his rights, nor to ask himi to go beyond the time named, except at the request and with"" the approval of the whole House. That teemed to me a fair proposal to make to those honourable members opposite, who ask for an adjournment of the debate. Of course, the suggestion that the Ministry should accept a hostile motion for the adjournment of the debate on a question of this vital importance- a question on which the fate of this Government is at stake-wil l not be considered for a moment. I think it scarcely necessary 'to sav that the Government cannot consent to the adjournment of the debate ; because the purpose of the Government is that 'the present sitting shall be continued when Sunday is passed-that the business shall be resumed at the point where it leaves off, and shall be pressed to its legitimate conclusion. I am puzzled to hear the Opposition declare that when, in maintenance of what we believe to be the right of this House to control its own business, the Government are prepared to sit silently by, day by day and night by night, until they cease their obstruction, we are chargeable with using force, while the minority, who are occupying the whole time with, irrelevant discussion, are not using force. Their action represents pleading and persuasion, and ours force ! There can be no doubt that any such oterm applied to the conduct of one side must apply equally to the other. I ami making no reflection on honourable members opposite, except to repel a slander upon this side, when it is said that we are endeavouring to "" b l u d g e o n "" this proposal through. As a fact, it is we on this side who are being bludgeoned all the while. But of that I make no complaint. That is the ordinary inversion of partisanship.",159
5,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We are happy !,160
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"- I should be happier if I saw the House rising to an appreciation of the circumstances, not only of the present moment, but of the future. We must acknowledge that the progress made during this session has been made, despite a perpetual and unjustifiable drag-in the face of a perpetually drawn-out dwelling upon minor and irrelevant considerations. We now find that, instead of having concluded",160
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. Is the Prime Minister in order in reflecting upon the conduct of business of this House in the past?,160
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I think the Prime Minister is perfectly in order in stating his opinion as to whether the business done is satisfactory.,160
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But the Minister is going beyond that.,160
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If the debates had been levelled only at those considerations whichcould be justified by taking the widest view of all possible objections, I undertake to say that before now we should have cleared the whole of the business off the notice paper. That is my opinion, and I believe others hold it strongly. There are now but a few weeks before Christmas, and it depends on the House-o n members on both sides-whethe r the remaining business can by then be disposed of. But the work shall ""be done, whether we rise at Christmas or whether we do not.",160
11,Mr REID,Unknown,The Government have to pay the price.,160
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"When we took office four months and a half ago, it was with a programme of practical business laid before the House, with the assurance thatnothing would be wanting; on the part of the Government to Tfs completion in a reasonable way and in a reasonable time. To that undertaking we still hold, mid by it we are still bound. The fact that we have not nearly finished our programme is no reason why we should aban-Â° don the task we undertook. The work is readv-the measures are practically prepared, and there is still time to transact our business before Christmas if the House addresses itself to the task without undue diversion of its powers or waste of its strength. That business can be completed without any trespass on the liberty or fair opportunities, of any single member of the House-wit h every opportunity - for free perfectly speech and the fullest deliberation. With that fact in view, it becomes more than ever imperative upon us, charged, as we are, all of us, with the solemn responsibility that attaches to the positions we hold, and to the pledges we have given",160
13,Mr REID,Unknown,"Pledges ? ,",160
14,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,To our constituents.,160
15,Mr REID,Unknown,--The Prime Minister has not been before his constituents.,160
16,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No other pledge has been given; and but for the betrayal of those following him. by the right honourable gentleman, and those who now follow him, the present Government would not be in office today. We took up the task which the right honourable gentleman and his Government wantonly threw down-the right honourable gentleman chpse to drop the reins' while in charge. Prime",160
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister kindly confine himself to the question, which is the adjournment of debate? I have allowed a good deal of latitude during the past hour to the honourable member for Mernda, the right honourable member for East Sydney, and one or two others; but, at the same time, I cannot throw to the winds all rules, and I ask the Prime Minister not to go so far from the question as to refer to the circumstances connected with the coming into office of the present Government.",160
18,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I admit my error, sir, which was, as usual, the result of interjections. I do not wish to detain the House. I am only too willing that honourable members should leave it as soon as possible, in order that they may have the Sunday rest which we all need. Nothing I have said is intended as in any way a threat, and there is nothing, I hope, which will be considered personally offensive. But we are reaching a stage at which it is necessary that both the House and the country should understand whit the Government intend.",160
19,Mr WILSON,Unknown,Why not send us to the country to see what the electors intend ?,160
20,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Government intend to do their work-the work they set out to do at the commencement of the session, and. if they live so long, to submit measures of a still more vital and far-reaching character to be dealt with next session. They must then take the judgment of the country, and will be ready and willing to do so; or they will take the judgment of - this House now, or at any time,, on this question, and abide by it . Either ness goes on and our work is done, or honourable members must find another Government.",160
21,Mr REID,Unknown," I rise to make a personal explanation in connection with the statement of the Prime Minister as to a communication"" between the honourable member for Merndai and myself. In the absence of the honourable member, I wish to say that he was careful to remind me that it was he who went to the Prime Minister, and not the Prime Minister who, in the first instance, employed him. He went to the Prime Minister on his own responsibility. I certainly did not ask him to go, and he went without any mission from me. the first place, to say that the statement of the Prime Minister was inaccurate in that respect, because the honourable member for Mernda was careful to assure me that it was he who approached the Prime Minister, and not that the honourable and learned gentleman had made use of him as an intermediary. Otherwise, I think that probablv some other channel of communication would have been chosen.",161
22,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Le t the right honourable gentleman come to the substantial point.,161
23,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I might be permitted to say that the honourable member for Mernda was sitting here and said to me, "" Can I do anything for you?"" and I replied,, ""Yes, you can take this message to the right honourable gentleman.""",161
24,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am coming to the substantial point, but I must clear away one ambiguity to begin with. The statement now made by the Prime Minister confirms what I say, and makes it clear that the honourable member for Mernda had not been previously approached. orable member never made any statement to me as to what the Speaker was going to do. I was not aware that the Speaker had confided in the Prime Minister as to the course he proposed to adopt - The Speaker did not confide that course in me as the other leader in this House.",161
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Speaker answered a question I put to him,.",161
26,Mr REID,Unknown,"I wish merely to say that T was not made aware of the course of action, which you, Mr Speaker, had decided on. I was in ignorance of it', and the honourable member for Mernda did not say a word to me about the Speaker or what he was going to do. If , sir, I had busiknown the course you proposed to take. T should probably have taken the liberty of addressing you upon that subject, but, as I say, I was in absolute ignorance as to anything you were going to do. It was put to me as a proposal from the Prime Minister that we should suspend the sitting until midnight on Sunday. The honourable member for 'Mernda also said that he thought he might say that the Prime Minister would probably be willing that the House should adjourn until about 10 o'clock on Monday morning,, but I understood the honourable member to submit that as a hypothetical possibility, and not as a distinct message to me. I told the honourable member for Mernda that I would I wish, in make a statement in which I would invite the Prime Minister to state to the House what he proposed to do. That was my answer. I did not employ the honourable member for Mernda as an intermediary. He-carefully let me know that he had approached the Prime Minister, and that the honourable and learned gentle4 man had not employed him. The matter was conveyed to me as an offer from the Prime Minister, an offer which I declined to accept. So far as the action of Mr. Speaker is concerned, that is n matter for himself; but if Mr Speaker thinks fit to come here at midnight on Sunday, I do not think he will find the Opposition ready to receive bin'.",161
27,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is extremely undesirable and unfortunate that, in connection with anvmatter, and especially if it be of a - highly controversial character, any reference whatever should be made to. the occupant of this chair.",161
28,Mr REID,Unknown,"Hear, hear; Mr Speaker has been dragged into the debate. The hon- Mr SPEAKER - Order ! I feel that what has transpired during the last half-' hour has placed me in a very delicate position, and partly hampers me in the course' which I had contemplated. It is due to nwself that I should say that the Prime Minister approached me, as nearly as possible about an hour ago, and asked me what course I thought I might take. I informed the honourable and learned gentleman of the course which was in my mind, and I also informed him that the taking of that course would depend upon developments between that time and 1a 1 o'clock. I felt, as I feel now, that ought not to finally determine the course I should take at 12 o'clock until that hour is reached.",161
29,Mr REID,Unknown,So that the Speaker had decided.,162
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I ought to be influenced in what I do at that hour by whatever may transpire up to that time. only one more remark to make, and that is that I informed the Prime Minister what was in my mind because he, asked - me to do so. 1 knew that the right hon the orable member for East Sydney intended to speak, and to make a request to the afternoon. Prime Minister in relation to the matter. I deemed that the speech.he might make, or the answer he might receive, would posof sibly have some effect upon the course proposed to take. It was my intention, soon as the right honourable gentleman made his speech and received an answer, make a communication to him similar to which I had already made to the Prime ister, and which I was prepared to make any leader in the House, or-indeed, to other honourable member who might seek know mv mind on the subject.",162
31,Mr FULLER,Unknown," After ' his heated reply to the leader of the Opposibe tion, I thought the Prime Minister would prove that he was prepared to act up to magnificent professions concerning the bath, by consenting at once to the journment of the debate, in order that the officers of the House and others should not be compelled to work on that day, and that we might be able to get to our it begins.",162
32,Mr RONALD,Unknown,"Why not,let us get there?",162

37,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"In the circumstances, regret very much that we shall be unable to get to our homes and to our rest until well into the Sabbath, so much dwelt by the Prime Minister. After his reply I to the leader of the Opposition, one would have thought that the honourable and learned gentleman would have tried to avoid any encroachment upon the day of rest by offernot ing at Once to agree to the adjournment of the debate until Monday morning.",162
38,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I have offered it.,162
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Offere d it ; after an I have offensive speech like that!,162
40,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The debate should be of adjourned, in order that we may have an opportunity to view the whole question in light thrown upon it by the speech delivered by the leader of the Opposition this I hold the Attorney-General responsible for the action which has compelled our protest in the interests of liberty speech. , Similar proceedings took place I in the New South Wales Parliament on one as occasion, owing to the action of the Gohad vernment of which the Minister of Trade to and Customs was a prominent member, and that the honourable gentleman can hardly feel Mincomfortable now when he recollects the to consequences that followed on that occaany sion. However, the price must be paid to for the support, given to the Government by the Labour Party. As the Prime Minister has said. "" The task of the day must done.""

48,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The House will perhaps permit me to say that I have gathered from the speeches of honourable members-, and otherwise, that there is a general wish that the sitting shall not be continued during Sunday. I have looked up the precedents, and I find that there are many for the Speaker suspending the sitting for such time as may be necessary for securing the purpose in view. In this House the time for which sittings have been suspended, has usually been one hour for lefreshments. There are other cases - in which sittings have been suspended for longer periods-up to three and a-half hours in one case, and in Victoria, on one occasion, a sitting was suspended for eleven hours and three-quarters. I recognise that if I suspend the sitting of this House for twenty-four hours, I go beyond any period for which I can find a precedent. in suspending the sitting for that time. I should not go beyond the period which is necessary to accomplish the purpose we have in view. I find, however, that there is a general desire that the House should not be called back to transact business at midnight tomorrow, and that the convenience of honourable members should be studied to a further extent. Therefore, I now suspend this sitting of the House until half-past 10 o'clock on Monday morning. Sitting suspended at midnight, until 10.30 a.m. on Monday, ihe 20th inst.",163
49,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I wish to know, Mr. Speaker, whether in the event of the sitting continuing, as seems possible, for a considerable time, you could make arrangements for the temporary relief of the Hansard, staff?",163
50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I think that it was the honourable member himself who mentioned to me on Friday or Saturday last that it was very desirable that some relief should Be given to the Hansard staff, and that that relief might be secured by enlisting the services of some of the officers of the Reporting Staff of the State Parliament. I will take care to ascertain whether'sucfi an arrangement can be made or whether relief can by any other means be afforded.",163
51,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"On a point of order, sir, since the sitting of the House has been suspended from midnight on Saturday, I should like to know whether our proceedings this morning should not be opened in the usual way, with prayer?",163
52,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,We are merely continuing the sitting which began on Thursday last.,163
53,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The sitting of the House has been suspended for a period which is unprecedently long, and questions may arise as to the iegality of the course adopted; but many of the grounds upon which we pleaded on Saturday for the adjournment of the debate having been removed, I do not intend to address any further arguments to the House in support of this motion. We have secured rest, and the traces of irritation on the part of many honourable members which were so obvious on Saturday have now entirely disappeared.",163
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) I wish, Mr Speaker, to make a personal explanation. Since the suspension of Yet the sittingon Saturday night, there has appeared in both the morning newspapers circulated in Melbourne a statement by the Prime Minister concerning the use of the "" gag'' some years ago by the right honourable member for East Sydney when leader of a State Government in New South Wales. That statement omits some of the facts.",163
55,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I omitted no facts of which, I was aware. Saturday, Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It would be inferred from the interview in question, that the leader of the Opposition had passed through the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales proposals similar"" to ""those now before us. As a matter of fact, however, he did not initiate those proposals; they were passed in spite of his resistance.",163
56,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,He did not vote against them.,163
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member knows why he did not do so. A picnic was given 'to the right ""honourable member for East Sydney, then leader of the Opposition in the State Parliament.",163
58,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Hav e we not heard enough of New South Wales.,163
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Why does not the honora'ole member address that observation to the Prime Minister? The leader of the Opposition did not vote against the proposals in question for the simple reason that he was not present when the Question was' put. He was at a picnic tendered to him by his supporters.,163
60,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is entitled, of course, to make a personal explanation in regard to his own position, but is not entitled to make a personal explanation on behalf of any one else. I cannot see that in referring to a certain picnic and some action on the part of the right honourable member for East Sydney, the honourable member is confining himself, as he must do, to an explanation of his own position.",163
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"A picnic was tendered to the right honourable member for East Sydney by some of his own party, among whom were the honourable member for Macquarie, the honourable member for Dalley, the honourable member for North Sydney, myself, and others, and the Standing Orders to which the Prime Minister has referred were passed while the whole of the Opposition were absent.",164
62,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The right honourable member for East Sydney had previously in a speech approved of the principle.,164
63,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I cannot allow the name of another honourable member to be imported into this question. The honourable member for Parramatta is explaining his own attitude, and cannot reply to interjections dealing with the attitude of any one else.",164
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I believe that I was the only member of the Opposition present when the Standing Orders mentioned were put through, and honourable members will find that I raised mv voice in protest against them.",164
65,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The honourable member was not then a. follower of the right honourable member for East Sydney.,164
66,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That has nothing to do with the question.,164
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It seems to me that I cannot utter two sentences without being interrupted. I repeat that I was the only one to raise a protest against the passing of the proposals, in the absence of the entire Opposition. ' .",164
68,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Was the honourable member a member of the Labour Party at that time?,164
69,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It is almost impossible for the honourable member to proceed and to obey the directions of the Chair when those directions are again and again disregarded by honourable members opposite. I must ask honourable members to assist me in carrying out the Standing Orders.,164
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In view of these facts, it will be seen that the partu of the right honourable member for East Sydney was leader, d id not introduce the Standing Orders to which reference has been made. They' simply applied them, after they had been forced upon the House in spite of their protest. I invite honourable members to see here the possibilities inhering in the motion now before the House",164

74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have nothing further to add.,164
75,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown," My statement having been directly or inferentially questioned, I may be permitted, by way of personal explanation, to say that in the press interview I confined myself .to two statements. The first was that the leader of the Opposition, as a member of the State Parliament of New South Wales, had approved of the principle of the proposals now before this House. For proof of this, I relied upon one of his own speeches, in which' he said that, subject to certain conditions, he had no objection to the principle. Mv second statement was that he had no objection to the practice of using this closure when he was in office, and showed that whatever mav have been his view of the parr ticular formi of the standing order now in question, he applied it in the manner mentioned. On looking up the records, I found among those who voted for the suppression of speech, as the honourable member for Parramatta has termed it. the names of those members of the Opposition whom I mentioned.",164

77,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"As one of the parties concerned, Mr Speaker, I wish to know whether I shall have the same opportunity which that has been accorded other honourable members to relate to the House the true facts, of the incident? - Mr SPEAKER - The honourable member is surely aware that equal rights are enjoyed by all honourable members;, and that he is just as much entitled to make a personal explanation as is the Prime Minister, the leader of the Opposition, or any one else.",164
78,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I was - Mr SYDNEY SMITH about to say that I was not in the Parliament of New South Wales when the ""gagging"" resolutions were adopted there. During the course of this debate, I have already intimated that if similar resolutions are adopted here they will be used by every party",165
79,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would point out that the question as to whether the proposed standing order, if carried, will be used by every party or against any particular party'has nothing whatever to do with a personal explanation. It is rather an argument upon the main question.",165
80,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I was about to say that at the time to which I refer, I was a member of a party which had appealed to the country upon particular proposals in regard to the Tariff. The proposals of that party had received the strong endorsement of the electors, and I and other honourable members ported-as I would support in this - House-the application of the closure under those circumstances. I have already said that if it were absolutely - necessary to insure effect being given to the will of the majority, I would even go to the length of supporting the proposal of the Government. But in my opinion the adoption of that course has not been proved to be necessary.",165
81,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown," B y way of personal explanation I desire to say that certain statements have been made by the Prime Minister and others in regard to the Standing Orders operative in the New South Wales Parliament, to which I feel called upon to reply. As was stated by the honourable member for Parramatta, those Standing Orders were brought forward whilst the members of the Opposition were absent from the Chamber. It had been arranged that they should attend an outing at the National Park, and whilst they were absent the Government of the day, of which the present Minister of Trade and Customs was a member",165

84,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Has the honourable member the division-lists relating to the "" g a g g in g "" of Mr Chanter and Mr. Ewing? - I will explain that matter at the proper time. It will be seen from the division-list that on the 7th June, 1894, Sir George Dibbs, who was then Premier of New South Wales, and who had associated with him the present Minister of Trade and Customs",165
85,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable member say what his remarks have to do with a personal explanation ?,165
86,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I wished to point out that the closure resolutions were adopted practically without debate.  Is the honourable member in order in recapitulating the circumstances connected with a vote in the New South Wales Parliament twelve or fourteen years ago? What has that to do with the present debate ?,165
87,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It has nothing whatever to do with it . But as remarks have been made concerning a supcertain incident which occurred some years ago, which the honourable member conceives reflect upon himself, he is entitled to make a personal explanation in regard ""to that incident. He is not entitled to go anv further.",165
88,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"On the 7th June, 1894, in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, Sir George Dibbs proposed the adoption of certain Standing orders, including the "" gag."" Those standing orders were carried by thirty-four votes to twenty-one. If honourable members will look at the division list, they will find that my name does not appear in it . I had previously intimated that I was opposed to the closure proposals, and it was well known that the majority of the Opposition were opposed to them. The Government of the day took a mean advantage of our absence from the Chamber to force those proposals through.",165

Had we known that they were to be dealt with, we should have been present. But, seeing that there was a chance to get them through in the absence of members of the Opposition, the Government of the day, of which the present Minister for Trade and Customs was a member",165
90,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is going far beyond the limits of a personal explanation. Statements concerning the attitude of the Government of that dayhave no personal application whatever.,166
91,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,At least it discloses the reason why I was not present to oppose the Standing Orders in question.,166
92,Mr CHANTER,Unknown," I should not have taken any part in this discussion but for the action of some honourable members in denying certain facts. I propose to explain those facts. In the first place I may, perhaps, be permitted to read from the New South Wales Hansard of 1887, certain statements made by the right honourable member for East Sydney in supporting the closure resolutions at that time.",166
93,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order . I am afraid that the honourable member will not be in order in making a personal explanation by reading a speech which was delivered by the honourable member for East Sydney. The honourable member is perfectly entitled to make a personal explanation, but he is not entitled to do anything more than that.",166
94,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"May I be permitted to say, in reply to statements which have been made; this morning, that the Tariff resolutions to which reference has been made took several months to deal with, and during the course of the debate upon them, it was found necessary to apply the closure to myself and several: other gentlemen who are members of this House. The actual facts are that the Tariff resolutions in Committee of Ways and Means were introduced by the then Premier, the right honourable member for East Sydney, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon of a. certain dav. Upon that occasion, the sitting of the House-wit h an interval of one hour for dinner, and an hour and a half for breakfast-occupie d only about eighteen hours.",166
95,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order . Unless the honourable member can allege that he is responsible, either for the length or shortness of the sitting., be will not be in order in proceeding upon those lines.",166
96,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I was certainly not responsible for the length of the sitting. I was one of those honourable members who were ""gagged,"" and those who were.responsible for ""gagging"" me, included five members of this House, namely, the honourable member for North Sydney, the honourable member for Macquarie",166
97,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order . Upon a personal explanation^ the honourable member is not at liberty to attack other honourable members. I must ask him to refrain from opening up a subject which will absolutely demand a further explanation by .honourable members.,166
98,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"As it is due to the country that this matter should be explained, I shall reserve my remarks upon it for the future occasion. Motion (by Mr LEE) , by leave, withdrawn.",166
99,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown," I had no intention of speaking upon this amendment, but it appears that there is such a general desire on the part of Ministerial supporters that 1 should address myself to it, judging from their repeated and persistent calls forme, that I should be lacking in ordinary courtesy if I failed to do so. I intend to support the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, the object of which is to considerably enlarge the field of discussion. It aims at allowing all business in this Parliament to be conducted without the application of any system of closure, obviously for the purpose of permitting this question to be referred to the electors. I claim that if any proposal in regard to the closure be good in itself, its application should be extended not only to this, 'but to any future Parliament. As far as I have been able to discover, no system of closure has worked satisfactorily in any Parliament. Its application has always been a source of irritation. In considering the amendment honourable members should recollect the nature of the business which will engage the attention of this Parliament. 'Necessarily that business will include not only the measures at present upon the notice-paper, but any other matters which may arise during the life of this Parliament. In mv opinion, the action of the Government in persistently pressing forward a proposal to apply the closure is more calculated to lead to their downfall than it is to practical legislation. I very much fear that the contumacious obstinacy of the Attorney-General in connection with this matter will prove the initial step towards bringing about the disruption of the Ministry. I should welcome an appeal to the people, because it seems to me that only by going to the country can we arrive at a solution of our present difficulties. The proposals before us are of a highly controversial character, and we should ascertain the opinion of the constituencies with regard to them. If we do not appeal to the electors forthwith, it is certainly desirable that opportunities, should be presented for the fullest possible discussion of the various proposals to which we shall have to devote attention during the life of this Parliament. Honourable members who believe that the closure should' be applied should at least take their constituents into their confidence, and ascertain their views with regard to a proposal which would have the effect of limiting the opportunities for the expression of their opinions. If the proposed new standing order were adopted, subject to the amendment now proposed, it - would be possible, after consulting the electors, to repeal, in the course of the next Parliament, any legislation of which the people might in the meantime express their disapproval. It seems to me reasonable that the application of the closure, which has been proposed under such exceptional circumstances, should be postponed for the present. It should certainly not be applied to the business under discussion at the time that it was interposed. It must be remembered that we are here to voice the opinions and views of our constituents, as well as to vote. This is a deliberative assembly, and it is our duty to fully consider and debate all the proposals presented to us, whether by private members or by the Government. We are entitled to glance briefly at the programme outlined by the Prime Minister in his statement to Parliament shortly after resuming office. He saidThis Ministry adheres to the practical policy sanctioned by the country at the last general election, and already submitted to this House, and exists for the purpose of giving effect to it. He went on to say that the Government represented the same policy, and the same party as in 1904, which, remained almost as completely applicable as it did sixteen months before.' He said furtherTaking the subjects mentioned in the order in which they appear in His Excellency's speech of March, 1904, honourable members will findthe taking over of the debts of the States. That subject involves such a variety of issues, and must give rise to such diversity of opinion, that the widest and freest discussion should be permittedCould any one argue that the discussion of a matter involving such vast financial considerations should. be restricted by the application of the closure? Surely, a national wrong would be inflicted if discussion were stifled upon a proposal affecting the constitutional rights of the States. I am sure that honourable members would not advocate the application of the closure to the discussion of a measure of that character. The Prime Minister has pointed out that the consideration of the subject entered upon its initial stage at the Hobart Conference, and that,, therefore, it might Well be submitted to Parliament as early as will be convenient. He next referred to the possibility of establishing a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. The subject was then, and is still, under investigation by a Royal Commission. It must be obvious that it would be unwise to rush such a measure through Parliament without the fullest discussion, involving, as it may, not only extra taxation, but also, by resort to direct taxation, a departure from the hitherto accepted principles of raising revenue for Federal purposes. The members of the Opposition could not reasonably be expected to meekly submit to the application of the closure to the discussion of a measure involving such large issues. Another plank in the Government programme is the encouragement of rural occupations, 'preferential trade, the granting of bounties for new products, and the establishment of speedier, cheaper, and better transportation for meat, butter, and fruit. Here, again, large issues are raised requiring serious and exhaustive debate. None of these matters, with the exception of preferential trade perhaps, has been before the country, but even in regard to preferential trade, we have evidence of a divergence of opinion such as will make very considerable debate inevitable. In connection with the transportation of produce, regard must be had to the probable introduction of a Navigation Bill, affecting the conditions of trade, not only on our coasts, but also between Australia and foreign parts, and to the proposal that the Commonwealth Government shall itself undertake the business of a sea carrier, by owning and maintaining steamers for the conveyance of merchandise, mails, and passengers, not only from State to State, but between Australia and the other countries of the world with which we do business. I am sure that, if any attempt were made to stifle discussion on any of these measures, a wave of indignakind. tion would pass over the whole Commonthatwealth, and there would be a universal demand for the dissolution of this House. I hope that in any case, the electors would very soon have an opportunity to give their opinions on these matters. But, although the question of preferential trade has before the people, honourable members senting such diverse views have been turned, that the whole subject must be haustively discussed. In regard to the ment of bounties, there is an equally wide divergence of opinion on the question principle, and there are sure to be differences of view when we come to deal with particular proposals. Honourable bers have surely the right to debate these matters to the fullest extent, because i only by presenting both sides of a question for consideration that hope can be entertained wise and permanent determination. Certain honourable members may have behave come accustomed to regard principles from one point of view, and if they listened arguments from the other side they be lifted out of that groove of thought. The proposal to ask Parliament to grant cepted, bounties for new products is sure to protion voke a large amount of opposition, and therefore is not likely to be allowed pass without proper debate. Another plank in the Ministerial programme is stated in the following passage: To attract population, and to make provision for the appointment of a High are kindred ends to be achieved, together with not apply. and in relation to the matters just mentioned tinued- with which they are closely allied. I think honourable members must see that the appointment of a High Commissioner and the attraction of population are closely allied subjects, and that the closure could not be applied to one question without being applied to the other. The appointment of a High Commissioner will provoke a large amount of discussion. Suppose that one honourable member was so popular that several honourable members might that he should receive the and that in the opinion of other honourable members he did not possess the necessary qualifications to fill with credit to himself and with advantage to Australia. Ought the closure to be applied in order to prevent the latter from expressing - their disapprobation of the proposed appointment? Mr Johnson. think it should be applied to a case of that The Prime Minister announced A Bill relating to navigation and shipping in the light of the report expected from the Royal Commission now sitting is in contemplation. Having referred incidentally to that meabeen sure a few moments ago, I shall pass on repreto a measure which I think honourable remembers will admit is most controexversial, and which we were told is to paybe dealt with by this Parliament. I refer to the Bill for the establishment of the of iron and steel industry. It would cergreat tainly be wrong to attempt to force through the House, without proper debate, mema measure so extremely contentious in character as that one admittedly is. There t is are grave and urgent reasons to be advanced for and against the proposal, and any therefore to prevent the expression of them for its in the House would be to deny the right of the people through their representatives to an adequate voice in the disbursement of taxation. This, is not a legitimate occato sion, I submit, for applying the closure. might The Prime Minister went on to say. Two ocean mail contracts, provisionally acwill be submitted, while the whole quesof subsidies for sea carriage will be brought i.nder review as part of the general to forward policy alluded to. Do the Attorney-General, or the supporters of the closure, think that it should be applied to a measure involving the whole question of subsidies for sea carriage? Commissioner That is one to which I submit it should The Prime Minister conWe hope to receive reports from the Tariff Commission, probably during the present ses. sion, and to take them into immediate consideration. That, it will be seen at once, will raise the whole fiscal issue. Surely Ministers and their supporters will admit that a measure affecting the Tariff should not be dealt with without having been freely and properly discussed ! In my,opinion, it is a desire measure which calls for the fullest exercise appointment, of the right of free speech, if only because it involves increased taxation. Certainly the Tariff should not be interfered the post with by the application of the closure. Passing over a number of items which, although of less importance than those to which I have referred, are all more or less contentious in character, the Prime Minister conI do not eluded his policy speech with this statementThis list of subjects may be divided into two parts. The first is made up of minor Bills aiming at useful but independent additions to the ordinary machinery of Government. The other consists of major Bills embodying a progressive policy of development of the resources of the Commonwealth, intended to be carried out by systematic effort here and in the mother country, and, if necessary, in the sister dominions of the Empire. There is the programme which is proposed to be submitted to this Parliament, and which involves issues affecting our relations not only with the States, as States, but with other countries. It must necessarily provoke a great amount of discussion. It ought to receive the most critical examination. But that could not be given if the closure were applied. I trust that my arguments will appeal to the members of the Government and their supporters. Apart, however, from the Ministerial programme, very important motions have been tabled by private members, which involve fundamental changes in our system of coinage, administration, and government. These questions ought to receive the fullest possible criticism, and therefore ought not to be settled with the aid of the closure. Take, again, the estimates of expenditure for the following financial year. They might be framed in such a way as to involve an immense increase of public expenditure which would not meet 'with the approval of the Opposition.",166
100,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. For about an hour and a half the honourable member has been speaking, but he has not used one argument which has not been repeatedly submitted to the House upon this amendment. If ever an honourable member has been guilty of tedious repetition, certainly the honourable member for Lang has been this morning, and I submit, sir, that understanding order 276 the only course that is left open to you is to order him to discontinue his speech.",169
101,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I noticed that a considerable part of the argument of the honourable member for Lang was in reference to the possibilityof the application of the Hosure to the proposal for the appointment of a High Commissioner. I have not heard any other honourable member refer to that matter.,169
102,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,It has been referred to several times.,169
103,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Not when Mr Speaker was in the chair.,169
104,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It has not been referred to while I have been in the chair. If I had heard the argument before, I should have called attention to the fact. An honourable member must avoid repeating, not only what he has himself said, but also arguments used again and again by any other honourable member.",169
105,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"In the first place. I am not aware that I have repeated myself ; at any rate, I have certainly tried not to do so. I have simply referred to the items in the Ministerial programme which I regard as the most important, and as proposals to which the hew standing order should not apply. I certainly was not aware that the question of the appointment of the High Commissioner had already been referred to. In any case, I only referred to the matter in the most casual and incidental manner.",169
106,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member, I say again, has not repeated himself, 1 but he must remember not to repeat arguments used ""by other honourable members. I will read an extract from May, commencing on page 300A member who resorts to persistent irrelevance may, understanding order No. 24That standing order is somewhat of the same nature as ""our own standing order, referred to by the honourable member for Kalgoorliebe directed by the Speaker or the Chairman to discontinue his speech, after the attention of the House has been called to the conduct of the member ; and akin to irrelevancy is the frequent repetition of the same arguments, whether of the arguments of the member speaking, or the arguments of other members; an offence which may be met by the power given to the Chairman understanding order No. 24. So that an honourable member must not only avoid repeating himself, but avoid repeating arguments which have been used by other honourable members in the same debate.",169
107,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I bow to your ruling, but say that, while the reference in May applies to the repetition of arguments which have been used by other honourable members, it does not prohibit, as far as I can see, references to arguments used byother honourable members- a totally different thing. I submit that I have not been repeating arguments used by other honourable members.",169
108,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member need not discuss the ruling. New Standing Order: [REPRESENTATIVES.],169
109,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am not doing so, but only explaining my own position. I do not at all question the ruling at the present time. I believe the ruling is already the subject of a motion of dissent, which may be discussed at another time on its merits. I submit that the points which I have referred to are particularly relevant to the amendment which has been brought forward for the consideration of honourable members. Even if those points have been referred to before, I submit that possibly the mental condition of honourable members, as the result of the prolonged strain, did not render them very receptive of the arguments used. 1 was about to conclude my speech with an expression of opinion that Ministers must recognise that there is a very dangerous element in the proposal to Apply any form of closure to a. discussion of questions""which are of such a highly contentious character as those I have cited.",170
110,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown," The proceedings since the standing order was submitted by the Government last week have resolved themselves, not into a discussion of that proposal in itself, but a discussion as to whether such a proposal ought to be submitted, or, if submitted, ought to be considered. The members of the Government, and, I think I may sav the members on this side, are, without exception, of opinion that a condition of affairs had arisen which called not only for the submission of this motion, but for persistence in its support, and in the assertion of the right of the majority of this House. On the other hand, honourable members opposite took the ground that in their opinion, the circumstances did not justify such a proposition and that if it were submitted, they were bound to register, in the first place, in the strongest manner within their power, their protest against its submission. It appears to me-in fact, it appeared to me some time ago, but it appears to many now-that on both sides there has been a sufficiently clear affirmation of the position at this particular stage. We. on our side, have been unconvinced, and are still as resolute as before, in the opinion that a standing order of this kind is absolutely necessary for the transaction of business. Honourable members opposite, as I understand, are equally united in their opposition to this proposal. But it does appear to me that we have made that abundantly clear. Limitation of Debate. There has been a prolonged debate, not upon the question which we desired to have discussed, but upon the question whether it should be discussed or should be dealt with now. I venture to submit to honourable members that, at all events, this question ought to be taken as settled. We have had a full exposition from honourable members opposite of their reasons for the course they have taken. On our side, we have, although in a very brief fashion indeed, given what we consider a sufficient exposition of our resolution. The question has arisen whether, that being the case, we are not now in a position to put a period to this portion of the debate. It has been proposed to me that we should agree to regard the particular issue; ;as 'to whether, the standing order should be debated, and debated now, as being capable of determination without further debate, that in other words, the amendments which have been proposed one on another, I think in three parts, shall be put and disposed of. That would leave us face to face with the original motion for the adoption of the standing order. If that be done, it is asked that in order to afford time for the full examination of the details of this standing order, the House should then adjourn until the usual sitting hour tomorrow, when the debate on the standing order itself may begin in earnest. When I say debated "" in earnest,"" I mean not only without the imposition of any amendments simply for the purpose of postponing or suspending its decision, but practically dealt with without any desire to delay the proceedingsonly with a desire to examine the proposal with the care which it deserves, and to discuss it only so far as may be necessary to allow honourable members to decide on any reasonable amendments which may be submitted from any quarter. After consideration, it appears to my colleagues and myself that this suggestion does offer a means by which we can .come to close quarters on a proposition that has hitherto been dealt with only with a view to its not being discussedthat meeting at the ordinary hour, and rising at the usual hour of adjournment, we may be able to dispose of this standing order in such fashion as the House may desire. Of course, we, on our side, are convinced that the closer the scrutiny given to the proposed standing order the more its principle will be affirmed. Honourable members opposite no doubt hold, on the other hand, that the closer the scrutiny the more they will be justified in asking for its amendment in any particular. What is agreed is that any amendment so proposed shall be fairly dealt with, and shall not be a means of delaying or avoiding the issuer-that we shall come to close grips with the question, and shall deal with the proposed standing order as-a piece of ordinary business in the ordinary way. There is no understanding of any kind as to any particular amendment to be submitted or not to be submitted. There is no attempt to restrict the freedom of the House in either regard; the only arrangement arrived at is by mutual understanding, and to the effect that this standing order with any amendments shall be disposed of in the shortest possible time consistent with its proper deliberation, and that, under no circumstances shall the debate be permitted to proceed beyond Thursday's sitting. The understanding is that before that time, or at that time, we shall dispose of the standing order in its final form. That is the proposition that has been submitted, and it appears to me one which we might fairly well accept.",170
111,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,What guarantee is there that the agreement will be carried out?,171
112,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,We shall want a guarantee in writing from the leader of the Opposition !,171
113,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I can only say.that I have not the least doubt as to the agreement being carried out in every particular. I have great hope that the agreement will be carried out some time before the close of Thursday's sitting. There is the great advantage that this being, not a piece of legislation in the ordinary sense, but a piece of what we may term the domestic legislation pf the House, it relates to a subject on which honourable members are particularly entitled to express themselves with individual freedom. I hope it will be regarded, not as a party measure, but from the point of view to which I had regard when I submitted the motion ; that is to say, as a necessary and inevitable condition of the transaction of the business of Parliament in these modern times. If that be the case, I have little fear but that before Thursday night we shall arrive at a standing order, which, I hope, will receive the support of the whole of the House; but, if not so fortunate, will receive the support of the great body of honourable members.",171
114,Mr EWING,Unknown,Thursda y night?,171
115,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The agreement is only that, if. necessary, the debate shall be prolonged until Thursday night. There is no agreement that the decision is to be postponed until then, but that it shall be taken if possible tomorrow night, or, if not then, on Wednesday night-bu t that it must be decided by Thursday. That is the undertaking, and it appears to be a very fair one, affording the utmost liberty to honourable members. The arrangement will exclude no expression of opinion by any honourable member, but will leave the House perfectly free, although there is a general agreement that by a particular time, having regard to the question, we shall have been able to exhaust every one of the points we are called upon to consider. I think I have made it clear that the proposal submitted is that the amendments now before us shall be negatived today, and that the House shall then adjourn until the ordinary hour of meeting tomorrow, when, after questions, and the usual preliminary business, we shall proceed with the consideration of the standing order until it is disposed of, either before Thursday, or on Thursday, in any event.",171
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown, I hope I may be permitted to make a few remarks in reply to the statement of the Prime Minister.,171
117,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member may proceed.,171
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has stated to the House the substance of some proposals, and of a practical agreement which has been made with a view to putting a period to these proceedings. That course on either side has, I believe, been dictated purely by a reference to public interest. I believe it to be an arrangement which leaves both sides^and I say this frankly and fully-wit h prestige unimpaired, and, was' going to add, their positions unturned, though I do not wish to use the word in an opprobrious sense. What I mean is, that we stand where we did, with the Government resolute to have some standing order of the kind carried, and we, on our side, equally resolute to have no responsibility whatever concerning the proposal as a whole.",171
119,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The Prime Minister is more reasonable than is the Attorney General.,171
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As I have already indicated, the view which should be taken of these matters is that which concerns the great public outside, and, consequently, the transaction of public business inside. However much we may struggle and fight, we must always keep that objective in view. It must be quite clear to orable members that the Opposition could have kept this discussion going for some time longer.",171
121,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Le t us go on.,172
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I can assure the honourable member that I have not the slightest wish that the debate should go on.,172
123,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Oh , let us go on 1",172
124,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,172
125,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Le t us go on for another week.,172
126,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order 1,172
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I hope the honRules orable member for Barrier will allow me registered to proceed. I have made suggestions Transmission purely, as I say, in the public interest, wealth, and without reference to our venience in any way whatever; and I take that to be the attitude on the other side. I have no doubt that the Government, like the Opposition, could, if they liked*, very much prolong the present sitting. But the proposal now made by the Prime Minister, in which I cordially and thoroughly agree, is that we should revert to trie ordinary procedure relating to the conduct of the business of this House, and proceed to the discussion of the proposal which appears to be so objectionable to honourable members on this side. We concede nothing regarding our attitude to the proposed standing order. We shall give it our opposition unreservedly. We lake no responsibility whatever for it. We simplv agree, in the public interest, to put a period to the debate, that the consideration of the matter shall terminate before a certain time. In the interests of both sides, it is now suggested that there should he a period in which we may prepare for the debate which will take place tomorrow in the ordinary and regular way. I think that the proposal which has been described by the Prime Minister may well be agreed to by all parties at once. Amendment of the amendment negatived. Amendment, as amended, negatived.
