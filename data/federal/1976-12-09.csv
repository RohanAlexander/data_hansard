2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Australian Symphony Orchestras To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that we are deeply concerned at the threat to the continuation of symphony orchestras throughout Australia posed by the IAC and Green reports. We believe that the Government should not allow the symphony orchestras of Austraha to be reduced in any way at all. Your petitioners humbly pray that your honourable House will take steps to ensure the continuation and growth of our symphony orchestras, thereby ensuring that the quality of life of the people of this countiy shall be maintained. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Abel, Mr Connolly, Mr Connor, Dobie, Mr Graham and Mr Charles Jones. Peddons received. Australian Broadcasting Commission To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government: 1. Subscribe to the view that the Australian Broadcasting Commission belongs to the people and not to the government of the day whatever polidcal party. 2. Eschew all means, direct or indirect, of diminishing the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. 3. Reject all proposals for the introduction of advertising into ABC programs. 4. Develop methods for publicly funding the Commission which will prevent the granting or withholding of funds being used as a method ofdiminishing its independence. 5. Ensure that any general Australia which may seem desirable from time to time snail be conducted publicly and that strong representation of the public shall be included within the body conducting the enquiry. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Keating, Mr Les MCMahon, Mr Morris and Mr Antony Whitlam. Petitions received. To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that; the Budget will increase unemployment to unprecedented and crisis proportions at a time when hundreds of thousands of Austrahans, especially school-leavers, young workers and apprentices, are without work; the Budget completes the dismantling of Medibank as a simple, effecuve universal health insurance scheme, providing basic coverage for the total community; the Budget, by its heavy cuts in urban and transpon programs, will worsen the quality of life available to many PETITIONS Australians; the Budget will compel state governments to reduce their services and increase charges; the Budget reduces spending on Aboriginal affairs by 30 per cent and returns expenditure on Aborigines to pre-1972 days; the Budget seriously disadvantages migrant groups, most notably in employment and health, and leaves room for concern over the future of ethnic radio; the Budget, despite the government's earlier rhetoric about defence threats to Austraha, continues to hold the size of the armed services at present levels; and the Budget, despite all the above, still cannot be expected to reduce Australia's annual inflation rate below twelve percent. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the 1976 Budget be redrafted to provide for economic recovery within the guidelines laid down by the Australian Labor Government's 1973 Budget. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. Mr Mr Charles Jones and Mr Les MCMahon. Petitions received. Pensions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That those who have retired and those who are about to retire, are being severely and adversely affected by inflation and Australian economic circumstances. The continuance of the mean's test on pensions causes undue hardship to them. We call on the Government to immediately abolish the mean's test on all Aged Pensions. To ensure a pension for all on retirement, and a guarantee that all Australian citizens will retire with dignity. Acknowledge that a pension is a: 'Right and not a Charity'. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, enquiries into broadcasting in by Mr Viner. Petition received. Ethnic Radio To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth, that they are deeply concerned with the low standard of the present Hunganan language program broadcast on radio station 2EA. On behalf of the wide cross section of thousands of AusBudget 1976-77 tralians of Hungarian origin, who understand the Hungarian language and have a knowledge of the more than a thousand years old Hungarian culture, and have good taste, protest in this way as a last resort, because all our efforts to date for a fundamental change have been in vain. Your petitioners most humbly pray that this House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should help the Hungarian speaking community to regain confidence in the democratically elected House of Representatives known for its conscientious and wise judgement in restoring peace and faith in the democratic prinaples,which unfortunately are missing from present management set up of the Ethnic Radio broadcasters. The petitioners aim is to help with advice, and not to contol the broadcasting, and for this we would very much appreciate the opportunity for a small selected delegation to meet the Ministers concerned. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Abel. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned (electors of the Division of) Capricornia in the State of Queensland respectfully showeth objection to Metrics andrequestthe Government to revert to the Imperial system. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by MrCarige. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (a) That the use of uranium as a source of energy is currendy unacceptable as it presents problems including radioactive waste, military implications and environmental degradation. (b) That there can, at present, be no assurances that radioactive materials exported for peaceful purposes will not be used in the production of nuclear weapons. (c) That there is not, as yet, any known safe method of disposing of radioactive wastes, nor is there likely to be. (d) That the expon of uranium from Australia is internationally irresponsible benefit to Australia. (e) That the export of uranium from Australia discourages importing countries development funds in finding viable alternatives. (f) That only the overdeveloped industrial nations will benefit from Australian uranium and the gap between these countries and the energy-starved third world will increase yet further. (g) That the securing of land rights by Australian Aborigines, promised by successive governments, is prejudiced by uranium mining. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will immediately cease the mining and prohibit the export of uranium until perfecdy safe methods of final disposal for radioactive wastes have been guaranteed; will greatly increase expenditure on research into safe, clean and inexhaustible sources of energy; and will aid underdeveloped countries in their efforts to secure a fanshare of the world's energyresources,while at the same time honouring its obligations to the future of humanity. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Carige. Petition received. Aboriginal Land Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: That the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1976 does not satisfy the Aboriginal needs for land in the Northern Territory. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should: 1. Extend the freeze on European claims to the unalienated Crown Lands of the Northern Territory until 12 months after the passage of the Bill; and to provide for speedy lodging and hearing of Aboriginal Claims. The hearMetric System ing of Aboriginal claims have been postponed as a result of Government decisions. Aboriginals should not be penalised; 2. Amend the Bill to ensure: (a) The removal of all powers to pass Land Rights Legislation from Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, particularly its control over sacred sites, entry permits, control over the seas adjoining Aboriginal land, the fishing rights of non-Aborigines, the right of Aborigines to enter pastoral stations, and control of wildlife on Aboriginal land. (b) The control of Aborigines of all roads passing through Aboriginal lands. (c) The restoration of the Aboriginal Land ComUranium missioner's powers to hear claims based on need as well as traditional claims lodged by Aborigines. (d) Therestorationof all powers vested in Lands Councils and the Land Commissioner in the 197S Land Rights Bill.

(f) A provision that land-owning groups of Aborigines may apply to form separate trusts if they wish. (g) The removal of artificial barriers to traditional owners imposed by the Territoiy Borders on all tribes so affected. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Connor. and is not, in the long term, of Petition received. Education from investing research and To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of AustraUarespectfullyshoweth. That residents of the suburb of Fraser, in the Australian Capital Territory are deeply concerned at the lack of adequate educational facilities to be made available to our primary school aged children. That plans toremovechildren daily to other suburbs will cause overcrowding, will force parents to private transpon or pay bus levies, and will make a mockery of the frequently quoted ACT. Schools Authority pohcy that primary school students should have access to a school within reasonable walking distance of their homes. That population trends in Fraser and adjoining suburbs more than adequately prove the need for a separate primary school in each of these suburbs. That a primary school in the suburb would provide an important focus for an area which currently lacks any identity as a community. That plans to distribute Fraser students between two to four different schools in adjoining areas may well frustrate the social development of many of these young persons, forcing them into a situation where they must relate to two different sets of peers. Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will take urgent steps to revise current plans for the education of our children with a view to the provision of a government primary school in Fraser. And your pedtioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Fry. Petition received. To the Speaker and the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that many Australians are concerned at the recent outbreak of racial riots and killings in South Africa. We your petitioners do therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government: (1) Call upon the South African Government to eliminate apanheid and racial discrimination; (2) Withdraw the Australian Trade Commissioners from South Africa in accordance with UN. resolution 3411G (December 1975.) And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hamer. Petition received. Residential Development in the Australian To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: (a) that the proposed residential development of the vacant block bounded by Fitchett Street, Kitchener Street and Yamba Drive, Garran is unsuitable in so busy and dangerous an area and grossly unfair to the public, particularly the residents and property owners m Garran; and (b) that we wish the block to be left as an open area and made safe for use by in the area and as a pleasant waiting area for visitors to Woden Valley Hospital. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should bear in mind that: 1. The Yamba Drive/Kitchener Street comer is an extremely dangerous corner with accidents and near-accidents there a regular occurrence; the proposed development will increase the volume of traffic and parking congestion, by residents and visitors, on the already very busy streets bounding the block. Also, if the proposed large development (residenual) at the other end of Fitchett Street is proceeded with, an additional very heavy volume of traffic will emanate from those sites along Fitchett was not constructed wide enough to cope with the expected extra heavyflowand extra street parking. 2. The reality of the Woden Valley Hospital, commenced in 1972, has seriously altered the situation since the correspondence and discussion with residents in 1970-71. Today, residents in the area have to cope with disturbances caused (a) by ambulance and police sirens at any time of day or night; and (b) by the much greater volume of traffic brought by hospital staff, patients, visitors and all kinds of services to the hospital and its accommodation areas. 3. We are already overwhelmed by the extent of future extensions and developments on the Hospital site-mos t of which were not public knowledge in 1970-71. These extensions include: (a) a new 6-storey laboratory block, (b) the extension of the car park with access to Kitchener Street and (c) a helicopter station on the Kitchener Street/Yamba Drive comer. 4. Other invasions on the peace and privacy of Garran residents include: sirens: Phillip fire station trucks sirens: Phillip police cars South Africa much shouting and screaming by participants and spectators and disturbance from public address systems on the sports fields and ovals in the areas-ver y often at weekends and other times when most Canberra residents can expect peace and quiet. much street congestion through heavy traffic and extremely limited parking facilities in areas adjacent to the sportsfieldsand ovals, creating serious traffic hazards. 5. Nearby open spaces, namely sports fields and ovals (which are fenced), are used regularly by schools and clubs for organised sports and are not available to the children who therefore desperately, need the vacant block in question as a safe play area. N.B. In addition, even if available, the existing sports fields are not safely accessible. It is far too dangerous for small children and older children with bicycles etc. to cross the four-lane Yamba Drive or busy Kitchener Street with its already dangerous crossing to the Garran Primary School. 6. With future Hospital developments eliminating the open space on that side of Kitchener Street we wish the existing trees on the block to remain-the sketchy plan provided Capital Territory by the NCDC shows the proposed destruction of the best stand of trees on the block. 7. The values of nearby properties will be seriously and unfairly depreciated and the owners of some of these properties will be greatly disadvantaged by the loss of their present views across to the hills. 8. If there is any urgency to construct seven town houses in this pan of Canberra, we suggest that the NCDC proceed instead with the development of some of the large number of home sites on Swinger Hill already serviced andreadyfor immediate development. the many children and residents 9. Garran is a suburb without an officially-designated suburban park. Children's play areas existforthe safety and welfare of children in the Dennis Street and Curlewis Crescent areas; the block in question is the only safe area available to the children in the Fitchett Street area of the suburb. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Haslem. Petition received. Citizen Band Radio To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: Street which, in our opinion, The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Canberra, ACT. respectfully showeth that provision should be made in the Wireless Telegraphy Act for children to be able to use wai kie talkies. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House amend the Wireless Telegraphy Act to allow for the use of citizen's band radio by children. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Haslem. Petition received. United Nations Secretariat for the Social and Economic Development Council To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Respresentatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth by your lack of support for the nomination of Elizabeth Reid to the United Nadons Secretariat for the Social and Economic Development Council. We believe that during Ms Reid's tenure as Women's Advisor she gained world-wide suppon and recognition for Australia's efforts to represent the needs and interests of all women. Her direction and drive at the United Nadons Convention for International Women's Year in Mexico City helped to unite a divided assembly and lay the groundwork for continued international co-operation towards a goal of full equality for all peoples of the world. Her international reputation is secure. Your petitioners humbly pray that your honourable House will decide in favour of wholehearted support for Ms Reid's nomination, thereby ensuring that the high quality of Australian representatives to the United Nations shall be maintained and augmented. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hurford. Petition received. Symphony Orchestra in Newcastle To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Hunter Valley Region respectfully showeth the lack of a resident professional symphony orchestra in Newcastle and surrounding area, with consequent denial to the citizens of adequate provision of concerts, opera, ballet, school concerts, teaching of various orchestral instruments and career opportunities for young musicians. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament give due and early consideration to the provision of funds, in association with the N.S.W. State Government, Local Governments and the community of this region, for the estabUshment and maintenance of the Hunter Symphony Orchestra, consisting initially of 40 players, located in Newcasde and serving the cultural needs of the 500 000 inhabitants of the region, in accordance with the proposal and budget submitted to the Industries Assistance Commission. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Charles Jones. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House i i Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully ihoweth: That, although we accept the verdict of the Australian people in the 1975 election, we do not accept therightofa jovernor-General to dismiss a Prime Minister who mainains the confidence of the House of Respresentatives. We believe that the continued presence of Sir John Kerr as Governor General is a cause of division among the Australian people. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House call on Sir John Kerr to resign as Australian Governor General. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Les MCMahon. Petition received. that we are deeply concerned Court Proceedings To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled.

Your petitioner is the informant in certain committal proceedings commenced on the 20th November 1975 in the Queanbeyan Coun of Petty Sessions wherein it is alleged inter alia that certain former Ministers of the Crown, namely the Honourable Edward Gough Whitlam QC, the Honourable Reginald Reginald Francis Xavier Connor, the Honourable James Ford Cairns and the Honourable Lionel Keith Murphy QC. have breached Section 86(1 )(c) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 as amended. 2.

3,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,MEAT EXPORTS,"Will the Minister for Primary Industry inform the House officially before it rises the details of the new scheme of quota entitlements for the entry of meat into United States market which was recommended to him by the Australian Meat Board and the exporters of meat more than 2 weeks ago? Will he adhere to his publicly stated views about the independence of the Meat Board and non-interference in its recommendations? Against the background of a strongly rising sellers' market and even better prospects in the future, does he think it is in the interests of the cattlemen who are struggling to survive that they should be compelled to sell to the less remunerative markets, with less remunerative returns to the producers themselves? In a somewhat humorous vein, would the Minister entertain such a quaint idea if he were selling meat himself?",23
4,Mr SINCLAIR,MEAT EXPORTS,"I trunk all honourable members would be interested to know that as a result of the announcement of the present scheme of diversification-that is the scheme presently operating-the prices for meat paid in Japan rose by 10c per lb. So, contrary to the general indication of therighthonourable gentleman's question, it would seem that the change in diversification in fact has provided a direct benefit to producers. I think it is of interest that following devaluation and following the increasing demand in what are known as the opportunity markets, there has been a significant improvement in prices paid for Australian cattle and for Australian meat generally-no t only beef but also mutton. I would hope that the benefit of those prices are passed back to the cattle producer and to the Australian livestock producer. I am sure that is a wish which the right honourable geiftle< man would share. One week ago-no t 2 weeks ago as the right honourable gentleman suggested- I received advice from the Australian Meat Board that it had accepted that some modifications should be made to the presently accepted diversification plan. Since then there have been dramatic changes in the world market place. In answer to a question yesterday by the honourable member for Capricornia, I mentioned the benefit that we could see flowing from orders from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I also mentioned yesterday, as the right honourable gentleman will recall, the circumstances of discussions in the United States which are critical to the resolution of meat opportunities for that market-whic h is what diversification is all about-in 1977. In answer to a question by the honourable member for Wilmot yesterday I mentioned with respect to the disadvantaged markets and particularly exporters in Tasmania, that there had been an acceptance that a change needs to be made in diversification arrangements. However, because of changing circumstances, I am most anxious that no announcement be made of changes in diversification which may need further alteration within the course of the next week or so. As a result of advice from the Meat Board and from my advisers, I am waiting until we can be sure that whatever diversification entitlement is to apply for the American market in 1977 it should be a final arrangement. As soon as I am advised that it can be afinalarrangement, I will make a public statement. I appreciate the right honourable gentleman's concern. Many honourable members in this House have been concerned for a longtimethat greater returns could be paid to Australian livestock producers. I trust that that will be possible as a result of whatever diversification regime is finally implemented. I can assure therighthonourable gentleman that in any event there is no intervention, nor will there be, in the independence of the Australian Meat Board. NA",23
5,Mr HURFORD,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"Has the Treasurer noted the report from the latest edition of the London Economist to the effect that Australia's devaluation was not justified on balance of payments grounds, will worsen a dangerously unmanageable inflation rate and could spark off a rash of competitive devaluations and/or trade restrictions by our trading partners? Have these criticisms by a conservative economic journal of world repute caused him to doubt the wisdom of indulging in such an enormous devaluation? If not, can he say whether the prospect of retaliatory action by our trading partners is one that he views with equanimity?",23
6,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,I certainly have noted the views reported in the London Economist. The Government rejects those views and the grounds on which they were based. I can report to the honourable gentleman that my discussions yesterday with international money market people reflect very much the fact that the decision was taken to devalue at the rate we announced at thetimehas been widely recognised abroad appropriate to Australia's economic circum1971. stances and has been a major factor in dispellingThe the uncertainty which existed in the months before the decision was taken.,23
7,Mr WILLIS,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,Nonsense !,24
8,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"The honourable member for Gellibrand claims that that is nonsense. Let honourable gentleman look at judgments abroad as to the soundness of the decision to devalue. could mention that our executive director at International Monetary Fund, Mr Whitelaw, has reported that the executive board appreciated the factors behind the decision to devalue. informed also that all directors who spoke ported Australia's decision to devalue. In dition, several directors welcomed the greater flexibility that would be permitted under the exchange arrangements. I am informed also that there was no suggestion at the International Monetary Fund executive board table that the devaluauon could be regarded as a competitive devaluation. NA  to the Minister for Transport. What ships been built at the State Dockyard at Newcastle over the past 5 years? What were the original clear contracted dates and actual delivery dates for those vessels completed? By what amount did the final prices of the vessels completed by the State Dockyard since 1 January 1972 exceed original contract prices? What investment has been made by the New South Wales GovernLeader ment in new shipbuilding plant and machinery at the State Dockyard, Newcastle, in the last 5 years? Is the Minister able to indicate has been lost as a result of industrial disputes the State Dockyard in, say, the last 2 years? Finally, can the Minister indicate how prothere ductivity in Australian shipyards compares that overseas?",24
9,Mr NIXON,SHIPBUILDING AT NEWCASTLE,It so happens that I have the information the honourable member is seeking.,24
10,Mr KEATING,SHIPBUILDING AT NEWCASTLE,I take a point of order. What if the the honourable member does us the favour of abysmal. tabling it and then sitting down. Obviously the productivity information has all been prepared.,24
11,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPBUILDING AT NEWCASTLE,There is no substance to the point of order.,24
12,Mr NIXON,SHIPBUILDING AT NEWCASTLE,"Seve n ships and one ship conversion have been completed at the State Dockwhichyard since 1 January 1972. The first of those ships was the W. D. A.

It wasfinallydelivered on 3 Sepnew tember 1975. The original cost of the 7 vesselsthe contract prices-wa s $75.5m. The final cost of the vessels was $93m. There was $45m in subsidy paid for those ships during that period.",24
13,Mr UREN,SHIPBUILDING AT NEWCASTLE,"I take a point of order. There have been 2 questions asked this morning from the Government side. In both cases the replies have been extremely lengthy. This is a quite blatant this morning by the Minister. It is suphave posed to be an answer to a question without notice. He is reading from a document. It is quite that it is a question on notice. I ask that the Minister make the statement after question time or that at least his reply be shortened, so that everybody in the House is given a fair go on the the last question day of the sitting.",24
14,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPBUILDING AT NEWCASTLE,"I heard what the Deputy of the Opposition said. It is not a point of order. I call the Minister. I ask him to bring his what time answer to a conclusion. at Mr NIXON- I will be as brief as I can, but it is interesting information for the House. In 1975 were 200 stoppages representing 174 000 with man-hours. To 30 November this year there were 67 stoppages representing 158 000 manhours. The whole point is that the yard's performance has been abysmal. That has been conceded, the House will note, by the President of Australian Council of Trade Unions. He accepts that the yard's performance has been The real reason for the high cost is that of the yard is too low. The Tariff Board, in its report, stated that a Japanese yard, for example, could produce more than 12 times the gross tonnage of an Australian yard, using about 8 times the amount of steel. The Australian smpbuilding industry study mission, sent overreference, seas by my predecessor, found that the yards overseas can, on average, produce three or four times as much per man as can the State Dockfinal yard. Finally, Professor Fink said that the Australian shipyards would need to improve their and productivity by 75 per cent if they were to have any chance of being competitive. So the House can see the real reason why the Government put forwardfirmheads of agreement for the yard December to look at if we are to continue to support shipreasons behind building of that capacity in Australia. NA",24
15,Mr LES MCMAHON,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,Has the Treasurer seen the report that members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development regard Australia's claim that a devaluation necessary because of a massive flow of funds of the country as laughable? Has the Treasurer noticed the report of hostile reaction to Australia's devaluation from governments overseas? Was the rapid decision to reverse the exchange rate slightly the result of pressure from foreign governments and international monetary circles?,25
16,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"The response on this matter quotas. must be perfectly clear. I re-raise the question the why the devaluation decision was taken. In the increased? first place, there had been a continuing and quickness of indeed increasing lack of competitiveness beindustries to the tween Australian industry and industries in so more rapidly neutralise many countries abroad.",25
17,Mr HUNT,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,Why?,25
18,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"Why was that? Simply because the Opposition, when in government, allowed escalation of wage and salary costs which absolutely unsustainable. Between 1970 and the first half of 1976 unit labour costs in this countrygood increased significantly more than the weighted average of such costs in our major trading partners. If there is any group in this country which must accept responsibility ing reasons which led to that decision to it is certainly Labor Party members in this House at present. Of that there is no doubt.",25
19,Unknown,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,Opposition members interjecting,25
20,Mr SPEAKER,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,Order! Mr Ruddock-We know who the culprits are. dards,25
21,Mr SPEAKER,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,Order! The House will come to order.,25
22,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"In short, what I was emphasiswhen ing was that as a direct consequence of Labor Party mismanagement Australian industry becoming less and less competitive. Quite apart from the underlying factor to which I have made the speculation to which certain members of the Opposition made a very heavy contribution made that process inevitable during the period before the actual decision was taken. I have seen references to comments, unsourced unnamed, in respect of overseas reporting. I have already said to the honourable member for Adelaide that the executive board meeting of the has International Monetary Fund held on 3 reported that it appreciates the the decision to devalue. All directors who spoke at that meeting supported Australia's decision to devalue. In addition, several directors at that meeting welcomed the greater flexibility that would be permitted under the new exchange arrangements. If any regard is was to be had for opinions abroad on this Governout ment's decision to devalue, one cannot go past the opinion of the International Monetary Fund. NA",25
23,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and it concerns the totally misleading statements that equate devaluation with the permanence of changes to tariffs and Is it not correct that, since World War II, speed of response of domestic economic changes to significant cunency alterations has Does this not mean therefore that the response of domestic and export devaluation changes will all the the so-called equivalent permanent tariff inflationary effects and increase the balance of payments? So, I ask: Can the speed of this response be accommodated by the an new managed float arrangements to be deterwas mined by the Exchange Rate Review Committee? Finally, since when has it represented economic analysis to ignore the most pervasive and consistent factor of all economic and financial experience-the speed of responsiveness of the economic community and the for the underlytime scale of events? devalue, Mr MALCOLM FRASER-I think that the honourable gentleman has obviously put a great deal of thought into that question. One of the things that have been quite remarkable over the last few days has been the way in which some commentators in this country have used stanof judgment in relation to the devaluation decision which were utterly dissimilar to the standards of judgment that were used in 1974 there was a devaluation. In those circumstances it ought to be noted that the then was Government also took a number of other measures which at the same time were highly inflationary. To find commentators under those circumstances praising that decision and then using some quite different and obverse standard ofjudgment at the present ume is an odd characseparate teristic indeed. All the information coming to this Government from overseas and the indicators available to the Reserve Bank of Australia and through the normal market forces indicate that the moves undertaken by the relation to devaluation are accepted overseas as wise and sensible. At the same time they are being proved to be a success by the market reaction that has already occurred in Australia. is no way in which the market reaction in this country and the indicators available to the Reserve Bank give any support for some of the wilder commentaries that are coming from honourable gentlemen opposite.

25,Mr LUSHER,ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY PEOPLE,A bit of alternative life.,26
26,Dr JF CAIRNS,ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY PEOPLE,"It istimethe honourable member adopted an alternative life. He has enough of the present one. The Prime Minister will know that I am not one of those people believe that the Government can make a sigwill nificant difference to the state of the I have said many times from that side of the table, it depends on the economic system and Government is secondary to that I ask the Prime Minister: Will he ensure in the next few weeks when Parliament is not sitting that there is nothcan ing the Government can do that is not done prevent any need being satisfied, especially in relation to unemployment and loss of income in the country? Will he ensure that no puritanical economic policy, or any other kind of policy, vents the satisfaction of genuine need, as far the Government can achieve that?",26
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY PEOPLE,"I thank the honourable honourable gentleman for his question. I think his concernforthose in genuine need is widely recognised throughout the Australian comthat mumty. I believe the Government has demonme strated throughout the course of this year that it has taken a number of actions to direct assistance to those most in need. The honourable gentlebasis man will well know, and I believe he will supthat port, the decision taken to change the previous basis of child endowment payments to the present family allowance system. That system concentrates the benefits of assistance in low income families who just could not take advanviews. tage of the previous arrangements. I believe that that change has been widely supported, not only agree. on all sides of the House but also throughout the Australian community. We have also taken decisions to index pensions automatically so that decisions do not have to be taken in relation to those matters. That, again, is a demonstration of our Government's concern and, I believe, of this Parliament's concern for those who are in a genuine position of need in the AusGovernment in tralian community. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has introduced, as the honourable There gentleman will recall, a number of programs designed quite specifically to assist young people who have had difficulty in getting jobs and who have, in recenttimes,left school. Those policies are of a continuing nature. They are already proving to be remarkably successful. I know quite well that the Minister will be monitoring those programs to see where and how improvements can be made. At the same time, a certain decisions have been taken because of difficulties in assessing the facts of the situation when somebody leaves school in a particular year. Questions arise such as whether they will had go back to school, whether they will go on to some other form of education or whether they who are genuinely seeking employment. The House know of the decisions which were taken in economy. As relation to that matter. At the same time, within the province of the the Department of Social Security and of the Director-General there is a capacity to use a discretion in relation to hardship. Where hardship be properly demonstrated that discretion, I to am sure, will be used. I thank the honourable gentleman for his question and for his expression of concern which I believe ought properly to be an expression of concern of the Parhament for prethose in need. For the Government's part, where as we can see a genuine and proper need we will certainly act. Where I part company from the gentleman is in the nature of policies which are designed on a permanent and enduring basis to overcome our economic ills. I hope if the honourable gentleman disagrees with and with this Government on the policies we pursue, he will at least do us the credit ofjudging the arguments on their merits and not on the of imputing improper motives. I believe the objectives that we all have in the Parliament are similar in relation to economic recovery. There is a very marked difference of opinion on the means by which that process can properly be achieved. The Government has firm The honourable gentleman would also have views with which, I am afraid, I could not ALBURY-WODONGA DEVELOPMENT NA",26
28,Mr HOLTEN,CORPORATION,"I ask the Minister for Environment, Housmg and Community Development whether he has noted a statement by the Victorian Minister for State Development and Decentralisation that the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation faces a cash crisis and will be out of money in a few days' time because of a delay in the signing of the appropriate financial agreement. Is this statement correct? If so, what action can the Minister take to remedy the situation?",27
29,Mr NEWMAN,CORPORATION,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have noted the comment in the Age today. I should make it clear from the beginning that if there has been any delay in signing these financial agreements it is not because of fault or delinquency on the part of this Government. The facts are these: At the ministerial council meeting all governments indicated their intention to sign the Albury Wodonga financial agreements for 1976-77. At that council meeting on 8 November it was agreed that the financial agreements should be signed before 30 November. I think that all honourable members here would realise that these are complex documents and therefore they have to be scrutinised very carefully by the officers concerned. That was done by the officers of my Department, and the draft agreements were circulated to both New South Wales and Victoria before 30 November. The response to the draft agreements is that the Victorian Government has formally agreed to sign the agreements. Unfortunately as yet the New South Wales Government has not formally agreed to the draft agreements that were sent to it but it has indicated its intention to sign them. As soon as the New South Wales Government gives its formal approval we will take urgent steps to ensure that the agreements between the 3 governments are completed. I am asked whether there is a cash crisis. As the 3 governments have indicated their intention to sign, I think that the usual mechanisms can now apply. That should prevent any cash crisis for the Corporation occurring in the short term. CURRENCY DEVALUATION: NA",27
30,Mr HAYDEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,Does the Treasurer recollect saying in this House 3 months ago-o n 7 Septem Mr ber-that devaluation of the Australian dollar would cause higher unemployment? Does he this also recollect saying in this House last Tuesday that the devaluation of this week will restore balance between economic sectors? Does he recognise that those 2 statements taken in conjunction indicate a belief on the part of the Treasurer that a balanced economy requires much higher unemployment? I ask him: How much higher?,27
31,Mr LYNCH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"How ironic it is that the honourable gentleman, who has been responsible for much of the speculation that took place before the decision and which in fact led to the decision, ought to assume some position of probing in this House. Let me go on the record again as saying that the honourable gentleman more than virtually any other man in this countiy must accept responsibility for recent events during the period from September to when the decision was made. He is one who ought to have known better and who I believe does know better, but he is prepared to sacrifice a sense of national responsibility for purely party political reasons. The honourable gentleman asked me about 2 statements. The first was a statement issued by me some months ago, with consistent statements by me, by the Prime Minister and by other senior ministers since our return to Government, about the impact of a devaluation decision. What the honourable gentleman conveniently overlooks is that all the statements which were made up to the time of the decision to devalue, and the statements on devaluation as a matter of Government policy, were made without any reference whatsoever to offsetting anti-inflationary measures. That was a consistent line. No one on this side of the House has sought to deny that the decision to devalue has some inflationary consequence. But I say to the honourable gentleman that, unlike the decision taken by him and his colleagues, this Government has taken a series of offsetting measures which are designed to protect the community against the inflationary consequence of the decision. The honourable gentleman went on to seek from me some estimate of the precise figure of inflation.",27
32,Mr HAYDEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I asked the Treasurer to quantify the level of unemployment that he projected would follow a devaluation. Once again, he is confused on this issue.",27
33,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"There is no point of order. The answer needs to be relevant to the question and I rule that the answer is relevant. LYNCH- I find it a matter of classic irony that the honourable gentleman should seek in House precision in areas in which he refused consistently, time after time, as Treasurer to elucidate in this House. I can recall the honourof able gendeman refusing to indicate the size the Budget deficit to the nearest $ 1,000m. That is the record of the honourable gentleman. I have no doubt that he did that because he sought cover up the fact, as this Government discovered when it came into office, that the deficit was ning at about $4 billion. The honourable gentleman talks in this House about unemployment and inflauon. One thing that is a matter of is what occurred during the past 3 years. The position created the legacy of tragedy in both employment and inflation. The honourable gendeman, from his own experience, will know that it is not possible at this time to quantify levels of unemployment or inflation that might follow from devaluation. NA",27
34,Mr COTTER,GOLD MINING INDUSTRY,I should like to ask a question of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The Minister would be aware that over the past 12 months or so there have large scale retrenchments from the gold mining industry in Western Australia. I ask: Has this added significantly to unemployment in the ern goldfields area? Will the Minister steps his Department has taken to alleviate the situation? Were these steps successful? Is there fact a shortage of skilled workers in the KalLebanese goorlie region which is severely hampering new development?,28

Also, I understand that at this meeting that called by the Kalgoorlie Town Council a local accountant said that there was a severe shortage suitable qualified staff for commerce and busiof ness and that many employers had experienced difficulty in employing qualified office staff. So I am pleased to be able to report that, thanks in no to small measure to the efforts of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, the employment siturunation in Kalgoorlie has improved markedly. NA record Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Minister for OpImmigration and Ethnic Affairs a question. He unhas been asked several questions during recent months about the entitlement of Lebanese refugees to come to Australia and the facilities the for interviewing them overseas. On this last sitting day, therefore, I ask the Minister Has the Government decided to continue the broader entry criteria which he announced would be subject to review at the end of 1976? Has the Government decided to retain in Cyprus the task force, whose operation he announced last September would be reviewed at the end of 3 been months? Has the Government yet decided to reinstate the migration team in Damascus? If the answer in any case is that the Government has eastnot yet made a decision I ask: When does the say what Minister expect a decision?",28

Minister will be aware of the various profor fruit cannery rationalisation in the that there of the areaValley. Goulburn Can he assure the fruit growers any Commonwealth Governor encouragement will be directed Town Council has towards the continued try by co-operatives? dorriination of the indusI Mr SINCLAIR-An unfortunate result of the last few years of inflation has been that cannery have not been as readily saleable, either domestically or overseas, as one would hope. Unfortunately, the very high escalation of costs to place has meant that there have been difficulties in realising the full product of the Goulburn Valley was and other canning fruit producing areas. It is important that all honourable members recognise what a significant employer of labour the canneries are so that it is not just the producers the industry who are concerned but, signight nificantly, the whole community. It is in that mate that this Government picked up the very seriousfinancialposition that growers were ing and provided an advance, through State governments, to canneries to enable the payment of a significant part of the proceeds of 1974-75 fruit which, of course, had been avoided by Labor Government for at least a 6-month period during which requests had been made. Since the devaluation, the Government is ing that there may be an improvement opportunities abroad. This will help in the ation of stocks but it will not overcome that there is still a shortfall in payments, not only in the Goulburn Valley canneries but also neries in South Australia and, to a degree, in New South Wales. It is true that requests have been received from the South Australian and Victorian governments for a deferral of repayThere ments of the funds that were advanced earlier this year. At this stage no decision has been taken by the Government, although we are most symobjective pathetic to the approach made and discussions are continuing to determine an equitable basis which it might be arranged. In the last part of question the honourable gentleman suggested rationalisation of canneries. A number of proimpact. posals have been advanced, including one within which the Victorian Government instrumentalithe ties have played a notable part. The Federal Government is anxious that there should be rationalisation but that it should not be to disadvantage of those presently involved in industry and rather to ensure the long term future of the industry. Whatever approach made to the Federal Government, that particular objective will be held very much in mind. NA",28

The Government decided that this further report should be tabled before the Parliament rises to enable the widest possible discussion of the proposals made by the year committee. The Government authorised me to legislation for a freedom of information Bill. It is intended that that Bill will be introduced in the Autumn sittings next year. that are made upon the interdepartmental committee report will be taken into account in drafting the Bill. I should say that, in authorising the preparation of a Bill, the Government does not itself to accepting the proposals put forby the committee. I will be examining these proposals very carefully, with particular regard public comments that are made on them. The final shape of the Bill will be decided by the he Government. It is also proposed that the Bill, introduced, will be left to lie for a reasonable period for public comment on the Bill. The an Government is anxious to have the fullest possSepible public input in determining thefinalshape to of the legislation.

83,Mr ELLICOTT,REPROGRAPHIC REPRODUCTION,"by leave-The report of the Copyright Law Committee on reprographic reproduction deals principally with the question of the photocopying of copyright works. Honourable members may recall that there has been a prolonged campaign by authors and pubhshing interests to obtain compensation for the reproduction of their works in Australian univerfor sities and schools. Complaints have also been voiced by educational bodies, amongst others, that the provisions of the Copyright Act permitthe ting the use of copyright materials for the poses of education, private study or research were difficult to apply and in need of claritual fication. The Copyright Law Committee on reprographic reproduction was appointed June 1974 and received written and oral submissions from educational authorities, teachers, complain students, librarians, professional bodies, sciencedure of about tific institutions, authors, publishers It has long been a problem for copyright to keep up to date with changes in technology. Consideration of the issue of reprographic reproduction and copyright has occurred at an international level, without any international ution being reached. The international disexpected cussions have left the issue to be resolved national level. No country appears yet to have come up with a solution that has achieved wide acceptance. The report of the Committee is therefore likely to be awaited with considerable interest overseas. The recommendations of Committee, particularly those relating to the scheme for remuneration for copying cational establishments, require public discussion and comment. I therefore invite missions on the report, and it is the Governought ment's hope that the report will be considered early in the new year so that any amending legisinitiative lation may be introduced into Parliament in autumn session next year. Submissions should made to my Department by 1 March 1977. There Officers of my Department will, of course, available to discuss the substance of the report with interested parties. I thank the House.

NA",34
86,Mr SPEAKER,RETIREMENT OF CLERK OF THE,"I wish to inform honourable members that Mr Norman Parkes, the Clerk of the House, will retire on 31 December. Today is his last day at the table after 42 years of service. His has been a notable career. In 1934 he was appointed to the Parliamentary Reporting Staff as accountant. In 1937 he came to the House of Representatives as an accounts clerk and reading clerk. Over the years he worked his way through every section of the Department of the House of Representatives. He became a chamber officer in 1949 when he was appointed Serjeant-at-Arms. In this role, with the Usher of the Black Rod, he escorted the Queen to open the Third Session of the Twentieth Parliament on 15 February 1954. This was the first time that a ruling sovereign had opened the Parhament or indeed had visited Australia. He became Third Clerk Assistant in 1954 and Clerk Assistant in 1959. He was admitted to the Order of the British Empire in 1961. In 1964 he became Deputy Clerk and, on 11 December 1971, he became Clerk of the House. He has served under 4 Speakers, each of whom will attest to his capacity, service and friendship. As Honourary Secretary of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, he has participated in many important Commonwealth Parliamentary Association activities, including attendance at conferences in Nigeria, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. He was a member of the steering committee for the First, Second and Third Australasian Parliamentary Seminars which are an important Commonwealth Branch initiative in this region. This year with me he attended the Fourth Commonwealth Conference of Presiding Officers and Clerks in London. The office of Clerk is an ancient traditional office. I quote from Phillip Marsden: The long unbroken lineage of the Clerks of the House is more ancient even than that of Speaker, reaching back as it does to 1363. On 31 December there will come to a close the reign of the ninth Clerk of the House since Federation. He follows in the path of his father, Ernest William Parkes, who was the fifth Clerk of the House during the years 1927 to 1937. As far as I have been able to ascertain there is only one previously recorded instance of a son holding the same office as his father in this area. This was not in this Parliament but in the House of Commons.  HOUSE Wales coming to the Parliament. This is one of his first recollections of his association with the Parliament when his father was the Clerk. During his service he has served, I think, 9 Speakers. Fourteen Prime Ministers have sat at the table during his period of service. He has witnessed 16 elections. I think there is not a member of the House who has been directly concerned with that number of elections. He has seen the Parliament assemble in our tradition after each election without a Speaker in the Chair with the Clerk sitting at the table to conduct the election of Speaker with absolutely no power whatsoever to discipline unruly members. Earlier this year the Clerk was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. This was an acknowledgment of his great contribution to this Parliament. In earlier days Norman Parkes was a keen cricketer. He is now one of Canberra's leading bowlers, although he modestly denies that. He will have greater propensity for that past time as from 1 January. He was given a mobile typewriter by the Executive of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association last week. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Was it last Tuesday night?",35
87,Mr SPEAKER,RETIREMENT OF CLERK OF THE,"The honourable gentleman will remain silent. He was given a typewriter by the CPA Executive at a dinner given to him as a departure gift. Most of us will wish that he use it to record the ever-changing scene of Parliament as he has observed it over the years. Those who do not wish it to be recorded, at least in relation to themselves, should give the Clerk notice of that fact.  companion to Norman during his long career. All members of the House wish them a most enjoyable, peaceful and entemining retirement. Whatever may be said of his career, one could never say of it that it lacked interest. They take with them, and they deserve, our good wishes and our thanks. To a friend, I say: Thank you, Norman; well done. Honourable members-Hear , hear!",35
88,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RETIREMENT OF CLERK OF THE," Mr Speaker, I am sure that all members of the House will want to join in the remarks that you have made of the good wishes and thanks that are expressed to the Clerk of the House. Norman James Parkes has had a very long and distinguished record of service to Parliament and through this Parliament to the people of Australia. He has come, as Speaker have indicated, from a fanuiy which has traditionally served this Parliament and the people of Australia from the begirming of Federthe ation in 1901. There must be few families with such a long and distinguished record as that. In histimethe Clerk will obviously have seen of many changes. He has seen attempts to modernthree-quarters ise the mechanisms and procedures of this House. Although he has watched and to a great Australia extent been involved in this process he also has bers know that made sure that the essential requirements of the liament are verythe procedures of a House of Parliament have been adequately maintained. He has made sure that where change had been introduced it has constructive and useful change and not merely change for changes sake, not merely getting of old traditions for the sake of getting rid of traditions. I hope that I can say, without being offensive to you, Mr Speaker, that, if my recollection rect, Norman James Parkes, amongst his other services to this Parliament, has broken in-if that is not too improper a term- 4 Speakers, although I think that one of those Speakers may have that position when Norman Parkes became Clerk. In that case that Speaker would have served his term during the office of 2 Clerks. Kings Hall. The Speakers under whom he has served were Speaker Aston, Speaker Cope, Speaker Scholes and you, Mr Speaker. But clearly in the initial stages of occupancy of the office of Speaker-and I do not think this would detract in any sense from the authority, status and respect that has for the office of Speaker-the advice of Clerk is obviously of significance and imporViceroy. tance. Precedents in the management of this House are important to the proper conduct business. I think that whether we are Ministers, Prime Ministers or Speakers, good advice from official advisers is always of great importance. The Speakers of this Parliament, and through them the Parliament, have been well served by the official advisers, by the Clerk and by the Clerk's assistants. Norman James Parkes, I think we all our thanks. We all wish you and your wife the Association. greatest of good health and happiness in your retirement. On behalf of the Government Parties I thank you very much for what you have done for this Parliament to maintain and uphold honour and dignity of this place. When this place has been let down, it has not been the Clerks have let it down; it is sometimes members who have not always behaved as they ought. We this thank you for what you have done. We thank you for the example you have set. We wish you you Mr well in whatever you seek to do. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of Opposition)- I support wholeheartedly but sadly everything that you, Mr Speaker, and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) have said about the Clerk. We are today witnessing the end of a century of service to the House of Representatives, to the Parliament of and the Australian people of the Parkes-fathe r and son. All honourable memoff-spring of members of Parlikely to become outstanding E arliamentarians. That is clearly shown by the. been onourable members for Hunter (Mr James), Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) and Grayndler (Mr rid Antony Whitlam). The same principle is shown old very clearly in the case of the Parkes dynasty. You yourself, Mr Speaker, have happily recalled the occasion when Norman Parkes, as Serjeantat-Arms, accompanied the Queen when she first is coropened the Australian Parliament. He is recorded in the painting of that event which hangs in Kings Hall. His father fulfilled the same function when Her Majesty's father, the then held Duke of York, opened thefirstParliament in Canberra. He too is recorded in the painting commemorating that event, which hangs in Norman Parkes' term of 5 years has been one of extraordinary political and constitutional sig' nificance-on e might think turmoil-affectin g this House and the Senate, this Parliament and one State parliaments, this Parliament and the the Government responsible to the House and the  never compromised his office or sullied his repuof tation. When he has spoken or written as the Clerk of the Australian House of Representatives, whether in the House or outside it he has done so with the most complete sense of propriety and duty. He has been a man of experience, distinction and honour. We have been well served. The present members of the Parliament have been well served by Mm through his office owe you in the Commonwealth Parliamentary During his period of 42 years in the Parliament there have been 500 members of the House the of Representatives. In thattimeeverybody who was a member has been able to speak with a fair who amount of latitude. The Clerk is the only person-it applies on this occasion also-wh o is not able to speak his own words. The Clerk must Lisfor ten. He must never interject. He must never voltectors unteer. He may never create his own words. Members of Parliament are not supposed to read itself. their speeches. The Clerk must. On an occasion like this I may reminiscing. I have known Norman Parkes and have Maida Parkes for a very long time-almos century.

Therefore, with more than usual personal involvement take part in this occasion when we farewell and wish well a very great servant of this House and nation.",35
89,Mr SINCLAIR,RETIREMENT OF CLERK OF THE," I too, on behalf of the memplace bers of the National Country Party of Australia, associate my Party with the testimony to the as retiring Clerk of the House which you, Mr Speaker, have advanced and which has been supported by therighthonourable the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the honourretirement. able Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). When the Australian Constitutional Convention met in its 3 successive sessions re has cently we thought that we were examining histhe tory in retrospect. Yet in the retirement Norman Parkes and in the succession of the Parkes family since 1901 when the Australian Constitution was implemented, there is the livnot ing testimony of the development of the Austhe tralian Constitution through the House of Representatives. It is a remarkable term service, not just to the Parliament but to the people of Australia. He who sits so silently at the table, as the Leader of the Opposition has remarked, must read his comments while those of us who are participating within the House normally required not to. The Clerk speaks only on petitions, on notices and on orders of the He must also sit and listen to so much repetition, so much of tedium, and yet so often so much of substance and of importance. He is a continuing observer and yet a participant within the parliaother mentary scene. In the development of the proofficer cedures and practices of the House of Representhis tatives and of the Australian Parliament he and his father have played an important part. Those procedures and practices, of course, are not just members of the House. They are there as proof our version of the Westminster system, of the people of Australia and of democracy Much has been said by the 3 speakers who be forgiven for his successmewithin preceded of Norman Parkes, his career and it. Essentially, those of us who t half a scene know him for the within been participants the parliamentary honesty and integrity of which he has afforded whether we have from the Treasury benches or It is in that context, of course, of the House is so importhe back up to those capacihonourable members so that they best assert their electorates around Australia. In that situation and service he has provided to the people inofthe I Australia, Norman Parkes has been quite outstanding. Whether it is on the bowling green or in the preparation ofhis memoirs that he seeks to spend his leisure hours, those of us who have been involved with him during his working hours and many others who have passed through this since he first began his service here so long ago in October 1934 pay tribute to him as a man, an officer of the Parliament and as a servant of the people of Australia. I join in extending to Norman Parkes and to Mrs Parkes our very best wishes for a very happy, successful and healthy",37
90,Mr SCHOLES,RETIREMENT OF CLERK OF THE,"As one of those who had the opportunity of serving as Speaker in House I pay tribute to Norman Parkes for the of work that he has done and for the manner in which he has supervised the parliamentary Department of the House of Representatives. I do suppose there are many who have to rely on skill and advice of the clerk more than those who occupy the position of presiding officer. of Most members of Parliament know a lot about the Standing Orders and the procedures of this Parliament and of others until actually put to the test by having to put those procedures into rulings or decisions. Then the amount that those are concerned do not know becomes a volume. The advice that I, my predecessor and, I presume, day. Speaker Aston received enabled us to carry out the duties with which we were charged. It is important to any person in any office to be certain that their advice can be relied on. In many ways-as Clerk, as an individual and as an  countiy extremely well. It is a frustrating job, in that the Clerk can advise but he cannot prevent the person to whom the advice is given from making mistakes. Mistakes will always be made. One other side of the Clerk's job on which I want to comment briefly is that in many instances members of Parliament take up with the Clerk grievances which properly should be taken up with the Speaker. If the Speaker makes a ruling from the chair, no matter what advice is given by the Clerk-and no one can know what advice is given-it is the Speaker's ruling and his responsibility. When honourable members take these grievances or supposed grievances up with the Clerk it adds to the pressure and I think it is unfair to the people who serve in that office. If a person accepts the role of Speaker in the House he should also accept the responsibility for his own decisions. I wish Norman Parkes and his wife well in their retirement. I hope that his experiences will not now be forgotten but that he will utilise those experiences in order to inform and to ensure that future generations have the benefit of what has been a very long and distinguished career of service to the Parliament and, as a servant of the Parliament, to the people of Austraha.",37
91,Mr LUCOCK,RETIREMENT OF CLERK OF THE," Mr Speaker, I desire to be associated with the remarks that you and  the factors contributing to the progress and work of this chamber is the attention to duty, the Loyalty and the friendship of so many people who keep the wheels turning. Not the least contribution to that is made by the Clerk of the House. I have known over a long period of time  ing thetimethat he has occupied the position. many occasions I have known by the look on brow that perhaps he has not agreed with what have said or with what I have done, but he always been the perfect gentleman and has polite enough not to indicate with a great deal of strength his disagreement with what I have said. I have also had a very pleasurable association with him in the Commonwealth Parliamentary outbreak Association. I do not want to repeat what has already been said by many honourable members who have paid tribute to him but I would like to express personal appreciation of what he has done durHouse. ing thetimethat I have been a member of this House and during thetimethat I have occupied the chair. We know the work that he has done, the courtesy that he has extended to all able members and the assistance given to honourable members on both sides of the House. I join with others in expressing appreciation for the work that he has done and my very best wishes and warmest regards to him in his retirement.",38
92,Mr HAYDEN,RETIREMENT OF CLERK OF THE,"I would like to join in the comments which have been expressed by honourable members in relation to the service of Norm Parkes to the House over a very long time and in relation to his impending retirement. He has served this House and a succession of governments in this House with impartiality and diligence regardless of the complexion of the government. I might suggest that for too long there has been too much of one complexion of government in this House, but that has not been the fault of Norman Parkes. It has always appeared to me by his appearance and behaviour that Norman Parkes has sought to maintain the composure, dignity and proper conduct of this House even attimeswhen it has fled this House in all other quarters. He has always been cheerful. I suggest that that is a not easy quality to maintain when one is compulsorily chained to the table of this House. Unlike members of the Parliament, the Clerks of the House cannot escape at particularly painful moments when an honourable member is making a speech. Of course, I exclude present company. Norman has served in the House as a Clerk, of wearing the formal appearance of Clerks of the the House, of mscmtability, wisdom and- I stress this word gently-discretion . I detected fleetingly a cold tremor of fear rush through the House when reference was made to a typewriter being presented to him on his retirement. Perhaps he is going to write his memoirs and his recollections the Parliament. If he confirms this, I expect On that there will be regular pilgrimages of memhis bers of Parliament to his home. I have noted I fromtimetotimein the newspapers when it is re has ported that the honourable member for Hindbeen marsh (Mr Clyde Cameron)-perhap s I should not say this because he is not here; on reflection, I probably would not say it if he were here-is in the process of writing his memoirs there is a fresh of pilgrims visiting his office encouraging him to drink from the sweet cup of nostalgia and to forget about the bitter one. I wish Norm Parkes and his wife happiness and satisfaction in their retirement. He has been a keen and loyal my oflicer serving this House and all parties in this On a personal level, I have appreciated his kindness, his thoughtfulness and his helpfulness whenever I have approached him. I repeat with a deep sense of sincerity that I hope that he honourenjoys a very well-deserved, satisfying that he has retirement with his wife. a deep Mr CHIPP (Hotham)-As a former Leader of the House of Representatives I want to add my name very briefly to the tribute.

(Notice given 1 December). political party organisations in The proposal I have put forward is for the establishment of a select committee to inquire into electoral matters. The proposal does not envisparties age such matters as redistribution and the major countries matters covered by other electoral legislation, but it envisages a general approach to elections, to be the conduct of elections, the role and organisbe nomiation of the Commonwealth Electoral Office, the relationships of political parties to the Electoral Act, and also an examination of the role, recognition and responsibilities of political parties comwithin the electoral laws of other countries with Prime comparable parliamentary systems to our own. Every member of this House and most people who who have had experience with elections will be present aware of quite a number of unsatisfactory when aspects of our electoral laws. Quite a lot of them present are archaic and could well be amended. There present would be unanimity within the House for such amendments. Unfortunately, governments from both sides of the House have pursued alterations to the manner in which we conduct our elections. The structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act has been the personal property of the government of the day. In fact, it is most likely fair to say that the Electoral Act ought to be prepared by people who do not have a vested interest in protecting their positions. Politicians would be about the last people to make an objective judgment on the Commonwealth Electoral Act or on the manner in which they confronted the electors. Be that as it may, it is not likely that any government will accept that proposition. I think it is not unreasonable that the Electoral Act should be subjected to continual scrutiny and recommendation by members of Parliament and that they should seek to acquire general agreement on where the Act could be updated and alterations made to improve and, wherever possible, simplify our electoral procedures. I should like to make one or two remarks concerning areas in which I think the whole House would agree alteration should be made but in which we have never actually got around to making alterations. The procedures for applying for postal votes are extremely complicated, even though they are meant to apply to people who are sick or aged and to large numbers of people who only once in their life are going to tackle filling in those forms. There would appear to be no justification whatsoever for not adopting a more simplified procedure and, certainly, a more simplified form on which people can apply for a postal vote and return their postal vote for counting. The placing of names on the ballot paper torically has been almost a case of people with surnames beginning with the letter 'A' or 'B' not wanting a change to the system but people with surnames beginning with the letter 'S or ' wanting change. I take advantage of the name of the MinisterforAboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner), who is sitting at the table. Most likely, both he and I could have lost our seats in recent years cause of the alphabet.",39
95,Mr YOUNG,ELECTORAL PROCEDURES,What about the seconder?,40
96,Mr SCHOLES,ELECTORAL PROCEDURES,"I did not know that the seat of Port Adelaide was one in which the Electoral Act would be of much importance. honourable member who holds that seat would have a majority of about 12 000 votes. It would seem to me to be a fairer proposition-ther e is fair proposition, even though we have heard about round ballot papers and the like-if people were required to draw for their positions on ballot papers. At least then everyone would have a chance of getting a high position on the ballot paper, which is desirable in a tight election and in a marginal seat. Any honourable member who is interested ought to ask the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) for copies of all the forms which normally are used in the Australian Electoral Office. I trunk something like forty or fifty of them are used to put people's names on the electoral roll. There are 3 different forms to challenge people's rights to have their names on the roll. These should be able to be modified to a considerable extent. Similarly, there is the issue of the 'How to Vote' cards. This seems to me to be one of the great wastes of money-it creates a tremendous amount of litter-to provide guidance in a system which we believe is too complicated for the general public to understand. It is not unreasonable that each candidate should be able to put forward his order of preferences to the Electoral Office within a reasonable period of the close of nominations and that that order of preferences should be included in the Act and listed in every polling booth so that when people go into the polling booths they have before them the order of preferences desired by each candidate. That brings me to the third problem, which is the recognition in the Electoral Act of political parties. A lot of guff is spoken about the incorporation of political parties, etc. It is an accepted fact that there are political parties. It is accepted de facto in Senate elections where groupings are used. It should not be beyond the wit of this Parliament to devise reasonable procedureshisproposals have been put before the Parliament in recent years-whereb y the names of political parties and the association of candidates to those parties can be recognised at least to the extent V that the names can be utilised in an electoral office. It is a strange thing that, whilst we do not recognise that a candidate is a candidatefora particular political parry, we require the political beparty to provide returns on expenditure and other matters in relation to election campaigns. So apparently we recognise political parties but we pretend that we do not. They are things which I think are worthy of examination by members of this House and, wherever possible, unanimity I thought the should be sought. On the matter of the closingtimesof polling no booths, in one or two States now the closing time is 6 o'clock but in the Commonwealth it is 8 o'clock. There seems to be no real reason why the some agreement could not be reached on that particular point. These issues relating to the Electoral Act are not terribly important but in total there are quite a number of them. I believe it is proper that the Parliament as a whole should deal with these issues and make recommendations. The motion which is before us envisages ing with the matter only as it affects the House Representatives. I should think that senators would want to examine their own electoral laws as far as the election of senators is concerned. hope that they will do so fairly quickly because the level of informal votes which is taking place in Senate elections is destroying any claim that the Senate is a representative House. The level informal votes isranningat something like 10 per cent. That is far too high and indicates that people are not capable of or do not want vote, but that the system is too complicated and therefore is denying people their right to vote. I should like to talk about one or two other matters but we have only 12 minutes left for debate and I should like to the seconder to this motion. However, I make the point that in future the problems involved ducting election campaigns in Australia are going to grow. People are going to demand results far more quickly than they are able to them now. In the last general election, if I may make the point, it took just on 3 weeks to settle the final seat in the House of Representaparties tives-m y seat. If the election result had close we would not have known who was going to govern the country until that period had elapsed. In a situation of, say, economic or another form of crisis, that would make the ition of government impossible. It would place the nation in a rudderless situation. It should be possible for us to get beyond the horse and buggy stage whereby 10 or 12 days of after an election people are not able to say even how many votes there are still to be counted, let alone when they are likely to arrive. In fact, late as the day of the distribution of preferences in the last general election, 20-odd votes turned up. I know that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs found a very important bundle of votes which apparently no one knew existed. These are areas in which the electoral procedures should be cleaned up and should be cleaned up fairly quickly. I do not suggest that there has been any parties. improper practice, but the Electoral Act needs careful examination and it should be examined by people on the basis of trying to seek agreeNational ment on what can and should be done to hide improve our electoral system. The other matter, which is going to be one of the big issues in the future, is that of financing election campaigns. If we do not do something about this matter in the future-and it is not a popular subject-w e will reach the situation which, I believe, obtains in some countries already, in which the members of the Parliament dealare agents of those who finance election camof paigns rather than representatives of the people who elect them. That would be an undesirable situation. Elections cannot be conducted without I money. It will be necessary to look at means by which the amounts of money required to be spent can be reduced. Some of the surplus activity that takes place could well be done away of with. I commend the motion to the House. I believe that it proposes a means by which we can not seek to have unanimity and agreement on those to changes which are necessary or those which we feel are desirable. In controversial matters, or matters on which agreement cannot be reached, obviously the Government has the numbers to enforce its will, but, wherever possible, I believe this that an agreement should be reached on elecleave some time for toral matters. in con Mr YOUNG (Port Adelaide) (12.21)- I second the motion. The mover of the motion, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), has get concentrated mainly upon the first 3 matters mentioned in his motion. I want to pay attention to the final two, that is, the funding of political and the recognition of political parties. It been is a subject about which the Labor Party has made continuous proposals over the last 4 years. It is a subject about which it gave the Government an opportunity to grasp the nettle this year posand to do something about this matter in the form of legislation. Again, before this House rises, the Opposition asks the Government to take action at least to appoint a select committee to look at these questions involving the very basis the operation of political parties in the Parliament, the funding of political parties and the operations of the Electoral Office. It seems strange as to members of the Opposition that while the Government has been able to set up committees on a variety of subjects, the latest of which is concerned with tourism, there is always this great reluctance on the part of the Liberal and National Country Parties to look at the question of the funding of political parties, the funding of candidates and the recognition of political One can only assume that the Liberal and Country Parties have a great deal to about the way they receive their funds and the way in which they are funding their political campaigns. The position in Australia is becomconclusions ing quite frightening considering the amounts of money that are required for respective elections. It is not just for one election that comes along casionally. Whilst we separate elections Senate and the House of Representatives, the amount of money required by each of the candimittees dates and by all parties in each of the States, ing into account the State elections as well, coming enormous. Honourable members know reports from their own individual experiences or from experiences with the campaign committees of our respective parties, that the amount of money being raised now is an amount which is recognised by the public. The general public Australia does not realise the amount of money that is spent on campaigns. There is no effort made by any authority in Australia to try to ascertain the amount of money being spent. As have said previously in debates concerning this matter, the only way that we can perhaps get some idea of the amount of money being raised is through the annual report of the Broadcasting Control Board when that annual report covers the period of an election. Then we canfindout how much money each of the political parties spent on television and radio. In 1974 we saw that the Liberal and National where Country Parties spent something like $1.4m on fundingit of radio and television. In 1975, as a result ofhavway to avoid ing witnessed the campaign by the Liberalout National Countiy Parties, it would be no exaggeration to say that they had millions of dolin lars available to conduct their election camthis? Why paigns. People are entitled to know what amount donors are?are of money is being spent on elections in Australia and they are entitled to know where that money comes from. The day before yesterday in the nations Melbourne Age, it was stated that the devalua1975 to establish tion of the Australian dollar means a hand-out to public could see who the Utah Mining Co of approximately $35m in a full year, based on last year's production figures. The Opposition would like to know whether the Utah is a major contributor to the financial continue pockets of the Liberal and National Country be in the national Parties. It has been the understanding in AusParliament, tralian political circles that the mining comcandidates, panies, the banks and some of the larger finan-trahan cial institutions are the big backers behind coalition parties. The people in Australia are titled to know what is going on. Otherwise will run into the same sort of difficulties faced other countries. The Opposition is asking the Government set up a select committee to investigate this ter. We will not reach any conclusions by merely conducting a debate in the House. We will reach only if a committee of the Parliament is set up to look at all these questions. The Opposition is asking this Government to do ocexactly the same as has been done in Sweden, of the Norway, Finland, Germany and the United Kingdom. All of these countries have set up comof their respective parliaments to look at takthese questions. In every case the committees of is bethose parliaments have recommended in their that the funding of political parties be met mainly by the State, that the Governments themselves pay out the moneys that are needed for the political parties to conduct their camnot paigns. They have recommended that these in moneys be based on the percentage vote which parties received at the previous one or two elections. If all those countries are reaching those conclusions, what is wrong with the suggestion I that a committee of this House should look at the question to see whether it is working in those countries and to see what sort of corruption that action has perhaps avoided. We have all witnessed the mammoth corruption of the American system in a couple of election periods, not too long ago. It is very fresh in our memories. That has situation should be avoided in Australia. We do not want to put ourselves in a position is alleged that there is corruption in the political parties in Australia. The only that situation is to bring everything into the open. The Labor Party is very much favour of this. Why do not the Liberal and National Countiy Parties join the Labor Party in they trying to hide who their They will not even go as far as to establish a public register of those who make doto their parties. When the Labor Government tried to legislate in 1973,1974 and again in a public register so that the made donations to political parties, the coalition parties joined together in Senate to defeat the legislation. They will to be charged with all these sorts of things until suchtimeas they agree that it would interest for the very basis of the the funding of political parties and to be made clean, because the Auspublic is entitled to know who the the Government's backers are. Perhaps this could enthen be related to some of the acuons taken by we the Government. The Government must not conby tinue to hide and refuse to recognise the importance of this subject, simply saying that it is going to to overcome the problems of the people of matAustralia by establishing a committee on tourism, or on Aboriginal landrights,or on foreign affairs, or on expenditure. The very presence here of all of us will be in a very grey area until such time as the Liberal and National Country Parties recognise the corruption that can creep into the funding of political parties and the funding of candidates, and until suchtimeas they recognise that something has to be done and that a committee must be set up, as has been done in parliaments right around the western world. I reiterate that we are not now spending $100 to run a campaign in a marginal electorate. Honourable members on the other side know this as well as the Opposition does. The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) knows this. He is probably spending in the vicinity of $15,000 or $20,000 every election just in the electorate of Griffith. If that amount is multiplied by the eighty or ninety seats that are hard fought, the amount of money spent by the candidates themselves, ignoring the amount that is being spent by the head offices of the political parties, shows that the conduct of elections is a multi-million dollar affair. The people of Australia are entitled to know-it would be in the interests of members of Parliament more than of anyone else-wher e those funds come from. If that were known it might be concluded again that it would be in the best interests of Australia if the funds to conduct elections came out of general revenue. That is the pure way of doing it. That is the best way of doing it. That is the fairest way of doing it. It has been said since Federation that perhaps the Labor Party does not have the ability to raise the same amount of funds as the Liberal and National Country Parties. In relation to receiving very large donations from major companies that is true.",40
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL PROCEDURES,"Mr Lucock) Order! As it is now 2 hours after thetimefixed for the meeting of the House, consideration of notices is interrupted. Motion (by Mr Viner) agreed to: That the time for discussion of Notice No. 1, General ness, be extended.",43
98,Mr YOUNG,ELECTORAL PROCEDURES,"As I was saying, if we multiply the amounts that are being spent in individual electorates and get some idea of the millions of dollars that are being spent on campaigns this adds to the Labor Party's case that everybody should come clean on the funding of political parties. We see no reason why the Government will not accept these proposals. The Government can set up a committee upon which it has a majority. Let us analyse exactly what is going on. The honourable member for Griffith says quite righdy-I beheve him; I do not challenge himthat he raises his campaign funds in the electorate of Griffith itself. But the honourable member cannot tell me because he would not have access to the books, how much money is paid into the headquarters of the Liberal and National Country Parties in Queensland. Not only is that sort of information denied to the public but also it is denied to the parliamentarians. Parliamentarians have no idea how much money is raised by their Party headquarters; what money exists in the slush funds all around Australia; or how money is paid to the political parties. All these aspects should be looked at by the proposed committee; then we can debate its report. The only reason we can see why honourable members opposite will not accept this proposalthey have defeated sinular moves over the years to appoint such a committee-is that they must have something to hide. Do honourable members opposite believe that the problems of funding political parties in Australia are any different from the problems experienced by the other countries that I named? Are we presented with different problems? Are we presented with different problems because of the number of political parties or the number of candidates? Why do we not follow the lead of all those other countries? Perhaps we may reach different conclusions, but all the people in Australia would be glad to see that we have come clean on the funding of political parties. I reiterate that the charges exist. Everybody believes that the big backers of the Liberal and National Country Parties are Mt Isa Mines Ltd, the Bank of New South Wales, the Shell Co. of Australia Ltd and the Utah Development Company. People will go on believing that until such time as they know exactly what relationship exists between all these major companies and the government of the day. The only way we can find out that relationship and rescue ourselves and Busiour reputations in the process is to appoint a select committee to look at these questions. The committee may reach conclusions and make recommendations to this Parliament similar to those of other such committees around the world, that is, that it is not in the best interests of the political system of this country to have private donations at all to political parties. Irrespective of the fact that we all get up and say that there are no ties with the donations that are made to us individually or between donors and political parties, who believes us? The public does not believe us. The public thinks a definite relationship exists between the donor and the pohtical party. We are putting forward a rescue operation for politicians in this generation and in this Parliament and for future generations and future parliaments. We ask the Government to look seriously at accepting the proposals. The committee may present interim reports and final reports with the result that future elections may be conducted by a new process. Millions of dollars will be spent in the elections of 1978, 1981 and 1984. If the honourable member for Griffith and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) are each spending $ 15,000 or $20,000 on each election now in 6 years'timethey will want $30,000 or $40,000. There is no ceiling; honourable members raise and spend as much as they possibly can. If the honourable member for Parramatta is raising $30,000 or $40,000 in 6 yearstimethe political machine in New South Wales probably will want $5 m or $6m. Where will it all end? Even the United States has put a ceiling on the spending of its Presidential candidates. The United States has had all the trouble of Watergate and the corruption involved with political donations. It is trying to wipe out the corruption. The United Kingdom, West Germany and other countries have moved in this area. But this Government continues to hide behind the present situation which embodies aspects that we really cannot understand or be fully informed on. Why will the Government not accept the suggestion by the honourable member for Corio that a committee of this Parliament should look at the whole question of the operation of the Australian Electoral Office, electoral laws, funding and voting procedures? All these questions are very basic to us. Our operations will be in a grey area until such time as we clarify our position. I make it clear that the Labor Party will not change its views on this question. We will continue to try year after year to get the Government to come out into the open on this question.",43
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL PROCEDURES,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,44
100,Mr VINER,ELECTORAL PROCEDURES,"It is really a long time since we have heard so much specious, hollow, hypocritical, insincere humbug as we have just heard from the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) who has spoken on the funding of political parties. In the history of the Australian Federation no Party has had such a remarkably clean record in government and in Opposition as have the Liberal and National Country Parties. The honourable member for Port Adelaide speaks about donations, which have ties, to political parties. He should rememberrecentevents in his own Party. He is not prepared to listen to this. I notice he is leaving the House. In recent memory is the escapade at breakfasttimeof the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) seeking half a million dollars of Iraqi money to finance the debts incurred by the Labor Party in the last Federal election. Whattiewas there to be for that money? That was secrecy par excellence in that proposed provision of funding for political parties not from inside Australia but from outside Australia. It was obviously intended to tie the fortunes of Australia to a foreign country. What more despicable conduct by a political party is there than that? In more recent memory is the $25,000 that the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union paid to the Australian Labor Party as the price for getting amendments to the industrial legislation of the Commonwealth as required by that union. What about the conduct of the Premier of South Australia, which is the honourable member for Port Adelaide's own State? The Premier turned against the Federal Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party because when the Labor Party was in government it introduced amendments to the taxation provisions affecting the wine industry contrary to the commitment that Mr Dunstan had made to the wine industry as the price for donations to the Australian Labor Party. What moretiedfunding of a political party could exist than that?",44
101,Mr SCHOLES,ELECTORAL PROCEDURES,Do you not think that that information should be disclosed?,44
102,Mr VINER,ELECTORAL PROCEDURES,"It is all veiy well for the honourable member for Corio to interject but that fact would not have been disclosed if the Australian Labor Party, under the leadership of the present Leader of the Opposition, had not turned against the commitment which had been made. Mr Dunstan denounced his leader. That is another example of a secret commitment made totiepolitical funds to the advantage of a section of the Australian community. What humbug, hypocrisy and insincerity we have heard from the lips of the honourable member for Port Adelaide. This is a typical example of the way the Opposition goes about its argument in thisfield.It uses insinuations without any statement of fact whatsoever to support its argument. The Opposition constantly points thefingerat this side of the House and says: 'What have you to hide? You must have something to hide if you are not prepared to agree with this proposition'. Again, it is the kind of proach that is so shallow that I wonder that the honourable member for Port Adelaide has not learned the lesson of good debate. I think that what I have said is sufficient to indicate why the Government is not prepared to accept the argument put forward here today. The Government wonders-as it has wondered before when the Opposidon has spoken on this matter-if the Opposition's principal motivation is to seek the disclosure of the source of campaign funds so as to invade the privacy of individuals who contribute to political parties other than the Australian Labor Party. That is inherent in the Opposition's proposition. It wants to be able to have access to names of donors to individual members of Parliament, let alone to poltiical parties. I remind the Opposition that when it proposed this motion when it was in government the former honourable member for Grayndler, Mr Fred Daly, who was handUng electoral matters for the then Government, refused to accept a proposition put by us when in Opposition that a parUamentary committee be set up to examine electoral reform and to examine the Electoral Act itself. The then Leader of the House indicated at that stage on behalf of the Government that our proposal was a phoney stunt. If our proposal was phoney, the Opposition's proposal today is much more phoney. It completely lacks credibility. I remind the honourable gentleman who proposed this motion that a census was conducted recently on the basis of which there will need to be a redistribution. A decision also is pending by the High Court of Australia on a challenge based upon the way in which quotas are fixed for determining the numbers of electors in electorates. The case before the High Court will determine whether people in the Territories are to be taken into account in determining the quota of electors for fixing the size of electorates. For those 2 reasons alone, it is premature to consider the establishment of any parliamentary committee to examine the Electoral Act. As well as that, the Government has said that a review of the Electoral Act is at present under way by the Australian Electoral Office. Let me remind honourable gentlemen that the Australian Electoral Office is a statutory body, independent of political parties. That body is conducting the inquiry and will advise the Government. So the Government can expect an impartial, objective review of the present provisions of the Electoral Act. When it has received that advice, the Government will consider what amendments need to be made to the Electoral Act. Proposals ap- can always be put forward to fix the order on a baUot paper by ballot or by the alphabet or to change the closingtimeof polling booths on election day. These were a couple of the matters that were mentioned by the honourable member for Corio but they are incidental. I think that if members of the Opposition had some patience they would find that the review being conducted by the Australian Electoral Office, independent of all poltiical parties, will be a satisfactory objective basis for advice to the Government. With those remarks, I think the debate should come to a conclusion and I move: That the quesuon be now put. Question resolved in the affirmative. Original question resolved in the negative. NA NA NA Ministerial Statement",44
103,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADMINISTRATION,"by leave-The Royal Commission on Australian Government Adrrunistration, under the chairmanship of Dr H. C. Coombs, presented its report in July of this year. In announcing the submission of the report at that time. I said that the Government would study carefully and give thorough consideration to the recommendations made by the Commission on the principles for more efficient administration. The necessary machinery has since been established for this purpose and decisions on recommendations will be announced progressively. For purposes of our examination of the Commission's report, the Government decided that its recommendations could be grouped in 5 main categories on the following basis: (1) Matters requiring Cabinet consideration, by reason of their impUcations or the likelihood of legislation being required if they were to be implemented. (2) Matters which relate to the subject matter of other inquiries, and which will need to be taken into account in the Government's consideration of the reports of those inquiries. (3) Matters relating to the allocation of functions among Ministries and to possible changes in admimstrative arrangements. (4) Matters having implications for particular Ministers and Departments. (5) Matters having impUcations for most or all Ministers and Departments, or requiring follow-up by the Public Service Board. Action has been put in train in relation to each of the 5 categories. In particular, I have asked that Ministers let me have their views on the Commission's recommendations which have both specinc and general relevance to departments and authorities under their control. I have also suggested that their consideration of the Commission's report could be regarded as a useful starting point for a wide-ranging examination of the efficiency and effectiveness of administrative procedures. In response to my request, the Public Service Board has completed its initial examination of the matters specifically referred to it and I will shortly be announcing the nature of the further action which it has in mind. The Government has now taken initial decisions on a number of the Royal Commission's recommendations. The Government has approved in principle the Commission's recommendations for implementation of a system of efficiency audits. Officials have been asked to report on the details of how such a system might be implemented. The Government also has agreed that the Pubhc Service Board should continue its management improvement functions, including efficiency and staff utilisation reviews, in general accordance with its present responsibilities under the Public Service Act. The Government also has noted the particular significance which the Royal Commission attached to integrated forward estimates of both financial and manpower requirements. In this regard, I mention that the Government has previously agreed with proposals by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) that forward financial estimates should be collected for the 3 years 1977-78 to 1979-80. The development of the Department of Finance will enable these to be pursued with greater vigour. The Public Service Board also has been progressively developing a comprehensive system of forward manpower estimates. Whilst noting the complexity surrounding many of the issues involved and the Commission's view that development of a satisfactory process might take several years, the Government has decided that action should proceed immediately for detailed examination and report on the Commission's proposals. A number of other decisions taken by the Government will, I am sure, be of interest to Public Service Staff organisations. They are: (a) We have authorised the Public Service Board to commence discussions with staff organisation, departments and statutory authorities, and in Joint Council-the joint consultative body presently operating under the Public Service Act-and to report to me on the manner in which the Royal Commission's recommendations both for expanding the jurisdiction of the Joint Council, and for creating consultative councils within departments and authorities, might be implemented. (b) Approval has been given for drafting to continue on legislation to give effect to changes in the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act, in accordance with recommendations which resulted from a review of those provisions by the Public Service Board, m conjunction with the Joint Council. (c) The Public Service Board has been asked to report to me as soon as possible on a number of Royal Commission recommendations relating to promotion processes in the Australian Public Service, after consideration of those matters has been finalised in the Joint Council and after the Board has completed all necessary consultations with staff organisation. The Government strongly supports the Commission's recommendations on promotion by merit. (d) The Government has agreed that the Public Service Act should be amended at an appropriatetimeto abolish the present 10 per cent restriction on the annual intake of non-specialist graduate recruits into the Australian Public Service. (e) The Government has endorsed the view of the Public Service Board that the present distinctions between the Third and Fourth Divisions of the Public Service were becoming increasingly irrelevant and the Board has been asked to consult with staff organisations on possible changes in the divisional structure and to report to the Government. (f) The Board has also been asked to consult with staff organisations on the possible elimination of inappropriate distinctions between permanent officers and temporary employees in the present employment arrangements under the Public Service Act and to report to the Government. (g) The Board has also been asked to continue its detailed examination of the desirability of developing arrangements under which the whole or much of Commonwealth Government civilian employment would be treated as one entity for a number of purposes. The Government has also accepted the royalthe commission's recommendations that a practice should be established permitting the Leader of the Opposition, before a general election, to confer with the Public Service Board and the Sec-ters. retary to the Department of the and Cabinet, and permitting shadow Ministers confer with the heads of relevant departments.There Guidelines have been developed covering the conduct of these discussions and I have the Leader of the Opposition of them.

106,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADMINISTRATION,"In response to the royal commission's suggestion that greater attention isrequiredto the provision of more realistic objectives for staff training and development activities, the Government has decided that all departments should be asked to review their overall arrangements in these areas. In the light of those reviews, the Public Service Board has been asked to review the nature of its own role in relation to training and personnel development matters and to report its findings to the Government by mid-1977. The Government did not take up the commission's recommendation that the special statutory provisions for the appointment of ex-servicemen in section 47A of the Public Service Act be not re-enacted when the Act is amended. We do not believe that there should be any suggestion of a lessening of the Government s special concern for veterans who have served Australia. The Government has noted that the commission highlighted the proliferation of Commonwealth statutory authorities, particularly in recent years. For its part, my Government endorses the commission's conclusion in favour of adopting the departmental form of organisation for government agencies unless a clear necessity can be demonstrated for the functions to be carried out by a body which is wholly, some desired way, separate from ministerial and departmental administration. In conformity with this approach, we have decided that formulation of broad guidelines for the creation of statutory authorities would be desirable. Accordingly, working party of officials is to be established prepare a guideline document as soon as possible for the Government's consideration. We would expect that the guidelines ultimately approved by the Government would be applied not only in circumstances where creation of a new statutory authority was being proposed, but also for E oses of assessing whether existing statutory odies continued to satisfy the guideline criteria.

Such consultation will take place with the peak councils of the staff organisations and with other bodies as appropriate. Legislation introduced recently on appointment of Permanent Heads of Public Service departments and on early retirement, followed the Government's acceptance of the main thrust of the Commission's recommendations on these matters. Because of the wide-ranging terms of reference of the royal commission it was obviously not in a position to prepare detailed implementation plans for its recommendations. I believe that we have made substantial progress in our initial examination of the report and have set in train work to prepare such detailed plans. I have no doubt that, when implemented, these reforms will lead to a more efficient administration-a matter which should be of concern to all Australians. I add that as the Government examination of the royal commission's recommendations progresses, obviously there will be other reports to the Parliament concerning the decisions taken.",48

With the a indexation of the personal tax system, the to Government has already seen to it that inflation can no longer act as a silent and unlegislated tax on personal income. This represents the most farreachingreformmade to the Australian system of personal income tax in our time. It has been introduced at a cost to the revenue during the purcurrentfinancialyear of around $ 1,050m, equivalent to $1,210m in a full year. By doing this the Government fulfilled, in the space of 6 an election commitment that was to be where met over a period of 3 years. At the time of the last election the Government also promised to reduce the burden of income tax onfirmsand companies which, because of inflauon, have had tofindincreasing amounts working capital to maintain business activity.

In words, inflation, acting through the taxation tem, was not only the instrument whereby of resources were transferred in an arbitrary way from individuals to the Government but also, cause of its impact on companies, a central ement in the weakening of the system that took place under our predecessors. Inflation, in precise terms, adds to the burden taxation on business enterprises which have replace goods that constitute their trading stocks, at constantly increasing prices, out of profits which, calculated in the conventional way, are fully subject to income tax. Under existing income tax rules full taxation is imposed on ness profits that, for obvious reasons, are available in a wholly liquid form and that are, an increasing extent, beingtiedup in goods heldis as trading stocks. To put it another way, businesses are paying taxes out of what amounts to no more than paper profits and this has ited, and in many cases depressed, the general level of business activity within the economy. As afirststep in putting an end to this probfigure lem, the Government has decided that the ations impact of inflation on trading stock financingto should be taken into account in assessing the taxation liabilities of business enterprises. In effect, special income tax deduction, measured by stocks reference to the annual increase in the goods component of the consumer price index, will allowed tofirmsand companies holding eligible trading stocks for business purposes. Honourable members will know that, under provisional stanthe dards issued by the professional accountancy bodies in Australia, accounting profit will measured in terms of current, and not historical, cost concepts. In relation to trading stocks, the full current cost price of goods be charged against its profits so that its financial statements will reflect changes that take place inbusiness the price structure of the goods and rises in general price levels. The trading stock adjuststock, ments, to be made for income tax purposes, are designed to protect business working capital income against erosion by inflation in broadly the same way as current cost accounting that is now being this taken up by accountants. For 2 major reasons, the income tax adjustcost ments will be measured by movements general price level and not on specific price changes. First, the adjustments are intended to compensate for inflation-caused cost increases of and not to reflect changes that may occur even when money values are stable, in pnce structures capiof particular goods. Second, the use of the index will provide a standard basis of othermeasurement of pnce level changes that can be sysapplied uniformly in the income tax assessments businesses dealing in goods. Having described briefly the nature of the problems that the new beincome tax stock valuation adjustments are eldesigned to resolve, I turn now to the adjustfree enterprise ments themselves. of The annual adjustment for afirmor company to will be made by way of an income tax deduction calculated as a proportion of the taxation value of its trading stock of goods on hand at the beginning of the year of income. The proportion of the stock valuation to be allowable as a deducbusition will be based on the percentage increase, not June quarter to June quaner, in the goods comtoponent of the consumer price index. The scheme to be phased in and, for 1976-77, the first income year for which the adjustment will be allowable, the proportion will be one half of the limpercentage increase in the goods component of the index. The stock valuationfigurewiU be that adopted by thefirmor company for income tax purposes, as long as no stocks are valued at a in excess of the true cost. Income tax valuin excess of cost wiU have to be converted cost for the purposes of the adjustment. a An important matter is the range of trading to which the adjustment is to apply. This has been considered carefuUy by the Governbe ment and it has been decided that goods held, and properly accounted for as trading stock for income tax purposes, will be within the scope of new allowance. Accordingly, the cost pnce of such property as land, buildings, construction be work in progress, shares, other securities and other legal rights, including industrial property such as patents and copyrights, will not be subsold by afirmwillject to adjustment. In a business of primary production, or other in which Uvestock is held as trading the adjustment will be calculated generally by reference to the cost values adopted for tax purposes so that where a standard cost adjustment has been ascribed to natural increase the will be a proportion of thatfigure.In connection, I add that it is not proposed that a deduction will be avaUable in respect of the of racehorses and other animals used or bred in the for sporting or domestic purposes. Inquiries have been received as to how the scheme will operate where a company has, with the approval of the Commissioner of Taxation, adopted a substituted accounting period in place of a year of income ending 30 June. Whether such compames balance earlier or later than June, the rates of tax applying in their assesspurposes. ments are those usually announced in the Budget Speech each year, for application to companies generally. It has been decided that, where a pany balances on a date other than 30 June, the increase in the general index between June quarter and June quarter used for the purposes of the stock adjustment will be applied to the purposes. relevant value of the trading stocks held by the company at the beginning of its accounting able period. There will not, therefore, be any special unusually index for these companies. Difficult questions arise where, during a ticular year of income, a business the interests of the proprietors in a business change, or the scale of operations of a business substantially reduced. Generally speaking, it not proposed that an income tax adjustment be available for a business in the income year in which it is brought to an end. However, where business is terminated on the death of its prietor, a special proportionate adjustment will be allowable. Furthermore, if the trustee and beneficiaries indicate that the business will carried on, a special proportionate adjustment will also be available in the assessments based income derived by the estate. Where the scale of operations of substantially reduced during a year so that the value of closing stock is less than its opening stock value, the adjustment will reference to the closing stock value, as the purpose of the scheme is to assist businesses want to preserve the same level of operating caleave pacity. If the shareholders or proprietors in a granted. business change during a year but it is established that the same business is carried on for rest of the year by the new owners, the ordinary adjustment will be allowable. In the case of business carried on by a sole proprietor or nership, the adjustment will be apportioned on time basis between the old and new owners. In year in which a firm or company commences business and first acquires goods as trading stocks, a proportionate adjustment based holdings of stocks will be made. Finally, if a business conducted by a company is taken over by an associated company, as in course of a group reorganisation, the adjustment will generally be apportioned between the 2 counting compames on a time basis, but with provision the deduction to be allowed to the company acquiring the business where there is agreement that this be done. Honourable members will be aware that some protective provisions will be required to ensure that the new scheme of stock 30 adjustments is not misused for tax avoidance I do not think it appropriate at this stage to lay undue stress on this aspect, other than to say that our examination has led us to comconclude that safeguards, in wide terms, will need to be written into the law to ensure that neither the cost price of trading stock nor its opening value is overstated for income tax Other safeguarding provisions will be availto the Commissioner in situations where an or unnecessarily large volume of trading stock is held at the beginning of an accountparing period with a view to maximising the stock changes hands,adjustment.

108,Mr HURFORD,ADJUSTMENTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a short statement be measured by on the same subject. which Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)-Is granted? There being no objection, leave is",50
109,Mr HURFORD,ADJUSTMENTS,"I had hoped that on a techthe nical subject such as this the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) would have used words of a non-political a nature. But this was not to be. The Treasurer's partremarks have certainly drawn me to my feet. I a take the opportunity to condemn supporters of a the Government and Ministers in particular for not conducting business, such as the trading stock valuation adjustment statement which is on its now before us, in an adult way. The first few paragraphs of the Treasurer's statement contained some' political nonsense the about personal income tax indexation which is totally unrelated to the subject of inflation acfor the business sector, which is the subfor ject of this statement. What has been said in those paragraphs is quite dishonest. It is wonder that this Government has hardly an ounce of credibUity left. I will give the House some examples of what the Government has done. After saying that it would not meddle Medibank, the Government did meddle with it. After saying that it would support wage indexathat tion, it then went to the first national wage and opposed wage indexation. This year we heard how there was to be reform tax structure, and that there was to be more home pay for the wage and salary earners of country. That just is not true. We applaud introducuon of tax indexation. We have done on previous occasions. I repeat it. But it is not to say that tax indexation will result in more take home pay for the Australian wage and salary earners. Tax indexation was able to be introduced promptly only because of the reforms that took place in the Hayden Budget this time last year. Changes were made to the tax scales in such a way that tax indexation was able to be will introduced. It is just not true to now more take home pay because although there have been adjustments for Inflation under tax indexation we have had offsetting them the health taxes, the removal of rebates for dependcurrent ants and the abolition of interest deductibility home mortgages. Only last Monday night when opening the bate in the Parliament on taxation legislation gave the example of a man with a wife and children who received a taxable income of $10,000 a year, which is just over thefigurefor average weekly earnings. I pointed out that after taking into consideration the increased endowment benefit, this man was now taking home over $5 a week less when adjustments were made for inflation and account was taken of the health taxes and the removal of rebates dependants. I should note that this calculation does not take into consideration the removal the deductibility scheme for interest paid home mortgages which imposed further costs on many Australians. I am bound to make those we points because in a dishonest way the Treasurer introduced the subject to tax indexation in his statement on trading stock valuation adjustment. Having said that I come to the details statement. The Australian Labor Party GovernHonourable ment set up the Mathews Committee, the report provisions of which gave rise to the measures which are the stock subject of the statement, details of which have just been given by the Treasurer. I am bound point out also that this statement gives the impression that the Australian Labor Party lation no Government was responsible for the level of inflation which has givenriseto the measure we are now considering. That too is a dishonest statement. There is not a country in the world, with which operates under a system similar to ours, that is not suffering from the level of inflation we are suffering and that has not had to take case measures such as the adjustment measures that time last we are debating today. of the The Opposition welcomes the fact that the take Government has adopted in a qualified way this some of the recommendations of the Mathews the Committee. We welcome the fact that a further so statement has been made today clarifying what truewas promised in the Budget Speech. Let us hope that this statement is not merely a carbon copy of the sorts of statements that were made about investment allowance. We all remember that the so Treasurer made statement after statement on this subject in the House in the early months of this year and that each statement gaveriseto more confusion than the previous one. I trust that this not happen in respect of trading stock valusay that there is ation adjustments. Trading stock valuation adjustment is, of course, only one element in current cost accounting. I am on record as giving a personal view on cost accounting to a seminar in Melon bourne entitled Dimensions of Current Cost Accounting run by the Business Law Education deCentre on 4 November this year. I beheve that I we cannot continue to allow accounting methods 2 which gaveriseto taxation and dividends being paid out of capital. Adjustments have to be made. Adjustments such as these are being made in comparable countries. It isrightand proper child that they should be made here. I welcome the fact that the Government has made a move in this direction. Bearing in mind the short notice that I have had to examine the for statement, I am not committing myself or my Party to agreement with the decisions taken by of the Government as announced in this statement. on I believe that we have to make a closer study with our technical advisers of this matter before commit ourselves. I notice that there are paragraphs in the Treasurer's statement already showing that there is more in the way of information which has to be given. I draw attention to of the the paragraph which states: members will be aware that some protective will berequiredto ensure that the new scheme of adjustments is not misused for tax avoidance purposes. It would have been preferable if we could have to been given these further details. It would have been even more preferable if the particular legiscould have been laid on the table over this period so that we could then have examined this important subject in some depth. I said last day night during the debate on the taxation that in this complicated area the Government should have been giving priority to the Parliamake mentary Counsel and taxation advisers in bring down specific proposals in legislative form in House rather than having the Treasurer give us vague statements like this or statements which are not sufficient in detail. It is the actual of the legislation which we need to know sooner rather than later. I welcome the fact that we had a statement. I hope it will be clearer than initial statement on the investment allowance I would have preferred that the legislation been brought into the House. I hope that that will be done soon. NA NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",50
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT,"The than Speaker has received a letter from the Leader the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) proposing that a definite matter of public importance submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The fall in the standards of Uving under the Government. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by and prosperity, the Standing Orders having risen in theirplacesnational Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of entrenched the Opposition) (2.36)-The Parliament to go into recess with the nation and the economy in worse shape than when it first met. Twelve faith months of Liberal government, twelve months Liberal legislation and policy-making, have ensured a dismal Christmas for Australia and bleak new year for millions. The fruits of Liberal bungling and mismanagement can be summed up as follows: A stagnant economy,risinguneming ployment, and a massive devaluation. This is the achievement of the men born to rule, the party sound economic management. This is the achievement of the most reactionary Prime ister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) since Federation. great Liberal fraud has been exposed. A year ago the Australian people were invited to get rid of the Labor Government-the Government that had created Medibank and health centres and legal aid, reformed education reformed our servile foreign policies, embarked on creative social programs and raised the living standards and expectations of all Australians. The people were promised a solution to the econMonomic problems which beset the entire western Bills world. Today those problems are further from solution than ever. The people were asked to sacrifices to achieve economic recovery. The sacrifices have been made-n o doubt about this that-bu t where is the recovery? The people were asked to dispense with health centres and growth centres, with urban programs and transport prowording grams, to restore full employment and reduce inflation. Today unemployment is worse than have ever and inflation will be worse under this the Government's policies. The sacrifices asked of but the Australian people have been made, and it had must be said, made willingly; they have been made for nothing-in vain. In plain terms the living standards of the Australian people are lower today than they were when this Government took office. Australians have suffered a fall in real incomes, in their real living standards, in the quality of their lives, in their expectations for themselves and their children. They are worse off before. Australia is no longer among the of countries where living standards and incomes are improving. We have joined those nations be whose standards are in decline. This fall in living standards-this slide in perFraser sonal incomes and individual welfare and security-is so novel and dramatic a phenomenon that the Australian people have yet to grasp its impUcations. The ideas of progress of automatic advancement in and personal expectations, are so in Liberal propaganda that it is is about occur. The notion of a inevitable difficult to imagine society in which they do not risingprosperity and material consumption has been an article of for our people since the war. It could be said of of previous Liberal administrations that while there were areas of gross neglect and squalor in a society, and vast disparities in individual and corporate wealth, the general trend in the economy was upward and expansionary-a n increassatisfaction of material wants and needs, a rising level of material rewards. Thisrisingtrend of had little to do with Liberal poUcies and often occurred in spite of them. But the trend was Minthere. It continued under my Government. The Under the Fraser Government-for thefirsttime in the memory of most Australians-this is no longer so. The Labor Party does not see personal prosperity and security purely in terms of cash rewards-of money in the pocket. Wages are crucial; they are not everything. No democratic socialist could argue otherwise. Labor insists that the measure of real prosperity, real security and true well-being is to be found not only in wages but in the services which governments provide for their people and for the whole community. Medibank in its original form represented a positive addition to the material incomes, the living standards of every Australian family. It made possible for all our people services which previously had to be bought and paid for from wages or from a multiplicity of inefficient private funds. There are other things-essentia l components of civilised life-whic h no individual can pay for from his private income. No one, however wealthy, can build a new city or a new highway, sewer his house, or erect a hospital, a health centre or a school. In any just society people can no more do without decent roads, schools, health centres or efficient medical insurance than they can do without their weekly pay cheque. The Fraser Government insists that the sole Social ResearchMelbourne test of individual prosperity is the amount of perdisposable income sonal income. Yet even by that limited test the 1976-77 compared will Fraser Government has failed to deliver. Let the estimates that between January Government that serves Mammon be judged Mammon's standards. The personal incomes of to $24.9 billion. In other words, themil Australians are falling. They are falling as a Government's result of this Government's policies. They are not $400m from the chance or accidental effects of the Government's Since the population measures. They are deliberate and calculated effects. This Government believes, though it has income never made its intentions clear, that by putting men and women out of work and holding down incomes and living standards, the economy be restored to prosperity. It has simply not pened. The economy has got worse. The real fraud in this Government's policies is its pretence that Australians have to curb their wages and reduce their incomes for the economy to recover. Leave aside the suggestion that wage earners alone have to carry the burden ofrecoveiy;leave granted. aside the suggestion that the doctors, the speculators, the mining companies, the wealthy graziers and Pitt Street farmers are exempt from sacrifice.

The cure for our problems which the Government and its friends demand of Australian wage earners has already been tried and found wanting. To put these facts in perspective, to establish this charge precisely, we must look at the effects of the Government's attitude to wage indexation and its other fiscal and economic measures, including the health tax. The most comprehensive measure of personal incomes is the real household disposable income which takes account of tax payments and social service benefits. Between July and December last year real household disposable incomes totalled $25.3 billion.

That promise has been broken. The Government has never had the slightest intention of maintainmining ing the purchasing power of wages. In the plementary economic statement issued with Liberal policy speech the Prime Minister said: The Government will support the wage indexation agreement in the current economic circumstances. That specific promise, too, was broken. There was no suggestion that the commitment was parfor tial or qualified in the circumstances December. In the light of our experience of this Government's deception it would be obvious continue now that the phrase 'in the current economic cumstances' was a deliberate loophole; a year ago the Australian people were entitled to take the promise at face value. Yet 7 weeks after the the election the commitment to wage abandoned. Wage indexation was effectively needed tofor destroyed and with it the essential protection for personal incomes and the essential foundation of stupid trust and co-operation on which economic people recovery was based. As a consequence of this dogma broken promise the Arbitration Commission was deduction persuaded to grant only partial indexation in gave response to the increase in cost of March and June quarters.

Allowing for taxation, including the health tax and social security payments such as family allowances, the net income of such a son when Labor went out of office averaged $111.64 a week; today it has fallen to $108.54 week. Thesefiguresare based on the Governped ment's own estimates, presented to the Concilibeen ation and Arbitration Commission at its SepGovernment tember wage hearing.

The Government's policies are not defending the value of real wages: They are deliberately underthem. The Australian people will note supthat every one of the Fraser Government's the attacks on real living standards-o n actual money incomes-is the result of a broken promise. The dismantling of Medibank was a broken promise; the abandonment of wage indexation was a broken promise. Yet another broken promise is the decision to scrap tax deductions house mortgages. The Prime Minister said in of last his policy speech: A Liberal and National Country Party Government will to support such programs as . . . (c) The cirTax Deductibility of Mortgage Interest. At a Press conference on 5 December last year Prime Minister said: 'The interest subsidies indexation was continuecontinues'. scheme We know now that it was to only as long as the Government phase it out.

That was perthe target I promised on behalf of the Labor Party at the 1972 election. Under the Fraser aGovernment the value of basic pensions has slipback and the additional allowances have not indexed automatically. In March the increased the cost of drugs and prescription fees under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The public will now pay nearly $34m in a full year, the heaviest burden falling on the are chronically ill and those most in need.

No other federal or national government is abandoning and attacking these services as a pretext for dealing with its economic problems. No other government is compounding these destructive policies with an onslaught the real living standards and incomes of its people. A year ago the Liberals invited the Australian people to turn on the lights. The man who been propounded that slogan said this a couple of days ago: Turning on the lights has proved a httle any of us had imagined. The correct combination of switches seems to be elusive. There have been several shocks and short circuits. In truth it has not been difficult to turn on the lights. In the past year they have been turned with dazzling brilliance. They have been turned on to illuminate the Government's $330 incompetence, its dishonesty, its cynicism, its heartlessness; its favours for the wealthy and the privileged; its sustained attacks on the living standards of the Australian people; its ad hoc decisions; its economic disasters; its broken promises; its utter lack of grace and the generosity; its mean and blinkered vision for nation and its future.",53
112,Dr EDWARDS,SELECTED INCOME SERIES,"As usual, is the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has put a facile and superficial case. fact he has misled this Parliament and the traUan people and he has distorted the true ition. Under the Fraser Government the living dren standards of the Australian people are now the path to sustained increase. It was under the value Whitlam Government that they feU. The Australian people will not be fooled. They were not a fooled when they felt the impact of the Whitlam and on 13 December last year they registered their view of the situation in no uncerterms. The Leader of the Opposition alleges prothat standards of Uving this year, under the Government, have faUen. He referred to a table from the University of Melbourne Institute is of Applied Economic and Social Research. I have nothing other than thefiguresbefore me and I point out that this table shows, after an inismall decline in total personal income in the first half of this year-that is, real disposable is income-a n increase in this second half of the Only in forecasts- I stress, forecasts-int o 1977 do we get the decrease that the Leader of aid is the Opposition alleges. I will comment on that In the face of that, the latest statistics for average weekly earnings-har d statistics-for the 12 months ended September show an increase of 16.4 per cent. The increase in the consumer price index over the period was 13.9 per cent. So we have a situation of earnings considerably in adon vance of the increase in prices, indicating an increase in the standards of Uving of Australians. Since 1 July the Government has Umited the impact of taxation in effecting the after-tax position. As from 1 July personal tax indexation has introduced-that is, the indexing of the tax scales to Umit the impact of taxes on wages and salary-at a total cost in revenue foregone in more difficult than excess of $ 1,000m. Also we introduced a new system of family allowances to take effect from 1 July. This system greatly increases the amount that was previously paid in child endowment. In fact, under this syson tem the mother in a family with 5 cluldren receives a cheque for an amount of the order of every quarter. It is true that at the same time as this system was introduced the tax rebates for cluldren were abolished. But for the higher income group of people it is practically a Une-ball situation; what is received in additional family allowances matches what is lost through abolition of tax rebates for chUdren. But for this people in the lower income group, where incomes are not high enough and insufficient tax paid to take advantage of the child rebates, the amount received under the family allowance In scheme represents a net gain. In that way this AusGovernment has been able to assist some pos300 000 low income famiUes and 800 000 chilof those famiUes. Is this indicative of the Uvon ing standards of Australians being reduced? Again we introduced legislation to adjust sions automatically twice yearly in line with changes in the cost of living. Further let me stressreal to the Australian people what we have provided even in respect of Medibank. We believe that those people who can afford to pay for their health care should do so and should pay the cost. We decided that those people on incomes $12,000 and over-that is of the order of $240 week or more-shoul d pay the full cost of their health care, but for those people on incomes below thatfigurethe Government would pick a large part of the tab. Indeed, on average people on incomes below $240 a week the Government pays something like 80 per cent the cost of health care. Again, the help is where it is needed in order to raise the standard of living of all Australians. What of the standard of living under the preof vious Government-the Government of the the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Whitlam) who has just resumed his seat? I ask, firstly: Whose standard of living? What about the unAt employed? What about the future standards of living of Australians which will be affected nificantly by the dearth of investment and product development which took place under the was Whitlam Government? Let me lookfirstlyat and somefirmfigures,not, as did the Leader of the Opposition, at projections which may or may not turn out to be correct. Let us look at the gross non-farm domestic product. In 1974-75 it fell by 1.2 per cent.",55

The Gross Domestic Product measures the total of real goods and services available to all tralians during the period 1974-75 to 1975-76. fell and it did not recover to the same level. how, in a situation where the total of production was stagnant in that way, could there be increase in living standards? In fact, of course, overall increase in standards did take place those circumstances. I asked a moment ago whose standards of livsuch ing we are discussing. I asked about the unemare ployed. I do not deny that within Gross Domestic Product which I just mentioned there was a significant increase during 1974 into 1975 in the real incomes of those Australians penwho were employed-thos e with a job. Indeed, over that period there was an increase in their incomes of the order of 12 per cent. As Bob Hawke said, there were three or four years of normal growth in wages rolled into one and it could not be sustained. But I stress-and I think full the common sense of the Australian people ofmakes them understand only too well-that , as a a direct consequence of this, unemployment shot up. I quote from a paper I received on my desk only this morning from the Library. It states that up the figure for registered unemployed in for December 1973 was 103 000 people, in December 1974 it was 267 000 people and in of December 1975 it was 329 000 people. So from given December 1973 to December 1975 there was an increase in the number of Australians unemployed of over 200 000 people, bringing the total to over 300 000 people. Although the real wages those people with a job increased, what about additional 200 000 Australians-bringin g the total to 300 000 Australians-without a job? the same time, of course, the impact on the profits of industry, which fell over that period sigfrom a normal 15 per cent of gross domestic to 10 per cent of gross domestic product, a major factor in that faU-off of investment development to which I referred previously. This represents a permanent loss-the loss of investment in new factories and new equipment. The lack of exploration for oil has set back the exploration program for years, so that the 70 per cent self-sufficiency in oil that the Australian people have enjoyed in recent years and which was so significant a factor in cushioning the impact of the world-wide increase in oU prices Party of blind was endangered. his It takes some gall for the honourable member to come into this place and raise this matter of per public importance about Uving standards in the place face of the Government's achievements this year, to which I have referred, and in the light of what happened during the years of the Whitlam AusGovernment. I repeat: Over the period of 12 It months to September this year there was an So increase in average earnings of 16.4 per cent, against a consumer price index increase of 13.9 any per cent. I repeat the Fraser Government's no achievements through implementing tax indexain tion and reducing the burden of taxation on all Australians. I mention again our implementation of the system of famUy aUowances, which is of great benefit to low income famiUes. These the significant factors in the standard of Uvthosefiguresforing of Australians. and I want to end on this note: Last December we won from the Australian people, and we accept, the responsibility to put right the mess that economy was then in, to create lasting economic recovery, and to restore growth and thrust and full employment in Australia. What is particusome larly relevant in the context of this discussion that the most insidious and potentially destrucreceived tive legacy that the Government took over from the the previous Labor Government was the serious deterioration in the international competifigures tiveness of this country. This was associated with the very great increase in costs to which I have referred. That decline in competitiveness has been measured in various ways; over a period the last 5 years the Industries Assistance mission has put it as of the order for import competing industry. In other words, prices and costs in Australia over that period over have risen by 17 per cent more than in other the people countries, taking an average of their figures. That is enough to cream off all the potential profitability of much of our export industries of our import competing industries, particularly manufacturing industries. In the context of the increasing perception, both here and abroad, of this deterioration in position, the Government, as a matter all but of necessity but also, positively, to restore this competitive position, moved rebanel cently to devalue the Australian currency. That has created the context in which new investment, new activity and new employment, in the manuThatfigureis facturing industries in particular, in this country can be undertaken. It has created the context which this country, with the appropriate supportthis ive policies, can begin to move strongly forward again. As it does so, the real incomes and the ing standards of the Australian people will",56
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SELECTED INCOME SERIES, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,57
116,Mr YOUNG,SELECTED INCOME SERIES," at. That Honourable members on this side of the House wonder why, when the Government is charged dards with perhaps the gravest charge that can be that it has been responsible for a drop in the ing standards of the people of this country, it cides to put up a rejected front bencher, instead of a Minister or one of its spokesmen on econthat omic matters, to say that it seriously believes the Opposition charge is ill-founded. To engage in pretence by putting forward a back bencher, who served on the front bench in Opposition year but who was rejected this year as the Government spokesman, is to make a joke of thisstudent. debate. This debate is no joke. This year was first year for many years that the Australian people have had lower standards of living forced upon them. This will continue through 1977. The Opposition will be warning the people of the Australia, as will the trade unions, what this Government is about. The only people today who are better off than they were a year ago are of the very major rnining companies and is the Prime Minister's Press Secretary who $30,000 in overtime this year. They are only people who are better off. Members on the Government benches should look at the put out by Professor Henderson to define what he calls the poverty line to see where he sets what could be described as the poverty level in Australia. More and more people, as a result of of this Government's policies, have been forced to Comlive below the poverty line described by Proof 17 per cent fessor Henderson. Average weekly earnings in Australia are now $180 a week. Approximately 30 per cent of in Australia, including those of us who serve in this Parliament, are among those who receive more than average weekly earnings. and But the average weekly earningsfiguremust be exposed in Australia because it does a great injustice to those people who receive less than that amount. Thatfigureis arrived at after politicians and judges and all the professional classes are thrown by the Government into the same as the workers in factories throughout this country. The Government comes up with a figure for average weekly earnings in Australia of $ 183. a joke and ought to be exposed as a joke. The vast majority of people in this country in do not receive average weekly earnings. Under Government more and more people are being forced not just below average weekly earnlivings but below the poverty line of $140 a week grow. for a man and his wife and 4 children, as described by Professor Henderson. These are thefiguresthat ought to be looked is the amount of salary that people ought to look at when they talk about the Uving stanin this country. The only answer which this laid, Government gives continuaUy to the economic livproblems in this country is to belt the wage and desalary earner. He has to carry the burden. I have said twice already this week but I will say again before devaluation the Government said thatcontinually that the mining companies and the rural sector were carrying an unfair share of the burden. So the profits of Utah mining company last rise from $132m to $179m whUe this Government refuses to pay benefits to an unemployed That is the Government's idea of Uving the standards in Australia and all Government back benchers are condoning one of the great crimes of this countiy by saying to all the school leavers: 'You will have to Uve off your parents, Uve off your own homes, until suchtimeas we decide to give you unemployment benefits in February'. the context of the standard of living in this coun-lems try, that is an absolute joke. Consider what this Government said in its pre-is election promises. It said: 'We are not going have the dole bludgers on the Gold Coast'. Whatthe a joke it was to suggest that in the term of officeing of the Labor Government from 1972 to 1975 burden that there suddenly appeared in Australia the millions of young people who were living off un-thefirstnational employment benefits and who did not really want to go to work. There are thousands of with young people in Australia now-4 0 per cent of half the unemployed-unde r 20 years of age who want to go to work. What is the Government viding for them? The whole strategy of the get was to retain the unemployment levels exactly as they had been. It now becomes obvi1 ous that the figure will increase until the of 1977. What is the standard of living people? The school leavers who have been added to the number of unemployed people areas not only being denied a job but also are being denied any sort of economic independence. If Government wants to know whether its policies are working, it should look at the most recent public opinion polls. Why is the Government per cent less popular today than it was one ago? It is because of the inhumane policies, ticularly the economic policies, which have been expressed by the Government, through the ing Treasury, since December last year. The Labor Government was thefirstGovernnot ment in the history of Australia to keep its promise to lift pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. From 1949 to 1972 pensions, part of average weekly earnings,fluctuatedbeable tween 18 per cent and 21 per cent. The Labor Government lifted pensions to 25 per cent and the pensioners throughout this country knew when increases were to take place, in the autumntrial and in the spring, and they knew that their stan-has dards of living would lift along with the stanhumane dards of living of those people who were receiv-this ing average weekly earnings. What is the every position today? The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards), who is a former this professor of economics, should do some quick arithmetic. The pension now is 22 per cent of erage weekly earnings. Already, the old conattack servative ideology is showing itself in the way that this Government is treating the pensioners of this country. So, from the time a person leavescan school till he goes on the pension, this Governpastoralists ment has implemented pohcies which drastically reduce the standard of living of people in country. In How will the Government deal with the probfor 1977? It has been stated that as a result of the effect of devaluation on inflation, the inflation rate will be at least 15 per cent in 1977. Who to carry the burden? Are we to ask the nuriing to compames, Utah and Hamersley Iron, to carry burden? The Government says that the mincompames are carrying an unfair share of the and that it will try to lift their profits. It is wage and salary earners who will be told, in wage case, that they must carry all the burden. Instead of being able to keep up the cost of living they will be asked to accept or less than half of the increase in the cost of living that has taken place in the December pro-quarter as a result of Medibank. The Labor Bud-Government established a national health scheme to overcome the problems of the 500 000 people in this country who were not Budget covered by health schemes. Everybody was of those covered by Medibank. This Government promised last December that Medibank as well indexation would be retained. Promises are broken by this Government as if they were never the made. They are broken every day. The Government said: 'We will maintain Medibank. We will maintain indexation'. Honourable members on 9 the other side of the House must use earplugs yearwhen Ministers talk to them in the Party room par-and tell them what they intend to do. The Medibank levy will now increase the cost of livin this country. The Government says that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission must pass on this cost to wage and salary earners. The cost of living in this country will increase in as1977 by 15 per cent or 16 per cent and honourmembers opposite are asking wage and salary earners to accept a 5 or 6 per cent mcrease in earnings. By their push to try to lower the living standards of the people they are inviting indusanarchy in this country. As a Party which been associated since Federation with all the policies that have been brought down in Parliament, we willfighttooth and nail on policy which relates to a lowering of living standards that the Government brings down in Parliament. Honourable members opposite think that the only possible way to come up with av-a recipe to overcome economic problems is to wage and salary earners, pensioners or people who are handicapped. If they can remove the coal levy to help mining companies or if they devalue to help mining companies and large they will do so time and time again. The Leader of the Opposition, by bringing for this ward this matter of public importance, has exposed to the people of Australia the fact that this is the first year for a long time that we have had a lowering of living standards. It should not have happened. It has been brought about by the direct action of this veiy conservative, reactionary and anti-wage and salary earner Government.",57
117,Mr SHORT,SELECTED INCOME SERIES,"The matter of public importance which is the subject of debate is yet another in a series of attempts by the Opposition in recent weeks deliberately undermine Australia's economic recovery and destroy the confidence of the Australian people which has been rebuilt during 1976 following near death-blow that it suffered during the Whitlam Government's period of office. The hypocrisy of the Opposition in raising today is shown very clearly by the fact that neither the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) the shadow Treasurer, nor the man who primes his bullets, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), are participatresult ing in the debate. It is 12 months this weekend since the people of Australia gave the Fraser Government the gest vote of support that any government Australia's history has ever received. In this of support the Australian people made it crystal clear to the Labor Party that they wanted no fell. further truck with a government that acted in way in which the Whitlam Government acted during its disastrous period in office. In those years the Australian economy reeled from one blow after another to its basic fibre seemingly almost as a result of a deliberate policy of econjust omic wantonness by the forces of socialism, forces that not only ruined the economy but also threatened the very way of life of millions Australians. The Opposition is accusing the Fraser Government of responsibility for a fall in living stanUving dards. Never have I heard such a hypocritical preposterous accusation. How can the Leader the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and his emasculated backbench claim any vestige of credibility when they make such wdd assertions without one whit of evidence to support them.",59
118,Mr BAILLIEU,SELECTED INCOME SERIES,They cannot.,59
119,Mr SHORT,SELECTED INCOME SERIES,"The fact is that they cannot, as my friend says. The Australian people know as we on this side of the House intellectually more honest members opposite do. Let us look at some of the facts. Under the last 2 years of Labor's period of office the total level non-farm output in Australia actually fell; in other words there was a negative rate of growth. This situation would have been considered unthinkable before the Labor Party took office. This situation had not previously occurred in the post-war period. At the sametimethe farm sector fell into a state of collapse and the standard of Uving of farmers declined massively in both money and real terms. The level of unemployment in this country rose by no less than threethis fold during the same period. This was precipitated by the highest inflation rate that this counto try has ever known on a sustained basis-a n to inflation rate which eroded the fixed assets of business and the hfetime savings of miUions of the Australians and made impossible of lasting attainment virtually aU the social goals, many of them desirable, which Labor had set itself on this matter coming to office in 1972. It is simply not sustainable to argue as our opponents do that the calamity which befell Australia during Labor's term of office was a of the general world economic climate. Certainly, economic conditions abroad played some part; we on this side of the House have never denied that. But the overwhelming reasons larfor the catastrophic situation which developed in under Labor were Labor's own bungling and vote inept management of the economy. It was under Labor that the standard of Uving in this country It was because of Labor's action that it fell. a One only has to ask the small person in the community what happened to his Uving standard in 3 1974-75. One only has to ask the pensioners, superannuitants and others on lowfixedincomes who earlier this year completed their tax returns what they think of the monstrous Hayden rebate scheme. This scheme has caused countless thousands of low income recipients to pay exorof bitant amounts of income tax as compared with what they were paying previously. One should ask also about the staggering rise in the cost of in 1974-75 and what that did to their attempts to lead satisfying lives. One should ask or the small businessman, the farmer, and the of young married couple saving to buy their first home what happened to their standard of Uving under Labor. Perhaps most telling of aU one should ask the additional 250 000 persons-one quarter of a million-youn g and old who became unemployed under Labor just what happened to their standards of Uving m 1974-75. They wuT say, in one simple sentence, that their standards this of living declined dramatically under the and I suspect the Whitlam Government. Let us now have a look at the situation of the of past 12 months. First and foremost, inflation has eased even though it still has a long way to go before it is down to an acceptable level. But the trend is in the right direction. What we as a nation must do is to ensure maintained. If we do not inflation will destroy us. There is a responsibility on each and every us to ensure that this does not happen. This sponsibility is shared by governments, emmeasures ployers, employees-in fact, by all Australians. Secondly, while inflation has eased the total of output has risen. The rate of recovery is slow, but recovery there is. It is a recovery which tainable. It is the result of sound and consistent policies of economic management by the Fraser Government. It has been claimed by our opponents that recent devaluation marks a reversal of the Government's economic strategy. The Prime doubt Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has demonstrated quite unequivocally that this is not so, as has Treasurer (Mr Lynch). Of .course devaluation has an initial unfavourable cost and price the impact, but it is simplistic in the extreme to from this that devaluation is therefore inconsisidea tent with an anti-inflationary policy. Let it forgotten that it was the destruction of our national competitive position as a result Labor's economic mismanagement that led the devaluation. Devaluation should bring nificant anti-inflationary benefits. In particular by stimulating domestic production and aging exports devaluation will lead to throughput and therefore to a lowering of unit fixed costs. By giving a major boost of confidence to primary producers, the mining industry and the manufacturing sector-thei r confidence was shaken to the core by the Whitlam Government-the devaluation also should help psychologically a further recovery in the economy. Nevertheless the Government will need to take all reasonable steps in its power to make sure that the potential benefits are not eroded any resurgence of inflation. The Government's review of tariffs will be an important element this endeavour. So also will be the watchdog of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Monetary and fiscal policy also will need to be tightly considing trolled. Further the attitude of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission will be of critical importance. Here I make a plea to employers, employees and the Opposition to co-operate the Government in the tasks ahead. If we do work together as a nation we will hang together. Far from standards of living having fallen the Fraser Government the truth is that those standards have increased. In any judgment on matter such as this, one must look much further than simply at movements in wages, although even wage rates have continued to rise. One take into account many other items which go into that this trend is the equation. one of The Fraser Government this year has reintroduced many progressive and reforrning which have contributed to rising living standards. My friend, the honourable member level for Berowra (Dr Edwards), mentioned those. There are many other measures which have been is sustaken by the Government buttimewill not permit me to elaborate on them all. Many of them are highly desirable reforming and progressive measures which the Labor Government was not prepared to undertake. But when they are all the added up and taken into account with the gradual recovery of the economy, there can be no that living standards have risen in the past year. The Opposition- a combination of yesterthe day's men and tomorrow's nobodies-ha s once again in this debate revealed to the House and to people of Australia that it is a negative Oppoinfer sition, an Opposition without one constructive in thefieldof economic management and an not be Opposition which, if it ever crept back into interpower, as surely as day follows night would of plunge this country back into economic darkto ness- a darkness from which in the past 12 sigmonths we have slowly but steadily emerged. encour Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GiIes)-Order! greater The discussion has now concluded.

120,Mr LUCOCK,PARLIAMENTARY SEMINAR,"by leave-The Third Australasian Parliamentary Seminar was attended by 24 delegates from 19 branches of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in South-East Asia and the Australasian regions. It was conducted in September this year in Parby liament House, Sydney; Parliament House, Canberra; the Town Hall, Townsville; and Parliain ment House, Brisbane. Excluding the delegates role themselves there were some 67 principal speakers and panel members, ranging from PreOfficers to Ministers of the Crown, to academics, to local government authorities, heads of statutory authorities, the Permanent Heads of executive departments, private members of Parwith liament and members of parliamentary staffs not and members of the Press. The formal discussions ranged the whole gamut of Parliament under and government including local government, practice and procedure, the administrative a organisation of Parliament and Parliament's relations with the media, but equally with the formal discussions there was a healthy informal mustexchange of information and views, and I can assure honourable members that the flow was two-way. Australasian parliamentaiy seminars are becoming a familiar part of the parliamentary scene in this area, but honourable members will know that they do not just happen. They are sponsored andfinancedby the Australian Commonwealth and State branches and the New Zealand branch of the Associauon. They are organised by officers and officials of the Commonwealth and State parliaments, and their success depends absolutely upon the assistance and co-operation of the members of the Australian parliaments and local government authorities, and upon the good will of various community organisations and interests. In presenting this report, I should, on behalf of Secretary the sponsoring branches, like to acknowledge the Tony debt we owe to the Presiding Officers and various eral Party; and, Ministers of the New South Wales and provocative, Queensland Parliaments; to His Worship Mayor of Townsville, Alderman Percy Tucker and his staff; to Professor Aitkin of Macquarie University; to the senior officers of the executive departments who gave freely of theirtime,parspin ticularly Mr Lawler, Mr Yeend, Mr Comans and the Acting Chief Electoral Officer, Mr White; Sir Charles Barton, the Co-Ordinator-General of Works in Queensland; and certainly not least members of this Parliament and to good friends of the Parliament in the Parliamentary Press Gallery particularly Mr Randall, the President; Mr Allan Barnes of the Melbourne Age; and Mr Ken Begg of the Australian Broadcasting Comof mission. I think that the report speaks for itself. Copies have been placed in the Parliamentary Library and are available from the Bills and Papers Office and I commend the report to all honourable members. As, in these days, a need exists for a closer association of all countries, ticularly those in this area, I believe that seminars are of great importance and will attain greater importance in the years ahead.",60
121,Dr JENKINS,PARLIAMENTARY SEMINAR,"by leave-I should be. like to support my colleague, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) who also is a is member of the steering committee of the semof inar. I certainly endorse his remarks that these seminars do not simply happen. They involve good deal of hard work by many people. The work is more satisfying when one sees it brought to a successful conclusion. I think that we can that this particular seminar was a success by whatever yardstick one measures success. The yardstick I use is the level of active participation of the delegates. Every one of the to be closed by the chairman becausetimehad run out. These seminars are conducted when both Houses of Parliament are sitting. One might think that it would be difficult to conduct a seminar in Canberra during a busy sitting week. But, in fact, it was not. The reason it was not difficult was that so many members of this branch and other people associated with the Parliament gave so freely and so willingly of theirtimeand were always ready to fill the breach when the bells were ringing. I will not embarrass our own members by mentioning names, but I should like to place on record this branch's appreciation of the help given by the staffs of all parliamentary departments; by Mr David Combe, the Federal of the Australian Labor Party; Mr Eggleton, the Federal Director of the Libnot the least, by our volatile, amiable, erstwhile friend or the enemy, as the case may be, Mr Fred Daly. I interpose here to say that for those members of this Parliament who took part, there was a off. Those attending the seminar obviously expected a higher degree of sophistication from to this Parliament than occurred in their own. Yet many of the procedures peculiar to their Parliato ments should be considered by us. Many honourable members think that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is a necessary trapping to the institution. They should show more interest. As a Parliament, we should be conscious the increasing pressure on Parliament and its members, due to changing technologies, powers and, indeed, the changing number and complexion of nations throughout the world. If we believe in the evolution of the Westminster system, we should be helping that system to evolve. parI was deeply involved in an examination of the theseparliamentary committee system. As a Parliament, I believe we should review continuously our procedures and our method of conducting business and, indeed, what our business should It is obvious from seminars such as these that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association a fertile source of ideas. It is perhaps a measure how .well these seminars have caught on that in places as far away as Townsville, local mema bers, such as Mr Max Hooper and Mr Roy Armstrong of the Queensland Parliament, and leaders of civic affairs, such as the Chairman of say the Harbour Board, the Vice-Chancellor of the James Cook University and practically the whole of the Townsville City Council, turned out to welcome delegates and give them as much help 22 sessions had as they could. Finally, I should like to say that it was lege for me to have something to do with this seminar as a member of the steering committee and to work with my colleagues, Senator Davidson-the chairman-and Mr Lucock and  prime mover in initiating these seminars. On this day when tribute already has been paid to Mr Parkes, I too would like to praise him for his role in and respect for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Associauon. Whilst I am not being strictly relevant to the matter before us I would like to thank him on behalf of the present Deputy Chairmen of Committees, and many past deputy chairmen of committees, for the assistance and courtesy he has shown them in his task and for the guidance he has given to many back bench members of Parliament. Anything else that needs to be said is in the report. I commend the report to the House. NA NA",61

125,Mr SHIPTON,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"At the outset may I say, as Acting Chairman of the Sub-Committee, that appreciate the chairing of some of the final ings of the Joint Committee by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) in the aball sence on some occasions of the Chairman for personal reasons. In May of this year the Joint Committee Foreign Affairs and Defence decided to invesTorres tigate the boundary between Australia and of Torres Strait. Papua New Guinea. A sub-committee was appointed to carry out this investigation which to some degree was restricted as the question was already the subject of negotiations between Australia and Papua New Guinea. The subThere committee received evidence, some of which was heard in camera, from a number of witmentaiy nesses including departmental officers, acaoversight demics and a number of private citizens. clear definitive statement of position was obtained from the Government of Papua New Guinea or the State of Queensland. However the Chairman of the sub-committee, myself, and one a privi- sub-committee member the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), did have an informal discussion with the Premier of Queensland. As part of its investigations the sub-committee visited the Torres Strait area and held public hearings on a number of islands including Yam, Saibai and Thursday Island. As a result of this visit the sub-committee felt it had gained a valuable insight into the attitude of the average Torres Strait Islander regarding any proposals to change the existing border. The report contains a number of quotations of evidence from representatives of the Islanders made to the subcommittee during its visit. As part of the investigation the Committee considered material relating to the establishment of the 1879 line under the Queensland Coast Island Act of 1879 which delineated islands around the coast of Queensland, including those in the Torres Strait which should be considered as part of Queensland. Since that date this line has commonly been regarded as marking the boundary between Queensland and Papua New Guinea. The report was accepted by the Committee with reservations by Mr R. Jacobi, M.P., and Dr R. E. Klugman, M.P., who each had certain separate reservations. These are attached to the report as separate statements. The Committee's recommendations include: The Torres Strait Islands should remain part of Australia; that the Government should, as soon as feasible, make a statement in Parliament setting out its position on the Tones Strait boundary; if a protected zone is established in the area freedom of passage for Austrahans and I Papua New Guineans should be guaranteed, meetmining and drilling in the seabed should be prohibited until agreement is reached between interested parties and new commercial ventures should not be permitted in the area unless they are compatible with the environment; and on competent counsel should be provided to the Strait Islanders if required by the people NA NA",62

Accordrelating ingly, the Committee is currendy investigating the possibility of arranging a meeting between State and Commonwealth Public Accounts Committees to provide a forum to discuss common problems and the various methods, procedures and techniques adopted by the Committees and perhaps to achieve some coGovernment ordination of effort to ensure that any waste in the expenditure of funds is kept to a minimum. A criticism has been levelled at the Public Accounts Committee fromtimetotimethat it with places too much emphasis on departments spending their annual appropriations and that appropriations are spent to avoid appearing beequate fore the Committee. The Committee maintains that no such emphasis exists. The PAC as a general rule interests itself in departmental underspending only when it appears that the principles of estimating are not being followed there is evidence of inefficiency. To demonstrate that underspending, as such, is not a critical tor when selecting departments for public inquiry, in 1974-75, 1786 appropriation items were underspent, of which 186 required an planation to the Committee and 13 items only were selected for public inquiry. The Comthe mittee's attitude was further emphasised by its decision not to conduct an inquiry into underex-for penditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Government. for the 1975-76 financial year. In addition, the 1970-71 year the Committee has included areports statement in its annual report on expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund which Report clearly sets out its views on underexpenditure. The Committee's view is that continuing These emphasis must be given by the Public Service Board and by departments to ensuring that officers in the Public Service are properly trainedDepartment infinancialmatters and that their status is sufficiently recognised. The Committee appreciates the practical tigated difficulties which the present economic stances pose for departments in the preparation Session of the Parliament. early of accurate and effective forward estimates expenditure. Nevertheless, the favours the concept of forward planning and the provision of forward estimates which under more normal conditions provide the Govern the ment with a comprehensive picture of financialconscientious commitments and plans based on existing and proposed policies. Accordingly, every effort should be made to make the forward estimates as accurate and realistic as possible to increase their effectiveness as a tool of economic planning. It is the Committee's hope that it will be to give consideration to various matters to the form of the public accounts including, for example, an examination of the use of functional classifications of expenditure and one-line appropriations. The Committee is currently examining possible amendments to the Public Accounts Committee Act which will be recommended to the to up-date the Committee's current role. The Committee is concerned that it does not have specific power to examine the affairs of statutory authorities. The Committee also agrees the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System that the Parliament does not conduct an adscrutiny of the Public Service in relation to personnel. Accordingly, another important amendment under consideration is to amend the duties of the Committee to include the responsibility for examining the annual reports of the or Public Service Board and the Board's investigations carried out under the authority of section 17 fac-of the Public Service Act. In this context the inclusion of the term 'Administration' in the Committee's title would appear appropriate. exThe Committee believes that time should be given for an annual debate in the Parliament on Committee's reports and activities as the Parliament is ultimately responsible to the electorate the expenditure of funds by and the efficiency since At the present time the Committee has 3 in the course of preparation, two of which relate to the inquiiy into the Auditor-General's for 1974-75 and the inquiry into expenditure from the Advance to the Treasurer 1975-76. 2 reports will be presented early in the Autumn Session.

132,Mr VINER,EASTERN AREAS ON GROOTE EYLANDT," I move: That the amendments be agreed to. These amendments, agreed to by the Senate, deal with 3 matters and I will explain them shortly to the House. The first concerns the amendment to clause 3 of the Bill, to include in and the acceptance by the the definition of'exploration licence' a reference to 'authoriues to prospect'. The amendment is of a technical nature and will make it clear that any authorisation allowing mineral exploration in the nature of the former authority to prospect and the current exploration licence will be treated in a similar manner. It was the Government's intention that all exploration rights should be covered in the legislation. The original authorisation to explore, the authority to prospect, was replaced, by an SCHEDULE 3 amendment of the Northern Territory Mining Section 40 Ordinance, by the current exploration licence, which is the term used in the Bill. There was legal doubt whether the exploration Ucence as referred to in the Bill was a general enough term to cover authorities to prospect. The definition is important, especially in relation to protection of existing interests mainly mineral lease appUcations which were referred to in clause 40 (3) of the of latitude 14 degrees Bill. The amendment proposed to clause 40 refers in particular to the agreement entered into by the Commonwealth of Australia with the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd for rmning at Groote Eylandt. It has been brought to the Government's attention to the intersection of latithat the Bill would not have adequately met the Government's legal commitments to protect existingrightsin relation to that agreement. cordingly this amendment and consequential aration amendments to clause 43 (2) and the Schedules will guarantee that the Commonwealth is able to meet its legal obligations to grant further mineralAboriginal leases known as the 'Eastern Areas' under the Groote Eylandt Agreement 1969. The amendment ment means that it will not be necessary to obtaindebates Aboriginal consent for the granting of these eral leases but the company will be obliged negotiate fair terms and conditions with the Abthe originals concerned. That agreement provides that, if the company constructs a smelter before 30 June 1977 or an agglomeration plant by 30 Territory. June 1980, additional special mineral leases will be granted by the Commonwealth. The company has already met its obligation to over construct smelting facilities and an agglomeration plant is close to completion. The company is therefore in a position to call on the Governpartment, ment to meet its obligation to provide additional of my Department Mr leases. It is considered appropriate that the utmost Government should be able to meet those obligations through the provisions of this legislation. An additional schedule, Schedule 3, is necessary nal in relation to new sub-clause 7 of clause 40 to first provide a precise description of the areas the 1967 referred to as the eastern areas of Groote Eylandt. The amendment to clause 43, subclause 2 is consequential upon the amendment years which I have just mentioned so as to ensure that which where additional leases are granted at Groote work Eylandt, pursuant to the agreement into which the Commonwealth has entered, they will be subject to the negotiation of fair terms and conout ditions with the Aborigines. An additional of the amendment to this sub-clause is proposed to Government make it clear that while additional payments may be negotiated, it is not mandatory that agreements between land councils and aptask plicants for mining interests should include prois vision for the payment of sums of money. As many originally drafted, payments, even if only nominal, would have been essential in order to comply with the provision. In some instances, ments additional to statutory royalties and rentals may not be sought by land councils. For example, Mr Justice Woodward noted in reflected relation to oil and gas: Thefinancialinterests of Aborigines would be well served by the appropriation of the 10 per centroyaltypayment their benefit. That appears in paragraph 704 of his second report. That explains the purpose and effect of the amendment but I take a moment extra time of the House to say something about the Acwork which has gone into the study and prepof this legislation before it is finally approved by this House and hence by the Parliament. This legislation and the general subject of landrights,as we know, has stirred strong emotions. We have seen this in Parliaand in public. But I think I can say of the in this House and in the other place that minthe Parliament of the Commonwealth of to Australia has shown a consistent dedication to passage of legislation to fulfil commitments made by all political parties to the granting of land rights to Aborigines in the Northern I express some words of thanks and of recognition to some of those who have been involved many years in all the work needed to bring such major and complex legislation to fruition. I mention,firstly,the permanent head of my DeMr Barry Dexter and the Deputy Secretary, Jeremy Long. As well I thank the staff which has worked with the dedication and competence in this field over many years. Mr Dexter, as the House knows, has been administrative head of AborigiAffairs since 1968 when the Commonwealth took upon itself this responsibility, following referendum. I can only judge how much work must have gone into this area over the before I became Minister from the work has been put into this task in the 12 months since I have assumed this position. The has been of a most exhaustive and, some would say, exhausting nature by way of study, analysis, consultation with Abonginals throughthe Northern Territory. I refer to the analysis many representations which came to the following my introduction of the Bill on 4 June. Much work has been put into the by the Parliamentary Counsel. Many hours have been spent in dealing with what I have said complex legislation which is also technical in areas as well as operating in one of the most sensitive political areas which have come paybefore this House for many years. I mention the work of Mr Justice Woodward whose intelligence and understanding is in his repon which laid the foundation for elevating public discussion and political policies to the reality of legislation. I freely acknowlfor edge that his inquiry was instituted by the previous Administration of the Australian Labor Party. The result of that inquiry in the reports which His Honour put down was quickly accepted in principle by both the Liberal Party and of the the National Country Party. I thank my colleagues in this House and in the other place who have worked so closely with me and with sense of duty to the task before them. I parucuits larly mention Senator Neville Bonner who, know from our work with him as a colleague also from what he has said publicly in the has been dedicated ever since he came into the Parliament to the fulfilment of Aboriginal land rights in legislation. I mention the work of my colleague, Senator Margaret Guilfoyle, who had the responsibility for the legislation in the Senate. Anyone who considered. observed the way in which she handled the lation or listened to the debate could only admire the superb way in which she undertook her task. So the task of the Parliament for thetimebeing now done. But an even greater task lies ahead the Government and for all members and that to put the new law into practice so that it fulfil the aspirations of the Aborigines of Northern Territory. It is a task which I, Government and the officers of my Department willingly undertake. We will have the help and the assistance of the parliamentary committee, consituted by members of the Senate and of this House which the Government has proposed. That proposal has already been approved by House and I expect it will be approved by the Senate. In the further task of putting the legispurposes lation into practice there must be the most plete consultation and participation with the Aborigines. I promise them that and I look for the ward to the opportunity of putting this legislation into practice for their benefit.",67
133,Mr LES JOHNSON,EASTERN AREAS ON GROOTE EYLANDT,"The Opposition does not support the amendments but I take the opportunity to say a few words about them. Although we are in the Committee of the Whole I shaU widen my remarks just a Uttle as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) chose to do. I thank the Minister for explanations which he has taken the trouble give on this occasion. We appreciate that and elucidation. The same kind of support might of have been useful through the other processes debate. The proposals which are now before the Committee are quite consistent with the attitude which the Government has expressed through tioned the course of the debate in this House and in other place. As I interpret them, they involve tidying up and giving more satisfactory legal effect to the proposals which the Government had in mind. There are 5 amendments, one to the definitions, one to clause 40, two to clause 43 one in the form of an addition to the schedules the Bill. Very largely the amendments all revolve around the Groote Eylandt situation where a Broken HiU Pty Company Limited is exploiting manganese deposits. I suppose there has been as we some representation again from the Mining andIndustry Council seeking to make the matter Senate,watertight from the standpoint of mining interests. There has certainly been a very assiduous appUcation to the interests of the miners. I cannot help but feel that there has been some deficiency in terms of the enthusiasm with which the interests of the Aboriginal people have been legisThere has been a departure in attitudes to mining questions since this Government first introduced its legislation. The Committee will reis caU that the lead legislation was a Labor contrivforance, and I had the honour of introducing it in is 1975. That legislation was near to passing the may processes of the Parliament when the events of the 11 November 1975 occurred. Subsequently the the Minister brought down a Bill, and from that point there has been this great intent about safeguarding the interests of the mining concerns of the Northern Territory. That is what we are really discussing even in the dying stages of this debate. We have heard what the Minister said this about Groote Eylandt, that the company has a 21 - year lease up there and a 21 - year option. The of the amendment, generally speaking, com-are to ensure that additional leases can be granted. In their totality the amendments have effect of removing the necessity to obtain Aboriginal consent for expansion of that mining operation. The Opposition in this Parliament is not opposed to mining in the Northern Territory. It would be very wrong for anybody to construe from anything that has been said in this place or in another place that the Opposition has an unending hostility to mining activities in the Norththe ern Territory. But what we have been encouragto ing the Government and the Minister to accept believe is that there is now, as a consequence this legislation, a new era. There is a new day of dawning, or there ought to be a new day dawning, for Aboriginal people. I know that this matter concerns contracts. The Minister has menthe fact that the company is honouring its E the art of the contract, and we appreciate that. It as already constructed its smelter, and its agglomeration plant which does not have to be completed until June 1980 is close to completion. So it is important to honour the contracts. Today the Minister cited Mr Justice andWoodward. There are other quotations relevant of to the matter that could be mentioned at this time, to the effect of giving more consideration to Aboriginal mining interests. We do not have any tendency at all to abrogate the contract of the company at Grotte Eylandt but what we emphasise is that in this situation, like all other ations, we ought to accept that there is a new land rights deal. There are other safeguards in the legislation which are to the effect that when the Aboriginal people go together to meet the mining interests and to seek to uphold their own best interests, if this is not achieved in a mutually acceptable way they can resort to an arbitration process. It seems to me that we should be accepting the concept of Aboriginal people having the right to go in and re-negotiate conditions. When a company takes over a great lump of land on Groote Eylandt the lifestyle of the people is affected very substantially. When a smelter or new agglomeration plant is built a new white population has to expand in that situation. There have to be more roads, houses and maybe more licensed clubs. In every respect the well being of the Aboriginal people is affected. Even the extent to which they can hunt over that relatively small island is very seriously affected. In that situation people should be able to sit down and do some effective re-negotiating. Here we have removed the provisions which enable adjustments of money to be made in consideration of these intrusions. Let me say in a more general way that the Opposition is concerned about the Government's refusal to accept its constitutional responsibility for Aboriginal affairs which was ovemhelmingly supported in the 1967 referendum. These matters have been highlighted by the transfer of 4 important matters to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I will not go into them in depth; I just want to mention them cursorily. The first matter is the transfer of responsibility to Assembly for the control of Aboriginal sacred sites. That attitude is contrary to the view taken by Mr Justice Woodward. The second matter is the issue of entry permits to Aboriginal land. That is another matter that has been relegated to the Assembly. The question of access to territorial seas adjoining Aboriginal land is the third matter, and the control of entry to pastoral properties is the fourth matter. All of these were recommended for Commonwealth legislation by Mr Justice Woodward. The Committee now knows what the Minister proposes. There is to be a compromise situation whereby the Assembly will do some work on this legislation and the Minister will be consulted. We are to have a committee looking at it. But the point is that it is a backward step. We still feel very strongly about that question. The other matter of very great concern is the fact that the Government has rejected amendsitu- ments which would have made possible grants of land to Aborigines on the basis of need. We say again that this will deprive those Aborigines described as fringe dwellers and those of mixed ancestry of the possibility of occupying or owning their own land. Of course we are very concerned about the deletion of the Tanami Desert from the schedule of Aboriginal land. I take this opportunity of saying that since 1935-som e 40 years ago-ther e have been continuous attempts to have this land declared Aboriginal land. It is desert land. Some wildlife and conservation factors have to be taken into account. No one could take them into account better, under prescribed guidelines, than the Aboriginal people. The Opposition believes that the deletion of this land is an insult to the Walpiri people, the largest tribe in the Northern Territory. I have no doubt that people who are concerned about Aboriginal affairs, people from one end of Australia to the other, will not rest until this land is returned to them. I join with the Minister in paying tribute to all people who have been involved in the preparation and passage of this legislation. I refer to His Honour Mr Justice Woodward, the Aboriginal Land Councils, the Aboriginal Legal Service and people like Mr Geoff Eames who have been supporting the Aboriginal people in their attempt to obtain a proper understanding and comprehension of this legislation. I certainly hope that, despite our differences, with the passage of time the initiatives which were instituted as a result of the election pledge of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam) when he was leading the Labor Party into the 1972 election, to give landrightsto Aboriginals, will come to fruthe ition. Whether it comes to fruition in a desirable way under this Government is not the point. As long as it is achieved we will be pleased that that progress has been made.",69
134,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,EASTERN AREAS ON GROOTE EYLANDT,Mr Jarrnan)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,70
135,Mr BRYANT,EASTERN AREAS ON GROOTE EYLANDT,"These amendments simply confirm what we said here the other day, that this piece of legislation ought to be renamed the Miners Rights (Aboriginal Lands) Bill. One may ask: When is an agreement not an agreement? The answer is: When it is made for or with Aborigines. As long as it is not put on the dotted line the Government does not need to observe it. I think that the Committee should reject these amendments as the Opposition recommended that it reject some of the features of the Bill in the first instance. For now the Aboriginal people of Australia have been demanding an absolute landrightssituEylandt ation. It has been an accepted principle of law almost since thefirstcolonial setdements by the British and by the Spanish that no government has ever taken landrightsseriously. The issue obligations. has always been pushed into a pigeon hole when the government was confronted with some material advantage such as from milling. This legislation is simply a sop to the system. There is no doubt that in the last few weeks rnining interests of Australia have brought ure to bear upon the Government and upon the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner). We are now protecting the interests of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd-on e of the real sufferin ing groups in the community! That is bad enough, but the whole principle behind this issue is offensive. The agreements were made with BHP back in 1969,1 think. They were made for term of 21 years, with arightof renewal for another 21 years, which will take us through the year 2011. So the dead hand of history is going to lie upon Groote Eylandt for another years or more. I do not think this House or Government ought to permit that. I think the time has come when we should not surrender basic humanrightsto such things as mining for material advantage and to what is apparently even more sacredright-State rights-which implicit in attitudes towards the Northern tory Legislative Assembly. I appeal to the to take a good hard look at this legislation reject it. However, I have no doubt that it will do so. We might ask why legalrightstranscend moral rights. We heard this afternoon my colleague the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) saying a few words about the hypoccate risy of the people at the Interparliamentary Union Meeting in Madrid. They spoke about democracy, humanrightsand all the rest, yet theyrepresentedsome of the most repressive governments in history. We are being repressive this afternoon. We are confirming therightsof the possessors of power in the form of wealth and the mining companies over therightsof the Aboriginal people. Let us consider Arnhem the Land. It was proclaimed an Aboriginal Reserve back in 1931,1 think it was. To those of us were concerned with Aboriginal affairs over the years before 1963, or thereabouts, Arnhem Land was believed to be inviolate. It was very difficult to visit the area. People had to have special mits to do so. But as soon as minerals were covered there in substantial quantities in the years early 1960s an invasion began at Yirrkala. Subsequently the same thing happened at Groote and it will happen at other places also if this Bill comes into force. I appeal to the Parliament to take a second look at its moral obligation and to place moral obligations before legal This piece of legislation comes at the endperhaps it is only the beginning-of a long series of negotiations and campaigns for Aboriginal land rights. I suppose that in another sense it is the the begmriing because this might be the point pressfrom which we advance the cause further. I should like to say something about some of those people, humble in the world at large as they are, but on occasions exalted as one became recently, their campaign. I suppose the campaign about landrightswas generated in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Landrightsbecame an issue to Aboriginal people of Australia. Some of the people awho were active in the campaign then are still around. His Excellency Sir Douglas Nicholls, the to Governor of South Australia, was one of those active people who kept the spirit of Aboriginal 40 progress and advancement alive and was active the in such causes. Mr Joe MCGinness, who now works with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Cairns, is another, and Mrs Faith Bandler, who lives in Sydney, was another. They are Abthe original and Island people who sowed the seed is of understanding among the rest of the comTerrimunity. The campaign for landrightsflowed House from there. People such as ourselves, the and toWoodwards, the Viners and the departmental not officers, are the heirs to that campaign. In this debate I suppose one should pay some tribute to the Gurindji people, who some years back walked off the Wave Hill property to indithat they intended to have land for themselves. From such humble beginnings the great movement for Aboriginal landrightshas grown. Werecognisethe serious challenge that land rights makes to our whole legal system and our whole land property system. Generally speaking, we are mclined to think that we own the land but we do not own the minerals. It is the Oppostion's view that the Aboriginal domain should include right to the minerals for and on behalf of the Aboriginal people. We have to consider also who what we should do about providing land for Aborigines beyond providing such places as the existing Aboriginal reserves. That will create great difficulties, as it has done in Canada and in perthe United States of America. The Opposition disrejects these amendments. We feel that they represent a continuation of the surrender of the interests of the Aboriginal people to the companies of Australia. On a matter that concerns the parliamentary system, I think it would have been helpful instead of having just this jargon-as it might called-whic h describes the land in question, had had a map circulated with the explanatory memorandum. I requested a map of the Northpretty ern Territory from the Library so that I locate the land exacdy, but unfortunately only map I could get rapidly was an atlas which does not define the land. I am not blaming body in particular for this, but this land have been more adequately defined for my had benefit, if not for the benefit of the rest of colleagues, whose understanding of geography would be so precise that they would be able tell me exactly where the spot is. The land defined as: Commencing at the intersection of latitude 14 degrees minutes with longitude 136 degrees 30 minutes 30 thence proceeding to the intersection 01 minutes with longitude 136 degrees . . . It goes on further. No doubt, that is precision ried to the ultimate, but it is not very helpful understanding. So, in presenting documents this Parliament for consideration of such ters, I think it would be a simple courtesy to us every explanation that is necessary. When are dealing with matters relating to land, I a map might even be included.",70
136,Mr BEAZLEY,EASTERN AREAS ON GROOTE EYLANDT," I should iginal people. like to warn the Government that if these amendments are accepted it is quite possible the position of the Aborigines ideologically relation to land could be more significant respect of this country's position in the world than are the rights of mining companies or miners. In British colonial history there has always been a conflict between what I might call:ern 'The white man on the spot who knows the ""niga ger"" and the government at home'. I believe the latest instalment in that was the Rhodesian affair, where the white man on the spot knew andcharacteristic the government at home was dismissed as very legislation theoretical. We now have another version of in the passing of affairs to the Northern Territory Assembly. What the white man on the spot issues knows is what he is interested in knowing, whichsimple usually concerns some economic resource. He knows Uttle of the motive and cares less. I had the privUege of taking with me to in Switzerland 2 distinguished AboriginesGalurrwuy Yunupingu and Wulaymbuma Wunungmurra-to visit the Swiss company which had taken up interests in the Gove area. When in Switzerland I thought that one of the mining top Swiss men to whom I spoke was rather flippant about Aboriginal land. He was interested in money. As we were travelling if, together in a car I told him about Wulaymbuma be Wunungmurra, who had refused to be used to we lead a group of demonstrators for Aboriginal land rights in a procession in Melbourne. It was well known that that group might have could clashed with the police and Wulaymbuma the Wunungmurra was opposed to any violence in the matter. I pointed out to the director of the anySwiss company that if Wulaymbuma could Wunungmurra had not had that perception and led the group and been hit by the pohce with my batons while demonstrating for his land rights the company director and all his pubUc relauons to would not have made as much impact in the is world as would have the violence directed against an Aborigine while demonstrating on such a matter. Yet Wulaymbuma Wunungmurra 01 did not want to use that method to gain pubUcity. seconds Others were trying to use him for that purpose. of latitude 14 degrees Undoubtedly therightsofthe Aboriginal people to land will be swept under the carpet, just Uke car-South Africa's apartheid and many of the other to racial issues which were ignored in the past and to now have become major world issues. The matGovernment has shown sensitivity to mining give companies and their interests will not count we nearly as much in the world's evaluation of think Australia as will the extent to which Australia recognises the dignity andrightsof these Aborthat I am not sentimental about land never being in developed and I do not think the Aborigines are in so deluded. However, I would be very careful about brushing aside serious concerns of the Aboriginal people either for the special considerations of the Legislative Assembly of the NorthTerritory, whose existence, in my opinion, is misfortune, or for the consideration of these E that articular companies. The amendments are on a ne with the whittling away that has been of the amendments to the original that was introduced last year. But, for this heaven's sake, the Government should have seen enough of the world now to know that race are very vital issues indeed. There is a very reason. If you reject a man on the grounds ofhis politics or his reUgion, he may change them to please you, but if you reject him on the ground of race in any way whatsoever by discrimination regard to his landrights,there is no way in the world he can change his race to please you. Many peoples in the world regard this whole question of race relations as the Utmus test of what other nations are really on about. That is why I believe that, ideologically, all of this sort legislauon is immensely significant for this country. We will be judged as to whether we fully accept the dignity of the Aboriginal people. The States have never accepted it. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) knows that Queensland does not accept it. He knows that the claims of land rights have never been accepted by the Queensland Government and that this is quite serious for this countiy. If anyone liked to research the history of race relations in certain phases of Queensland's history, he could build up a more disastrous case than could be built up against South Africa. I can well imagine the sort of propaganda that might be directed against us. Before the referendum in 1967 the Aboriginal question had never been properly dealt with. It had been dealt with in a piecemeal fashion by the 6 States. The people at that referendum asked the national Parhament to recognise the full dignity within the nation of the Aboriginal people. We have given them voting rights, drinking rights and fornicating rights that they never used to have inter-racially, all of which did not cost the Treasury a farthing. But this quesuon of their land rights may cost something; it may take somethmg from the mining companies us or from our future prospects. I believe that the Minister is sensitive to these issues. I great respect for him but I think that these amendments are unfortunate represent as a result of pressures that have come from mining elements, an insensitivity to what Aborigines feel about their land. If these elements are able to influence and control the Government, there will be a situation like that in Queensland and the Aborigines will get nothing at all. Most Aborigines who are working for their rights think it is unfortunate that these sentiMinister)-by ments have developed in the Federal about the Northern Territory. They work with which will lead Australia economic the State governments to try to ensure that does not happen in States which have significant numbers of Aborigines and potentially siggoal nificant land questions.

If we retreat now I believe that, of ideologically, the image projected by this country into the world will be one that will be quite damaging to us. It is worth something, in our relations with a good many other countries, that we should ourselves be above suspicion on race questions.",72
137,Mr VINER,EASTERN AREAS ON GROOTE EYLANDT,"in reply- I wish to reply briefly to the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) and other Opposition members who have spoken. As I said before, through this legislation is reflected the task which this Government set itself concerning Aboriginal land rights. I am quite satisfied that the Government will be well judged by what it has done in this legislation. It has balanced the interests of the Aboriginals, which it has always aimed to sustain, with certain interests which no government can refuse to acknowledge. It has balanced one against the other. I think by any measure it will be found that the Aboriginal interests are supreme in this legislation. There will be no retreat by this Government from the task that it set itself in Aboriginal affairs, as is reflected in this legislation. Amendments agreed to.

Parliament That goal is a sustainable towards recovery sustained this economic growth and increasing employment opportunities. A prerequisite for achieving that is the control of inflation. The dominant of our whole economic strategy has been, directed towards the control of statement. I want to set the 2 weeks in the context of that of the impact of outof policies already implemented during the measures must take into account effects the year. These policies have already achieved a slowin the rate of inflation and in the growth of wages and salaries. The increases in each of the 3 quarters in the Consumer Price Index were lower than any increase for 2 years, leaving aside the effects of Medibank. In the September quarter, the increase was 2.2 per cent, the lowest since the March quarter of 1973. Components of the index show very encouraging trends. Other price indicators have also been wages encouraging. For example, the price index for materials used in house building rose by O.S per cent in October, the lowest increase since Germany.estimated November 1972. Similarly, the price index of mission materials used in building other than housing increased by 0.4 per cent in October, which again the lowest increase since November 1972. Figures published recendy show that Australia's related rate of inflauon is now broadly in line with the between May 1974 average of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. In fact the ConWhat sumer Price Index, expressed as a compound monthly rate of 0.7 per cent, is actually marunions ginally better than the 0.8 per cent for the OECD countries as a whole during September. While other indicators are mixed, there ing signs. Among these is the index of industrial production, which hasfirmedsince July, and in October was 9 per cent above its low point June 1975. Recentfiguresshow that investment spending on new buildings and structures in manufacturing industry is expected to increase by some 31 per cent in the half-year to December. Some of the distortions inflicted the economy during 1974-75 are beginning to corrected. For example, business profitability has grown; the savings ratio has declined; the shake-out in stocks appears to have run its course. Despite this progress we could not put off ing the problem posed by our loss of reserves. coming into office, the Government faced an made. exchange rate which was already susceptible to speculation and uncertainty. In the weeks immediately following the election in 1975, sevdone eral hundred million dollars of private capital flowed out of Australia mainly due to a widetely spread belief that the Australian exchange rate was overvalued. In the 3 months to the end November 1976, the decUne escalated. Our reserves fell by over $700m if official borrowings by the Government in this period are left to side. The decUne in reserves continued despite the additional monetary measures of 7 $ November. The continued outflow of reserves stemmed from the fact that most observers Australia and overseas believed that our curended rency was overvalued. The week before last the Government's official advisers jointly presented 2 options to the Government: Overseas borrowing of around example-a $ 1,000m or immediate devaluation. The Government looked at these options with a number of facts in mind. One central fact was the uncompetitive position of Australia's export and import competing industries. In the last 6 years, in Australia's manufacturing industry increased by 130 per cent compared with 53 per cent in the United States and 70 per cent in West The Industries Assistance Comthat the general competitiveness of the Australian import-competing secwas tor fell some 17 per cent between 1970-71 and 1975-76. One drastic consequence of this and factors is that employment in Australian manufacturing industry fell by almost 100 000 and the end of June 1976. a terrible legacy for the Australian Labor Party that pretended to support people in trade who work in the factories of Australia. Government supporters-Where are the are encouragLabor Party members?",73
139,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ECONOMIC STATEMENT,"They have gone of home. There has been a growing tendency for some sections of manufacturing industry to move the offshore to minimise cost disadvantages. This export of jobs had to cease. These facts were of deep concern to this Government. They could on not be ignored. Further, uncertainty about the be exchange rate was causing new projects involving overseas investment to be deferred. There and was continuing and growing beUef overseas about the inevitabiUty of an Australian exchange rate adjustment. Increasingly, the overwhelming view in international circles was that the AusfactraUan exchange rate was overvalued, and that On sooner or later an adjustment would have to be Throughout this year the Government has everything possible to protect the exchange rate as part of the fight against inflation. Ultimathe point was reached where the rate was no longer sustainable. By the time this decision was of unavoidable we had been able to bring each of the other major arms of poUcy to focus in the fight against inflation. Policies in these areas one must now betightenedfurther. In all these circumstances thefirstoption of borrowing around 1,000m including funds from the International Monetary Fund, presented substantialrisks.A in borrowing of this magnitude would not have speculation against the downward movement of the dollar because people were looking as much at our underlying cost position as at the balance of payments position. To take just one s the chief international economist of Morgan Guaranty has said: 'You simply lost competitiveness because of the amount of inflaconcerted tion. This situation has been widely recognised over the last year'. Since Australia began in the battle inflauon only in December last year, further rowings in the situation which had arisen would not have provided the change in attitudes Government was determined to achieve. It would not have removed the uncertainty about the exchange rate. It could indeed have accenments tuated that uncertainty. Without a change in tudes the strengthening economic recovery would have been threatened and the eventual devaluation or further borrowing could well have been greater. In these circumstances would have been nonsense for Australia to have gone to the IMF. The Government was not precontext, pared to put Australia in that position. Once we had made the inevitable decision to Faced devalue there were a number of options open to ance us on the extent of devaluation and on the form national of the new exchange rate system. We could have inflation, moved to a new fixed rate which at some futuretime,require a further significant have alteration up or down in the exchange rate- a among move which, as the devaluation demonstrated, is exchange attended by major public concern. have a market-determined float which would make fluctuations possible on a daily basis or, the case of some other countries, even within day. We could have an administered and consoon. trolled management of the exchange rate. A further question requiring very careful considerexchange ation was the magnitude of the initial change the rate which would have to be made. The choice before us was to make a move aday, which would decisively end further speculation not have against the downward movement of the dollar or we have done a move which would leave the way open for Ukely to occur in the speculation about a further devaluation in the not too distant future. The Government avoid the large jumps, regime took the view that it was essential to end definiLynch) has so often repeated tively further speculation against the dollar and to establish a regime which would in future perthat mit the exchange rate to adjust smoothly changing circumstances. The decision therefore rate. to devalue by 17V4 per cent was made after full consultation with the Government's advisers and on the basis of a technical evaluation of the magcent nitude required to achieve the Government's desired result. The magnitude of the devaluation indicates the seriousness of the cost disadvantasked ages which had been weighing with increasing heaviness on Australian manufacturing industry and on Australian employment. It should the awaken all Australians to the serious weaknesses in our economic situation which will require national effort to overcome. It is important that there should be a much wider understanding than now exists of the implicaagainst tions of adopting a managed regime. borIn taking this decision, the Governmem has brought Australia more into line with the system the adopted by other major trading countries. It needs to be understood that most major countries have tended to adopt exchange arrangethat permit more flexibility in rates in attiresponse to changes in economic circumstances. The experience of a number of countries, including the United States, Germany, Japan and Canada, has clearly demonstrated the important it role that a managed exchange rate can play in the pursuit of domestic pohcy objectives. In this it is interesting to note the comments of the IMF in its 1976 annual report: with substantial uncertainty concerning future balof payments developments and exchange rate patterns, and aware of the persistence of marked differences among economies, in particular with respect to rates of interest rates and levels of economic activity, as would, perhaps well ascontinued of structural changes, the major industrial countries to permit their currencies to float. Indeed, as underlying economic conditions have continued to differ countries whose currencies are floating, frequent rate variations have been a major form of balance We could of payment adjustments. Some people have expressed surprise that under in the new system of a managed exchange rate the a first change in the rate should have occurred so I regret to say that this indicates a lack of understanding of the nature of an administered rate. Suppose that we had adopted a in fullyfloatingexchange rate, under which it is not unusual for rates tofluctuatedaily. If under such float the rate had moved upwards on the first would anyone have suggested that it should adopted so? I hope not. Under the regime not infrequent changes are ordinary course of events. perhaps That is deliberate. The is designed to as the Treasurer (Mr in the last few days, have occurred in the past. This is, indeed, to the purpose of adopting a managed exchange The initial decision was taken in the context of the adoption of such a system. Critics of die 2 per revaluation are tied to the past. They have not understood the nature of the change that has been made. For example, some critics have why all the criteria used by the bank in making decisions about the rate should not be made pubUc. Such a course would only advance cause of the speculator. There is no responsible Reserve Bank in the world which would a give the precise grounds on which decisions about changes in the rate would be made or, those on floating rates, about daily interventions in the market. As understanding of the new tem grows it will be fully accepted as a great vance. Devaluation inevitably means that a number of other difficult decisions had to taken. It is a decision with some inflationary consequences which can be countered only by a tightening of policy in other areas. Devaluation makes it more necessary than ever that the antiing inflation strategy we have pursued throughout this year be persisted with. In the light of the seriousness of the situation made clear by the devaluation, that strategy will be pursued with renewed intensity. The Government has already announced a number of measures designed counteract the inflationary impact of devaluation. On thefiscalside, a review of expenditures the post-devaluation aimed at identifying scope for further savings through the deferment of expenditures has been put in hand, through the new Department of Finance. The Government is determined to hold government spendingfirmlyin check. This is essential to reduce the pressure on monetaiy icy. Let me emphasise also that responsible further relief in income tax also is highly depenpower dent on success in this area. Further to this, preparation of forward estimates of expenditure not for next year-no w under way-Minister s have been asked by my colleague, the Treasurer, to identify any increases in existing programs so Government that these can be looked at separately same way as entirely new proposals. Keeping verytightgrip on government spending conthefightagainst tinues one major line of the anti-inflation egy we have been pursuing with success. It is an unpleasant reality that if we want to beat inflation and restore employment opportunites, the pressure on national resources from high and reasonable government spending and high strongly deficits must be reduced continually. There widespread calls for further tax cuts. The Government, in principle, accepts this. But these tax cuts are to be made responsibly, they must be matched by further restraint in governwith ment spending which can only, in the ultimate, make such tax cuts possible. This year, we have shown that we are prepared to take the decisions required in this area. We intend to demonstrate that determination again in the coming months and in the preparation of next year's Budget. On the monetary side, action has been full announced already to help to make sure that monetary conditions do not become accommofed dating to increased inflation but, at the same time, providing adequate funds to foreconomic recovery. Yields on Treasury notes were raised by 0.5 per cent on 29 November. sysSubscriptions to the notes have been encouragading. Non-official holdings presently are more than $ 1,400m-abou t half of which is held by the be non-bank public. Subsequent action by the authorities has brought about an adjustment of similar magnitude in yields on short-dated bonds with consequential adjustment-o n a diminishbasis-of yields on other securities. The long term bond rate has been increased by 0.3 per cent to 10.5 per cent. The yield on savings bonds has been increased to 10 per cent. Bank lending will be monitored so as to prevent any increase in inflationary pressures. Normal financing to requirements of business will be met. I should not need to emphasise that wages policy has assumed an even greater importance in context. To allow the rate of increase in wage settlements to escalate as a result of devaluation would be to negate the beneficial effects which will otherwiseflowfrom devaluation for the competitive position of Australian industry and for Australian-as opposed pol-to off-shore-employment . The Government, therefore, will be doing everything within its to make sure that any identifiable effects in theof devaluation on the consumer price index do flow through into wages and salaries. The wages area is one where-as both the Treasurer and I have emphasised throughout the year-the cannot achieve success on its own. in the In this area, particularly, a ment by all sections of theitcommunity will take a committo take up inflation and to restore employstratment opportunities. It is somewhat ironic to recall that we were un-attacked earlier in the year for arguing as as we did in our first submission to the are Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Even then, there were those who predicted that if the if Government based it policies on economic common sense, the result would be confrontation the trade union movement. Unfortunately, too much credence has been given to the threats of extremist union leaders to create further conflict. In this area, there has been a capitulation to threats instead of recognising economic common sense. Not enough weight has been given to the great common sense of the vast majority of the rank andfiletrade union members who know well the importance of restraint at thistime.I believe most of them and most Australians are up with the disruptive tactics of a few who are not supporters of the democratic system in underwrite this country in many cases. This Government will not allow an unreasonacted able burden in thefightagainst inflation to further on any section of the community includthe ing wage and salary earners. The Government deliberately has taken a number of major repeat: measures designed to encourage wage and salary restraint and to protect potentially disadvancompetitive taged groups from the costs of inflation. These measures include the automatic adjustment of pensions for inflation, the family allowance scheme and full personal income tax indexation. These measures, which are of continuing benefit, should provide an important support to and salary restraint. Further, the Government's submissions before the Conciliation and Arbibeen tration Commission are designed to protect fore lower income earners. There should be a recogcould nition that the important fact to the wage salary earner should not be gross income final real disposable income. These measures provide a totally reasonable basis for wage salary restraint. It is in this context that the Government intends to argue more strongly before the Comafter mission for recognition of the absolute imporfore tance of wage and salary restraint. Beyond that, the Government will be taking every its power to secure restraint. The Treasurer, example, will be discussing with the Premiers impact of wage levels on the State loan programs at the Loan Council meeting next week. Quite clearly, with wage restraint the States can for achieve more effective loan programs, larger loan programs and the greater employment of people. This, again, is part of action to tighten the main lines of the strategy we have followed throughout the year. In addition to action on budgetary, monetary and wages front, action also has been taken on the prices front. The Prices Justification Tribunal has been asked to pay special attention to price increases consequent on devaluation. This will not be limthe ited to compames technically covered required to notify. The purpose is to make that devaluation is not used as an excuse for unjustified price increases. The Government's legislation regarding the Prices Justification bunal will, in fact, increase its surveillance pacity and its ability to investigate areas where there is evidence of price abuse. The Prices tification Tribunal will report progressively the Minister. At the end of 3 months, the Government will review its requests. In the external area, as a result of the devaluaexpenditure tion of the Australian dollar, the Government has examined the Australian tariffs. We have not made across-the-board cuts in tariff but we have selectively to reduce inflationary effects fall arising from the devaluation without negating improved competitive position that devaluation has brought to Australian industry. Let me It was firmly the Government's intention to put Australian industry in a much improved position, and in the Government's judgment that was necessary after the results of recent years. This improvement is greatly needed by Australian industry if jobs are to be created and industries are to be discouraged from going off-shore. Our decisions on tariffs have been the wage right decisions taken at therighttime. An across-the-board tariff cut would have foolish. Selectivity was necessary and thereit was imperative to take advice before there be action. In this case advice could not be and sought until after devaluation was announced. but To have done otherwise would have been imprudent, to say the least. It would have exand tended beyond reasonable bounds the circle of people who knew about the devaluation. Accordingly, the decisions on tariffs had to be taken devaluation. We were fortunate to have beus an Industries Assistance Commission report and recommendations, and we acted on step within those recommendations. for The Government's decision, as my colleague the has announced, has affected over 900 of the 2750 items covered by tariffs, the value of the trade in these items being around $2,000m. The reason the selectivity of the tariff reduction, for our refusal to engage in across-the-board cuts, is clear. Manufacturing industry in recent years has had its competitive position eroded by rising wage costs, a dollar which was until recently over the valued and the shocks imposed by the Labor Government's 25 per cent across-the-board tariff cut. What needs to be understood is that the competitive position of Australian industry had to be restored. Devaluation will achieve that. At same time we have sought to reduce the inflaby the Act tionary impact of the decision. sure Thus, following devaluation the Government had acted with respect to each of the major arms of policy. On monetary policy there have been Triadjustments to interest rates on Treasury notes, caAustralian savings bonds and other government securities. On tariffs there has been a review of Justemporary assistance arrangements followed by to measures announced to offset the inflationary impact in certain areas. On budgetary policy there has been a further review of Government aimed at holding real expenditure levels. We will also maintain pressure on the wages front and we have acted to establish conditions in which wage restraint is possible and reasonable. We intend to persist with our anti-inflationary strategy in full measure. In the circumstances that Australia faces it is disappointing to note that some people, who should by now know better, continue to promote policies which would only add greatly to inflation. The vast majority of Australians realise it is no longer possible to spend our way out of inflation and unemployment. One consistent feature of all the alternatives offered by the Labor Party has been the willingness-som e might well say eagerness-to vastly increase public spending once more or to pump up the size of the Federal Budget deficit. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) some weeks ago urged the Government to adopt measures which would increase the deficit by $ 1,000m. The Premier of Tasmania followed with an extravagant 24 point plan. The Premier of New South Wales outshone both with proposals for almost $2,000m more in Federal spending. Others have urged, and continue to urge, tax cuts and inflationary spending. It would seem that these proposals are made total disregard for their consequences under present circumstances. Each of these proposals, without exception, would be inflationary. The selling overriding need of this country is to conquer inflation. What the Labor Party is proposing would create yet more inflation. Surely it undershore. stands that by now.

Secondly, it can be paid for through higher interest rates which can lead credit squeeze on business and a loss of job opportunities in the private sector.

The clear consequences of further increases in spending are unacceptable at this time. When people propose policies of this kind they must be prepared to follow through the full that consequences of those policies. Unfortunately too often this is not done. The Government rejects these as desirable or viable alternatives. Higher Government spending, larger deficits, would do nothing whatever to correct the imbalances in the economy. Such an approach would further damage the private sector, increase further government's demands on the nation's resources and add to unemployment. Those who propose to solve our problems through yet higher government expenditures are in fact, whether they know it or not, perpetrating a cruel deception on the people of Australia. Contrast those policies with the effects of devaluation. It does not add significantly to the deficit. It will reduce the burdens on those sectors in which have been hardest hit by inflation and which have not been protected by some form of indexed returns, which have not had guaranteed prices for their products. It will create conditions where jobs can be created. It will reduce the reason for Australian companies to move offOverseas and domestic investment projperiod in ects will start moving again. The real possibilities of increased production for domestic industries constitutes a substantial from devaluation. Many manufacturing firms are able to expand their currently underwe utilised capacity. At present their fixed costssuch as plant and equipment depreciation, capicosts, rent and salaries-represen t a high proof total costs. In this situation, increases he in demand and production can produce quite sigin nificant reductions in unit cost. It is worth to recalling the words of the 1975 Jackson Comthe essays of mittee report which stated: manufacturing industry is in acute financial Unemployment is high. Factories are running below capacity . . . . Their profit record and prospects make it hard to raise equity. it The Jackson report also mentioned the damage Bank caused to manufacturing industry by recent in the exchange rate and the levels of protection. Our company tax measures have made a contribution to alleviating this situation, but beyond this devaluation presents an opporto a tunity for much needed relief in the problem areas identified by the Jackson report. The it can alternatives to devaluation would have been massive subsidies or even higher tariffs. Those who criticise the decision to devalue fail preciate the continued thrust for more and more tariff protecdon which carries its own inflaof tionary impact, and which was present before decision to devalue. In the last few weeks there has been remarkable unwillingness on the part of some commentators to assess the decisions objectively in their full ramifications. One well known omic commentator writing on the devaluation the Australia dollar has made the following points. He stated,firstly,that: . . . most spectators would have felt the devaluation would have been timed for some time next year. Government, by getting in early before speculative built up, has avoided a haemorrhaging of Australia's national reserves through capital outflow. The same commentator stated: The extent of the devaluation will be sufficient potential foreign investors in Australia that there to be any funher devaluation. The third statement was: The devaluation will give a breathing space to tralian industries now suffering from severe import competition. Again: The economy is running below full capacity, so the stimulus to domestic demand and employment will fully take up some of the spare capacity. Finally from the same commentator The devaluation will give afillipto business confidence. There could be no better description of the tive aspects of the 1976 devaluation. But these comments were made about the 1974 devaluation, which was undertaken in an inflationary context and was accompanied by a number of highly inflationary measures. The same comwhich mentator condemned the 1976 decision, neglectMorgan ing his earlier arguments and assessments, not mention the completely different policy context within which the 1976 decision has been taken. Many of the statements being made in recent days about the devaluation are with reality. They are sheer humbug. Wild assertions about interest rates, the availability of now-an credit and the exchange rate confusion are not nations based on a considered assessment of what has actually been occurring in the market, in the place where it counts. Information available to the Government suggests that transformation the new interest rate yield curve has been cessful. The greater indications of support for Government Treasury notes are encouraging. cautious observation of the stock market indicates strengthening since devaluation. The Government welcomes renewed interest from priority, overseas in portfolio investment. The changes to apmade in the exchange rate have halted speculation against the dollar and the haemorrhaging our reserves. The massive inflow of capital the that some have predicted has not occurred. Much of the criticism failed to understand the a changed nature of the regime and its consequences. This week's adjustment reflects no more than the success of the initial move. Comeconmodity markets have also shown continuing of strength. The hysteria and humbug coming from certain people in relation to events of the last 2 weeks are not supported by the evidence available. The Government condemns the hysteria The and the humbug. The Government believes that pressures the movements that have occurred are responintersible and are appropriate and that as each day passes more and more people will come to understand that. But what a contrast to the domto convince estic critics are the more measured reactions is unlikely from overseas. In accordance with normal practice, the Executive Board of the Intemauonal Monetary Fund, as the Treasurer indicated this some Ausmorning, has considered Australia's decision to devalue. The Board appreciated the factors behind the decision. All directors who spoke supported Australia's decision to devalue. In adextra dition, the greaterflexibilitythat would be perhopemitted under the new exchange arrangements was welcomed. What greater support could a country have than that, especially coming from the organisation whose business interest in this matter is second only to that of this Government? posiThere was no suggestion that the devaluation could be regarded as a competitive devaluation. Most international reaction to our measures has recognised the soundness of the decisions have already been taken. The New York Guaranty's chief international economto ist described the 17.S per cent devaluation as a very correct amount and noted the wide recognition of Australia's international uncompetitiveness. Milton Friedman has observed, postquite out of touch devaluation: Australia is very well regarded internationally because d this is comparatively rare amongst Western at the moment-it appears to be pursuing a mature and steady course. Our Ambassador to the United States has reported that our emphasis on the anti-inflationary to objectives accompanying devaluation is being sucapplauded and that the devaluation has been seen as removing a significant disincentive to A investment in Australia. In balancing the arms of economic policy, the Government considered inflation as the No. 1 but we have never contended that it was the only priority; nor has it been argued, to my knowledge, that it ought to be the only priority.industry In a number of decisions such as the introductionployment, of family allowances, full personal tax indexasise tion, the investment allowance and the allocation of moneys to Aboriginal and welfare programs, the Government has moved to help sectors of thesalary community hardest hit by inflation, and to endown courage activity. If inflation had been the priority there would have been no family allow-always ances, no indexation and no increases in moneythat for social programs. There would have Budget deficit, and there would have been extensive cut-backs in government programs. If inflation were our sole objective we should haveas had a balanced budget. I do not recall the Government being urged to bring down a balan-will ced budget on this last occasion. The reason obvious. The hardship in other areas would haveexpansion been vast and much too great. In other words, there must be a balance in objective, although there is one major objective. Thefightagainst inflation, although our domithe nant objective, cannot be conducted with an utter disregard for its effects on other areas of social and economic policy. The fact that 3 devaluation has taken place does not mean thattor combating inflation has lost its place as our priority. The fact that the Government has beenwas forced to take a decision which has some infla-clining. tionary consequences can no more be adducedarms evidence that the anti-inflationary strategy been abandoned than can the fact that Government did not plan for a balanced budget. The reverse is the truth. The devaluation decision requires us to redouble our efforts to get on top of inflation, that there be no let-up, that press ahead with our announced strategy more strongly than ever before. Let me review the year's major economic deadvantage cisions. In February $360m worth of savings offers resulting from expenditure reviews were icy announced. In January decisions were taken soak up excess liquidity in In May a package offiscalpolicy introduced-ta x indexation, $2,600m savings to forward estimates and family allowances. Budget, spending was held and the deficit conmy tained, monetary guidelines were laid down and strategy for recovery wasfirmlyimplemented. Let me state again the main elements of that tegy-the most rigorous restraint on government spending to rein in the bloated public sector to free resources to productive private enterprise,in the provision of a wide range of incentives to resume expansion and to provide emseizing every opportunity to emphathe importance of restraint in wage and salary demands, establishing, through a variety of measures, a climate which will make wage and restraint possible. This is essential to keep costs and to create conditions in which emonly ployment opportunities can be expanded. We said that the strategy would take time, it would be a full 3-year program. It is the been no only strategy that will work. more Let me state the Government's attitude to inflation, so there can be no misunderstanding, there has been in some quarters in recent days. Inflation is the enemy that Australia must and defeat. It undermines security, it destroys the is value of savings and incomes, it hinders the of jobs, it erodes our position in the world and in the end it eats away at the vitality of our institutions and our way of life. Twelve months ago Australia, as we know, was in great economic disarray. In office we were faced immediately with the worse unemployment since 1930s, an actual decline in gross domestic product, a depression in company profits, a decline in business investment to its lowest level in years, a desperate situation in the farming secand an inflation rate that was 14 per cent. It firstwas higher than it had been a year before and showing no substantive indications of deIn the past year we have focussed the as of policy on the problem of inflation and has have achieved improvement in Australia's posthe ition to a significant extent. The fact that it was not possible to avoid devaluation shows the magnitude of the probwelems which still face the Australian economy and every one of us as Australians. Some people appear to believe that devaluation was a soft option. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is the hardest option of all. If we do not take of the opportunities that devaluation us, if we do not bring every weapon of polto bear on inflation, the future will be a grave to one for Australia. We may not get another thefinancialsystem. opportunity. decisions was MrBryant-Wewillinl978. In the Mr MALCOLM FRASER-You will be out, friend. I will be sorry not to see you on the Opposition benches because unlike some of your colleagues you are a friendly face. The present stra-situation facing us all demands a concerted national effort. All Australians, all sectors of the andcommunity, have an overriding national interest achieving a soundly based economic recovery. to We have made a beginning and we must not squander our national opportunities and our try national strengths. The Government's measures have been the right ones, but the Government cannot do it alone. In the batde against inflation any governstrategy ment needs the support of its own community. We need to find a nauonal will and determinathat tion to overcome inflation. Too often our institu-Whitlam) tions seek to sharpen differences in the munity, to pursue an adversary relationship with each other for temporary advantage rather than emphasising the common interests that all tralians share. This is a ume when all of our tutions and all Australians-business , trade unions and everyone in a position of leadership in this community-mus t seek to set aside narrow interests in favour of the overriding common public interests that we all share. Devaluation should underline for every Australian the seriousness the problem that confronts us. It also gives us opportunity that we as a nation cannot afford lose. The fight against inflation is a fight that are going to win.",78

143,Mr HURFORD,ECONOMIC STATEMENT,"We have just heard a feeble and overlong effort seeking to stem thetide.But all the huffing and puffing that we have heard will not make an ounce of difference. Like the Arab, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) would be better advised to fold up his tent slink off into the night. The Prime Minister not even enthuse the sycophants behind him. could not get even an ounce of enthusiasm from them. The tide has turned. The credibility of the Government is nil. Government supporters know this; it shines from their faces. They are on the worse. slide to oblivion and we intend to give them further push. If only Government backbenchers would realise what the true situation is instead of to find some enthusiasm or sitting in this place like schoolboys behind their leader. I know that they do not want an election to be held right now. In fact the Opposition would challenge Government to an election but the Government would not agree to hold one. But knowing that will not happen what Government supporters huffing can do for Australians is to make sure that they change the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). If ever we heard an empty excuse for the incompetent economic management of devaluation, this country, we have just heard it in an overlong statement of about 40 minutes which sought to to persuade us that all was well. Of course, it is not well. This Government started off its term of office with its so-called anti-inflationary strategy, a which is now completely in tatters. Before developing that point, I inform the House the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. was not given much advance notice comthat the Prime Minister would be making his statement at this time. The Leader of the Opposition had another appointment. He is not able to Ausbe here. But at least he deputed someone from insti-the front bench of the Opposition to take his place. This is in sharp contrast to what happened earlier this afternoon when 2 Government backbenchers spoke on a discussion of a matter of importance on the subject of the fall in the standards of living under the Fraser Governof ment. The Leader of the Opposition had given an 36 hours notice that this matter would be dealt to with today. However, if ever words summed up wewhat has happened this year, it is the words of that matter of public importance certainly did. Instead of a Minister being deputed to answer grave but truthful charges against this Government we found that 2 Government backbeing benchers were given the task. If there is one statement that sums up this year of the Fraser Government it is that the living standards of Australians have been reduced. This is the first time in my living memory that this has happened to our country. This situation has been perpetrated on our nation by a group of and men who believe that they were born to rule. did These men grabbed power on the excuse that He they knew how better to manage the economy. The Australian people have learned in one year that that was the greatest truth ever perpetrated on them. The Government has gone from bad to a The Prime Minister was stupid enough to give us a litany of the economic decisions which he had made. He started off wrongly by slashing trying government spending and by slashing a Budget which was already a correct mix. This action has ruined consumer confidence in this country to the extent that we have now lost the confidence of the overseas people and investors. That explains why there was the rapid outflow of funds which gaveriseto the damaging devaluation. All the and puffing of the Prime Minister will not make an ounce of difference to the inevitability that the package on monetary, fiscal and wages policies, which must come in the wake of will do further harm to this country. I am afraid that the only Christmas message that anybody objectively looking at the economy can give to the Australian people is that, after a in which their standard of living has been reduced by the incompetent and inept economic policies of the people who rule us, we will have another year of sinular wrong and inept policies. We are now promised that there will be mean further slashing of government spending. course the savings ratio is increasing. Of course that squirrelling will continue if this foreshadowed action is what we have to put with in the months or year ahead. Because of their lack of confidence the Australian people will not spend. As a result the business conhim. fidence that is necessary for investment decisions to be made to get the economy moving will not be created. It is a domestic led recovery which the end will be the answer to the economic ills that we are suffering. Instead we have a GovernParty ment which started off believing that an investthat ment led recovery was required. We had the pensive and expansive investment allowance increase which was an almost complete waste of Governwithout ment funds. Then the Government said that been perhaps it ought to try to persuade people to spend. But it did not put forward the policies urge people to spend. Rather, the Government pursued policies that increased unemployment Of course, this has given rise to a lack of confidence fidence. Now, by some grand but wrong last Sunday night the Government decided to devalue the currency. Apparently the answer to the country's ills is to be an export led recovery. The Government is groping from one area to another. All of its policies are equally wrong have equally been mistakes. I draw to the attention of the House and Australian people the alternative strategy put forward not only by myself and the Leader of the Opposition in the packages that he has prepared but also by the Premier of a major State, South Wales, and also the Premier of Tasmania. I shall focus for a moment on Mr Wran's plan. draw the attention of the House to the fact that plan has been endorsed in great detail by many sectors of private industry m this country. It was put forward following the alternative Budget strategy suggested by me and later by pathetic. the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). The plan is: It is only by increasing government spending modestly-stimulator y spending-and by reducing indirect taxes, particularly sales tax, that we will bring a necessary return of confidence to the Australian consumer in order to get the economy moving. what the Prime Minister has said in the statement was dishonest that it is hard to pick out one year area. But to suggest that any member of the Opposition was suggesting a $1 billion increase in the deficit is just patent dishonesty.",81

But I will not impute motives to I have drawn some conclusions. If those conclusions are unparliamentary and, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you want me to withdraw, I in will. But I think I have got my message over. I say that the proposals of the Australian Labor Opposition have been modest. We realise there cannot be a limitless increase in the exmoney supply. We realise that a very great in the Budget deficit cannot be financed increases in interest rates. What we have putting forward as the alternative economic strategy has been a modest plan. If that plan had to been adopted earlier this year we would not have the lack of confidence which pervades the community. We would not have had that lack of conspreading abroad with all the dire consegesture,quences leading up to devaluation. I end on the note that the Government members could not be enthused by this statement beand cause they know that the tide is turning. They know that their credibility gap is too great All these promises of not meddling with Medibank have been broken; the promise of not mterfering the with wage indexation was immediately broken.

The Navigation Amendment Bill 1976 is similar in many aspects to the Navigation Bill 1975 which had not passed the Senate when the infamous sacking of November 1975 took place. Second Reading Hence the Bill lapsed. MrBradfleld-Oh,no!",83
154,Mr MORRIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member will lapse without a sacking, so he should not worry. The essential difference between the 2 Bills is this Government has deleted those sections the 1975 Bill which dealt with the operation of vessels and collision regulations. The I Opposition does not oppose the Bill but it notes that the Government has delayed this legislation for more than a year. Despite the deletion of secof the 1975 Bill relating to collision regulations, it is encouraging to note that at the meeting conof the Marine and Ports Council of Australia Mr held in Surfers Paradise on 26 November 1976 the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) advanced the proposition that a single unitary law should apply to all shipping on the Australian coast instead of the present fragmented method whereby 7 separate governments are all involved in regulating shipping. While the Minister did not achieve complete success in having his proaccepted by the relevant State Ministers, at recognised that advantages were to be that if the Capmatter is to beuniform further shipping legislation and the discussed at the next meetCouncil of Australia. More positively, the Council agreed that the Australian Government should legislate to implement on the widest possible basis the intercollision regulations which, in effect, are the rules of the road at sea but leaving to State laws the administration of navigation rules for within harbours. Apart from the large be number of miscellaneous amendments which I shall touch on later, the 4 major changes made to the principal Act, the Navigation Act 1912, are: it raises the limit of UabUity of owners of seagoing ships for loss of Ufe or property, for example, from $20 per ton to $189 per ton for bepersonal claims and from $11 to $61 per ton for claims by adopting the provisions of the international convention relating to owners of seagoing ships which was signed at Brussels in October 19S7 and which came into force in 1968. Secondly, consequent upon the provisions of United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act 1970, Part II of the principal Act is amended to tralian redefine visiting British ships so as to exclude British ships visiting Australia in the course of international voyage. Thirdly, new Division 14 is the principal Act thus giving legislative force to The the unique ship reporting system introduced by ment the previous Minister for Transport on a volunUeved tary basis. Fourthly, following the passage of the of the Historic Shipwrecks Bill it is necessary that reference be made to its provisions concerning compensation when rights to a shipwreck are altered. The basic legislation governing the activities of Australian merchant shipping is Navigation Act 1912-1972. This Act was the result of discussions during the years immediaizon tely after federation when At was sought to existing British legislation to Australian contransport, ditions. The base legislation was the British chant Shipping Act 1894 which, in many ways, reflected attitudes at the end of the 19th century. In the period since 1912 numerous considerYet ations have been given to updating the Navifast gation Act to bring it more in line of a young and growing maritime federation. The most recent attempt to review the Act was the appointment by the then Minister, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), in 1973 of the Maritime Industry mission of Inquiry under the stewardship of Mai Summers to report on 'The need for revision and modernisation of existing legislation'. His comprehensive report was tabled in the Parliament some weeks ago. Fromtimetotimediffering views have been expressed as to how government should go about updating Australia's maritime laws. One view that a completely new Act designed to meet Ausinfuriated tralian conditions should be enacted. Another view is that the existing Navigation Act should be updated by a series of gradual amendments. The Bill before us represents a stage in that secexisting ond view. As far as the Summers report is conBill cerned the Government has yet to indicate its intentions. So far the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) has said only that the Government is givthis ing consideration to the report. For all practical purposes it may be simpler for the industry if gradual amendment procedure is followed. The However, it is a poor reflection on our Constiwhen tution and our progress as a Federation that, years after attaining nationhood, our shipping industry is regulated in the main by British legislation drawn up to meet the needs of a 19th centhe tury colonial empire. Mr Summers reported that 'there is a need for urgent action to enact Auslegislation relating to the registration of ships in Austraha'. He noted that legally there an are no 'Australian ships'. At law they are British ships registered in Australia under the UK. Merchant Snipping Act. He goes on at page 5 ofhis added to Part IV of report to say. bar to effective legislation by the Australian Parliahas been the Australian Constitution which it was bedid not give the Commonwealth Government power to enact provisions comparable to those contained in Pan 1 Merchant Shipping Act 1894. The years since Federation have seen a number of great changes in the Australian shipping scene. Sails gave way to steam, coal-fired vessels the to oil-fired vessels, then to oil-powered motor vessels and gas turbines, and maybe on the hornuclear-powered vessels. Coastal passenger adaptvessels were displaced by surface and rail which was followed by the motor car Merand the aeroplane. Sea-borne general cargo has lost out to surface transport while bulk carriers have brought a new dimension to sea transport. through all these changes Australia has held to the principles of the 19th century British with the needs Merchant Shipping Act. John Bach in A Maritime History of Australia, which was published recently, referred to the activities of the Imperial Shipping Committee which was established in 1918 and which funcComtioned between the 2 World Wars. Describing Mr the argument of the Dominions as to the extent to which they were still bound to observe British maritime law within their own waters, he said: Indeed, for Australia this question is still not resolved, since ship registrations still have to be referred to the Central British office at Cardiff, United Kingdom, for final approval, a remnant of the 1894 Shipping Act that infuriates some and enchants others. is There would be many Austrahans who would be to learn of that. In his second reading speech and in the explanatory notes attached to the Bill the Minister details the provisions of clause 34 which substitutes a new Part VII for the Part VII of the principal Act. As in the of 2 October 1975, the clause provides for the exclusion of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 1 of the 1957 International Convention. The effect of exclusion is to remove the opportunity for ship owners to limit their liability in respect of the damage to harbour works or for wreck removal. inclusion of this clause is surprising, because the 1975 Bill was debated the present Min76 ister for Transport, then the Opposition spokesman on transport, objected to the exclusion of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 1 of the ConvenI tion. He claimed that this would impose a furtherthe burden on Australian ship owners. At page 2175represents of Hansard of that date he said: The practical effect of this is that ship owners in will have to pay massive amounts in liability insurance cover these increasedrisks.This will lead to significantly higher sea transport costs within Australia. As the sponsor of this Bill he may care to explain to the House what has caused the dramadc reverI sal of his previous opinion in respect of subabout paragraph (c) of Article 1 of the Convention. In the same debate he embarked on his union-bashing exercise by claiming that the wage levels, crewing requirements conditions which have been imposed on Australian shipowners make it quite uneconomic for finition Australian vessels to compete against vessels account of flying foreignflags.A litde later in that samechant Shipping speech he contradicted himself by saying: It seems that basically we are not a maritime nation. does not exist in Australia the incentive for men to and earn their Uving. One would have thought that if conditions Australian ships are so well paid and so luxurious as the Minister would have us believe, there would be a wild rush of landlubbers to go to But that is not the case. He ignored also the fact that some Australian general cargo vessels operated profitably and with increasing success on the Australia-Japan service. He often seamen for their wage levels and working conAustralia. ditions, but the 1975 annual report of the Australian National Line shows crews' wages and lowances as 20.1 per cent of expenses. The 1976 annual report shows crews' wages and allowreference ances as having reduced to 18.5 per cent penses. Clearly, total crewing costs are an tant factor but the Minister was overstating case. I would like to take the opportunity to that part of the Summers report under the headappointment ing of'coastal shipping'. In paragraphs 6 and the Commission says: The coastal section of the Australian shipping industry faces serious problems at the present time. Shipownerswhether in general cargo, bulk trades or in tankers-sa these problems are labour problems. Shipowners say that there are too many unions and that they act irresponsibly. Then in paragraph 18 the Commission says: The maritime unions do not agree with these statements. If we move to paragraph 19 wefindthe Comthe mission saying: . . . it has been too easy to blame industrial matters lack of development in the shipping mdustry in the past. commend very strongly to the Minister and to Government the next paragraph because it a constructive and positive approach to the problem. It says: Australia Nevertheless industrial attitudes between owners and to unions require a strong effort, which the Commission beUeves only the Commonwealth Government can make, to bring both sides to a better working relationship. FaUing this the Commission would expect that we shall continue to see the demise of major parts of the coastal shipping industry. believe that that is the responsible way to go it because I see the role of the Minister for Transport as being that of a good broker, not of usual an agitator and certainly not of inflaming already delicate and difficult conditions between and living employers and employees. Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill amend the de'visiting British ships' to take into the consequential effects of the UK MerAct 1970. The provisions of that Act extend to masters and crews of British ships There visiting Australia in the course of an intergo to sea national voyage and are different from the provisions of the Australian Navigation Act. The on amended definitions exclude from the category of visiting British ships those ships that have Australian connections, that are chartered or sea. based in Australia and those ships which by regulation are declared not to be visiting British haveships, such as vessels operated by the British Phosphate Commission, which are registered in slams London but whose operations are based on alClause 4 (1) (d) extends the references in the principal Act to the owner of a ship to include a to the operator, except in a few of exspecified circumstances. The many minor imporamendments in the Bill cover such items as the adjustments to incorporate the metric system. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that a nautical mile is now declared to be refer to 1852 metres. The amendments include the of superintendents or deputy super17 intendents where there is no mercantile office, procedures concerning production of competency certificates, procedures concerning character reports of seamen, adrninistration of y that discharged seamen's wages, administration of also deceased seamen's estates, accommodation, and numerous other items which time will not permit me to detail. I want to move now to clause 23 of the Bill because it is a very important provision for which Department of Transport, the previous Minister for Transport-the honourable member for for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones)- and the Australian Government can take a great deal of credit. Clause 23 of the Bill creates a new division 14 at the end of Part IV, which gives legislative force to the Australian ship reporting system, AUSREP. AUSREP was established on a voluntary basis by the previous Minister for Transport following the loss of the 'Blythe Star'. This ship reporting system is unique in the world and stands to the continuing credit of the honourable member for Newcasde. It is an excellent example of Australian irutiative in the field of navigation and marine safety, like the aviation interscan system now under development. The present Minister for Transport ridiculed the honourable member for Newcasde during the 1975 debate on this issue for claiming AUSREP would be a worldfirst,but again he has had a change of heart, I am pleased to note, and it has remained part of this Bill. The wide acceptability of the ship reporting system, even on a voluntary basis, and its importance is evidenced by the fact that the Marine Operations Centre was involved in 1327 search and rescue coastal surveillance and general maritime incidents in 1975-76, which represents an increase over the previous year of 49 such incidents. Searches were carried out in 41 of the incidents. Ofthe 994 ships that participated in AUSREP in 1975-76,720 were foreign-owned vessels. The disturbing factor in the report of the Marine Operations Centre is the high frequency of incidents involving pleasure craft. In fact, 308-o r 23 per cent-of the 1327 incidents reported concerned pleasure craft, the largest single category. Much more needs to be done by State governments to ensure the safe operation of pleasure craft off our coastline. In many cases powered craft are taken to sea at weekends by people with little or no knowledge of seacraft. It is not unusual to see off our coast peoplefishingin very small open boats-boat s down to the size sometimes oft I would guess, 9 feet, but certainly no more than 10 feet and powered by 3 horsepower motors. In some cases, I suggest, they would be 20 years old, but with 3 horsepower or 6 horsepower outboard motors. In many ways this practice is an invitation to disaster, and when difficulty does occur it also involves, in the gate, a great deal of public expense. Governments have a responsibility to protect people from themselves by much closer supervision of pleasure craft that put out from our foreshores. I want to turn now from the Navigation Amendment Bill to the companion Bill in this debate, the Historic Shipwrecks Bill 1976, which originated in the other place. The Opposition welcomes this legislation, particularly as, like the Navigation Amendment Bill, it was initiated by the previous Labor Government. The Attorney General (Mr Ellicott) looks at me, but a decision was made by Cabinet on 2 June 1975 to appoint a committee and that resulted in this legislation being drawn up. I think he now agrees with me; he has nodded. Mr Ellicott-There are other historic wrecks around.",83
155,Mr MORRIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is the Attorney-General suggesting that the legislation is a historic wreck? Mr Ellicott- I am suggesting that the Opposition is a historic wreck.,86
156,Mr MORRIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am suggesting that the Attorney-General is a historic wreck in the making.,86
157,Unknown,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m.,86
158,Mr MORRIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Before the suspension of the sitting I had commenced my remarks relating to the Historic Shipwrecks Bill. As I said, the Opposition welcomes this legislation, because, like the Navigation Amendment Bill, it was initiated by the previous Labor Government. It is a sad reflection on some Australians that legislation should be necessary to protect our historic relics and evidence of early visitors to our shores from the maraudings and the destruction of irresponsible vandals. The provisions of the Bill will enable protection to be given to the many relics and wrecked vessels that lie off the coast of our continent. No federal legislation exists to cover historic shipwrecks, although the Navigation Act has some powers related to shipwrecks. The passage of this Bill has necessitated amendments to the Navigation Act which I mentioned earlier in this debate. The legislation provides controls for the recovery of wrecks and relics declared to be historic and for their disposition. Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the inclusion in Schedule I of the agreement between the Netherlands and Australia concerning old Dutch shipwrecks which was signed at The Hague in November 1972. In that agreement the Netherlands transferred to Australia all its right, title and interest in and to wrecked vessels of the aggreVereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC, lying on or off the coast of the State of Western Australia and in and to any articles thereof to Australia which shall accept such right,titleand interest. Article 4 of the agreement provided for the establishment of a committee of 4 persons, two nominated by Australia and two by the Netherlands, to determine the disposition and subsequent ownership of the articles recovered from vessels between the Netherlands, Australia and the State of Western Australia. Honourable members will no doubt be aware of the West Cook's discovery Australian Maritime Archaeology Act 1973 and the the challenge to its validity now before the High the Court. The Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) has be virtually indicated that should the Court's judgment In impinge on the Bill before us, the Bill will be charges reviewed in the light of that judgment. Briefly, this legislauon gives the Minister the scattered power to declare as historic shipwrecks toric articles the remains of ships or articles from them that are of historic significance. sons in possession of or finding such items required to notify the Minister, who may then rect how they are to be dealt with. The Minister may also authorise the exploration for a recovery of shipwrecks and articles under appropriate conditions. The environs of a declared wreck article may be protected by the ing that area a protected zone and applying controls to any activity in the zone so declared. The report of the Committee of Inquiry on Museums and National Collections, set up by the Whitlam Government on 10 April 1974 and chaired by  the mass of historic material that lies beneath sea off our coastline. It shows that 500 identified shipwrecks have been located, which is the Tryal, an English East India Company merchantman lost in 1622 off the West Australian coast, 66 years before Dampier Government. reached Australia. I would like to take this  chaired that Committee of Inquiry. He perforwill med an excellent service to the nation and to those who follow us in drawing attention to valuable material that we need to take account and to preserve and examine.

In paragraph 14.3 he continues: As the earliest wreck off the West Australian coast earliest known contact of European Man with Australia-6 6 years before Dampier's voyages and 148 years before of the east coast-it is disturbing to learn of wanton destruction that has occurred. In 1622 the Tryal sank in fairly deep water and hence escaped battering from waves. When she was discovered in 1969, she seemed to as she was when sank three centuries previously. 1971, however, a museum expedition found that the wreck had been recently blown to pieces. Apparently had been placed along the hull and in the mouths of the ancient cannons, and theresultingexplosion had not only the relics but had also brought down a cliff, thus or hisbuiying many of the remains. taken Further on the report refers to the wreck of the PerGilt Dragon which was wrecked off the West are Australian coast in 1656.

It also deals with the condition of the  Minister declarrelation to this wreck: These are not isolated incidents of underwater vandalism although they may be the most serious. Reference is also made to the activities of skin diving clubs. A magazine called 'Skin Diving in of Australia' describes how divers found a ship's the money box, but realising that the box contained only old paper money and documents, threw it the oldest of back into the sea.",86
159,Mr SHIPTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It sounds like the Labor,87
160,Mr MORRIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The way you are going, you need it before long. You might go into the sea with it. Another excellent publication called the 'The Treasure Divers Guide' presents up-dated of information on sunken treasures throughout the no world. Australia gets a good mention. Tne publistates that pirating of wrecks is increasing rapidly along the Australian coast. I commend to honourable members a perusal of that report to is a vital source for those and see what information could be gained on our early history. The surprising feature is that of all in force the vessels that must have arrived off the west from coast of Australia, surely some persons must archaehave survived and reached shore. Yet there because of the scores of sigor seems to be no evidence whatsoever of the existin ence of white man or of the cohabitation of white in man on our western coast. That is something which later investigation and research may of shipwrecks has become a popuIt is certainly a very interesting subject a and something that we as a nation should be lootedpreserving and devoting a lot more attention to. I or discan only request those people who participate in skin diving and underwater activities to have the utmost regard to preserving whatever relics they may come across. As I said earlier, the Oppois the sition supports the view expressed by the MinisJames ter in his second reading speech on this Bill. The Opposition hopes that the legislation will adequately serve the purpose of protecting an important part of our national heritage.",87
161,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I am glad to have a few moments to discuss the national treasures that are lying off our coast, not only the west coast but also in Victoria. This is a moment, of course, to congratulate the Pigott Committee for what it has discovered and what it has done to bring the attention of the nation to marine archaeology and to a sense of responsibility for our early history. Off the coast of Warrnambool there lies what is known historically as the Mahogany Ship. About 8 years ago Dame Mabel Brookes drew my attention to this particular ship and suggested that further exploration should be undertaken in that area. I went down to see what remained of the Mahogany Ship. Of course, all honourable members want to know what the Mahogany Ship is supposed to be. Spaniards based on Lima made very many voyages to the South Pacific. One vessel, the Santa Isabella, from Mendana's expedition was lost in 1393. The question is: Did this ship happen to go aground east of Warrnambool? The Captain in charge of Belfast or, as it is now called, Port Fairy, Captain Mills, recorded in his annals having seen the ship on the hummocks east of Gorman's Lane. Therefore, I went down to look at the area and to find out as much as I could about this very early boat. The boat's galley lock was produced from Warrnambool museum. A shaving was taken from the lockMr Charles Jones-Do you mean from the for ship?",88
162,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I mean a metal shaving from the ship lock. I am referring to the galley lock of the ship. be done in Does the honourable member for Newcastle from the Yangary understand my meaning? Mr Charles Jones-Yes , of course I do.",88
163,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Newcastle is a tremendous sailor. A shaving from the galley lock was sent to Birmingham University to ascertain the actual date of the metal. I was surprised to learn that the metal of the supposed galley lock of the Mahogany Ship could not have been earlier than about 1770. One then researched the wood. The story is that the early whalers down there pillaged the ship. I do not really believe that happened, but that is the story. One wouldfindin the various houses of the early whalers evidence of this ship. I visited houses and with the permission of the house owners I took a shaving of the wood. Also I moved across to Captain Mills' house. It is sad to think of it. The house of the early harbour master of Port Fairy or Belfast, whatever we wish to call it, is just a ruin. I went into it to try to understand why the National Trust had not preserved it. The Trust just had not bothered. The wood was interesting and seemed to compare with that of the old houses belonging to the whalers. Shavings of this wood were sent off to Princes Risborough in Britain, where wood and trees are analysed to determine their age. The wood was analysed and it was found that the wood was not earlier than about 1720. The wood which I found in the house of the whalers was of much later date, about 1870. It was a Tasmanian hardwood. This proved, as far as I was concerned, that the early whalers, the Mahoneys and the Hentys, and the other families there, had not pillaged the ship. Let me now discuss the question raised by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). Had anybody from a white nation come ashore and entered Australia? I draw the honourable member's attention to the book Riders of Time by Dame Mabel Brookes. She notes that a black gin, Jim Caine's second wife Nellie, had completely divergent features and colouring-no t that of the usual half caste. She was from the Yangary tribe. Nobody yet has been able to prove one way or the other whether this ship came ashore and whether the Yangarys had Spanish blood in them. It would be very useful if some research was done into the matter by universities. Of course, those who went out as settlers travelled with all the implements necessary farming and to set up a colony. It is presumed therefore that people coming ashore from any in would be allowed by the Aborigines to work peace. There is quite a lot of research work to this area particularly with relatives tribe. This Mahogany Ship caused a great deal of excitement. It was viewed in 1836. It was viewed again in 1849. The Royal Geographical Society in 1891 set aside an enormous sum of money-£50-as a reward for anybody who discovered anything more about this vessel. What am I getting at? I know that people from 2 universities nave been down to the area with buckets and spades. I have seen signs of other school expeditions in the area. I have discussed the matter with Sir Alfred Oppenheimer from South Africa. We think that the only way to find 2 the ship is to use a sand pump to take away the sand and thereby uncover the ship. I suggest to the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) that he takes the greatest possible care to declare the area east of Gorman's Lane one of the areas where they may or may not be one of these famous ships which will be important to our history. What further research did I undertake? It seemed to me that local stories were quite extraling ordinary. It has been established by the Colonial ship. Office, for example, that an official naval officer was sent down to write a report concerning the Mahogany Ship. That report was never congratulations published in the Colonial Office. A Spanish sword, found in Belfast Harbour, was to be to the Mitchell Library in Sydney. That sword never reached Sydney. Spanish corns were as a gift in the local church. It all goes to show that there is something of interest to us in area. I do not think that Dame Mabel Brookes got exactly right. I feel the ship was built in 1812 was involved in the Napoleonic Wars. By her sonaUy'. construction I would think she was probably the built in Panama. The big mahogany panelling on the side of the ship puzzled Mrs Manifold and baffled the early harbour master. I think therebate fore the ship could have been constructed Panama. That conclusion would seem tofitin well with the time factor. She probably ran aground during the Napoleonic Wars. She was probably carrying Spanish coin and coming back towards Europe at the ume when Spain became involved in the Napoleonic Wars. This is not the only wreck of importance off coast of Victoria. Off the entrance of Port Bay Bay there is a large number. I do not understand why Victoria does not have an Act of Parliament similar to the one in Western Australia. I suggest that the Minister consult the Victorian Governto ment to endeavour to have the left and right heads of that harbour declared another zone where only people who are authorised can go and look for what they think to be treasure. need Unfortunately those people's idea of treasure is not the same as that of a marine archaeologist. All they want to do is see whether in it, or gold coins or something there which can exchange. We need most of all more accuafirst-classBUl rate information where these ships lie and in paralmost ticular their age. I think the research should handled by universities or by those who are competent to do the work. I am not against any amaLaborment teur organisation joining up with a university legislation-whic team and doing the exploration work. I do not want to detain the House any longer. think the Bill is an extremely valuable one. I must congratulate the Opposition for appointing the Pigott Committee and for its part in bringing Bill before the House tonight. I hope that what have said shows that most Australians, including myself, are deeply interested in our history and would hate to think that something of value was lost through the negligence or incapacity of a person to understand what he was actuaUy handwhen using his diving kit and going into a I suppose it would be poUte if I extended my to the Clerk of the House who will retire before this House meets again. He is sent the third Clerk with whom I have worked. The others were Sir Edward Fellows, Sir Barnet foundCocks and now Mr Norman Parkes. The only advice that a Clerk of the House ever gave me as that a member is one which I always remember. It was: 'When you are thinking of the Opposition it those who oppose you, you are only opposing or and their opinions; you are not opposing them perIn that spirit, on behalf of myself and my electors, I extend good wishes to the Clerk of House and to members of this honourable House. I have enjoyed participating in the deon this Bill. I look forward to taking part in in other discussions at a later time.",88
164,Mr CHARLES JONES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The BUls before the House are the Navigation Amendment Bill 1976 and the Historic Shipwrecks Bill 1976.1 congratulate the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates). I did not think I would ever be in a position of agreeing with the him. However, I am pleased to say that when we are considering matters of historical interest and environmental matters oft-times party barriers disappear substantially. I congratulate the honourable member for Holt on his contribution the debate this evening. I join with him in his comments about the Victorian Government. I do not want to be political. AU governments in Australia should have a greater awareness of the to protect the history of this country and not allow relics to fall to pieces or be destroyed. I agree with the remarks of the honourable there is a quid member for Holt. they I congratulate the Government for introducing into the Parliament. The Bill is identical with the Bill that was introduced beinto this Parliament in October 1973 by the Governmentr. Once again, the Governhas adopted Labor legislation-first-clas s h is in the interests of people involved in the maritime industry. I am disapI pointed, of course, that many important parts of the 1975 legislation are not included in this Bill. I will deal with those matters later. I turn now to this the important sections of the 1975 legislation Iwhich have been included in the Bill. A considerable number of amendments are proposed to the Navigation Act. I always find navigation legisfrom lation interesting and mtriguing to deal with. Unfortunately, amendments to the Navigation Act are not brought before the Parliament enough. It is outdated legisladon sadly in need updating. It was the objective of the Labor Party in 1975 to update the legislation when it introduced amendments and new initiatives, his some of which are now contained in this Bill. The main provision contained in this Bill cerns the hmit of liability of owners of seagoing ships for loss of life or propeity. We adopted provisions of the Intemauonal Convention relatin ing to the Limitation of Liability on Owners Sea-going Ships signed at Brussels on 10 October 1957 and they became law in 1968. Part II of Act deals with the crews of ships and their ditions of service. This will no longer apply visiting ships, the conditions of whose operauons in Australia were governed by the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act. Visiting ships no longer will be governed by the Australian legislauon because of improvements which the British Government has provided. Our law will apply only to ships under charter in Australia. New Division 14, which is to be added to Part TV of the principal Act, makes it ship's master to submit plans of a ship's in Australian waters and to report its movements. is called. I will deal with that in detail. which I am very proud. Part VII of the Navilegislation todorefer gation Act deals with historical wrecks as a whole. The definition of 'historic thefiguresto which Isigned wreck' is to be included in the Navigation . This is necessary because of provisions in the not wait another 12 months-it will certainlywill Historic Shipwrecks Bill. Proposed new Part deals with special purpose ships and special personnel. That is a broad outline gation Amendment Bill is about. So far as the limitation of liability is cerned, Part VIII of the Navigation Act limited the liability of ship owners for loss or damage accordance with the provisions of the Imperial Act known as the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894. This Part subsititutes a new Part VIII which gives the International Convention relatable ing to the Limitation of Liability on Owners Sea-going Ships the force of law in Australia except that the liability relating to salvage ations or damage to marine facilities and waterUabUity, ways cannot be limited. The effect is to increase substantially the liability of ship owners. figures referred to by the Minister (Mr Nixon) in his second reading speech have been updated since 1975. They have increased, for liability for personal claims, from to $189 a ton and, in the case of property claims, about $11 a ton to $61 a ton. With the recent revaluation, these figures are not out of date. They will continue to fluctuate. often The International Convention, to which I of referred, is included in the Bill as Schedule 1 and approval is given for its ratification. Proposed new section 59B states that an owner cannot limit liability in respect of loss or life or personal injuries sustained by crew and other people who conhave duties on the ship. One aspect of this provision which concerns me is that the Convention the was signed in Brussels in 1957 and it became law 1968 yet this Government, when in office beof tween 1968 and December 1972, did absolutely nothing about implementing or bringing into opthe eration the terms and conditions of the 1957 conBrussels Convention. When I introduced similar to legislation 12 months ago all that the present Minister for Transport did was to severely castigate the Labor Government for what it had done. He was most critical of our actions in bringing forward amendments. However, I am pleased to say that in the 12 months in which he has been the Minister he has seen the light of day and has had enough sense to pick up what we initiated and what we suggested at that time. mandatory for a Mr Morris-Charli e Nixon? voyage Mr CHARLES JONES-Charlie Nixon as he If we do not tell the Minister what to do, It is a provision of he does not anything. If he does not have our to he does not do anything. wrecks and The new Convention referred recently increases earlier by about Act. 400 per cent. I hope that the Government not VA have 23 years or as long as it took to adopt the of what the Navirecommendations before it adopts of the 1957 Conventionthe new Convention. The Government should get on with the job and get conaway from the present archaic system of limited owner liability. It applies to aeroplanes; it in applies to the maritime mdustry. It is something that belongs to the bad old days. It istimethat governments gotridof it. My one disappointment is that when I was the Minister I was not to getridof it because its retention could of have harmed our own shipping industry. The sooner the Intergovernmental Maritime Conopersultative Organisation gets rid of this limited the better. At least governments can then get on with the job of implementing deThe cisions made by IMCO and at international for Transportconventions.",89
165,Mr BAILLIEU,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"You r Government did not. $20 per ton Mr CHARLES JONES-We did. The honourable member for La Trobe will be voting on our legislation tonight. I hope that his does not delay this legislation in the Senate. legisladon is similar to the legislation introduced in October 1975 by the Labor Government-it is almost word for word. I hope the honourable member has enough sense to vote for it. His Min-ships ister has had enough sense to introduce this ladon and to get on with a job which is sadly overdue. I hope this Bill will not be delayed further. I will give an example of how litde people can be hurt by delaying legislauon of type. I think we are indebted to Jimmy Ramsden of the Australian Financial Review for an article which he wrote and which appeared yesterday, December. Honourable members can read it. gave me a bit of a dig and he gave the Minister for Transport an even bigger dig. In that article he drew attendon to a crewman of a fishing boat who severely injured his hand and lost a number of fingers. That man received as compensation paltry sum because he did not belong to a union that had the muscle to be able to get mm what was entided to. This is a clear case which how little people can be deprived because parlia4-engined ments are too dilatory and are not prepared to act. It is obvious from the attack on me months ago by the present Minister that if we snipping. had not embarrassed him into the position of having to reject that section of the Act, the possiknow bility is that he would not have gone on with it. So we have these cases where Uttle people can beinterested hurt. In the case of the new amendment, proposed new section 59B which will be written into Act, trade unions are able to get over the lem of Umitation by reason of their industrial strength. We have had numerous cases where occur seaman have received just compensation. In the case of the Birchgrove Park they would have received virtuaUy peanuts under the provisionsweather of the old Merchant Shipping Act if the Umiout tation of UabUity had appUed. In the case Blythe Star fatality in Tasmania a few years those women received their just entitlements under the then compensation Act, but under Uman ited UabUity provisions they would have been deprived of many of the benefits. Where the unions have strength they can get away with it; but where they have not, such as in the case I quoted or in the case of thefisherman,there nobody tofightfor them. Thatfishermanlost out andfinishedup with a very paltry amount of compensation. So much for the matter of Umited my UabUity. The next matter I want to deal with is the reporting of shipping movements. The Labor with Party is entitled to be proud because of this Party amendment being written into the Act. I am This pleased that the Minister left this amendment in the Bill. Australia wiU be thefirstcountry which will have compulsory filing of sailing plans and position reporting every 24 hours for Australian or other ships on the Australian coast. The legismaritime industry throughout the world is very keenly interested in what is going on. Some of any the moneybags are concerned about it because it might cost them some money, but if this section this had been in the Maritime Act and had been in operation when the Blythe Star fataUty occurred, in my opinion those men who lost their Uves 8 would still be with us today. The Transport ComHe mission did not know whether that ship was going up the west coast of Tasmania or whether it was going up the east coast of Tasmania. It did not have a clue about whether the ship sunk on the Friday night, the Saturday or the Sunday. It a did not have a clue because the captain was not required to report his position or to lodge a saU he plan. Every pilot who takes off in an aeroplane, shows whether it is a single-engine aeroplane, a jumbo or a Concorde has to lodge a flight plan so that controllers know where the air12 craft is. The same principle will apply to From discussions I had with people overseas I that the American Coast Guard is very in this idea. It has a voluntary system working but it is most interested in seemg what happens with this idea. My hope is that very shortly this legislation will be extended further to the coverfishingvessels and pleasure craft. The probhonourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) drew attention to the number of fataUties that with pleasure craft along the coast of this country. We have a beautiful coastUne but it is also one of the most dangerous coastlines. The can change so very quickly and people at sea can be in trouble unless somebody on of the shore knows where they are or where they ago, should be. I cannot understand why any owner of a boat going to sea, whether it be a 14-footer, 18-footer or bigger boats up to 30 feet or 40 feet, is not prepared to lodge a sail plan and to report his position regularly. I will never know why that is so. It is in his own interest and for the welfare of the people with him that he do so. The is same can be said forfishingvessels. I was going to deal with historic wrecks but I am watching the clock on the wall. I know that friend the honourable member for Fremande (Mr Beazley) will be speaking on this subject so I will pass it by. The next matter I want to deal is visiting British ships. The British Government has updated the Merchant Shipping Act and we have kept pace with it. Therefore we have excluded British ships from the Australian Navigation Act, except when they are on charter here. The other points I want to mention relate to items omitted from the Bill. They concern me greatly. ThefirstI want to deal with is the deletion of amendments relating to vessels and other structures engaged in offshore industry and activities associated with it, such as exploring or exploiting the natural resources of the continental shelf of Australia or the seabed off the Australian coast I am referring to thosefixedstructures and mobile units used in industry of this kind. There are going to be more and more of these units at sea. I tried to obtain agreement with the States about the operations of oil drilling rigs which have been engaged off the Australian coast for about 15 years. The former Department of Shipping and Transport tried for 15 years to get agreement with the State governments on laws to apply to offshore shipping. When I was Minister my Department tried to get agreement with them and I made a similar attempt at a meeting of the Marine and Ports Council. It was just not on. FoUowing the Press statement dated 26 November and recently released by the Minister, in relation to navigation laws, I hope that he can get some agreement with the States. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a page out of the 1975 Navigation Bill which sets out proposed amendments relating to offshore shipping arrangements.",90
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The document read as follows(b) a barge or like vessel fitted with living quarters for more than 12 persons and used or intended for use in connection with the construction, maintenance or repair of off-shore industry fixed structures, shall be deemed to be an off-shore industry mobile unit '(4) This section applies that are used or intended for use in, or in any operations or activities associated with or incidental to, exploring, or exploiting the natural resources of, either or both(a) the continental shelf of Australia; or (b) the seabed, or subsoil of the seabed, of the Australian coastal sea.

167,Mr CHARLES JONES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I thank the Minister and honourable members. That page sets out the things that we proposed would be brought within the jurisidiction of the Australian Navigation Act. Unfortunately they are not included in this Bill Ito they will not be included in the legislation until some futuretimewhen the Minister is satisfied that he cannot achieve those matters by agreement with the State governments. State governments are terribly difficult on these things. AU I say to members of the Government is this: Just be wary that as a result of your actions or those of your Ministers there is not another Sedco Helen on your consciences. That was one of the most blatant cases relating to foreign ships which were operating in Australian waters off our coast but which were not within to off-shore industry mobile units the jurisdiction of the Navigation Act. Just be careful that it is not on your conscience that you have kept this out of the legislation. The amending Bill was in order and its vaUdity was covered by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. The amending legislation was drawn up in the beUef that the Australian Government was going to win a case then pending before the High Court. It did win. That is all I can say on that matter in the matter with respect to which protime aUotted to me. I hope that the Minister will not be side-tracked by the State governments, that he wiU get on with the job and put into legislation the matters to which I have referred. I say that because, believe you me, that industry is in a mess. There is a problem as to whether State laws apply or Federal laws apply. The industry as a whole has got over some of its problems late but it still has a long way to go. The next matter I want to refer to is the letion of section 187A, a provision which was the 1975 Bill and which related to the endorsenes. ment of the 1972 convention on internationl regulations for prevention of collisions at sea. That convention will become operative in July next year. There will not be a Marine and Ports Council meeting until April of next year and we are going to find ourselves again dragging the chain in regard to a most important international convention. The Department of Transport tried to negotiate an agreement with the States from 1973 on. It still has not got an agreement. I that it ever will. Another important feature that has been deSure leted is the operations manual. This was one the important points that came out of the Blythe Star inquiry. The officers did not know operate their ship or how to calculate the stability of their ship. We brought in this provision operations manual. I cannot understand why Minister has deleted it from the Bill. It simple procedure. Ships today are all different. Construction, layout, technology and charactercrats. istics of shipping today are different ship by ship. There is a need for this sort of thing. For the ister to delete it is, in my opinion, criminal.",92
168,Mr BEAZLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I have the only one point in relation to the Navigation Amendment Bill, and that concerns the national maritime college in Tasmania. The Attorneyof General (Mr Ellicott) will miracle the Bill setting up that college was one of were cast to the and the educational measures which the Senate did not delay or defeat, as it did with the technical education proposals, the legislation dealing with the Karmel funding and the Schools mission legislation. The Bill relating to the national maritime college went through very quickly. I understand the site has been selected. Yet the construction of the college is being delayed. I think this is a mistake. It is important not-(a to have afirstclass navigational and maritime relic; college in Australia. I turn now to the Historic Shipwrecks Bill. study or knowledge of some of these early ships can have very important implications per revalublown ing Australian history. I mention in passing D ""Entrecasteaux and the French navigators who left France in 1788, the last year of the aneien regime to try tofindtraces of the Compte de la Perouse who had disappeared with his ship L'Astrolabe. When I was on the Australian Instiof tute of Aboriginal Studies we received information from Paris that the journals of that French expedition, which had been cast to the four dewinds for reasons which I will explain in a moin ment, had very important references to AborigiAs D'Entrecasteaux sailed up the east coast of Tasmania he met Aborigines. He went ashore at one place. The Aborigines stood around a pile of dried faggots. They offered him a burning brand. Assuming he was invited to light the fire, he lit it. He got. a hail of spears. He stopped any ofhis men fromfiring.They got back to the ship. When they were travelling up the coast he considered what happened. He assumed, I think, being a very sensitive man, that he had indicated doubt an intention to stay and to take possession, by lighting thefire.He decided that nexttime,if there were a nexttime,he would not do that. enough, within 2 days there was a next time. of He was handed a burning brand. He handed it back. The result was that they were received as how to friends, given crayfish and so on. for an D'Entrecasteaux did not survive the voyage. the He died and was buried at sea. The expedition was a came back under the command of D'Auribeau. All of these French naval officers were aristoThey knew nothing about the French revolution. They got back in 1793, the year of the Min-terror. They were promptly arrested. I think some of them were executed. Their work was treated with contempt. It was in the phase when French were prepared to guillotine the great chemist Lavoisier on the ground that the republic had no need of chemists. It had no need anthropologists or navigators either. recall that by some D'Auribeau's D'Entrecasteaux's books four winds. They have only lately been brought back into the French maritime museum. A French-Canadian lady who had been studying Australian Aborigines went to Paris to Comlook at this material. The wrecks are important. I think the decisive part of this Bill is clause 13, which states: Except in accordance with a permit, a person shall ) damage or destroy a historic shipwreck or a historic (b) interfere with a historic shipwreck or a historic relic; (c) dispose of a historic shipwreck or a historic relic . . . The All of this, I think, comes from Western Australian experience. Some prize specimens have up wrecks that other people have discovered, got together the silver coinage, were prepared to melt it down and fake, with the old silver, silver coins, to try to sell them at a high price as having been in a rather better state of preservation, naturally, than the ones that had been lying at the bottom of the sea. They did this to get a good deal of money. What they doing to what one might almost say were imporThe tantfilesof Australian history was quite tragic. 1963 Dr Philip Playford of Perth advised the coverers of the shipwreck of the Dutch East Indiaman Vergulde Draeck, or Gilt Dragon, that their proper course was to assign all their rights in this wreck to the Western Australian Museum. This, he said, would be proper because evidence of Australia's history of that era, the seventeenth century, was so important that it should preserved on behalf of the nation. The disseverely coverers were a journalist James Henderson his sons Graeme and Alan and their friend John Cowan. I am very glad to say that they accepted the advice of Dr Playford. A deed of assignment was drawn up by the Crown Law Department Western Australia and duly executed. Artefacts brought up from the wreck by this group were handed over to the Museum. Unfortunately the Western Australian laws were shown as hopelessly inadequate to protect this shipwreck-it was a shipwreck from nificant. 1656-fro m plunder by people whose object quick profit from the sale of silver coins other items which they retreived by blasting site with gelignite. To complicate matters, the wreck site was about on the limit of the 3 miles from shore, giving some doubt about the appliAustralian cation of Western Australian legal jurisdiction. Some people in Western Australia sympathised with the shipwreck plunderers. I think the people of Western Australia regarded them as another sort of miner. The people sympathised with them on the basis that they were entided to rewards therisksthey took and for thetimespent in the sea. It almost sounds like Lang Hancock, i say so, but I do not think it was. Over a decade so, political parties, both Labor and anti-Labor, developed thefirmview that the historic wrecks - al l those of pre-1900 vintage-shoul d be preserved from commercial or other exploiDepartment tation. So the wreck legislation emerged and strengthened. The doubts about State legislation persisted, and it was difficult to enforce the law in relation to remote coastal areas. But the Western Austion tralian Museum, through its energetic Maritime Archaeology Department, embarked on a conless tinuing campaign to educate public opinion to support the concept of preservation of historic evidence. It was fortunate that some of the disAustraUan coverers were very good journalists. It carried out careful, scientific surveys and then conducted.some archaeological excavations of the wrecks ofexcavation the Gilt Dragon and the Batavia, which was wrecked in the Abrolhos Islands area in 1629. So were the Batavia is a very old wreck. discovery of a wide variety of artefacts In was published to win public interest and symdispathy for the serious, constructive work. That is in sharp contrast with the destructive effects of the plunderers who had made great profits from the sale of seventeenth century silver coins throughout Australia and overseas. Some of the coins were conterfeited in rare and more valuable forms by melting down silver blasted from be the wrecks. The Gilt Dragon wreck site was blasted for the plunder and pillage of its and many thousands of Spanish silver coins which themselves provide an important study of sixteenth and seventeenth century history. of The first English ship wrecked in Australian waters, the Tryal, in 1622, was so badly blasted that there is some doubt whether the remains will warrant a future excavation by the Western Australian Museum. That is really a tragedy for it represented the beginnings of English navigation which was ultimately to be very sigProbably the historic shipwreck in most was danger now from the plunderers is the Dutch and Zuytdorp off the Murchison coast of Western the Australia. This shipwreck has already been visited by divers after its rich hoard of silver coins. Records of the proceedings of the Western Court of Petty Sessions, the Supreme Court and the Criminal Court and more recently the High Court of Australia leave no doubt about who is the plunderer whose activities have made the Western Australian and Commonwealth laws to protect the historic shipwrecks necessary. for The legislation currently before the National Parliament is the culmination of many years of f i may advocacy by Dr Philip Playford and James orHenderson, his son Graeme Henderson, who is now the Assistant Curator of Maritime Archaeology at the Western Australian Museum, and the dedicated work of the Maritime Archaeology at the Western Australian Museum. was The Department established at Fremantle what is now regarded as one of the finest maritime museums in the world for its special areas of interest. An excellent exchange of interest and informahas been developed between Australia and The Netherlands whose archives contain a pricecollection of rare exhibits and documents reflecting on the Ufe andtimesof the beginnings of European discoveiy of Australia. Western skin divers are encouraged to take an interest and to participate under supervision in of the Museum's maritime exploration and with excellent results-in terms of responsible community attitudes. Several valuable historical books have been written in recent both in Holland and in Western Australia as one of the products of interest in Western Australian history. James Henderson conducted research in The Netherlands in 1975 and is now working with a Commonwealth literary grant to complete a book dealing with a 17th century voyage beonly tween Western Australia and Java. By the new Commonwealth legisladon which those is now before us, Australia estabhshed an international role of significance in the recognition and preservation of history. In fact this legislation places this nation among the world's leaders in thisfield.It is to the people who have influenced this legislauon the State and Federal Parliaments, and it will to the enduring credit of members of both sides of the House, that this legislauon has been developed and accepted without delay.",93

176,Mr ELLICOTT,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I have 4 amendments which refer to clauses 9,17 and 23 which read in part: Clause 9.

Penalty: $1,000.",96
177,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is leave granted to move the 4 amendments together? Third Reading There being no objection, leave is granted.",96
178,Mr ELLICOTT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I move: (1) In clause 9, sub-clause (1), omit 'and' (first occurring), substitute'or'. (2) In clause 9, after sub-clause (4), insert the following Second Reading sub-clause: It is a defence to a prosecution of a person for an offence against a provision of this section in relation to an article if the person proves(a) in the case of an offence against sub-section (1) or (2) inrelationto an article in respect of which a notice was published in the Gazette under section 5 or 6-that the person did not know, and had no reasonIn Committee able grounds for believing, that the article was an article to which the notice related; or (b) in the case of an offence against sub-section (3) or (4)-that the person did not know, and had no reasonable grounds for believing, that the arucle was a Dutchrelicor a pan of a Dutch shipwreck.'.

The next amendment proposes to add new sub-clause (4A) to clause 9. The reason for this amendment is that it has been suggested that as the clause stands at present a person who quite innocently and legally has in his possession an article which comes within the protecdon of the legisladon may be prosecuted for failing to notify the Minister that he has that article, despite the fact that he did not know that the article was protected. The proposed amendment will overcome this objection. Mr Charles Jones-What is that?",96
179,Mr ELLICOTT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am sure that the honourable member for Newcasde who interjects will think quite quickly that that was a very fair amendment to make. The next amendment is to clause 17. It is proposed to add to sub-clause (2) the words: 'or proves that he had reasonable grounds for believing'. This sub-clause sets up a defence for a person who fails to give the required notice with regard to the discovery of a wreck. It makes it a defence against a prosecution if the person charged can prove that someone else had given the necessary notice. It has been suggested that it should also be a defence if a person has reasonable grounds for believing that the necessaiy notice has already been given. The proposed amendment will provide this additional defence. The last amendment inserts in clause 23 new sub-clause (SA). It is proposed to spell out expressly that self-incrimination constitutes a reasonable excuse for the purposes of sub-clause (S) thus confirming that this is a defence to a prosecution for failing to comply with a requirement to answer a question under subclause (1). This reflects, as do the other amendments-particularl y the second and the thirdthe Government's continuing concern to ensure that our civil liberties are protected. Clause 23 provides in sub-clause (S): A person shall not(a) without reasonable excuse, fail to comply with a requirement made of him by an inspector in the cise of a power under this section . . . The power includes the power to require a person to answer a question. An interesting question of law could arise-and this has been answered in Victoria-as to whether it would be a reasonable excuse not to answer if one felt that the answer might incriminate one. In Victoria a supreme court single judge has held that it would be an excuse. But it was felt that we ought to put this matter beyond doubt and so we have added subclause (SA) to make it clear that this will be a defence.",97
180,Mr MORRIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Opposition concurs with the amendments. I draw the attention of the Committee to clause 9 which, as a result of the amendment which substitutes the word 'or' for 'and' now reads: (l)Where(a) a person has possession, custody or control of an article; and (b) a notice applying in respect of the article is published in the Gazette under section 5 or 6, the person shall, within 30 days after the date of publication of the nouce in the Gazette, give the prescribed notice to the Minister in relation to the article. The other 3 amendments are welcomed by the Opposition. In another place Opposition senators, Senator Cavanagh and Senator Douglas MCClelland, brought these matters to the notice of the Minister for Adminstrative Services (Senator Withers). It is good to see that the undertaking which the Minister gave there, that he would give consideration to the comments of the honourable senators, has been carried out and that these amendments have arisen from that undertaking. Senator Cavanagh in another place in relation to new sub-clause (4A) of clause 9, quite rightly drew attention to the fact that a person could have an article or object which had been handed down through the family or which had been given to him by another person. The owner of the article could be completely unaware that it was an article declared as being of historic value. That person could be completely innocent of any intention to contravene the Act. Even though it was pointed out in reply that advertisements would be published about such articles and so on, that is a valid point. I am pleased to see that the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) has taken this up and that new subclause (4A) of clause 9 takes account of that matter. Likewise, in relation to the amendment to clause 17, sub-clause (2), a reasonable proposition was put in the other place. People could have reasonable grounds for thinking that notice exerhad been given to the Minister and that they had complied with the provisions of the Act. The amendment to clause 23, the insertion of new sub-clause (SA), arose from a reference to clause 23 which deals with the powers of an inspector. This matter was dealt with at some length. It is worth noting the powers that an inspector has under these conditions. If we look at sub-clause (2) of clause 23 we see that it states: Where an inspector has reason to beheve that a person has failed to comply with a notice given to the person under subsection 11 (1), the inspector may make application to a Justice of the Peace for a warrant authorising the inspector, with or without persons and equipment to assist him, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the person has failed to comply with the notice(a) to enter any specified land or premises; and (b) to search any land or premises so entered and to break open any cupboard, drawer, desk, box, package or other receptacle, the land or in the premises. It was in the context of discussion on that clause about the powers of the inspector that the Attorney-General has quite reasonably brought forward the amendment at which we are looking. It brings into legislative form the possibility of self-mcrimination as a reasonable excuse for failing to answer questions asked by an inspecliance tor. Under the circumstances the Opposition comes the amendments and supports them. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report-b leave-adopted .

181,Mr INNES,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"The report of the House of Representatives Select Comtage mittee on Specific Learning Difficulties is the most important documents in the field of education to come before this Parliament. It concerned with a single aspect of education-th group which does not achieve 'minimum acnine ceptable standards' in numeracy and literacy. is a humane and compassionate document, conable taining practical and worthwhile recommendamore tions, many of which could be quickly books implemented with little expense, to deal with vital question of under-achievement in the basic educational skills. But while it is not acted there is little evidence to suggest other than ing notice by the Government-it remains another 'interesting' document and the problem of under-achievement remains unassailed. The fact that there is no Minister at the table to hear my views on the issues arising out of the docution ment is not to the credit of the Government. The reason I rise in this debate is to ask the Government why there has not even been the bewise ginning of action on the Committee's recommenpicked dations. One sees from the report that the Aborthey iginal community organisations course at the Swinburne College of Technology is about to discontinued. The funding for that course cease in 1977. There have been about 30 applicants for the course for 1977, including 4 Aborwhether a fixture or not, on igines from as far away as Roper River in the Northern Territory. The Government has shown scant respect for the very important work that should be got under way in the near future. Together with the report of the Australian Council for Educational Research, the report of the Select Committee forms the basis of an alfor literacy. The Opposition welcomes the welreport of Dr Ronald T. Fitzgerald entitled Poverty and Education in Australia which was tabled today. So we have ample evidence of the problem and a range of recommendations which would give some serious government ample opportunity to do something about the problem. y Until the emergence of these reports, research material on these subjects was sparse. Having Third Reading got them, let us do something about them. The urges the Government to take urgent action to implement at least some of the recommendations of the Committee and to commit itself to the longer term objectives of the report. Let us look at the problem in its most fundaReport mental human terms. Failing to teach a child to read is among the more serious injuries which one human being can inflict upon another. The child has closed to him the excitement and information of the world of books. He also has closed to him most of his chances of taking full advanof the opportunities which education could one of otherwise have afforded him. The following figures come from the nationwide survey of literis acy and numeracy in Australian schools carried e out by the ACER, and they are stark: Twentyper cent of Australia's 10-year old children It and 27 per cent of 14-year old children are unto understand written material which is no difficult than the text books and reference they use in their classrooms. Up to 20 per the cent of 14-year olds are unable to comprehend either the literal or inferential meaning of passupon- ages taken from daily newspapers. Between IS passper cent and 25 per cent of children are passing from primary school into secondary school and ultimately leaving school altogether without ever acquiring an adequate mastery of the basic educational skills which they need in order to funcsuccessfully as citizens and as members of the work force. Children who are not brain damaged or otherthe victims of a major handicap should have up the mechanics of reading by the time are aged seven. Teaching a child to read is the most fundamental responsibility which is be owed to him by his school and by the education will system generally. Unfortunately, one thing which can be said with complete certainty is that enormous numbers of today's children are not mastering the reading skills which research shows clearly could be taught to them. Britain's Bullock Committee report called A Languagefor living had this to say: If children are apparently unable to learn, we should assume that we have not as yet found the right way them. But in Australian schools these children are likely as not to be classed as dyslexics, and the moral responsibility for teaching them is loaded on remedial reading staff outside the mal classroom. Many will have left school before an actual remedial reading place is so much offered to them. There are, of course, many areas and levels in the community where the problem of under-achievers can and must be tackled. These include parental education, pre-school education and television. Let me for a moment tackle the very core the problem, and that is teacher training. At school level the most important factor setting eracy back has been a disastrous collapse in the practical content of teacher training. According to the British Bullock report, preparing a teacher for the passing on of reading skills should occupy at least 100 hours of training coursetime,and preferably ISO hours. But the Select Committee discovered that in Australian teacher training colleges the following was the position: The median values are quite low, even the maximum values of 60 to 75 hours are less than internationally recommended standards. As the Select Committee was told, it is not dyslexia or specific learning difficulties which have landed us with the literacy problem, as much as teaching which fails to identify precisely where breakdowns have occurred in the child's acquisition of reading, to tackle them, and then retest to make sure that success has been achieved. As the Committee's report makes clean The teaching of reading, numeracy and language be the responsibility of all teachers. A child who is subjects such as geography or history because of difficulties with basic skills should be taught ject areas of the subject teacher. From the research evidence, the whole idea of taking children out of their classrooms for separward ate remedial teaching should now be seen as deeply suspect. The Select Committee was told that, while there had heen spectacular initial gains in performance on the pan of great numbers of children, often in the long term these gains declined or even disappeared. Too frewill quently, withdrawal from the normal classroom setting leads to the child's problem being in his own ability or personality rather than in the qualities of the teacher or of the classroom itself, as is so often really the case. When the remedial process has run its course, the child simply returns to the conditions which gave him his difficulties in the first place. Increasingly, the remedial teacher who works to teach apan in a room ofhis own has to be supplanted by the resource teacher whose programs are conas ducted shoulder to shoulder with the classroom teacher on a team basis. So long as there are not offenough resource teachers to go around-this norseems bound to be the case for some considerable time-ther e has to be a way open for parents as to come in and help free the classroom teacher for the actual business of instruction if that is going to be necessary in the first instance. Parents are the great untapped resource of the education system as far as meeting the slow learners' need for warmth and individual attention is conof cerned. There are problems. Problems were thrown up in the course of our deliberations and litin the evidence taken by the Committee. But in the short term, if we do not act and act quickly, children are going to be committed to a hfetime of the emptiness that goes with failing to achieve progress in the literacy and numeracy area. Failing to mount a major research effort into getting the best from parental involvement in classrooms has been a major oversight on the part of the planners and administrators of Australian at 10 to 20 hours, and education. There is room here for a general comment to be made on educational research. What Australia is getting back from its educational research dollar reflects more the preoccupations of staff of the universities and colleges of advanced education than it does the problems facing teachers in their everyday work. New funding arrangements should be made. These require a setting of priorities each year for educational research by the national Government. Each year a list should be prepared of specific projects should which the Education Research and Developfailing in ment Committee lets out to research workers on a tender basis. Research funds should be split bethese skills within the subtween these national interest projects and the proposals which researchers continue to put forto the Committee on their own initiative. Let us turn to the report of the Select Committee. In 2 years the Select Committee received more than 400 submissions and took more than 4000 pages of evidence. After all that work, which was conducted in an atmosphere of goodand understanding, the Committee came to a general belief that the levels of achievement seen as are acceptable only when they enable the individual to compete in society in such a way that he can, with reasonable effort, obtain for himself a reasonable livelihood, dignity and reasonable social intercourse. The Committee went on to say in its report: The reason for under-achievement in a young child son greatly in need cannot set aside his entitlement teaching resources. It should be the aim of our educational system to bring every person to a level where he can be a functional member of society. We believe that this objective would be shared by most Australians. That is a very important quotation from the of report. Let me say that the Opposition shares this vastliteracy objective and it cannot see why there should be do not make the any delay in implementing the recommendations of the report so that such an admirable objective can be achieved. It is no Utopian objective of equal opportunity for all; it is simply a matter trying to establish a situation in which the vantaged get a run in the race which every day is being made more difficult by the economic obtutions. stacles erected by this Government. After 2 questions on this matter of the Minister representing the Minister for Education, received an inane reply that the Government did not have anytimeto talk to the people in the State. It would not have taken a great deal of time to talk to the people in the State. It would not have taken a great deal oftimeto implement some of other available recommendations that could have been put into effect very quickly. Let us look at some of the specific recommenadopting dations of the Committee. In chapter 2 of the report the Committee recommends that the dence of learning difficulties among Australian school children should be determined at regular intervals by a nation-wide survey based on simivery lar principles to the ACER study on 'Literacy and Numeracy in Australian Schools'. It states that the survey should be developed so that it platforms. will provide information on an assessment of the comparative performance of school systems and schools to establish whether, historically, stanplatforms dards are improving or declining and to detertained rnine the comparative performance of Australian schooling with schooling in comparative counblueprint tries. The report goes on to state that an organisvery ation such as the ACER should be funded by Australian Government to conduct the survey and that further funds should through the ERDC to enable research to aid in the development of survey techniques. This is not a radical approach; it would simply find out every more about the problem we are trying to solve by member using apparatus that is already estabhshed. Chapter 3 of the report goes on to propose operation between the States and the Australian Government. For God's sake, do we not need it? It proposes amendments to the legislation of some States which denies the responsibility of education departments to provide educational services to handicapped children. It states that education departments should provide such seror pervices. The Committee suggests that funding for to extra special education should be undertaken, as far as possible, through recurrent grants programs. As at least can be seen, this Select Committee went deeply into the subject and came up with recommendations on a very broad front to tackle the problems number and to make life more fruitful for a of people who at the moment just grade. One of the latter chapters of the report deals of with teacher education. The Committee has disadmade recommendations which provide for integrated activity by a number of existing instiThese proposals involve interaction beasking tween State departments of education and teacher organisations, the Australian UniversiI ties Commission and the Advanced Education Commission, and teacher training institutions. One would have thought that on an important issue such as this the very least the Government could have done at this stage would have been to set the wheels in motion. If they have done so, the Opposition can only be agreeably surprised that there has been any movement at all. If they have not, we can only say that the delay in the recommendations of the report is unforgivable. The longer the delay the greater incithe number of children there will be whose futures are blighted and whose development will be stunted. Politicians should believe-man y likely do believe-that the way is open for parties to speak out and to make clear whether there is a place for 'the right to read' in thenThere needs to be room for that in political to cover all the issues that are conin the report. It is a very good report. It is well researched and clearly set out. It provides a for what the Opposition believes is a desirable 'alliance for literacy'. Let me conthe clude by once again quoting from the general conclusion of the Committee in the foreword to be provided its report. It states: It should be the aim of our educational system to bring person to a level where he can be at least a functional of society. We believe that this objective would be shared by most Australians. coLet me say that every member of the Opposition shares this objective. It hopes that every member of the Parliament supports that objective and that there will be no funher delays in implementIn ing the recommendations of this most vital that report.",98

I agree with the honourbourne. able member for Melbourne, that it is a most mane and compassionate report.

I honourable member for Melbourne that I for one on this side of the House will be using the influence that I have to see that things are as a result of this report. Mr Stewart- I said that when I was in Parliachildren ment for 11 months, too.",101
184,Mr SHIPTON,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"If I might say so, I think the honourable member who interjected has his eyes closed. I think that this report adds to the state knowledge on the problems of literacy and numeracy in Australia. The Committee collected evidence and made its inquiry all over Australia. It has done good work. It commissioned the trahan Council of Educational Research survey to which the honourable member for Melbourne refened. I shall refer to certain of the that survey, firstly, those concerning reading. shall quote from the report as it relates to the school room. Paragraph 2.32 states: terms relevant to the schoolroom, the survey indicates one child per classroom in 10 year olds is virtually unable to read and one child in every three or four classrooms of 14 year olds is still unable to read in any independent That is quite frightening. With regard to Adults', numbers paragraph 2.37 states: most disturbingfindingwas that 4 per cent of 14 year not substract 9 from 17 correctly, 4 per cent did not 7 by 6 correctly and 8 per cent did not divide 56 by 7 correctly. With regard to learning problems the survey to 20 per cent of students in normal schooling were their teachers at both 10 and 14 year old levels to be need of remedial instruction in reading and number. I do This information was supplied from a teacher questionnaire in the report. All the information in the report is quite frightening. I think that the in community at large as well as educatorsparents, school teachers and the total communis ity-need s to study and debate this report. I might comment on the word 'dyslexic' because it was raised by the honourable member for MelI do not know whether he would agree, hubut I started my work on the report thinking that a dyslexia was the real problem. I came away with conclusion that the word 'dyslexia' did not mean anything. In fact, it is a word that is likely getto mislead if it is used in this area. There are of learning difficulties, but if the word 'dyslexia' is used to describe a supposed medical problem or supposed learning problem, that is dangerous in itself because it will lead parents teachers to think that a particular child is side dyslexic, and, therefore, something is different to about that child, whereas the child may merely have one of the many criteria of learning difficulcan say to the ties that we discovered. For instance, migrant children have problems, as do non-migrant children. But I think that die done problems of migrant children are perhaps more magnified than the problems of many Australian because when children of migrant families go home at night, they probably converse in the native tongue of their parents. That is a right and proper tiling to do but it means that they do not practise the language that they learn at ofschool. Perhaps their parents are unable to help them with their homework and are also unable to read them a bedtime story. I am old-fashioned enough to believe that this is fairly important in Austhe process of teaching children to read. Mr MCVeigh-You are a good father. results of Mr SHIPTON-I thank the honourable I gentleman for that compliment; I might reciprocate. I think there is perhaps a shyness involved as well with members of die migrant community. In relation to migrant children, the Committee recommended: The Committee would like to be sure that departments education make great efforts to recruit teachers, preferably from the relevant ethnic groups, who were proficient ority and migrant languages, who could converse schoolchildren from ethnic minorities and with understanding of their backgrounds. The Committee drew the analogy of customers of banks who can talk with tellers and read interpreters in Greek, Italian and Yugoslav at many banks because these languages are spoken by bank officers. I recommend to the Government that more than courses should be established to re-train migrant teachers in Australia. There are many migrants in this country who are, in fact, trained teachers in their countries of origin and who come here and take up other vocations. I have found from my own experience that it is better to re-train these people in Australia rather than to go overconclusion, seas and specifically recruit teachers. In my torate, at the State College of Victoria in known as Stonnington College, there is a course for re-training migrant teachers. It is a special bridging course to train migrants with overseas fact qualifications in Victoria. One of the upsetting have aspects of even that course is that it only re-trains teachers by giving them a conversion course in the English language for 6 months and then 12-month education period of study. The course qualifies them to be primary teachers only. I think there is a great deal more to be done in area. I commend the work of this particular State college to the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) and to the Government. I have referred to the problems of migrant children and migrant education by way teacher training. I now turn to the problems migrant adults because they have perhaps more problems than many other people. I suggest that migrant adults, like all adults, need to read write for some of the most basic forms of emknow ployment in society today. To drive a truck needs to be able to read a street sign and a street directory. I think that we must all ensure there are more courses and that migrants motivated and encouraged to train and teach themselves to learn to read and write and underbackhander. stand English. The problems of all adults are quite severe. The Committee visited a course at Footscray Technical College. To me this was quite a remarkable experience because I saw there bers adults who could not read or write, the firsttime.I think that more needs to be done in this area also. I remember one man who told me that he had worked in a store and that he had got on very well until metrication was of introduced. Before metrication his mates helped him with the invoices and the paper work; but in minmetrication completely beat him. I found that with rather sad. Fortunately he found this course. in their own languages Another man on that course said to me: ' I have been waiting 20 years for this course. I cannot or write. I am a paper hanger and painter and I have my own business'. I said to him: 'How did you do that? How did you give a quote?' He said: ' I just walked into a room and made it up in my head'. I think there are perhaps more people we realise in this situation in society. There was another man from an Italian family who had not learned to read and write and who was being restrained. All parliamentarians in all parliaments in Australia, who have responsibility for education, should look at this report and at the work that needs to be done as a result of it. In I trust that this report precipitates eleca debate amongst educators and teachers. With Toorak regard to teachers, the report states: The classroom teacher is the person to be encouraged. In many more problems can be solved in the classroom than we think. The classroom teacher admittedly needs to support by way of remedial teachers and other aids. But more and more problems can be solved in the classroom. a To do that we need to change the syllabus of existing teachers' colleges all over Australia and we need to make sure that existing teachers in the this teaching work force are retrained so that they can better understand the nature of the problems mentioned in this report. The concludes all that I wish to say on the report. I crave your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, of for one minute to refer to the imminent of retirement of the Clerk of the House, Mr Norman Parkes.

206,Mr BEAZLEY,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"I should like to ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) who represents the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) whether the Department of Education has reacted to the report of the Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties. I imagine that the report has been submitted to the Department of Education and to the Australian Schools Commission. It is likely that by thistimethere has been some reaction from them. If the Minister is not in a position to indicate to the House what their reactions are to the report, I would be grateful to receive from the Minister for Education a letter indicating the reaction of the Education experts of the Commonwealth Government to the recommendations of the Committee. In the opening part of its recommendations, the Committee referred to an and for all the important point. It stated: The incidence of learning difficulties among Australian school cluldren should be determined at regular intervals by a nation-wide survey based on similar principles to the ACER study Literacy and Numeracy in Australian Schools'. 1 When I was the Minister for Education I authorised the investigation into the literacy and numeracy in Australian Schools, particularly directed at 11-year olds and at 14-year olds. It is possible to stand up in Australia and say that reading standards are improving; that reading standards are getting worse; or that mathematical standards are improving on getting worse. There has been no base year to make comparisons. The report of the Australian Council for Educational Research made available this year-as a result of decisions made when I was Minister for Education last year, has given us a base year. But we are not yet in a position to make comparisons. I contrast this situation with paragraph 585 of the report entitled Children and their Primary Schools-the so-called Plowden report-publishe d in the UK. It states: Successive investigations into reading abihty undertaken by the Department of Education from 1948 to 1964 make it clear that, despite the dismal reports that appear from time to time in the press, the standard of reading m the countiy as a whole has been going up steadUy since the war. Children of eleven have advanced by an average of 17 months since the first report was made, and backwardness now has a different connotation from that which it had in 1948. For this improvement the schools can take much of the credit, but it does not dispose of all the questions asked about reading. The most important which remain are: what can be done to help the minority of chUdren for whom learning to read is a slow business and for a few never achieved? What use is made of the skill once it is acquired? Without putting it quite so specifically, the Select Committee has really been aiming in Australia at trying to find the answers to those questions. It is important to note what has happened in the United Kingdom since the Plowden report in 196S. When I was in the United Kingdom June and July of this year I went to the College Education at Edgehul and also to the Thomas system Coram Child Research Unit of the Faculty of cognitive, Education of London University. I learnt a students. number of things. One was about the standards redefined of reading in the United Kingdom. I learned that First, the standard of reading had stood still since that discriminate revelation in the Plowden report. It had not gone back, it had not gone forward, but the demands that of people in the United Kingdom had risen. instance, in 1948 it required a reading age of to read the London Daily Mirror. Even the don Daily Mirror, which is about as revolting the Sydney Mirror in its standards, now requires a reading age of thirteen. That increased requirement has really gone through the English Press. A tertiary reading age is required to the London Times, but the reading age required to read it in 1948 was not so high. They have been making assessments of what is required. Amongst the most difficult reading, of course, is any sort of instructional or inquisitorial reading such as forms. A person who died in the United Kingdom in 1975 in his lifetime hadfilledin times as many forms as a person who had died 1945. Therefore there is a considerable demand on reading skills. I have already mentioned in this House that sometimes a difference is made between requirements of reading skill in technitacking cal education and in academic education. These differences are quite false. For instance, if reads the house manuals of Mercedes, Ford Holden, such as are studied by a person doing mechanical engineering at one of our technical schools, one will quicklyfindthat the. reading requirements of those motorfirmmanuals are fully at tertiary level. Even if someone is doing chef's course at the Canberra Technical College- a very important course-the instrucexpenditure tional reading m books of recipes and so on has to be understood. There is almost no sector education which does not require reading skills. I hope that the Department of Education will take note of the recommendations of this year's and last year's exercise of the ACER in its report on literacy and numeracy in Australian schools. hope its study of the capacity of Australian chilin dren in that regard will be noted. If it is we then have objective tests of whether reading advancing. A report has been issued to us today entitled Poverty and Education in Australia. Dr Ronald Fitzgerald, who was the commissioner, when referring to the Interim Committee of the Australian Schools Commission stated: The terms of reference directed to the Interim Committeein That is the Karmel Committeeof . . . to determme ue ininimum needs of the schooling and to define those needs according to the extent of physical, social or economic disadvantage of In its repon of the following May, the Committee equaUty of opportunity in the Australian context. it rejected the estabUshed principle of uniform provision of services and assened that governments should positively in favour of disadvantaged groups. Second, the Committee argued for diversity and assened criteria other than academic success ought to be acFor cepted for recognising student achievement nine Looking back on my experience as a Minister I Loncan remember being under fire about schools. as The truth about our Australian community is that the most articulate sections of the community regard education as a weapon to their advantage and to the advantage of their own read children over other children and not as the instrument of every child's dignity. I was never attacked about expenditure on universities. Let us face it: Expenditure on universities represents shifting purchasing power upwards in the community. It costs $67m a year to run the Australian National University for 6000 students, which is 17 $11,000 a head. There are many taxpayers who inare much poorer than many of the students at the university and who are paying taxes for the students' education. I believe it is very important that university education is free. I am not at that principle. I am stating that there is a social effect on shifting resources upwards in the one community. It is significant that the Labor or Government was never under attack about that. But my goodness, the attacks that came when a differential was made between, say, a Geelong Grammar school and a Marist Brothers college in the non-government sector were siga nificant. That was where the real battle came in. If a government does anything in education that starts shifting resources downwards in the community it willfinditself under of fire from articulate sections of the community. I say one thing about what is, after all, a superficial look at Fitzgerald's report. I dislike his imprecise use of the word 'elitism'. I believe that the Specific Learning Difficulties Committee I avoided confusion of terms. I believe it is elitism education if you are trying to socially privilege will an economic or social group. For instance, is Palmerston, in his days at Oxford University, was considered to be a man of exceptional selfrestraint because he did not take out a Master of Arts degree to which he was automatically entitled as a peer. Being a peer and just breathing the atmosphere of Oxford entitled him to an M.A. immediately. That is what I would call elitism in an extreme form in education. But when people start talking about intellectual pacity and say that it is elitism, if someone instance a student at a secondary college in berra, with high intellectual capacity can go ahead at his own pace, what they really are speaking about is academic and intellectual skill. If they are going to attack that as elitism they are making a mistake. Of course, it is elitismtremendous if you try to confine opportunities to socially privileged groups or if you leave others to rot cause they are not in socially privileged groups. I think we would be very wise in the field of handicapped. education to confine the expression elitism to thewhich question of social and economic privilege and not make it an instrument of attack on quality. After all, if I am going to be operated on by a surgeon I hope to God he belongs to an elite and can do the operation skilfully and with good discernment. There are many things for which we require the services of an elite. The Specific Learning Difficulties Committee was trying tofindreasons why some cluldren not succeed. They are not all economic reasons. At the Thomas Coram Research Unit, Professor House. Tizard had students who had done a survey of English children at Dagenham. They had excluded from the survey children of West Indian background or Indian and Pakistan backSpecific ground because their command of EngUsh was not different from that of the general run of English cluldren. They analysed the reading capacities EngUsh cluldren in the Dagenham area and theysubject found this very interesting thing, that cluldren who read regularly to their parents now were the top reading group. ChUdren who read occal casionally to their parents now were in the ond best reading group. Cluldren who had regularly read to their parents in the infants group, but had not done so since were in the next group, and cluldren who had read occasionaUy to their parents in the infants group The chUdren who had never read to their parents were in the last group. This is a very interesting aspect in establishing a correlation between the factor of parental interest in listening to chad's achievements and the child's results. other words, cluldren and young people do catchfinition from adults a value placed on education. The secondary colleges which came into existcould ence in Canberra this year have a number of definition things about them which have led to them beinga very intense learning communities. One is that cluldren have deUberately chosen to transfer them because they want to get on with work. ondly, under our adult secondary student scheme, adults who missed secondary education opportunities may come back to school. So theresaid cawe have 21-year olds and 25-year olds who have for come back to matriculate in those coUeges. They, Canas young adults, put a high value on the opportunities which the 17-year olds and 18-year olds get naturaUy. The younger students have caught these values from the older students and the I thinkpresence of these older students has been a factor in motivation. It is the same thing with the parental stimulus. We cannot be-eUminate that factor, but the vital parts of this report do speak of the quality of teachers of the The beginnings of a transformation in that area came about by the funding arose out of the Karmel report. There are many comments in this report on specific learning difficulties which are extremely valuable and that is why I would Uke very much to have the reactions of the Commonwealth Department of Education and the Schools Commission to it. I am not an objective viewer, being a member of that Committee, but I regard this doreport as being a very valuable educational document brought down by a committee of this",104
207,Mr HYDE,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES," I also am a signatory to the report of the Select Committee on Learning Difficulties and therefore I will speak to the subject matter of the report. Obviously I agree with it. I can do no better than of recommend to anyone who wishes to take up the a reading of that report. It was a type of inquiry that probably was not particularly suited into the parUamentary forum in that it was technirather than political in nature. Nonetheless, secthe Committee dealt with a very serious problem. In some cases the results of the problem were nothing short of heart-rending and the problem of learning difficulty undoubtedly has deprived many people of an opportunity to enjoy were next. our Australian society. The attitude of the Committee was bipartisan. I can give a ready example of that. The previous the speaker, the honourable member for Fremantle In (Mr Beazley), described the problem of the deof eUtism. I envy him. I had that word written in my notes at one stage and, frankly, I crossed it out. I thought there was no way that I explain to the House the problems of the of elitism without painting myself into corner as a hopelessright-wingerin the view of those who did not Usten carefully to what I said. to Sometimes there is an advantage in speaking Sec-from the Opposition benches and from the side of the Labor Party. I wiU overcome the problem simply by saying that I agree with every word by the honourable member for Fremantle. There is a problem in deciding how resources will be allocated. A society allocates resources some people in disproportionate amounts beUc. cause they can provide things that society needs. There is no better example than the doctor whom the honourable member for Fremande spoke. The group of people with which concerned consisted of people at the other end the scale, those who had difficulty in reaching basic minimum standard that I think society should believe is the right of everyone. I refer that minimum standard that will let people comthat pete in society at a level where they can reasonably happy Uves, where they can have a sense of fulfilment, and where they will not feel that their lives have been pointless, fruitless in vain. Obviously, competing in today's society is very difficult if you cannot learn simple metic, simple reading, simple literacy and simple numeracy. How much of society's resources ought to be provided to bring children and adults with the more difficult learning problem up to that level where society will see them Uve reasoncomfort ably full lives? That is the subject matter of this report. have tried to decide how those resources better applied to fill these very mmimum needs of individuals so that not only wiU theyfindemployment but also they wUlfindmates and some appreciation of the things that are around them. Many things are not understood-it might even be true to say that most things are not underof stood-abou t the difficult problem of learning. We know the problem is widespread. We have no criteria against which to measure our success. It is essential that anything that is done-man things ought to be done-is evaluated carefully so that not only will we help some chUdren in immediate future but also we will budd up knowledge with which we can help children the more distant future. It is absolutely essential that populations be tested, that progress be fully monitored and that the techniques by which this is done are studied. The process and techject. nique of evaluation are inadequately members understood. There is a problem of bad teaching and, I am afraid, bad teachers. I am glad that the report Dr Fitzgerald also mentions that had one or two harsh things to say about some teachers. That is not to say that other teachers do not give to their profession in a manner and gree that can bring only credit to themselves. It a problem of bad parents, of bad environment and of bad luck. One question I have had asked of me since report came down is: 'Where do we go from here?' In the first instance, the report is advice to to the Parliament. It is advice to the Australian pubI went through the recommendations. I found that it was advice to no fewer than 23 different about organisauons involved with education-the 3 arms of government, the research institutions, we were the Schools Commission and many other of organisations which have responsibiUty for the a education of our cluldren-includin g obviously, the State Education Departments. The advice into the report, if it is taken up- I hope and believe it will be, as I did not sign the report idlylive will be taken up piecemeal by many organisations. It will also be taken up over an extended period. It is my hope that the next Schools Comand mission report, for instance, will be influenced by the things that we said. It is my hope that we will arithbe able to measure, when we look back at this time from 10 years hence, the progress that we have made. I thank the House.",106

209,Mr BRYANT,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"Do not let me embark upon that kind of an argument. I have been a member this House for long enough to be able to qualify to speak in debates without having to apply to the Whip of the Government parties. As a nonmember of the Committee, I thank the Comy mittee on behalf of ali the non-members of it for the competence of their work and for the dedithe cation which they put into it. I take up the remarks of the honourable member for Moore in (Mr Hyde) about the fact that the Committee embarked upon a program which was certainly carenot in the normalfieldof parUamentary endeavour inasmuch as this was a highly technical subHowever, I have a great deal of faith in of Parliament en masse, and sometimes individually, and in their competence to examine subjects of great technicality and to produce adby equate understanding of them. In this case I beproblem. We lieve they have done so. I ask the Government, insofar as it is likely to take any initiative about anything at this stage, to a deapply itself to having the recommendations of is this Committee carried out. Perhaps it istimewe had some system of parliamentary audit by which committee reports which are brought be the fore the Parliament are examined and continually sent along the way. Something must be done inside the parliamentary system to make this of it effective. This report would not be the first report which has been before Parliament and which has been completely ignored. A comtake mittee has recendy been looking at matters condations. cerning Aborigines. It discovered that around Australia something like 45 reports have been ignored. I want to refer briefly to 3 matters which interest me particularly. Thefirstmatter is on the first page of the recommendations. Thefirstone appeal is that we do something about legislation in some of the States which denies the responsibility of Today education departments to provide educational services to handicapped children. This has been one of the most callous areas of Australian essential education-the ignoring of our duty to handiture. capped children and to the parents of those chiltion dren. It has created great hardship. It has been an area of neglect over most of Australia, and will be only through the action of some supraphilosophy national authority that we will get equal opportunity in thatfieldfor those children. The second point is item (c) of the recommendations which is in chapter 3. It states that we should make every effort to recruit teachers, erably from the relevant ethnic groups, who are proficient in minority and migrant languages, and so on. I speak about this matter with some depth of feeling because my electorate has one the great concentrations of migrants in Australia. Three million people have come to this country, thousands of them with a faintly literate backtage ground of their own. Mostly they have been poured into the industrial areas of Australia. Their future education has been ignored. I think this has been a very serious area ought not to have been tolerated. The Government of which I was a member attempted to are introduce a program and started it along its I do not think the Victorian Education Departber ment applied itself with proper vigour to the task. In this instance we will need special classes, special equipment and special teachers. We have a Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs responsible for the question. We have a DepartOn ment of Education. There is no excuse for our pressing the State departments, making the necessary grants and getting on with the job. I think this is one of the most important areas educational activity. The third point is the situation of the Aborigiis nal children of Australia. Governments pre-1972 took some steps which gave some hope to the Aboriginal children in that they established, think, secondary grants. In the 3 years in which we were in government we took a lot of steps part establish programs to overcome the particular difficulties of Aboriginal groups. I appeal to the Parliament, to the Government in particular, to urgent steps to implement these recommenIt is quite pointless the Parliament appointing committees which put a lot of work into their subject and which travel the country at great length, listen to a large number of competent people who produce mountains of submissions and evidence, if nothing then happens. I to the Government to forget for a moIt ment the theology that it calls economic theories. should start to apply some vigour to this. we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) saying that it was absolutely that we reduce government expendiThis is such an enormous social contradicthat we cannot tolerate it. The people of Australia ought to be alerted to the contradiction it between the pretensions about social policy and of honourable members opposite and the economic theories being followed. I remind the House that Australia's record in public education is probably as good as that of any other country. At the end of the last century pref-we established a free, compulsory and mostly secular education system. That was basically in the 1870s. At that stage not much more than 50 to 60 per cent of the community was literate. Acof cording to the census returns, by 1900 Australia was basically a literate community. That was a remarkable achievement. It had the great advanof a simple objective, that is, to obtain literacy-to be able to read and write. Unfortunately we still have no clear objective in secondary education, for handicapped people or for of neglect. It specialist groups. I propose to finish at that point although there a number of things that I would like to say, way. particularly to my friend the honourable memfor Bendigo (Mr Bourchier). I think it is inordinate impertinence on his part to think that he shall decide whether or not people shall speak in this House. He is one of those fortunate people who is a temporary member of this Parliament. this occasion I sit down to pay a proper cournottesy to my friend, the honourable member for Darling Downs who, in this instance, happens to beright,but who is mostly in a situation of grievof ous political error. I remind the House in doing so that it is very rarely that that kind of courtesy paid to myself or anybody on this side of the House.",107
210,Mr MCVEIGH,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"At I the outset, I express my personal and sincere thanks to the honourable member for Wills (Mr to Bryant) for being courteous and kind enough to allow me to be associated with the debate on this report. I was a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties which heard public evinot dence and received various submissions. The areas report which is concerned with the learning difficulties of children and adults consolidates some 4000 pages of public evidence and 400 submissions. I suppose it is true to say that the Committee embarked upon a voyage into uncharted waters. Very little had been done not only in Australia but also in most of the world to define the lem and to establish guidelines to overcome the very serious hardships and the great personal traumas of people who are afflicted with what we term, in a general sense, learning disabilities and/or difficulties. It is interesting to recall great sense of concern and goodwill shown people who came before the Committee. were united in their task of isolating the and overcoming an area of great personal tragedy. The recommendations and conclusions conachieves, tained in the report are somewhat unique in modern political era insofar as they do not of necessity advocate that morefinanceshould be pumped into a particular stream-in this child instance, the educational stream. be a reallocation of resources and this is a matter which is open for debate by the Parliament, by the people of Australia and by all people regrettable interested in education. It must be admitted some States are doing a great deal to overcome the problems of learning difficulties and in the provision of remedial and resource teachers to identify this problem. Some States are doing verycriticism little in these areas. I express the wish that people should associated with the efforts of governments to overcome the problems. Only today I had privilege of meeting at lunch some people who are represented in this Parliament by the honourhigher able member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett). It was brought to our notice that one of the local service clubs in the small Queensland country town Cunnamulla had donated $1,000 for the proeducated vision of a remedial teacher to bring this type education to the children of the outback. That importance. type of community outpouring of goodwill, cern and identity should be encouraged. These matters should not of necessity be left to governped ments to provide the services. I express the hope that when governments around to doing something positive about this desired ends. matter they will do something about the requirements of isolated children. I support the remarks of previous speakers who also made a plea in this regard. I hope that governments will just think of children in the metropolitan but they they will also have regard for children in isolated areas and the children of the Aboriginal community. The needs of these children are very important and they are entitled to receive an adequate amount of resources to upgrade their education requirements. One of the salient features of the report which came through with crystal clarity and continuous probpurpose was the correlation of the home, the school and the teacher. The report pointed out that each of these 3 different areas has a great part to play in helping children as well as adults to play a useful part as members of the comthe munity and to develop fluency in expression, by all arithmetic and all the associated arts. They Mr Martyr-The home is fundamental. problem Mr MCVEIGH-I am delighted to hear that remark from the honourable member for Swan. The home is vital because whatever the school however dedicated the teacher is, if the a home environment to which the child returns does not place emphasis on correcting a serious problem and if no encouragement is given to the to progress, in thefinalanalysis very Uttle But there must progress wUlbe made. It is interesting to note that 25 per cent of chUdren are in need of special assistance. It is most that 10 000 chUdren will leave school that each year without the simple skUls and 20 000 chUdren will not have the ability to do simple multiplication, subtraction and so on. I believe that these are very salient considerations. Much was expressed of teachers and teaching institutions. A query was raised whether the be modern teacher is motivated sufficiently and whether he or she is sufficiently accountable. The the standards that are being demanded of our teachers are intolerably high. They will become in the future. A vast amount of pubUc money has been expended in the area of teacher education. Therefore, it is absolutely essential of that we turn out teachers who not only are people but also know how to teach the of fundamental 3 Rs. This requirement is of vital conEvidence taken by the Committee revealed that the older 'type' of teacher was better equipto isolate the problem initially and to inculcate into the cluld a better understanding of the get needs of education and how to achieve the Mr Martyr-Throug h discipUne.",108
211,Mr MCVEIGH,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"It is possible that in the old days teachers were more disciplined. They wereport taught to become teachers rather in die educational sense. It was found that only one teaching institution in Australia allocated a reasonable number of hours for teaching teachers the fundamentals of numeracy and literacy. What do we do in that situation when overseas standards indicate that at least 100 hours lectures, and possibly a maximum of 150 hours, are required in this area? We have reached intolerable situation where one college of vanced education in one of the States only 2 hours to what one might call the absolute foundation of educational teaching. A chorus of witnesses drew attention, as they saw it, to the problem of the inability of teachers to teach children. I conclude on 2 simple notes. I hope Australian Council of Education Research will continue its research into the problem and that it will monitor progress. It is simply not good enough to say that standards have not We have to know what the actual standards are.

This morning a number of us had something to say about a Clerk of the House who has given long and distinguished service to this Parliament. and his father have done so since Federation. believe the Clerk and his family typify the a in and about this Parliament. It question of people who work in this people who are essential to the comfort and well-being of members of in Parliament. At least at thistimeof the year, with more charity in our minds and hearts than polithis ticians often have, I believe that we ought to remember them. I refer to the attendants, the drivers, the people who make the communications work, the voices on the switchboard that The belong to people whom honourable members probably never see but who with great efficiency have seem to be able to connect members of Parliament to people at other ends of telephones in indulgence, remote parts of Australia. I think it is appropriate for members of the House of Representatives to pay particular tribof ute to Gordon Pike, who for as long as I can remember has given notable service to all members of Parliament, always making sure that they get to their avowed destination, sometimes when they probably do not deserve to do so. He has carried out his part of the bargain on each and every occasion. He has made sure that people get this chamber in the morning, that they get raise home at night and that they get home on the am weekends. He is the sort of person whom members of this Parliament, I believe, ought to chervery greatly indeed. He is also a cricketer of no mean note. I have never had the good fortune see Tony Street bowl him out on one of those significant occasions when the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations takes part in his old sports and habits, but I think that also is one of the activities that ought to be cherished by Minister has members of this House. There are the cooks who feed the members of Parliament and the waitresses who see that we get served and fed in the dining room. There are cleaners who make the place habitable after I members of Parliament have left it at night. the There are carpenters and the mechanical staff who change rooms and make them more appropriate to Ministers' needs and to the needs of of the Opposition so that they and their staffs can be better housed, in better comfort, therefore can better carry out their particular duties. Earlier today we paid a tribute to Northe man Parkes and I remind the House of that. posEarlier this year we paid tribute to the Chief Hansard Reporter, Bill Bridgman, for long and significant service to this Parliament and again, through the Parliament, to Australia. Paddy Ward, an attendant on the House of Representatives side who retired in May will be rememthe bered by many people who have been in this Parliament. A special thanks is owed, I beheve, to the brary staff and especially to produce a year of newspaper clippings at the twmlding of an eye. We are especially grateful when they have the clipping we particularly want on the top, which enables us to against our opponent in the way in which we want to make it. The Library staff has been mously strengthened in recent times. The research part of the Library has been greatly strengthened to service the needs of members Parliament and to enable them better to carry out their responsibility and duties. I think one the things that members of Parliament in parties from both sides of the House have great conor fidence in is the fact that the people and around this chamber and in this building work with no regard to the political Party from which a particular member comes but merely on with a regard to carrying out their particular ligations, services and functions in relation to member of Parliament. I believe they do this the best of their ability, no matter what Party no matter what the political leanings of a particuby lar member may be. At this time of the year I think we can thank a very large number of people, many of whom are work not seen and many of whom, I suppose, in the that business of the day are hardly noticed in a norThismay mal working week, but without whom this Parwomen in liament could not function, without whom this conspicuously Parliament would fall apart. Just as our own Prime Ministerthroughout wives might sometimes become a little tired thetimeswe come home late because of the sitwell to all the members on both also tings of the House or a little tired of the weekends which, by thetimewe have looked ies are probably the most long-suffering infamilafter electoral functions and other matters, become pretty short weekends, so too the people country who work in and around this House when Parliavirtue ment is sitting work very long hours. The wives the support must be patient indeed to put up with it year after year. I think it is an appropriate time for members of this House, with charity and warmth in their hearts, to offer good wishes, a happy Christmas and prosperous new year to all who serve us as members of Parhament. We owe not them our thanks. I hope that as the lights Parliament go out, some of the bitterness of debates which is often too much generated tween politicians can be forgotten and that some of the characteristics of Australians can be remembered. Mr E. G.

Your guests will always be of disclosed sooner or later. Sometimes there is difficulty infindingthe names of the protagonists the guests on these occasions, but gradually who work in they are ascertained. I did not want to speak in a facetious manner an occasion like this; I wanted to pay due tribobute to you, Mr Speaker. I must say, you are looka ing better every day. I wanted to pay tribute also to on behalf of my Party to all those who have and backed up, as they have for many years, well led the Clerk to whom we paid tribute earlier. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) spoke appropriately, graciously and warmly about all those men and women-hundred s of them-wh o in this place. It is a great delusion to think this arena is the whole of the Parliament. arena, well or ill conducted as the members be, would be a shell but for the men and their hundreds who work here less the year.

I found that some of them concerned me. I shall weary the House with any of those matters. I of this am aware that fromtimetotimeI have been the unjust to some honourable members on the other beside of the House with whom I have served for very many years. I am delighted to see- I have not yet been able to read-the defence report which my good friend, the honourable, learned and gallant Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) tabled tonight. I do not believe he had equately conveyed to the Australian people sacrifices that he has made in his portfolio. Interesting though the document which he has tabled tonight may be, it in fact tells only tion of the story. Another document has come into my hands tonight. Presumably it is authentic because it is authorised by Tony Eggleton, eral Director of the Liberal Party",114
261,Mr SPEAKER,BENEFITS LEGISLATION,"Order!

He has been given leave to make a occasion, statement but he is misusing the forms of the during House to do so. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker. I will not all trespass very long. I thought you what I was about to say. I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Defence for the economies he is achieving in the administration ofhis portfolio. I am assured, on very high authority, that he cut the 5-year defence program from $ 12,000m to $ 1,200m. This really will put this country very much better economic position. I am not relying on any scurrilous information, such as fence leaks in recent copies of the Bulletin. I not relying on anything that Norman Minister for Defence might have said at the National Press Club today-and I appreciate his tributes me. Mr Killen-They were desperately earned. Mr E. G.

Many Ministers are making great economies. For instance, I find, and it will be announced in the next couple of days that the a porTreasurer (Mr Lynch)-frankly , I think people have been far too beastly to the Treasurer in this House and in the Party room in recent weeks-is Fedeffecting great economies in the civil field. I gather that we will learn next week that there be no new expenditure entered into; that all departments must look at further cuts that can be apmade to an existing expenditure program; that all departments are to report to the Treasurer on those areas where under-expenditure is occurand that all Departments must report to the I Treasury Department and/or the Department of Finance on all these issues by 13 December. I am this quoting from Cabinet decision No. 1971.",115

I trust that the next year will be an even better one for you. In the meantime, I trust that of us in the bosom of our families will have a would enjoy very happy Christmas.",115
265,Mr SINCLAIR,BENEFITS LEGISLATION,"by leave-The Leader of the has Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has referred very kindly to an economy that even the in a Treasurer (Mr Lynch) did not expect to be able to achieve. However, he who spoke reminds me deof the days when he was in office and of a ditty am that I believe originated from the Parliament. I am sure that it must have been in the days when the Labor Party was in office. It runs something to like this: 'Australia is a land of milk and honey. The cows go into Parliament and the bees take all our money.' The Government is trying to give the money back and that has been the substance and the motivation behind the last 12 months. If the Leader of the Opposition cares to read of E&OE-error s and omissions excepted-in the issue of the Bulletin, he will realise that the he progress report from which he quoted sets down of a very worthwhile and productive summary of He the achievements of thefirstFraser-Anthony Government. It is in that light that I think we reviewing the year's proceedings tonight. Mr Speaker, to you and your assistants I like to extend my thanks, on behalf of those of who have been responsible for miming this place, for the way in which the business of the Parliament has been conducted. To Mr Norman Parkes, whoseretirementwe spoke about earlier today, I would like to wish not only a happy retirement but also to him and his family a Christmas and a prosperous and contented New Year. To his successor, Mr John Athol Pettifer, whose appointment has just been announced- a midst. very merited appointment that all honourable members are delighted to see- I would also like to extend congratulations and best wishes on his new appointment. We are all sure that his will a very effective tenure of office. Mr Speaker, through you, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the position each referred to many people who, this place, have made their contribution to effective operation. I do not seek to repeat individual names but I would support very strongly the testimony that has been given to their contribution to this Parliament. However, there is one whose name has been omitted and whom I would like torefertonight. I understand that, with promotions and changes within Public Service he does not expect to occupy his office in the next Parliament. Ireferto Dyster who is the Principal Parliamentary Liaision Officer, and whose unusual tenure has extended through the days of the Labor Government and then through the first 12 months of the Liberal-National Country Party coalition. Those days in the Parliament, of course, have been passive and anyone who can survive must have, think, an extraordinarily strong and vigorous constitution. To Arthur Dyster, on behalf of my predecessor, Mr Fred Daly, and on my own tary behalf, I would like to say a particular thankHansard you. The functioning of this House, more than many members are perhaps aware, depends very significantly on the advice, consultations and assistance that he provides. Mr Speaker, I know full well that you, as a former Leader the House, would recognise the contribution he makes. I would also like to extend other officer of the Parliament who is, of course, a parliamentarian. I refer to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) who is the manager of Opposition business. He also has facilitated the conduct of the affairs Representatives and to him I would extend my own personal thanks. I would are closing not only to wish the members present but also those absent, including my own leader, a would merry Christmas and a happy and healthier New us Year. I trust that in the New Year those who are not with us will be able to return refreshed for the fray during 1977.1 know that all of us have been very sad that Doug. Anthony, the right honourable member for Richmond and the Deputy Prime Minister, has been ill for so long. happy In particular, on behalf of members of the National Country Party I would like to wish him a speedy recovery and an early return to our",115

267,Mr HOWARD,FOR THE STATES AND STATE GOVERNMENT LOAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows; SOUTH AUSTRALIA (1) to (5) The information requested on duty increases in arising from the 1976 review of the system of tariff preferences for developing countries has been set out below three tables, which provide a list of all tariff items affected, together withrelevantrates of duty and import statistics for in motor vehicle 1973-74,1974-75 and 1975-76. The three tables differentiate between goods on which the WESTERN AUSTRALIA Developing Country rate of duty has been increased but a tariff preference; goods on which the Country rate of duty was increased to the General Tariff; and goods which remain in the system of tariff preferences but for which some developing countries TASMANIA were excluded from preference on 1 July 1976. in The explanatory notes in the tables show that on the basis levy of Australian imports in 1973-74, trade from developing countries actually subject to increased duties resulting from the 1976 Review was valued at about $23.3m. However, on the basis of 1973-76, imports of the same products had almost doubled to $41.1 m. (6) It is not expected that the value of imports from developing countries will decrease as a result of the duty increases. (7) There are no fixed criteria for determining whether a country should be a beneficiary under the Australian system of tariff preferences for developing following factors are taken into account: the country's desire to be a beneficiary; the country's level of economic development; the practice of other preference-giving countries in respect of that particular countiy.

The import clearancefiguresfor Developing Countries shown in the attached tables are for all import clearances from Developing Countries under the items hsted.

However the E articular product or DC imports were above the level of a IC Quota and therefore subject to General Tariff rates of duty. Such imports ineligible for tariff preference were therefore unaffected by duty increases arising from the Review.

(2) What was the total revenue earned by (a) the Commonwealth and (b) each State from these royalties during each of the last 5financialyears. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Royalties are a matter for the individual State Governments, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. Ireferyou to the appropriate State and Territory Acts, Ordinances, and Regulations from which the information below has been extracted. The units quoted in this answer are as specified in the States Acts and Territory Ordinances. With regard to petroleum (oil and gas), royalty is paid as a percentage of the wellhead value of a unit of production, i.e. barrel, cubic foot, or cubic metre. (1) (a) The Commonwealth imposesroyaltieson minerals produced only in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, and on petroleum produced from offshore title areas. Offshore Petroleum The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Act provides for a standard royalty of 10 per cent of value at the wellhead of production to be shared 6/10 to the State and 4/10 to the Commonwealth. An over-ride royalty of between 1 per cent and 216 per cent is payable when a Secondary Production Licence is granted. Australian Capital Territory There is no mining in the A.C.T. except for sand and gravel, hard rock for aggregate, and fine crushed rock for roadbase. Material Sand and gravel $0.20 /cu. yard First-grade $5,000/year plus $0.06/ton sold, with a aggregate rise and fall clause which operates Fine-crushed rock $5,000/year plus $0.03/ton sold, with a for roadbase rise and fall clause which operates Northern Territory (a) Gold . . . 1 Viper cent of the nett value. (2 Viper cent if in an Aboriginal reserve). Nett value is the gross proceeds of sales less treatment costs (other than those necessary to make the product marketable), and the transport costs from the mine to the point of sale. Mining and concentrating charges are not allowable treatment costs as these are necessary to obtain a marketable product (b) Other minerals . . . 1'/* per cent of the nett value (2Vi percent if in an Aboriginal reserve). (c) Washed bauxite . . . IU per cent of the value (but 2Vi per cent if in an Aboriginalreserve).If the world price of aluminium is $500.00 per ton the value of washed bauxite shall be deemed to be $4.00 per ton, and pro rata for higher and lower prices. World price is the price for Canadian primary auminium 99.5 per cent f.o.b. Toronto in the London Metal Bull(Question No. 1557) etin, converted to Austrahan currency. Royalty payble on bauxite produced from Gove Peninsula is set out in the First Schedule to the Agreement under the Mining (Gove Peninsula Nabalco Agreement) Ordinance 1968. The basic royalty rate is 20 cents per ton on bauxite mined and treated in Australia and 30 cents per ton on bauxite mined and exported as untreated bauxite (with provision for reduction of theroyaltyon treated bauxite if the profitability of alumina production falls below a certain level). (d) Petroleum. Onshore-1 0 per cent of wellhead value.

Immigration of Refugees (Question No. 972) Mr Innes asked the Minister for Immigration concentrate conand Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: than 90 per cent Ti02 royalty 25 (1) What persons are presently eligible to migrate to cent f.o.r. value (or Australia as refugees. (2) What are the procedures adopted in their processing, and what are the criteria used to determine eligibility as a refugee. 2 per cent f.o.r. value (or Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourf.o.r. value able member's question is as follows: (1) The Government's policy towards the entry of if refugees is governed by its obligations as a party to the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees and its the acknowledgement that as a member of the international community it must accept a share of responsibiUty in refugee quasi-refugee situations which often involve personal and loss of human dignity, basic rights and means of per cent, will not pass livelihood. with this approach the Government is prepared what it can to facilitate the resettlement pf those refugees who can be integrated into the Australian comas well as others who though not in a strict sense pass refugees have been displaced and are the victims of severe concentrating or other privation. The extent to which Australia can participate in these of projects must allow for special arrangements to be made to interview applicants and must take into account the ability of any particular group of refugees or displaced pera sons to integrate into the community. Factors to be considered in thisregardgo well beyond the grant of assisted passages to Australia and include placement in employment in Australia which is significantly difficult at present and an assessment of the degree of reliance which any group may on continuing social welfare payments and services. Any proposal to admit refugees must be dealt with on a global basis and does not permit specific groups to be dealt with in isolation to the exclusion of other groups who may be seen as eUgible to benefit from Australia'srefugeepolicy. The essential aim, therefore, is to offer optimum assistance and avoid the intrusion of self-defeating factors such as poor employment prospects or the denial of employment opportunities which would otherwise be available to persons already in Australia. (2) The procedures adopted for the selection and movement of refugees and displaced persons whose entry has been approved in principle ensure that the standard migrant criteria are not imposed as this could effectively deny to the persons concerned the resettlement opportunities which the Government has offered. Health and character standards are insisted on but aUowance is made for the parlous situation in which the refugees find themselves and their inability to comply strictly with rules related to occupational skills, etc. The criteria used to determine eUgibUity for entry to Australia as refugees allow for the chances of resettlement in the country in which the refugees find themselves, the degree of support which would be forthcoming in that country, alternative opportunities for resettlement elsewhere more readily on the basis of language or closer association and Australia's ability to integrate the refugees at any given time.

Wages on Christmas Island Mr Garrick asked the Minister for tion and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has the Union of Christmas Island Workers made a formal complaint to the Community Relations Commissioner. (2) Have Asian workers on the Island been receiving wages as low as $28 per week, while Europeans get Australian awards. (3) Are Asians working on the Island employed on short term contracts to prevent them from staying on the Island long enough to gain Australian Citizenship. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) (a) A dual wage structure exists on Christmas Island because of a need to attract people from different labour markets. There are two main labour market sources from which the Christmas Island Administration and the British Phosphate Commissioners draw their employees working on High the Island: (i) Mainland Australia or areas with sinular workforces and economies; (U) South East Asian areas in close proximity to Christacting mas Island (e.g. Singapore mas Island itself. Employees from both Australia and Malaysia/Singapore are paid wages which will attract them to the Island. As a result, positions on the Island are generally divided into two categories-'Mainland-based' and 'Regionally-engaged'. 'Regionally-engaged' positions require qualifications skills which can be readUy found in recruits from Christmas Island or neighbouring areas. 'Mainland-based' positions are those which, because of require, are normallyfilledwith recruits from Australia pr a simUar country. (b) The lowest cash wage paid to an employee on Christmas Island was $28.70 per week up until 20 October 1976. Since then there have been two separate increases granted in respect of 'RegionaUy engaged' employees on Christmas Island. A cost of Uving increase of 5.7 per cent retrospective to 1 October 1976, was recently granted by the employers and a 5 per cent 'across the board' increase in wages, effective from 1 August 1976 was granted in an interim decision by the Arbitrator for Christmas Island. Wages are supplemented by marriage and child aUowances. In addition free education, housing, electricity, water and other municipal-type services, transpon amenities, medical and hospital treatment, and dental and optical services are provided. Furthermore, no rates, income tax or sales tax are levied. The only indirect tax is on non-Australian-made alcoholic beverages. 3. No. The eventual exhaustion of the phosphate deposits on Christmas Island makes it unrealistic to operate a permanent workforce on the Island. Accordingly, some considerable time ago, a poUcy of offering three year terms of engagement to RegionaUy-engaged workers was introduced to enable them to retain affiliations with their place of recruitment. respect of official engagements. Australian Ambassadors and High Commissioners of his nine-day official visit to (Question No. 1307)",133
271,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,TABLE A,"the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (Question No. 1289) Do Australian Ambassadors and High Commissioners represent Australia independently of the Government which Immigrafrom time to time may be in office.  member's question is as follows: In formal terms, the letters signed by the Queen accrediting an individual as Australian Ambassador to a foreign country ask that the Head of State of the receiving country give credence to all that the Ambassador shall say in the Queen's name. Australian Ambassadors therefore formally represent the Queen of Australia. The same is true of Australian High Commissioners, except in the case of High Commissioners in countries whose Head of State is the Queen. In such cases, because it would be inappropriate for the Queen to address a letter to herself, letters of introduction are signed by the Australian Prime Minister of the day and addressed to the Prime Minister of the receiving country. These letters ask that credence be given to aU that the High Commissioner may communicate in the name of the Australian Government. In practice, of course, all Australian Ambassadors and Commissioners direct their advice to and act on instructions from the Australian Government of the day. Australian Ambassadors and High Commissioners are regarded by the countries to which they are accredited as representing and on behalf of the Australian Government of the day. and Malaysia) or ChristStudents from Thailand (Question No. 1330) Mr E.

(4) How many still Uve in Australia. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In April 1975 there were in Australia (a) 327 Government-sponsored students from Vietnam and 69 Government-sponsored students from Cambodia; and (b) 129 private students from Vietnam and 27 private students from Cambodia. (2) My Department has been informed by the Department of Education that Uving aUowances were provided from the special fund during 1975 to 134 students, amounting to $ 191,591. In 1976 allowances were paid to 87 students and to the end of October these amounted to $ 104,055. It is estimated that payments will amount to S130,069 for the full calendaryear 1976. (3) 32.

A further 151 are continuing their studies and hold temporary entry permits. The individual situation of the remaining 140 students is not currently known, but none of them has been required to leave Australia and any student who has left would have done so from choice. Trade Practices: Film Industry Mr Jacobi asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Does the Government propose to introduce legislation to implement any of the recommendations of the Tariff Board, as it then was, contained in its report on motion ture films and television programs. (2) Does the Government propose to introduce - to regulate the presentrestrictiveagreements existing in the film industry in Australia, and more particularly: (a) legislation to break ties panies and motion that between Cinema International Corporation Pty Ltd and the Greater Union Organisation, between Hoyts Theatres Ltd and 20th Century Fox FUm Corporation, United Artists and Columbia Pictures, (b) legislation guaranteeing access tofirstreleasefilmsto independent and smaU exhibitors and (c) legislation to establish a marketing board to distribute aU importedfilmsso that independent country theatres and city exhibitors will be able to obtain films on favourable terms, avaUable only to the large exhibitors such as the Greater Union Organisation, Hoyts Theatres and Village Theatres.",133
272,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TABLE A,"The answer to the (Question No. 1364) honourable member's question is as follows: 1 shouldremindthe honourable member that it was on of a previous Liberal/National Country Party Government that the reference on motion picturefilmsand television programs was made to the Tariff Board in March 1972. In Opposition we supported the implementation of the report's main recommendations incorporated in the Australian FUm Commission Act 1975. This Government has recently, in Une with the report, sought to achieve further rationalisation through changes incorporated under the Australian Film Commission Amendment Act 1976. (2) (a) The Trade Practices Act 1974 is designed to regulaterestrictiveagreements and practices regardless of the industry in which they occur. AppUcations under that Act were made on behalf of the members of the Motion Picture Distributors Association of Australia to the Trade Practices Commission for clearance (and, in one instance, authorisation) of certain agreements between the members thereof, which agreements regulated the terms and conditions upon which films were to be made avaUable to exhibitors. On 29 June 1976, a member of the Trade Practices Commission, acting under delegation, denied clearance in respect of each of the agreements on the grounds that each agreement had, or was likely to have, a significant effect on competition between the parties to the agreement, or, on competition between those parties or any of them and other persons. to in part (1) above, 203 have As aresultof that decision, each of the agreements was abandoned by the parties and the authorisation appUcation was withdrawn by the appUcant. I am informed that the Trade Practices Commission is keeping the practices of companies within thefilmindustry under review.

This represents a four-fold increase in Australian aid as compared with the preceding three years.' The Queensland Premier may have been referring to this commitment. National Health Scheme Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) How many taxpayers elected to pay the 2.S per cent Medibank levy charge. (2) How many have joined Medibank Private in any of its benefits scales. (3) How many taxpayers elected to join private medical and hospital benefits funds. (4) What is the present membership of private hospital and medical benefits funds.",135
275,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The specific number of taxpayers who pay the 2.5% levy will be information which can only be provided by the Taxation Office and I understand it will be some time before this information is available. persons who pay the levy or are exempt from the levy and are covered by Standard Medibank, such persons are not required toregisterwith the Health Insurance and accordingly the number of these persons could only be calculated when the number of privately insured persons is known. This information will not be available from the funds until early 1977. (2) In keeping with the competitive nature of the piivate health insurance industry, the Health does not intend toreleasedetails advance of its competitors as such action may be inimical its interests. I support this view completely. All registered organisations are required to submit details of their auons to my Department each year. This information sequently published in an annual report entitled 'Operations of the Registered Medical and Hospital Benefits Organisseeking ations'. This report will include membership information.

Lycine in Food Aid Program Mr Short asked the Minister for Foreign provided Affairs: (1) Is lycine a valuable amino acid in the context Australia's food aid program? (2) Is the unit cost of providing lycine through meat protein less than that through wheat protein? (3) Is it practicable and/or desirable for Australia to provide more of its food aid in the form of canned beef luncheon meat? (4) If so, will the Government examine increasing its food aid going through the World Food Program in the form of canned meat, as a proportion of Australia's total food aid program?  member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No. (3) This is a matter for judgment bearing in ming the nutritional value and cost of canned meat as compared with (Question No. 1580) other foodstuffs and the expressed needs of recipient countries. Australia has recently given a total of $450,000 worth of canned meat to Lebanon and Cyprus to help these countries meet emergency food needs. The Australian Development Assistance Agency will continue to seek appropriate opportunities to use processed meat in nutritional and developmental programs in developing countries. (4) Australia includes canned meat in the list of commodities which it is willing to supply to the World Food Program as pan of our commodities pledge. Moreover Australian representatives in Rome have stressed to the World Food Program that we are anxious to see the use of Australian canned meat increased. However, the World Food Program has pointed out that there are serious difficulties in the way of using more canned meat in its nutritional programs, including its high cost and the fact that it is not a typical food commodity in developing countries which gives nse to problems of acceptability.

Agricultural Exports (Question No. 1624) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Overseas the desirability of Trade, upon nodce: What information does his Depanment possess on United States Domestic International Sales Corporations engaged in agricultural exports which are competing with Australian agricultural products.",136
277,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the member's question is as follows: Following is an outline of the DISC operations. For obvious reasons on individual DISC transactions in the agricultural field. The United States Domestic International Sales Corporations (DISC) legislation was passed Revenue Act of 1971 with the objective of increasing US. exports and improving its balance of payments by placing US. exporters on a' more equal tax footing with their foreign competitors'. DISCs are legal accounting quire ownership of export property from parent or affiliated companies and then sell the property abroad. To qualify as a DISC, a United States corporation must meet certain requirements, e.g. that it be a US. domestic corporation, that 93 per cent of the corporation's gross receipts for each taxable year consist of'qualified export receipts' and that cent of the corporation's assets at the close of the year be 'qualified export assets'. There are special intercompany pricing rules governing the allocation of export sales income between a parent company and the related fessional DISC. A DISC is not subject to on its current or retained export earnings, with the qualification that one half of the earnings shareholders of the DISC and is taxable to those shareholders as a dividend. It has been estimated that there DISCs in existence and that about 70 per cent of total US. exports in 1975 were traded through them. The latest figuresZealand available show that in the accounting 1973 to 30 June 1974 tax deferred on SUS3.1 billion of income earned by DISCs amounted to $US756m. The larthan gest product categories of exports handled by DISCs are in sidising the agricultural, chemical, machinery and equipment areas. Exports of agricultural products traded by DISCs are given under two main categories, viz. (i) grain/soybeans other agricultural products. In the latest available year (1974) DISC exports of grain/soybeans comprised 94 per cent of total US. grain/soybeans expons. DISC expons of other agricultural products comprised 46 per cent US. expons of these products. The DISC scheme was challenged in the General AgreeProduct ment on Tariffs and Trade on its introduction on the grounds (and manufacturer that it constituted an expon subsidy and was in breach of or agent) US. obligations under the GATT. A GATT Panel of experts appointed to examine complaints about the DISC reported on 2 November 1976 that there was a prima nullification or impairment of benefits which other GATT member countries were entitled to expect under the General Agreement. The Panel's report is expected of bilateral discussions with the United States as well as funher discussions in the GATT itself. The Australian Government is watching developments closely to ensure that operative Limited) Australian trade interests are safeguarded distorting effects of DISC.

280,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The repon on vinyl chloride monomer levels in vegetable oils to which the honourable member refers was pan of a continuous monitoring program by the Food Standards Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council. I have provided to the ParUamentary Library copies of a summary of the repon excluding brand names and individual analyses. Following the release of the results to the Plastics Institute Mr of Australia the plastics industry additional information regarding the date of manufacture of the 52 bottles that exceeded the NH and ommended maximum level of 0.05 mg of vinyl chloride monomer per kilogram of contained food. (a) 37 were known to be made in Australia prior to the announcement of the latest NH and MRC guideUnes. (b) 11 were known to be made in Australia but detaUs of date of manufacture were not traceable. (c) 4 were of overseas origin. From this information it is clear that a maximum of 11 bottles out of 575 samples could have been manufactured Australia after the latest NH and MRCrecommended levels. In addition, a number of State Departments of Health and the Plastics Institute of Australia have carried out monitoring programs parallel to the study referred to above and these surveys have shown the number of samples exceeding the NH and MRC recommended levels is now extremely low. (Question No. 1679) I would stress that there is no evidence of toxicity from of the trace amounts of vinyl chloride monomer (vcm) found in food. The only evidence of toxicity has occuned in the inhalation of vcm in extremely large quantiat ties over extended periods of time. The maximum levels recommended by the NH and MRC were based on the minimum levels attainable by the plastics industry by strict long for a adherence to good manufacturing practice. of This matter will be maintained under continualreviewby the Food Standards Committee of the NH and MRC in the Ught of further data on vcm and refinements in the plastics industry.

(2) Has the Minister issued any instructions to the Director-General on this matter. (3) If so, on what date did the Minister issue the instructions. (4) What was the text of the instructions.",138
281,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's quesuon: (1) Section 107 of the Social Services Act provides in effect that in order to qualify for unemployment benefit a person must satisfy the Director-General of Social Services that he is: (a) unemployed; (b) capable and willing to undertake suitable work; and (c) has taken reasonable steps to obtain such work. (2)-(4 ) The Government's policy on this matter was announced by my colleague, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, in the House on 23 March 1976Hansard pages 869-872. Lebanese Immigrants Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs upon nouce: (1) With reference to the interim report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on its inquiry into the Lebanon Crisis, and the quoted figure of 1835 Lebanese arrivals during the nine months ended 30 September 1976, were the figures, as quoted by the Committee, correct. (2) Were they the latest figures that he had provided to the Committee. (3) Is it a fact that Lebanese migration of 1496 in 1975 was about half the pre-warfiguresof 3178 arrivals in 1974. (4) Is it also a fact that the 1976 figures of actual arrivals is unlikely to exceed the pre-war figures quoted in part (3). (5) Are figures of arrivals always substantially lower than visas issued and, therefore, figures of visas issued by him are not a clear indication of the true picture. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 1976 statistics given for permanent arrivals showing last country of residence as Lebanon were preliminary figures issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Final figures are now available for the period January to June 1976. These are: January, 82; February, 196; March, 164; April, 104; May 124 (c.f. 123 preliminary); June, 164 (tf. 167 preUminary). The statistics for July (325), August (256) and September (418) were also based on incomplete data and final figures are not yet avaUable. Accordingly 834 persons arrived in the period between January and June 1976 and this figure (Question No. 1729) together with the preUminary statistics until September 1976 gives a total of 1833. (2) Yes. Subsequently preliminaryfiguresfor arrivals for October 1976 have beenreceived.They show that 767 persons from the Lebanon arrived in October. (3) Yes. But it needs to be recognised that the 1975 arrival figures were affected by: the introducuon of occupationalrequirementsin October 1974, problems associated with consideration and processing of appUcations during 1975 due to the conditions in the Lebanon. (4) No. PreUminaryfiguresindicate arrivals to the end of October 1976 to be 2600. If arrivals at the present rate of some 800 per month continue, the total for 1976 will be well in excess of the 1974 figure. (5) It is correct that not all persons granted visas decide to migrate and it is possible that, if conditionsremainstable in the Lebanon, some persons granted visas may decide not to migrate. The actual issue of visas, however, is specific evidence of the Government's wUlingness to admit the persons concerned to Australia. Whether the persons approved actually travel is a decision for them but the opportunity has been offered and can be availed of, if desired. Immigration Offices Overseas (Question No. 884) Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs: (1) How many (a) Australia-based and (b) locallyengaged persons are employed in each of his Department's overseas offices. (Question No. 1735) (2) How many persons made inquiries at each office in 1975-76. (3) How many persons migrated from the area for which each office isresponsiblein 1975-76.

(b) The Commonwealth Development Bank provides finance for the establishment or development of undertakings providing accommodation or transportation for tourists or other facilities designed to attract tourists. The loans ate directed towards assisting smaller undertakings away from main assisting population. (c) Section 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides that any expense necessarily incurred in the gaining or producing of assessable income shall be an allowable deduction private or capital nature. Additionally, this Government has introduced a 40 per cent investment allowance for eligible plant and equipment on site or ready for installation from 1 January 1976 and up to 30 June 1978. In each of the 5 years following 1977-78 the allowance will be at the rate of 20 per cent per annum. A unit of does not attract the allowance. (d) People from other countries are encouraged to travel to and within Australia by the Australian Tourist Commission. The Commission has an appropriation of $3m for this purpose in 1976-77.

284,Mr HOWARD,CANBERRA THEATRE PRESENTATIONS,"The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Government is currently considering an advanced draft of the White Paper on Manufacturing Industiy. (2) The Government hopes soon to be in a position make an announcement on specific timing for the presengrammes, tation of the White Paper to Parliament. Australian Industry Development Corporation in Mr O'Keefe asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Have a number of projects assisted by the Australian Industry Development Corporation experienced problems and several made bankrupt. (2) If so, how many assistedfirmshave gone into liquidation, and what was the amount of the loss to the Australian Government. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Industry Development Corporation has provided the following advice: (1) A number of projects for which AIDC has provided fUnds have experiencedfinancialdifficulties. (2) No such companies have gone into liquidation and no loss has been sustained by the Government. Alleged Radio Attacks on Ethnic Communities (Question No. 1537) provided it is not an expense of a Dr Klugman Asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs: (1) Has his attention been drawn to allegations that some so called 'access', 'ethnic' and 'community' radio stations, especially in Melbourne, have made veiy provacative attacks on other ethnic communities. property which costs $500 or less (2) Is it a fact that transcripts are impossible to obtain. (3) WUl he ask the Commissioner for Commissioner Relations to investigate and repon on these aUegations. Mr Mackellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There have been allegations concerning attacks on ethnic communities in broadcasts on some radio programmes. Some of the allegations have related to radio broadcasts in Melbourne. However, it is not clear which allegations are referred to and the question is not sufficiently specific to enable a definite reply to be given. Melbourne stations which have been mentioned in this connection at one time or another have been 3EA, 3ZZ and 3CR. As the honourable member will be aware, 3EA is an 'ethnic' broadcasting station operated at present under the control of the Department of Post and Telecommunications. (Question No. 1466) 3ZZ is an 'access' station operated by the Australian BroadCommission; 3CR is a 'community' stauon operated by the Community Radio Federation Ltd. The Government believes that ethnic broadcasting should be a means of developing harmony and understanding between and within ethnic communities. Accordingly, in its decision of 9 September 1976, to place ethnic broadcasting on permanent basis, it adopted a set of criteria for the new service, which included: 'Ethnic broadcasting should: assist in promoting mutual understanding and harmony between and within ethnic groups and between ethnic groups and the English-speaking community; avoid political partisanship;' (2) I understand that none of the three stations previously to mentioned automatically prepares transcripts of probut all three tape-record thenprogrammes as they are broadcast. In response to specific requests, tapes of particular programmes broadcast on 3EA have been provided the past. The ABC is able to do the same for 3ZZ. The (Question No. 1492) licencees of 3CR are under no obUgation to supply tapes. (3) If the Honourable Member cares to provide detaUs of the allegations to which he refers and the times, dates and stations concerned, they will certainly then be investigated financial by the appropriate authority. Immigration Staff at Overseas Posts (Question No. 1550) Mr E. G. Whitlam Asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs: Why is it taking him so long to answer Question No. 884 which I placed on notice on 17 August 1976 when his predecessor was able to give me an answer on 27 March 1969 (Hansard, page 1048) to the simUar question I placed on notice on 25 February 1969. Mr Mackellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Question 884 relates to staff at overseas posts. In 1969 at most posts locally engaged staff were by the Department of Immigration and simply task to provide an up-to-date report on numbers employed.

Summary Measure of the Budget (Question No. 1585) Mr Hurford asked the Treasurer, upon notice: staff from Foreign Affairs later (1) Does the ration of Budget outlays to gross domestic product, used as a summary measure of the Budget in Budget Statement No. 1 show either the contribution of Budget outlays to GDP or the impact of those outlays on the (Question No. 1556) economy. (2) If not, what alternative measures would more effectively reveal these relationships. (3) What have these measures been in each of the last 5 years. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The ratio of Budget outlays to gross domestic ptoduct, to whichreferenceis made m Statement No. 1, is not intended to show either the contribution of Budget outlays to GDP or the impact of those outlays on the economy. Rather it is one of several possible measures of the extent to which the Government, through the Budget, exercises command and influence over the disposition of the nation's goods and services. Thefiguresshow that the previous Government pre-empted a much larger proportion of the total than had been customary in the past; this increase had to be paid for of course and it was-by a combination of higher overall burdens of taxation and unprecedently high rates of inflation. The present Government is working towardsreversingthese trends. (2) and (3) The Government does not believe that any single summary measure can effectivelyrevealthe relationships mentioned in the question. What has to be considered is not only the total of Budget outlays, or the change in that total, but also the composition of those oudays, the (Question No. 1558) level and the composition of total revenues that make up the other side of the Budget, theresultantoveraU and domestic and the manner in which those deficits are to be financed. These and other aspects of the Commonwealth's Budget need to berelatedto the evolving economic situation and to the Government's overall economic strategy. No sumthe mary measures can satisfactorily encompass aU these aspects: a comprehensive analysis is called for.

The 1975-76 coUections, adjusted to an earnings basis (Le. to allow for the lag between instalments being deducted from earnings and remitted to the Taxadon Office), were estimated at $8,058.0m. The basefigurewas then increased in line with the assumed increases in average earnings (12 per cent) and employment (1.3 per cent to 1976-77 and the additional mcrease in yield consistent with the continued use of tax instalment schedules that reflected 1973-76 rates of tax. A further adjustment was made to convert this result from a month-of-earnings to a month-of-coUections basis, and the resulting gross collections, estimated at $ 10,230.0m, were reduced by the estimated effect in 1976-77 of the measures affecting gross PAYE collections that were announced in May. These adjustments involved the cost of indexation and the additional increase in the rebates for spouses and sole parents, estimated at $1,01 lm, the yield from the health insurance levy ($208) and the gain from the withdrawal of income tax rebates in respect of dependent children and students ($428m). Marketing of Uranium Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Nauonal Resources, upon nodce: (1) Is the world uranium producers' cartel, which was formed on the initiative of the Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation (RTZ), still in existence following the withdrawal of this company from the cartel earher this year. (2) Is the Uranium Institute, another group formed initiative of RTZ, still in existence; if so, does the Institute's charter specifically exclude price negotiations. (3) Which Australian companies are, or bers of these groups. (4) Are any Austrahan mining compames members of any other local or international uranium producers' associations; if so, what are these associations, and what is their main function. (3) Does the current United States of America inquiry into alleged uranium price fixing or other breaches of United States anti-trust laws relate to the activities of these organisations; if so, which organisations. (6) If not, what is the basis for charges which have been made in the United States against Australian uranium companies for alleged price fixing. (7) What marketing arrangements exist for the sale of uranium in (a) the Umted States, (b) the United Kingdom, (c) South Africa and (d) the rest of the world. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) , (5) and (6) It would vide information concerning matters which are, or may be, the subject of legal proceedings. In regard to the current legal proceedings in the United States of America, I refer the honourable Member to the facts set out in the recitals of the Orders made by the Attorney-General on 29 November 1976 under the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act 1976 (Australian Government Gazette No. S214 dated 29 November 1976). (2) The Uranium Institute was set up in June 1975 teen of the world's leading uranium producers. The head1972. quarters of the Uranium Institute are in London, United Kingdom, where it is incorporated as a limited company. The Articles of Association of the Uranium Institute were revised in January 1976 to admit consumers of uranium members. The Memorandum of Association of the Uranium Institute states that its objects are: (i) to promote the development of the use of uranium for peaceful purposes, in order to assist in safeguarding the future availability of world energy suppUes. (tf) to conduct research and to do investigations concerning the world's requirements of uramum, the world's uranium resources and the productive capacity of uranium producers. (Ui) to provide a forum for the exchange of information concerning the use of uranium for peaceful purposes, the world's requirements and resources of uranium, the productive capacity of uranium producers and aU matters connected therewith. (iv) to consult, for the purposes of its research or investigations, with Governments and with other agencies, organisations and entities. In addition, the Memorandum has always included the following statement: (Question No. 1051) 'The activities of the Institute shall not be such as will result in any agreement, understanding, combination or any other form of concerted action to Umit production, fix pnces, provide, receive or supply information regarding contracts, or interfere with commercial transactions, suppress competition or in any other manner restrain trade or commerce or to monopolise or attempt to monopolise trade or commerce.' on the (3) The Australian companies which are currently members of Uranium Institute are Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited, Noranda Australia limited, Pancontinental Mining Limited, Peko-Wallsend Limited and Westhave been, memern Mining Corporation Limited. (4) I am not aware of any Australian mining companies being members of any international uranium producers' associations. However, I am aware that some are members of the Australian Uranium Producers' Forum, the stated objectives of which are: (i) To act as a co-ordinating body for the Australian uranium industry as a whole in discussions with, or representations to, various Australian Government Depanments or Authorities concerned with the industry; (U) To co-ordinate the participation of member companies in any international organisations or forums for promoting the use of uranium for peaceful purposes; (Ui) Generally, to promote the development of a viable Australian uranium mining industry including research into uranium production, supply/demand and other statistical data on a world basis. not be appropriate for me to proThe companies which are members of the Forum are Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited Noranda Australia Limited, Pancontinental Mining Limited, Peko-WaUsend Limited, Queensland Mines Limited, and Western Mining Corporation Limited. (7) No marketing arrangements exist for the sale of Australian uranium overseas, other than arrangements being put in hand for the expon of uranium in respect of contracts the by sixmain terms of which were approved prior to December Apan from the measures announced on 11 November 1976 by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, the Government's attitude is that policy decisions in relation to the further development of the as Australian uranium industry will have to await the outcome of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. Working Womens Centre in Melbourne Mr Garrick asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that the Working Women's Centre in Melbourne may have to close its doors through lack of financial support. (2) Is it also a fact that received from the International Women's Year Advisoiy Committee, was insufficient for continued operation. (3) Is it considered that the work done by the Centre, for women of all occupations in the important areas of child care, equal pay and maternity leave, is of value. (4) Is it a fact that, at present, there is no other organisation capable of covering these and other related matters efficiently. (5) Did the 'Women's Bureau' of his Department undertake an evaluation of the Centre 3 months ago and has it, as yet, not come to him for a decision; be made. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I understand from representations me by the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations (ACSPA), which operates this Centre, that financial support has not been forthcoming in adequate amounts from Union sources to cover the on-going operinquiry ations of the Centre after the initial grant of $40,000, by the Commonwealth last year through the International Women's Year (IWY) Appropriation, has been exhausted. (2) The initial grant from the Commonwealth through the IWY Appropriation was provided to establish this Centre, and to cover the salaries of staff to run it in as well as to pay for equipment and other incidental costs incurred. IWY grants were not designed to pay for the going operations of a facility, such as the Working Women's Centre, beyond those costs incurred in its establishment. (3) It is difficult to assess the value of the work done this Centre in the areas of child care, equal pay nity leave. I understand the Centre has endeavoured to have Unions take up these, and other issues of concern to working notices women, and has also attempted to make working women Tubemakers more aware of such issues and to raise them with their inquiry into this Unions. (4) Many women's organisations have, for some years, been concerned with these and other related matters of conany cern to working women. In addition, there is the N.S.W. Limited Women's Trade Union Commission in Sydney, and the Gazette Queensland Women's Trade Union Committee, both of Gazette No. which also received Commonwealth funds made available through the IWY Appropriation, last year. More recently, a Workmg Women's Centre was established in Footscray in Melbourne with Commonwealth funds provided under the Australian Assistance Plan. There are also Working Women's Centres or Groups in Canberra, Newcasde, Adelaide and Perth. Further, within my own Department, the Women's Bureau, established first in 1963 as the Women's Section, concerned with undertaking research into, and providing policy advice on these, and a wide range of other matters, relating to women in employment. (5) When representations were originally made to me by Justice ACSPA requesting additional CommonwealthfinancialsupHigh port for this Centre, 1 said that, in thefirstinstance, I would ask my Department to examine its work and make a report to me. I added that the Women's Bureau of my Department would be associated with this examination. In the meantime, this examination has been completed and a report has been (Question No. 1394) forwarded to me. The question of further Commonwealthfinancialsupport for this Centre is currently under consideration by the Government, and a decision will be made as soon as possible. Sir Henry Bland the initial funding, which it (Question No. 1406) Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice: (1) Have the Industries Assistance Commission or the Prices Justification Tribunal sought information from or held inquiries into any of the companies of which Sir Henry Bland is deputy chairman or a director (Hansard, 20 October 1976, page 2076); if so, which companies. (2) If so, on what matters and dates did they seek information or hold inquiries. if so, when will a decision",154

295,Mr STEWART,TASMANIA,"the Treasurer, When does he intend to keep the promise made by the Prime Minister in the policy speech of the Liberal Party the 1975 election that the 'tax np-off would be stopped. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable tions member's question is as follows: In his pohcy speech for ter stated that 'We will put an end to Labor's taxrip-off.We will make a start towards this in next year's fully index personal income tax for inflauon over three years.' The honourable member will be aware that the Governmined ment has done much to honour that commitment in its first year in office. The 1976-77 Budget provided for the fuU and automatic indexation of personal 1 July 1976 at a cost to revenue currently estimated at $990 rnilhon for thisfinancialyear.

(2) The fact that there is a clearly stated policy inevitably results in many proposals not being submitted to the Government when they would be contrary to that policy, e.g., speculative investment inrealestate. Also, foreign investors will generally endeavour to frame their proposals in such a way that they fall within therequirementsset by the Government Furthermore, an important role of the Foreign overInvestment Review Board is to give guidance to foreign investors on those aspects of their proposals which may not conform with the government's foreign investment policy and suggest ways by which such proposals might be in order that they will do so; it is not possible to state with certainty how many proposals have been amended aresultof this aspect of the Board'srole.Government decisions on the proposalsreferredto in (I) above have been (a) 589 accepted, (b) 3rejected,(c) 16 other, including withdrawals.

(4) The 'guidelines for the operating in Australia' referred to in my 1 April 1976 statement are covered in the guidelines for multinational enterprises which form part of the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises made in June 1976 at the OECD Council Meeting at Ministerial Level.

(2) What have been the movements in these aggregates and in the savings ratio during each quarter of the last 5 years. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The saving ratio is the ratio of household saving to household disposable income. In the Australian national accounts the household sector includes all Australian resident persons, their unincorporated enterprises located in Australia and dwellings owned by persons, and non-profit organisations serving households cial enterprises sector. Household saving and disposable income are named in Tables 11 and 32,respectively,of the 1974-75 tion of Australian National Accounts and in Tables 14 15 of Quarterly Estimates of National Income and service. Expenditure. Although oftenreferredto 'saving ratio' is preferred for clarity. Saving of accumulating assets; savings more accuratelyrefersto the sum of accumulated assets. To facilitate analysis of quanerly saving ratio is calculated on a seasonally basis by dividing seasonally adjusted saving by seasonally adjusted household disposable income. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has not included in its publications seasonally adjusted series for household disposable income but has made available for research purposes a seasonally adjusted series which after funher development it would expect to include in publications. This developmental series is given in the answer to pan (2). Seasonally is derived as the difference between seasonally adjusted household disposable income and the published series for seasonally adjusted privatefinalconsumption expenditure. (2) The saving ratio and the culated are shown in the following table for each quaner of the last 5 years. The saving ratio, similarly calculated, can be found in Table 2 of Statement 2 attached to the Budget Speech 1976-77. Household saving, whether in the original or seasonally adjusted form, is derived as aresidualbetween two large gregates and consequently may be significantly affected relatively small variations or estimation deficiencies household disposable income and private final consumption expenditure.

This was answered by Mr Lynch on 7 September 1971 (Hansard page 899) indicating, in effect, that the information sought was too lengthy and complex to incorporate in Hansard] but that copies were available at the House of Representatives Table Office. I am informed this information is still available at the Table Office. Subsequently, Mr Cameron obtained leave to have incorporated further information the same time span, in the House of Representatives Hansard of 10 May 1972 (pages 2326-2334).

Investment Allowance: Hire Plant Finns Mr Young asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Why have businesses in the equipment rentalfieldbeen excluded from the benefits of the 40 per cent investment allowance purportedly designed to encourage investment in new equipment Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The investment allowance, which provides a strong encouragement to business to re-equip and expand by investing in new productive plant, is designed to assist become more efficient and productive, level of activity in the economy and creating more job opportunities. It seeks to achieve this by reducing the cost of investing new business plant and, consistent rected to the actual productive user of plant, whether an owner-user, hire purchaser or a long term lessee. To extend the allowance to plant owned by hire firms would change the underlying concept of the investment lowance because the benefits of the owner of hired plant and not the productive user who, as a short term hirer, could not be treated as new plant. Further, the allowance would be available for plant used other than wholly for business purposes. In effect, a subsidy would be made available through for plant and equipment which could be used by casual or short term hirers for private, domestic or pleasure purposes. of children in respect of School Leavers: Employment (Question No. 1385) However, on a very broad esMr Les MCMahon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice: (1) How many (a) male and (b) female students in Forms 4,5 and 6 in New South Wales schools will be leaving school at the end of 1976. (2) How many of them are expected to (a) go into the work force and (b) further their education. (3) How many of those entering the workforce are expected to go on to unemployment benefits, and when will the payment of those benefits commence.",184
328,Mr VINER,SOURCES,"The Minister for Education has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) On the basis of past experience about 84 000 students (Question No. 1333) are projected to leave school in New South Wales in the period August 1976 to August 1977, of which about 80 per cent or 68000 are likely to leave in November and December 1976. Ofthe 68 000 about 56 000 (29 000 males and 27 000 females) would be students in forms 4,5 and 6 in 1976. (2 ) On the basis of Australia-wide estimates on the destinations of all school leavers it is projected that approximately 62 000 of the 84 000 school leavers in New South Wales in the period August 1976 to August 1977 are likely to enter the labour force directly. The remaining 22 000 are projected to be 'not in the labour force' in 1977 with the very large majority of these being engaged in full-time postsecondary study. It is known that most of those engaged in full-time post-secondary study would be leavers from Form 6 but estimates of the destinations of school leavers by form are not available. (Question No. 1359) (3) The Depanment of Social Security advises that it cannot be anticipated how many school leavers entering the labour force are expected to be granted unemployment benefits.

(2) Is there one proposal whereby a doctor who qualifies as a primary producer for taxation purposes can deposit $50,000 in income equalisation deposits and, if he is on the maximum tax rate, save $32,500 in tax, withdraw the deposit after he retires, and pay tax at a drastically reduced rate. If so, is this possible. (3) If it is possible, what steps will he take to prevent the abuse of this valuable scheme which was introduced to assist fanners withfluctuatingincomes. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am not aware of advice along the lines suggested in the question being given to medical practitioners, but doctors who carry on in Australia a business of primary production and are, accordingly, primary producers in terms of the income tax law will, along with mil time primary producers, be able to claim tax deduction primary production receipts in a year ofincome in respect of amounts placed on deposit under the income equalisation deposits scheme in relation to that year of income. The deduction may not exceed the amount that would ordinarily be the taxable income from sources other than propeny. (2) A taxpayer with a taxable income, after the allowance of deductions for income equalisation deposits, that is greater than $25,000 in 1975-76, or $28,250 in 1976-77, would save tax of 65 cents for each doUar of the deposits that was aUowed as a tax deduction. It is thus possible that tax of $32,500 could be saved from a deposit of $50,000 but this could occur in one year only if the gross receipts from primary production for the year were $125,000 or more. If a doctor who was also a primary producer were to withdraw amounts deposited following retirement from medical practice, the rate at which the amounts would bear tax would largely be governed by the level of taxable income in the year the amounts were withdrawn. A person who had amounts of this order on deposit may well continue to receive a substantial income from investments and from primary production activities following retirement from medical practice. In this event the amount of the deposits withdrawn may still attract tax at (3) While the situation envisaged in the question may be unlikely to arise in practice, the operation of the income equalisation deposits scheme will be kept under review.

Whitlam asked the Minister Assistpany's ing the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters, upon notice: What were the subsequent substantial mentioned in his answer to my Question No. 872 (2) (Hansard, 9 November 1976, page 2504). Mr Street-The Public Service Board has provided the following information for answer to the honourable member's question: Following the absorption of elements of the former Department of the Media by the Departments of Administrative Services and Postal and Telecommunications, rationalisation of activities in those departments resulted in the abohtion of 62 positions. Steel: Cost of Production Mr Jacobi asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) WUl he set up a Royal Commission to investigate the cost of steel production in Australia in view of the inability Australia's only steel producer, contain its production costs, as is evidenced by submissions has made to the Prices Justification Tribunal and the sation Industries Assistance Commission. (2) Has the price of steel in Australia mcreased rate than for other industrialised countries, and is this adversely affecting the price of consumer products within Australia as well as the prices of our exported manufactured goods. (3) Can he say whether BHP has been increasing its dom(Question No. 1643) estic steel prices in order to be able to seU steel on world markets at a substantial discount. (4) WUl he also authorise an inquiry into the accounting to the procedures employed by BHP to ascertain whether proare being used to disguise the fact that Australian users of BHP steel are subsidising BHP's exports of steel, and whether BHP is asking public assistance to maintain its steel operations so that the company can divert its funds into new investment in the mining industry.",193
338,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,EMPLOYED IN THE ELECTORATE OF EVANS AT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Such a royal commission would substantially dupUcate the work of the Industries Assistance Commission and the Prices Justification Tribunal. (2) A comparison of international steel prices submitted by BHP to the IAC iron and steel inquiry shows that between 1966 and 1976 the rate of price increases of BHP products (measured in terns of Australian dollars) was greater than that of Australia's major steel trading competitors. This the generally faster growth in Australia's cost structure and, in particular in wage costs since 1972, and also to some extent the economies gained by certain overseas producers, particularly in Japan, from the installation of new, larger scale plants. These increases in steel prices have the prices of domestic consumer goods and exported susproducts to some extent. Steel prices are, however, only a segment of total manufacturing costs, which also reflect the very large increases in labour costs since 1972. (3) There is no evidence that BHP has been increasing its domestic steel prices in order to be able to export at a subMedia stantial discount. All price increases since 1973 have been (Question No. 1645) subject to scrutiny by the Prices Justification Tribunal and this includes a check that an equitable share of the comproduction costs is allocated to its steel exports.

339,Mr HUNT,EMPLOYED IN THE ELECTORATE OF EVANS AT,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Workers' compensation and third party insurance premiums are determined on a differential basis. Increases in workers' compensation premiums may vary according to the nature of the industry and, for third party insurance, according to such factors as class of vehicle and area classification. Details of increases since able in my Depanment.

(2) If so, does this mean that those students who, during their 2 years self-support, spent some of that period travelling on the money so earned, will no longer be considered eUgible. (3) If so, is the Government (a) denying certain people the right to take a hoUday or broaden their outlook by travel and (b) discriminating against the very people it purports to support, those with initiative and a wUlingness to work hard, who are being denied therightto enjoy the fruits of their hard work without jeopardising their educational prospects.",194
340,Mr VINER,EMPLOYED IN THE ELECTORATE OF EVANS AT,"The Minister for Educauon has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Periods of paid leave from employment whether spent travelling or studying or undertaking any other activity will count towards the 2-year requirement. Any period not spent in employment or on paid leave will not be counted. Thus, students who travel whilst living off savings may not count such periods towards their claim for establishing independence.

Mr Street-The Public Service Board has provided the following information for answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Various forms of flexible working hours are in operation in the general area of Commonwealth employment, but statistics are not centrally held. The extent to which flexible working hours may be worked in each Commonwealth Department or Authority depends upon their operating requirements. Where flexible working hours schemes have been introduced staff members respond in different ways in varying their patterns of attendance, but observing the constraints of departmental operating efficiency. (2) The Public Service Board recently issued a Report on Independent Status Departmental Evaluations of Flexible Working Hours. This report did not cover the totaUty of Commonwealth employ(Question No. 1695) ment but only departments staffed under the PubUc Service Act. There is no informadon avaUable on the number of full days taken underflexiblehours schemes. The Report indicated, however, that data gathered by 4 departments showed that approximately 80 per cent of officers eUgible to participate inflexiblehours schemes took advantage of'core time' off for at least one half day during a 3 month period. Core time is that period of the day when staff are usually required to be in attendance. (3) The Board is not aware of any lack of proper supervision offlexiblehours arrangements so far as departments are concerned. The Report mentioned above noted that manual recording of attendance was viewed by most departments as operating satisfactorily. However, it was also noted thatflexibleworking hours schemes require careful oversight by management. With this in mind the Board is continuing to oversee the operation of schemes in depanments and will draw to the attention of depanmental managements any deficiencies that may become apparent The Board's Report on Departmental Evaluations of Flexible Working Hours is available in the ParUamentary Library.
