2,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The other day the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr . Page) asked some questions regarding the cost of recruiting in the several States. I promised to get the information, and to make it available as soon as possible, and I now lay on the table a statement showing the details of expenditure on recruiting for the period from the 1st January, 1917, to the 30th June, 1917. The figures relating to the 3rd Military District differ slightly from those given in answer to a question by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Heitmann), but the cost per recruit for each of the States is unaffected. Paper laid on the table. TASMANIAN COMMUNICATIONS.",20
3,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I received this morning the following telegram from the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Hobart: Last steamer leaving Hobart for Sydney, Moeraki, 11th August. 150,000 caeca apples awaiting shipment, in cool store and growers' hands; also usual weekly exports, including 20,000 cases preserves. Only' ten days' supply of coal on hand for gas. No sugar, other foodstuffs. Can the Primo Minister Bay whether a steamer will be put on the Hobart to Sydney service shortly to relieve this rather serious situation)",20

5,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I ask the Honorary Minister if communications from Darwin are being censored, mutilated, and in many cases slopped altogether! Tho Department for Home and Territories throws all the responsibility in this matter on the Defence Department. For a week 1I have been expecting communications from Darwin, and have received nothing. I ask the Honorary Minister if communications from Darwin to myself have been censored and stopped, or prevented .from reaching me in the ordinary course t",20
6,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I know nothing about the matter, and can only promise to make inquiries. PERSONA LEXPLANATION .",20
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I wish to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) is reported to have said last Friday, referring to contracts between the Government and certain firms engagod in the manufacture of wool topsThe Government ought to lay the list of shareholders on the table.' Surely there IB nothing to conceal.",20
8,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister making a personal explanation ! If so, I ask in what way he has been misrepre1 sented ?",20
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman has not proceeded far enough to enable me to answer the question.,20
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have frequently explained that the list referred i o was handed ho the Wool Committee confidentially, and is regarded by the Committee and the Government as in the same category as returns under the Income Tax Act and other statements made under the seal of confidence.",20
11,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, do you regard this as a personal explanation t",20
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I understand that the Prime Minister desires to remove a misapprehension regarding a statement that has been made, or to more full y explain some matter upon which informs-- tion has been sought.",21
13,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I rose to make a personal explanation regarding the insinuation of the honourable member for Capricornia that the Government was acting improperly in this matter. He is reported in Hansard i o have interjected, when the Minister for the Navy was speakingI do not think that many members of the Government do know anything about it, meaning the transaction to which I have referred. I submit t h a i I am as much entitled as any other member to make a personal explanation in regard to a matter in which I have been misrepresented during my absence. I also ask permission to make a personal explanation regarding some observations of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), who, speaking of replies furnished by me earlier in the day, in answer to a. question about food returns, said I asked for returns, and there waa a general Impression that full information would he ""given; but when a question was asked, it was laughed off with a statement of the number of sheep, tons of sugar, and bushels of wheat in store He (the Prime said that the returns arrived too late. That is a reflection on omcers engaged in important duties. . I have obtained a report from the Department in which it is stated thatAt the beginning of July, 1915, a monthly census was taken of the food supplies in Aust r a l i a . StockB in hand of the following commodities were ascertained:-Beef , mutton,' lamb, bacon and ham, rabbits, sugar, molasses, cheese, butter, jam, tinned fish, condensed milk, rice. I did not deal with a ll the commodities mentioned, but only with so many as I had at my fingers' ends at the momentThese Teturns came to hand from month to month until January of this year. The information contained in the replies was tabulated, and was generally available about a month, sometimes longer, after the date up to which the return was prepared. In answering the questions of tihe honourable member for Maribyrnong, I merely stated the facts, and he should have accepted my statement. He may be of opinion that the practice of making these returns should be continued, but that is another matter. I told him that the Government were considering the question. We are doing so.",21
14,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation, since the Prime Minister has endeavoured, perhaps unintentionally, to show that I have done something which is not quite regular. The questions I have asked in regard to the Colonial Wool Combing and Weaving Company and its list of shareholders are the outcome of a report that a member of the Central Wool Committee, is largely interested, financially, in the arrangement by which the Government and the Colonial Wool Combing and Weaving Company share certain profits. I have endeavoured to obtain the list of shareholders. When. I asked the Prime Minister for i the replied that the information was not available, but that I could obtain it at the Registrar's Office, Sydney. Search was made at that office, but the share list was not available. I then drew the. attention of the Prime Minister to a clause in the agreement), which provides that the company shall furnish the Government with a list of shareholders and of the' shares held by them; but when I asked him for the list he replied, "" It is confidential."" The position is, therefore, that we cannot - obtain the share list at the Registrar's Office, Sydney, and the Government will not supply UB with a copy. If they would do so we should then know to what extent Minister) the member of the Central Wool Committee to whom I have referred is in terested in the agreement. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is not a fact that a member of the Central Wool Committee is largely interested in the agreement ?",21
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member will not be in order in putting a question to the Prime Minister in the course of a personal explanation.,21
16,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I also desire to make a personal explanation. The reply which the Prime Minister gave to my question was such as to suggest to me that he-was indulging in one of his well-known efforts to put off, by means of a joke, the answering of my inquiry. I thought he treated me in a rather cavalier fashion.",21
17,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I gave the honourable member a very full answer.,21
18,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"It was, I think , a little overdone. The righ t honourable gentleman said that one reason why these monthly reports were not now forthcoming was that they were often so late in being furnished as to be of no real value. In referring to that answer on the motion for the adjournment of the House on F r i day, I said that it was either a reflection on the officers called upon to make such returns or it proved the inefficiency of the Government. Other returns are provided in a few days, and, that being so, I should like to know why we cannot obtain equally prompt returns in regard - to so important a matter as the supply of foodstuffs.",21
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order . The honourable member is now going beyond the making of a personal explanation. INDUSTRIAL UNREST. NOBTH QUEENSLAND RAILWAY STRIKE.,22
20,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria have exercised upon him any moral suasion to prevent his intervening to bring about a quietening of the industrial unrest which at present exists?,22
21,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"This seems to me to be a most extraordinary question, and one that should not properly be asked. I shall, however, answer it . My answer is. "" No . Most emphatically, No ! """,22
22,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister lay on the table of the House the correspondence that has passed between him and the Premier of Queensland, and any other persons in regard to the industrial dispute on the railways in Northern Queensland?",22
23,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"There has been no correspondence other than telegrams, all of which have appeared in the press. NA RUMOURED ACTION OF NAVAL BOARD.  put to the Minister for the Navy in regard to a fire which occurred on board a ship at Port Adelaide. Rumour has that when the fire brigade reached the wharf to assist in putting out the flames the Naval Board authorities insisted on the firemen showing their authority before they went on board the vessel. ask the Minister whether red-tape existe to such an extent in his Department, and, if so, whether he will take action to gpt rid of it?",22
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIRE ON BOAR DSHIPAT,"I know nothing about the matter, but shall cause in quiries to be made. AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL PORCE. RECENT DECORATIONS-SPECIA LLEAVE .",22
25,Mr BRENNAN,FIRE ON BOAR DSHIPAT,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence be good enough to supply the House with the comparative numbers of officers and privates upon whom decorations and distinctions of various kinds have been conferred, as disclosed in the most recent list published; and whether he has any comment to make upon the fact that in the very long list published in this morning's issue of the Age, extending over two columns, there does not appear the name of one private ?",22
26,Mr GROOM,FIRE ON BOAR DSHIPAT,"If the honourable member will furnis h me with a copy of hia question, I shall have inquiries made with regard to the matter. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), on 29th instant, put to me a question with regard to week-end leave, and I promised to have inquiries made. I am now in a position to furnish him with the following reply:The following instructions with regard to special leave for members of the Imperial Forces were recently sent out:"" (1) Cases have come under notice of men in the Australian Imperial Force Camps, whose homes are in the country districts, and who sometimes find that their business or family affairs necessitate their return for a few days. "" (2) In such cases, applications will be submitted to the Camp Commandants, who may, if the circumstances justify, grant such special leave, without pay. "" (3) Camp Commandants 'will personally deal with all such applications, and carefully consider the circumstances of each case. ""(4) This leave should preferably be given so as to include a week-end, in order that the soldier is absent from his training for as short a period as possible."" ADELAIDE. It was pointed out that it was only intended that additional leave should be granted in cases where it can be shown that business or family affairs necessitate such urgent additional leave, and not to allow men in Camps additional leave in order to visit their homes at week-ends. The training of the troops would seriously suffer if it men were allowed such leave indiscriminately. PAPERS.

28,Mr HUGHES,FIRE ON BOAR DSHIPAT,"As this is an urgent matter, or might become so, I shall make inquiries before this man's rights can beand come affected in regard to a pending action. I take it that the question is whether I consent i o the prosecution of an action ?",23

40,Mr FENTON,PROTECTION AGAINST,"'the Prime Minister, upon noticeWhen does he intend to carry into effect his promise to have members' questions and the answers thereto .printed, so as to save time in reading answers to questions?",24
41,Mr HUGHES,PROTECTION AGAINST,"It is not proposed to have the answers printed, but arrangements will be made for a copy of the answer to be handed to the member concerned. I shall make arrangements with Mr Speaker, and, with his permission, have this done at once. GERMAN TRADE. MARKS'.  the Prime Minister, upon notice I. What is the reason for revoking the suspension of the registration of German trade marks? 2. Why is it stated in the Commonwealth Gazette of 26th July, 1917, that the registration of German trade marks is to be ""avoided""? 3. What alteration in administration is made by the substitution of the word. "" avoided"" for the previously used word "" suspended "" ?",24
42,Mr HUGHES,PROTECTION AGAINST,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The suspension of enemy trade marks in favour of individuals was intended merely to assist local manufacturers who satisfied the Government that they could manufacture goods of substantially the same quality as those to which the trade marks had been applied, to place their goods on the market, and thus oust the enemy, article. It was intended that the suspension should not be operative indefinitely, but merely until the local manufacturers had an opportunity to introduce their goods to the public. Sufficient time having, in the view of the Government, been given for this purpose, the suspension was revoked. 2 and 3. The trade marks in question were avoided in order to abolish the rights given to the proprietors by registration and to permit public use of certain trade names. The suspension of a mark suspends the rights of the proprietor during the period of suspension; but those rights become fully operative on the expiration of that period. In addition, suspension makes the public use of the trade mark an offence. NA WORKERS. OBJECTIONS m ENGLAND .",24
43,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN MUNITIO N,"the Prime M in ister, upon noticeIn view of the fact that workers in England are objecting to Australians of military ferred ? age going to Britain as munition and other workers, while the British Government is still asking for Australians as munition workers, carpenters, artisans, and even as unskilled labourers, will the Prime Minister make inquiries as to whether or not the objection to Australian workers by English workers is serious f",24
44,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN MUNITIO N,"Seeing that the British Government accepted the offer of the Commonwealth Government to send munition workers to Britain, and in view of the fact that our representatives in the United Kingdom who look after matters affecting these workers have not informed . us of any objection io them on the grounds stated, the Government do not propose to take any action. NA INTERNATIONAL PEACE. ADDRESS BT MB . FXNLAYSOIT.",24
45,Mr SINCLAIR,SISTERHOOD OE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether his attention has been drawn to a programme issued by the Australian. Sisterhood of International Peace for the present half-year, embodying an item entitled ""Lay down your arms,"" by Bertha Von-Suttner, and an announcement of an address on "" selected subjects,"" "" probably by Mr W. F. Finlayson, M.H.R."" ? 2. Will he, in view of Mr Finlayson's public position, arrange to have a report taken of that gentleman's address, if given, and issue instructions for the prohibition of the item "" Lay down your arms "" in view of the present urgent need for the prosecution of the war?",24
46,Mr HUGHES,SISTERHOOD OE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No. 2. I understand reports are usually taken in such cases, but it is assumed that Mr Finlayson is unlikely to say anything on such an occasion that would give reason for action under the War Precautions Act. The item referred to is the title of a book published many years ago, written by an Austrian lady, to show that modern war was impossible and barbarous. Since its publication Austria, in collusion with Germany, has forced war on the world. ELECTROLYTIC SMELTERS. GERMAN INTERESTS.  . the Prime Minister, upon notice I.. Did the Public Trustee compel the German agent, Frank Snow, and the German, Sigfried Hirsch, to dispose of their interests in the electrolytic smelters? 2. If so, who bought the shares? 3.

Why are not the 15,400 shares held by the Deutsche Bank, in the Broken Hill prietary, amongst those listed to be sold on low:the 11th September?",24
47,Mr HUGHES,SISTERHOOD OE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1-4. The Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company, in August, 1915, adopted Articles of association giving it power to get rid of alien shareholders, and also preventing aliens from ever again becoming shareholders. Under these articles Hirsch was retired from the company, and the shares held by him were transferred to the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, on 10th September, 1915. The office of Public Trustee was not established t ill nearly twelve months later1st September, 1916. The moneys received held by the Comptroller-General of Customs under the Trading with the Enemy Act. By agreement the shares held by JF. Snow were sold to the same company on the same date. 5. The shares held by the Deutsche Bank are on the London Register. Those to be sold on the 11th inst. are all on the Australian Register. The matter of the sale of the shares on the London Register is the subject of representations to the British Government. NA STAFF: PAT.",25

53,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [3.29] - It will be rememin bered that last week we passed several 6d. clauses containing amendments submitted duty by the Government, the object being that honourable members might, on recommittal, have an opportunity to reconsider paid; those clauses as amended. I move That the Bill be now recommitted to a Comof the whole House for the reconsideraof clauses 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, and 16, and for the consideration of a new clause. I move this motion in accordance with pledges that I gave to honourable members when the Bill was in Committee. As a matter of fact, clauses 3, 4, 15, and 16 have not yet been considered by honourable members. The new clause proposed to be added w i ll give effect to a promise ' made that the principle of the arrangef o r ment between New Zealand and the I m perial Government should be adopted in Bill if it were found possible to do Camp so. The question was raised by the honman orable members for Plinders (Sir William to Irvine) and Kooyong (Sir Robert Best). Other clauses are - being recommitted for technical alterations, while others are to be reconsidered in accordance with promises made to honourable members.",25
54,Mr GREGORY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Did not Minister promise to recommit clause 31 'i,26
55,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"On clause 31, the honourable member for - Wide Ray (Mr. Corser) brought forward the request for extended time for payment of the tax. It was pointed out that it would be a heavy burden if the taxpayer was called upon to pay two assessments at the same time. However, I understand from the Treasurer that it is not proposed to collect the two taxes at the one time. On Friday afternoon we recommitted clause 31, and extended, in effect, the period of payment from thirty days to sixty days. As the Bill now stands, after notice of the assessment/ is given, sixty days, instead of thirt y days, are allowed for the payment before the liability to pay 10 per cent, extra is in curred.",26
56,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The promise was made that the question of payment of the tax in war bonds would be reconsidered.,26
57,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I promised to refer the matter to the Treasurer. He is very ill today; but he informs me that the Commonwealth are sellers, not buyers, of bonds. The taxpayer can sell his bonds, and pay the tax.",26
58,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I do not know how far it is open to discuss the principles of the Bill as it now stands upon this motion. There are certain matters in relation to the Bill as it ' now st ands which I would like to bring forward if it is open to discuss them - at this stage. The Bill has been reported from Committee, and the Honorary Minister has moved to recommit it . I wish to know whether it is open to me, on this motion, to discuss the measure in the condition in which it has been reported to you.",26
59,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL," The honourable member may discuss the proposal to recommit, but not the general principles of the Bill as a whole, or details of the separate clauses proposed to be recommitted.",26
60,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Does that mean that any honourable member can make a second reading speech on the Bill as it now stands ?,26
61,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I hardly think that the moving of this motion can be considered as an opportunity for a second reading debate; but honourable member^ are &t liberty to give brief reasons for moving for the recommittal of any particular clauses, without debating the the Honorary clauses themselves.",26
62,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I do not wish the House to be under any misapprehen- sion. My proposal was not to suggest new clauses. It was to discuss the principles of the Bill as it now stands. I recognise that, whatever liberty is granted to me must be accorded to every honourable member; and I wish to know whether, on this motion, I can discuss the principles of the Bill as it now stands, or whether I shall have to wait until the Committee stage is reached.",26
63,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"There will be a f u r ther opportunity for discussion at the final report stage. This motion is merely for the recommittal of certain clauses. The Committee has made certain proposals, and it is open to honourable members to deal with them; but a discussion on the Bill generally is not in order at this stage.",26
64,Mr ATKINSON,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Is it permissible, at this stage, to suggest - an amendment to a clause ?",26
65,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Tlia t can be done in. Committee.,26
66,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Henty) [3.37] - Will I be in order in moving that clause 31 be recommitted ?,26
67,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The honourable member will be in order in doing so.,26
68,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I would like the consent of the Government to the recommittal of clause 31. My desire is to have it altered so that people may pay their tax in war bonds. Some big co.mpanies have made provision for the payment of this tax by investing their money in war bonds; and if they are compelled to realise on these bonds, they may sustain a loss. In any case, they will be required to pay brokerage and other costs that - they should not be called upon to pay. In view' of the fact that many companies have made provision to pay the tax in war bonds, I move as an amendment That "" clause 31 "" be added to the motion.",26
69,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Capricornia) [3.40] -- I regret that the Government found it necessary to proceed with this Bill during an all-night sitting. F u l l and ample opportunity to discuss the measure should have been afforded honourable members. If I had had opportunity in reasonable hours, I should have suggested to the Government that clause 26, dealing with' the Board of Referees, should be recommitted. .No mention is made in the clause of the number of persons who shall con-/ stitute the Board. The Treasurer said that in his view the Board should comprise three members. I should like some information from the right honourable gentleman on that' point. In the meantime I move as an amendment That "" clause 26 "" be added to the motion.",26
70,Sir JOHN FOBREST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"This clause discussed for a long time in Committee. - Mr HIGGS - The discussion must have taken place in the early hours of the morning, when all respectable people were supposed to be ini bed.",27
71,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The point that nobody asked at that stage that the clause should be recommitted.,27
72,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The Treasurer should not say that the clause was discussed if nobody suggested that there should be an alteration in it .,27
73,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The honourable member  clause.,27
74,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"In my opinion, the number of members to constitute the Board of Referees should be stated in the Bill . Although the measure is so liberal that it is doubtful if anybody will be so dissatisfied with the ruling of the Commissioner as to desire to appeal to a Board of Referees, still, in order to do things decently we should specify how many members shall constitute the Board. If we are to have such appeals, there should be a tribunal in every capital city. Are people in Perth to be asked to come to Melbourne if they desire to appeal against the decision of the Deputy Commissioner in Western Australia ? If the Board is to consist of only three members, they will, I presume, be resident in Melbourne, and those persons in other States who have reason to find fault with the Deputy Commissioner will be greatly disadvantaged in having to come to Melbourne for the purpose of appealing. I would prefer' that there should be referees in each capital city, and that each Board should include at least one chartered accountant. Whilst our system of recruiting the Civil Service is very good, the accountancy methods in the Government employ are quite different from those adopted in commercial circles.  ence ?",27
75,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I should like to know how the honourable member, who is a squatter, could expect a Civil Service accountant to be able to audit his accounts, go through the various documents involved in the sale of stock, and to understand the discount that is given in each trade and profession.",27
76,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I rise to a point of order. I submit that the honourable member for Capricornia is entirely out of was order in discussing the merits of clause 26 on a motion to recommit that clause. I submit further that no amendment is allowable on a motion such as that which is now before the House. On page 468 of May, tenth edition, this p.assage ocis curs : It may be necessary to recommit a Bill to a Committee of the whole House, and occasionally to a Select Committee, before it is read a third time; and debate on this motion must be restricted to the purpose and extent of the proposed recommitment of the Bill. The purpose and extent of the recommittal are expressed in the motion of the Honorary Minister, and I submit that no debate is permissible on any other question.",27
77,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL," The passage in May read by the honourable member deals with the reference of a Bill to a Select Committee. What is now proposed has been frequently done, and is in accordance with the practice of the House. I ask the honourable member for Capricornia to confine himself as closely as possible to his amendment.",27
78,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I shall do so, but unless I can induce the House to recommit clause 26 I shall have no opportunity of speaking about the Board of Referees in Committee, and, therefore, I must offer a few arguments now in support of my contention that the number of the members of the Board should 'be fixed.",27
79,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"The honourable member will not be in order in making more than a general reference to the matter now,",27
80,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"The House evidently is not seized of the importance of this matter, and I , therefore, wish to show as briefly as I can that the Board ought to consist of more than three members. Otherwise, it will probably sit in Melbourne, and persons living in Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane, and other distant places, who may have occasion to appeal against the decision o&the Commissioner, w i ll have to come to Melbourne to have appeals heard, which would be a hardship. I cannot imagine that there will be such appeals, because the Bill is so liberal, and allows so many exemptions. But I have had complaints from business people who say, without in any way challenging the capacity or ability of the officers of the Taxation Department and the Treasury, that it is not possible, with the training that a man gets who starts in boyhood in the Public Service",27
81,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,This is a discussion which properly should take place in Committee. If I were to permit the honourable member to continue it might open up a debate on every important provision of the Bill .,28
82,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"May I put it to you, sir, that if this clause be not recommitted I shall, have no other opportunity of placing my arguments concerning the Board before honourable members?",28
83,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I cannot help that. The Bill has been reported from Committee, where an opportunity was afforded for the discussion of every clause of it . The Government now proposes its recommittal for the reconsideration of certain clauses. The honourable member is in order in moving for the reconsideration of other clauses, but he is not in order in debating the clause that he wishes to have reconsidered.",28
84,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I bow to your ruling, Bir, and hope that the perspicacity of honourable members will prove equal to the occasion.  think it is a pity that the number of the members of the Board of Referees has not been fixed in the Bill . I am the person who introduced this machinery, and it was in my mind that the Board should consist of three members.",28
85,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The honourable member is debating a provision of the Bill . Such debate at this stage is out of order.  order in giving reasons for fixing the number of the members of the Board ?,28
86,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The honourable member may not now discuss the clause which deals with that matter. The principles of the Bill were open for discussion during the second-reading debate and the various clauses in detail when the B i ll was in Committee.,28
87,Mr STORY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Boothby) [3.57] - I ask if the Government will consent to the reconsideration of clause 10. Yesterday I introduced to the Treasurer a gentleman interested in an Australian industry which may be injuriously affected by that clause, if it be not amended. That industry is typical of a number of new businesses. It must be the desire of the Government that - Australian industries shall'be established before the end of the war to enable Australian manufacturers to compete successfully then with their rivals abroad. An embargo has been placed upon the importation of motor-car bodies, arid a gentleman in .Australia has arranged to manufacture 5.000 of these bodies yearly. To do this he has been compelled to ask his bank for an advance of .£20,000 to cover the cost of putting down the necessary plant. The bank, however, asks, with some justification, will the security be sufficient if half the profits of the enterprise over and above a certain amount are taken under the war-time profits tax? The American motor manufacturers will not allow their agent's here to make a contract for a longer term than a year, so that immediately after the war they may be manufacturing their own motor bodies here. It is entirely with a view to assisting Australian manufacturers that I desire to amend clause 10, to give the Commissioner power, where he thinks that the tax would shut up a factory by preventing a manufacturer from successfully competing with outsiders, to make a concession.",28
88,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The Treasurer does not see his way to agree to the reconsideration of .the clause.,28
89,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Kooyong) [4.0]. - I support the request for the reconsideration of clause 10, which is probably one of ithe most important provisions of the Bill . It purports, under certain limited circumstances, to give a certain discretion and power to the Commissioner, and I ask that this power be extended. The discretion of the Commissioner is limited rigidly by the consideration that no modification shall be made unless the financial stability of a business is affected. What the financial stability of a taxpayer means I do not pretend to say.",28
90,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The discussion is irregular. No amendment for the reconsideration of clause 10 has been moved. It will simplify procedure to dispose of the two amendments already before the House before dealing with other proposals.,28
91,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Flinders) [ 4 . 2 ] - I understand the desire for the reconsideration of certain clauses, but I remind honourable members that there was something in the nature of. an agreeorary ment arrived at on the last occasion we sat.

The policy of the Commonwealth is to discourage the importation of certain articles, and to encourage their local manufacture. There is a possibility of this Bill doing material in j u r y to those who may enter upon the manufacture of certain goods.

99,Mr KELLY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Wentworth) [ 4 . 1 5 ] - I should like to ask you, MT . .Speaker, whether it would not be possible for the House to be placed in possession of the reasons that actuate this amendment.

100,Mr SPEAKER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I would point out that if I were to permit a general discusThere sion on eaoh of these proposals to recompower mit a clause, the whole Bill could in way be debated just by the simple process of going through, the form of moving amendment to recommit each clause an honourable member desired to debate. the motion for the second reading, honourable members were able to discuss the whole principles of the Bill ; and in Committee they were at liberty to discuss in detail the whole of the clauses. It would, therefore, be quite irregular this stage to permit a debate which would include a discussion covering all these various points.' If the House agrees to recommit the clause, there will be a still furthe r opportunity to discuss it in detail.",30

In Gommittee (Second Recommittal)': Clause 3 (Parts).",30
109,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Flinders) [4.34] - I desire to further appeal to the Governmenit ""to consider the whole question of. the pre-war standard. The more I look into this measure the more I am convinced of two things, the first of which is that it will not at all affect the majority of those whom it is tended to affect; that many companies, individuals, and firms who have, during - the years of the war made considerable profits in excess of those made before the war, will be called upou to pay nothing under this Bill . I shall show in a moment that l'he» measure will not reach tihe great companies which have made war' profits-that it) will not touch the shipping 'companies, which the community desire to tax, nor the big metal companies,, nor those companies with, huge stocks that have increased in value, and given rise to great! profits, but that the people who will really be affected are those in smaller classes of business, whose excess profits have not been made out of the war. Let me point out why this Bill will not tax the excess profits of, let ue say, shipping companies or soft goods warehousemen, whose stocks have increased in value, provided they are largecompanies or firms, or individuals whose profits as shareholders in companies have increased by large sums. The reason is that' they are er titled to deduct from their excess profits the whole of the income tax which tihey pay. Let me give a simple example. A firm which made a net income of £10,000 a year before the war-that is its normal pre-war income-make s a 50 per cent, increase during the taxing year. NOES. That is a largeincrease, thesort of in crease which it is intended to tax. Its' in come during the taxing period is thus £15,000, and every penny of it may be derived directly from the war through the increase in the valueof stocks or base metals, or through the increase in shipping freights. Yet, the firm which makes that increase willnob pay one penny in taxation under this Bill . It will be in exactly the same position as if the B i ll did not exist, because the amount it has to pay under the Federal income tax will be just about £5,000, and that £5,000 represents the excess income over the pre-war standard. Thus the man who mad* £10,000 before; the war, and is now making £.15,000, will, have .nothing to' pay 1 under tails Bill , but) the smaller man who has been engaged in developing his business, andmade perhaps £1,000 the year . before the war, and though he may not be in a business in which the value of his stock has increased owing to the war, hae developed from that £1,000 a year to £1,500 a year, will be in quite a different position. He will be entitled to deduct the amount of his income tax, but only in - at a very much lower rate, and though he 'has made £500 a year in excess of his pre-war standard, hew ill deduct only £12.5 for what he is called upon to pay in in come tax. He pays income tax atl the rate of lOd. in the £ 1 . The man who has' increased his profits from £10,000 to £15,000 pays income tax at the rate of 5s. in the £ 1 . The small man, who earns an excess profit of only £500,. will be called upon to pay war-time profits tax on £375-. Is there any sense in this proposal ?",31
110,Sir JOH NFOBBEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,It is the same provision that is contained in the Imperial Act.,31
111,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Unfortu nately,, it is not, because the Imperial Acti does not provide for the exemption of t h » amount paid in income tax, and that iti is which creates the trouble in regard to this Bill . .",31
112,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Does - tflie honourable member wish to tax these peopl» doubly""? '",31
113,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"My purpose is merely to point out the effectof the Bill . The Prime Minister and. the Treasurer have talked about the pledge given tio the country. I am as strongly in favour of keeping political pledges as any honourable member is, but it is necessary to have regard to what was the real r War-time Profits Tax substance of the pledge said to have been given to the people. As 1I have said before, in my opinion the real substance of Vhe pledge given to Ihe people was that the Government proposed, either through the War-time Profits Tax Bill , which had already been introduced, or by some necessary alteration to that measure, to tax heavily, if it were possible to do so, profits made by large companies and rich people through the war. M i ' . GREENE - If we have already taxed away their profits under the Income Tax Act, why further reduce tliem now below what they were before tihe war?",31
114,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"If this Bill were wiped out altogether, we would still derive the same amount of revenue from these companies from the income tax they pay. I do not propose to further reduce their profits. My proposal is totally different; it is this: If we cannot arrive at what are, in effect, war profits, we should take a percentage of capital, aud allow a man 10 per cent, without charging him any tax. If he makes 15 per cent, on his capital we should take, say, 50 per cent, of the prdfits abo^e that 10 per cent., and so proceed by a graduated scale. It must not be assumed that I am saying that the Bill should be modified by wiping out the exemptions in regard to payment on account of income tax. What I am endeavouring to say is that the Bill , with that exemption, has not the effect which the country expected that this kind of legislation would have. This Bill will take from the great bulk of the big - ompanies and the .rich men who have made war profits nothing whatever more than if it were thrown into the waste paper basket; but it will take away a considerable portion of the profits of smaller businesses. These latter pay in come tax at a very much lower rate, and, therefore, will get a very much lower rate of deduction. The only effect of this Bill will be that, while it lets off the wealthy companies and firms, whether their excess of profits is derived from the war or not, from any burden of taxation under it , it will greatly increase the taxation upon the lower incomes, which at present, under the income tax, are not called upon to pay an excessive rate. In other words, the whole burden of this form of taxation will be thrown, not on the big companies or the persons who hold shares in them, but on those people whose incomes as [63]- 2 [5 SEPTEMBER, 1917.] Assessment Bill. 1667 shareholders in companies or as individuals carrying' on businesses do not approach, those of the shareholders of the big companies. If there was any pledge to the country, if the late election was really fought on this issue, and there were no other issues before the people, or if this was one of the material issues before the people, the substance of it was that we should so frame our legislation - that we should, as nearly as possible, tax under this form of taxation the profits of tliose metal companies, those shipping companies, those soft goods companies, those chemical businesses, and others whose gains, whose stocks, whose freights, or whose other sources of revenue had, by reason of the war, enabled them to make larger profits. But the Bill lets them off.",32
115,Mr JH CATTS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"On e chemical company in Sydney is said to have made excess profits to the extent of £250,000,",32
116,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"The excess profits undoubtedly are heavy in some cases, but because a firm's stocks have increased by 200 per cent, it must not be concluded t h a i its profits have in creased to the same extent.",32
117,Mr JH CATTS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,This Bill will reach that company in Sydney.,32
118,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"It is quite true that some companies whose profits have increased beyond 50 per cent, will be h it by this Bill , but those companies whose excess of profits does not amount to more than 50 per cent, of the pre-war profits will not be h it by it , and the great bulk of those who have made war profits must be included in the latter category, and will not be taxed by the Bill , because the income tax rate is already one-third in the highest grade. The firm whose in come was £10,000 before the war, and whose income during the accounting period is £15,000. pays income tax at the rate of 5s. plus 25 per cent., that is, 6s. 3d. in the £ 1 , and' that will just about wipe out the £5,000 excess profit. On the other hand, the smaller men, where the income tax rate is lower, will bear the whole burden of this war-time profits taxation, and that is not what I consider was the intention of the people when they gave sanction, if they did give sanction, to what was then termed the War Profits Bill before the country. Let me give the history of this legislation. Originally there was no exemption of payments on account of income ,tax in the Bill introduced hy the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), so that this argument would not have applied to that Bill ; but the honourable member for Grey (Mr . Poynton), though he did not introduce an amending Bill , made an interim financial statement on the 6th December, 1916, and under the heading of "" What constitutes war profits "" he saidAllowance should also be made for the deduction of amounts paid in respect of Commonwealth and State income taxes. That was stated before the election; but can any one say that it is not straining the matter to the utmost to suppose that when the Government said that they - inearn tended to proceed with the War-time Profits Tax Bill , and pointed out that certain modifications would have to made, the people had in their minds, only the terms of the Bill , which very knew anything about, but also the state50 ment made by the honourable member for touched by it . Grey on the 6th December, that certain further alterations should be made ? But, principle of the pre-war standard. if the people knew that those further alterations, when made, would have the effect of preventing this kind of legislabhe tion from touching the large companies and firms which made war profits, would they have .sanctioned it? I have placed my views as strongly I could upon this point previously. Like other honourable members, I have received numerous letters from all parts of tralia, but I have not paid much attencentage of capital. tion to cases of individual hardship, cause, with all such legislation, there must be such cases. However, I have come more and more impressed with the fact that this taxation, based on a pre-war standard, will not touch the man we seek to touch, for the most part, but w i l with crushing weight many of those smaller growing industries upon which the future of the Commonwealth depends.",32
119,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"The honourable member must admit that if a company makes excess profit of over 50 per cent, above the pre-war standard, it must pay tion under this P ill .",33
120,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I have two already admitted it . In reply honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts), I pointed' out that my argument covered only those firms whose profits did not exceed 50 per cent. In chemical nesses, and in others, there will be cases where the actual cost of the article sold has gone up by 100 per cent, yet the profits have not gone up more than 50 per cent. An y excess over 50 per cent, will come under this Bill . So far as companies are concerned, it must be remembered - that it is the shareholders who will be affected. If a company pays its profits away in dividends, it does''not pay income tax on those profits, and therefore would not be entitled to deduct income tax, bub a company is merely an aggregation of shareholders, and all wealthy shareholders whose income exceeds £5,000 are the persons who would get the greatest relief from this tax. If their business does not 50 per cent, more than iti earned before the war, they would be relieved absolutely. It would be invidious to mention be the shipping companies and other large not concerns which expected to pay this tax, few but which, unless they made more than per cent, excess profit, will not; be I wish to say a word or two upon the To my mind, it is an essentially unsound principle, and is particularly dangerous at present juncture in Australia. The 10 per cent, standard which will be adopted in a great many cases ought to be adopted as the standard in every case, as but we ought not to require people Vo pay 75 per cent, of all profits made in excess of that standard. We should have a Ausgraduated tax based always on a perI t is unfortunate be that we should have to debate this extremely important measure without havbeing an opportunity of dealing with the general financial position of the country. We are crippled in respect of that kind of criticism which we, as a Parliament, l h it ought to use in connection with such a measure. In a very short time, there will ' be returning to Australia about 300,000 men who must be replaced in in dustry. Heaven knows that will be a an sufficiently heavy burden upon us. But, in addition, we shall have a sudden and taxagreat diminution of the amount of borrowed money available for maintaining public works and employment. Those facts represent our immediate f u t u r e ; to the that is the position we have to face. I i said the other day that there never was a time in the history of Australia when so urgent a duty lay upon this Parliament busito stimulate and encourage every form of production and enterprise, because there never - was in the history of Australia such a difficulty as is right on our threshold today. The problem which every country engaged in war will have to face we shall have to face. But in some respects we shall have to tackle it with greater difficulties than confront other countries. Yet at this moment, when every encouragement ought to be given to enterprise, to the starting of new businesses, and to the taking of business risks, v we are saying to people, "" If you continue developing your business, and succeed, if you throw your whole energy int'o it, and use every gift of knowledge, strength, and enterprise you possess to expand your activities, we shall take 75 per cent, of any profits above the pre-war standard of your business, but if you lose, you yourselves must bear the loss."" Is it conceivable that, under such an embargo, there can be any development in this country ? My criticism of this measure applies with equal force to the Bill introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs). But I realise that only when a measure is threshed out in Parliament, and has the light of criticism thrown on its provisions, do we see the full measure of its strength and its weaknesses, and if we are a rational Parliament at all, while avoiding party issues on all sides, we ought to have regard to the immediate industrial and economic problems that confront us.",33
121,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The Bill I introduced contained a clause balancing profits 1.0SS6S,34
122,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"That would minimize the effect of the measure to only a limited extent. That Bill provided, this one provides, that if a business more profits than it had been making fore the war, 75 per cent, of such profits should go to the Treasury.",34
123,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,But section 10 of the English Act has been left out of this Bill.,34
124,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Member s on both sides have been wrong in regard to this class of legislation. that it will not work. At a. time when credit is low and the springs of enterthink prise are necessarily slackened, when takes more energy and enterprise launch out into business and create fresh avenues of employment, to say to people, "" We shall bind you to your pre-war dard, and take 75 per cent, of anything you make in excess,"" would be to dry the wells of enterprise, and to cause economic sterility. Once more I appeal to the Government to reconsider this measure. No question of party or political conflict ought to deter us from preventing such injuries as this measure is likely to do.",34
125,Mr SINCLAIR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Are you losing sight of the temporary nature of the measure ?,34
126,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I am not. It is quite true that if the war ends next year this Bill will only hamper and weaken enterprise for one year. If the war does not end next year, the Bill will have that effect for two years, and so on. But this is not the sort of legislation which we can try, and then repeal if it does, not succeed. Its very nature is to place an embargo on industry during the coming year.",34
127,Sir JOHN PORREST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,They are doing it in England.,34
128,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I do not think the English precedent ought necessarily to bind us in Australia. I pay the greatest respect to legislation relating to legal and commercial matters, bills of exchange, and so forth, which has received the advantage of the great skill and experience which statesmen of the British Parliament can give. Their experience entitles most measures which they pass to the greatest consideration from us, but and when we are dealing with a tax which directly touches the present economic position of our country it is our duty to go to the ground level, and study exactly as what it means. The suggestion I have made made to the Government on previous beoccasions I venture to make again, and I do not think that the Ministerial party, any more than the party on the .other side, will lose any prestige by facing the real question and even jettisoning some of our previously-conceived ideas. I should not have again raised this question unless I felt that we were about to do an We find now irreparable injury. My original suggestion-and I do not it is impracticable-wa s that we it should devise some method of scheduling to businesses which are supposed to have made war profits, and call upon them to show reason why their excess profits are stannot derived from the war. I believe the majority of honourable members are opup posed to that idea, and therefore I do not press it. But, instead of having a pre-war standard, which will operate as an immovable fetter upon the natural growth of industry, we can adopt the alternative 10 per cent, standard, which is in this Bill, and was, I think, in the previous measure introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia.",34
129,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"In the Bill introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia the standards were 6 per cent, and 7 per ».ent. on capital.",35
130,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I do not Sir WILLIAM IRVINE care what the percentage is, provided that the burden is graduated. We shall then be taxing war-time profits, not on the false and mischievous theory that we ought to tax a man because he is making more now. than at some other time, but because he is making an abnormal profit on the capital invested in his business. That principle is adopted by the Bill in some cases. 'Wherever the pre-war standard is less than' 10 per cent, on his capital, a man is entitled to take 10 per cent, as his standard. I suggest that we should omit all the provisions relating to the fixing of a pre-war standard, and that we should take a 10 per cent, standard in every case. But we should not commence by taking* 50 per cent, and 75 per cent, of all profits above 10 per cent. We should have a graduated scale, the precise range of which will be for 'the Committee to determine. I recommend the Canadian principle that if a man is making a 15 per cent, profit he should pay 50 per cent, in taxation, or if he is making 20 per cent, profit he should pay 75 per cent. That would not cripple any man's industry, because he would know that he could, at any rate, make up to 15 per cent, on his capital before feeling the burden of taxation. Of course, all war taxation must have some crippling effect on industry, but the scheme I suggest would not place an absolute embargo on enterprise. MT. BOTD - What about businesses, such as agencies, which have a small capital but a large income?",35
131,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,I have such' cases in mind. The businesses which we intend to reach by this taxation are those which have made large profits which are the direct outcome of the war.,35
132,Mr TTJDOK,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Tiha t is not the class of business to which .the honourable member for Flinders was referring.,35
133,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"No . I do not think it is agency business that the people wish to have heavily taxed. Such. businesses are in the same category as professions. The CHAIRMAN ; (Hon. J. M . Chanter) - The honourable member's time has expired, but he is permitted, under the Standing Orders, to make a second - I have not very much more to say. The system adopted in Canada has worked very well.",35
134,Dr MAIOSTET,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,How much revenue has resulted from it?,35
135,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"A great deal more than it is estimated that the tax provided for by the Bill will give, though .taxation of this kind does not yield anything like as much as is expected of it. I am informed that the yield from the Canadian tax is between £2,500,000 and £3,000,000; the estimated revenue from our proposed tax is £500,000.",35
136,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Ru t in Canada there is no income taxation.,35
137,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"If we adopted the Canadian system, we should still have our income taxation; every citizen would, still 'have to pay income taxation at the Tates applicable to his income. But where the profits of a business .are much in excess of what may be called the normal rate of profits on capital, it is not unjust to impose an . .additional tax. Such a tax would affect war profits, and would include .profits that were not war profits, but were profits due to some cause having no connection with the war. Some companies have watered their stock, other companies have not done this, but possess very large reserves. Most of .the companies whose war profits it is intended to tax have large reserves, in addition to their nominal paid-up capital-reserve s sometimes equalling the paid-up capital. The Bill provides, in - my opinion very properly, that it is the real capital, not the nominal capital, of a business that is to be taken into consideration. A dividend of 15 per cent, on the nominal capital of a concern may be only 10 per cent: on the real capital. My suggestion is that the percentage principle should be applied to capital. It is applied inmany cases, 1 amd, I believe, would cover the majorit y of businesses in which war profits have been made. Although) in many cases companies may have declared dividends of rm-ore than 10' per cent, prior to the war, the profits on theirreal capital may have been less than 10 per cent. Mr SAMPSON"" - That is, adding their reserves to their paid-up capital? Sir WILLIAM l EVIWE . ^ Yes . Mr BOTB' - Reserve s are generally in vested in the business of thecompany;",35
138,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Practic ally aH reserves are business capital. think that honourable members will agree with me that it is proper to take the assets of a business as the basis of calculation, and to say, We shall allow you tO' make 10 per cent, without taxing your profits, but over amd above that percentage we shall tax on a graduated' scale, rising rapidly t© large percentages."" I put forward the Canadian method as one the adoption of which would leave a great deal of ithe machinery of theR ill intact, and would make unnecessary a pre-war standard, with all its difficulties and its unjust and mischievous results. The Bill would then have nothing like such ruinous^ effects upon industry and enterprise. It is with the greatest reluctance that I have again brought forwar d this matter. I thought when we last discussed the measure that, with the alterations made in Committee, and the very wide discretion given to the Commissioner, it might be possible to avoid' the most injurious effects; but the more I have read the representations made to me, and the more . I haye thought over the matter, the more convinced have I become that .that is not eo, and that while the pre-war standard is preserved, nothing will prevent, the measure from having the disastrous consequences to which I have drawn attention.",36
139,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Capricornia) [5.13] - Th honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) has made what may be considered a very important speech; he certainly appears to think it important; but I cannot, help thinking that such speech is of very little use at this stage.

141,Mr WISE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"We are told that the honourable member's Bill did not r un the gauntlet of the Caucus. I Mr HIGGS - That was because there was no.t time; but had' we remained in office it would have been submitted to the Caucus, as most other Billswere. I think ti that I have said as much before when speaking about the measure. The honourable member for Plinders seems to think it. inequitable that we s'hould tax wartime profits or profits made during war time. It may be that this particular measure is more political than fiscal, that the public had demanded it .",36
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Are we back at the second-reading stage?,36
143,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"As I am going to. help the Government, I hope that I shall, not be interfered with in replying to the honourable member for Plinders. The public has seen that many companies are making huge profits, and believes that their profits are due to the high, prices charged for commodities. The honourable and learned member says that we should abandon the idea of taxing war-time profits, and adopt the Canadian system of allowing a dividend of 10 per cent, to be exempt from taxation, and having no pre-war standard. The equity of a pre-war standard is shown by the reference of the honourable member for Flinders to the watering of stock. According to the share list there are companies which pay as much as 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, on their capital. For a number of years the Bank of Western e Australia has paid 20 per cent. It s directors have been perfectly honest with the public, and have shown that percentage on their ba.lance-sheets' year after year. Some companies, however, have done d if -. a ferently.. From time to time these companies increase their capital by issuing canfresh shares, upon: which their shareThisi> The new shares, though nominally worth, f l , . may h a r » a market value of £ 2 , but the shareholders are allowed to take them up at £ 1 , the company thus increasing its capital appearing to decrease its profits. proposal of the honourable member for Flinders would penalize the honest pany which showed the true profits on capital, and would allow the company which adopted the more modern method to escape scot free. The Bank of New South Wales has from time to time offered new shares to its shareholders for £20 apiece, although such shares might be worth sion, in the market nearly £40 each. greatest Shares in companies like the West Austerest. tralian Bank have been turned over and over again, and many present-day holders may not be getting a return of more 5£ or 6 per cent, upon their capital. The proposal now is to tax such shareholders in such a way that the return on their investments will be reduced to, perhaps, will only 4 per cent. That is inequitable. The honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) spoke of the serious position that confronts us. He said that perhaps next year we should have to settle 300,000 returned soldiers; that our public works expenditure would be reduced, that there would be difficulty in obtaining the capital necessary to carry on industry. If the general public are afforded an portunity to read the honourable member's speech in the newspapers tomorrow, I afraid that it will cause, on their something in the nature of a panic. The honourable member spoke in the most seritralia ous tones of the difficulties that would confront us if next year we were upon to provide for the repatriation of 300,000 soldiers. He must know, howous ever, that even if the war were next June we should not be called upon to settle anything like that number within the following twelve months. When we had at the Front only 200,000 men it said that it would take two years to. turn them to Australia. It is probable that it will take us nearly three years bring backthe whole of our troops after the war. They may be brought back at the rate of 2,000 a week, and whilst process of returning them to Australia in operation this Government, which parently will not attempt to raise by tion the requisite revenue, will doubtless be borrowing money to provide their pay and to defray the cost of their tion Mr Biggs. transport and repatriation. For the first two or three years after the close of the and war; therefore, there will be, in my The opinion, not a period of depression, as suggested by the honourable member, but comsomething nearly approaching a boom. its The honourable member said that because of this depression difficulty would be experienced in obtaining the capital necessary for the development of industry. I take the view that if , following the close of the war, we experience a great depresit will be possible to obtain, with the ease, capital, at a low rate of inI f , on the other hand, there is something like a boom, difficulty will be experienced in obtaining capital for the than purposes of commercial enterprises. The Government must go on with this measure. I do not think that industry suffer by reason of it, because every business will be allowed to earn 10 per cent., plus a £200 exemption, before any part of its profits is taken. If , as the Treasurer estimates, the tax will yield only £1,000,000, then the taking of that amount from the incomes of Australia will not seriously affect our commerce and and industry. Under instructions from the Government, Mr Knibbs, who is an impartial statistician, took a census of the opwealth and incomes of the people soon after the outbreak of war. We are given am to understand by him that the wealth of part, Australia amounts to something like £1,000,000,000, and the incomes of Austo about £200,000,000. The taking of £1,000,000, for the purposes of taxacalled tion, from incomes amounting to £200,000,000 is not likely to have the serieffect which the honourable member for to end Flinders has suggested.",36
144,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Kooyong) [5.27] - I am largely in agreement with the honourable member for Flinders (Sir was William Irvine) in warning the Comremittee of the disastrous effects that will follow the passing of the Bill in its preto sent form. Twelve months ago I emphasized very strongly the serious effect it would have on the industries of Australia the at a time when we were all most anxious is that our industries should be encouraged apand that our production should expand. taxaThe whole trouble arises from the fact that the Government are endeavouring to graft on to Australia a form of legislathat is applicable only to the conditions which exist in the country where it was originally introduced. There is a fundamental difference between the conditions prevailing here and in the Old Country, and consequently the Bill, in its present form, is calculated to do gross and serious injustice. The Now Zealand Aet was withdrawn after it had been in operation for only twelve months, because it was found to operate most unjustly, and to be unfair in its treatment of the general community. A still further objection was the cost of collecting the tax. The injustices which must follow the coming into operation of this measure are largely, if not wholely, due to the pre-war standard for which it provides. The effect of that pre-war standard is to select one particular section of the community for taxation, and to relentlessly penalize it. It is not the wealthy section of the community, but the young and struggling manufacturing industries, that are to be so penalized. They are specially picked out for taxation.",37
145,Mr MATHEWS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Can the honourable member see anything in the' Bill that does not select for taxation only one section of the community?,38
146,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"B y reason of the pre-war standard, the Bill deliberately excludes from taxation all those large enterprises which have long been returning by way of income perhaps 10 per cent., 20 per cent., or even 100 per cent. All such enterprises are excluded. Instead of going to the sources of income on which taxation might fairly be levied, and levied with good results, the Government pick out small industries, recent enterprises, which are now struggling and endeavouring to grow and develop. ""Why should this be done?",38
147,Mr MATHEWS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Why did not the Ministerial party settle all this in their Caucus before the Bill was introduced?,38
148,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Twelv e months ago, I strongly pointed out all the objections that have been urged today, and I repeated those objections on the motion for the second reading of this Bill. deeply regret that the Bill has been persisted in, because I think it is grossly fair that one section should be penalized in this way. It is true that it is to be only a temporary measure, but, while it is in operation, it will inflict on one section of the community injustices from which they are not likely to recover for many a year.",38
149,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Some of the patients will have become corpses in the interim.,38
150,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Quite so. One obvious reason why the pre-war standard should not be persisted in is that this is a War-time Profits Bill. If it were possible to bring about the high taxation of all war profits, I should be found cooperating with the Government in such an effort. The fundamental principle of this measure, however, is that it shall be a War-time Profits Bill. That pre-supposes that all persons who, during the war, have made profits over and above a certain standard should be taxed. The pre-war standard, however, destroys what is fundamentally intended to be the principle of the Bill. It is not too late to withdraw this particular feature of the measure, and so enable the Government to obtain more revenue, while, at the same time, avoiding the taxation of one particular section of industry.",38
151,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"If we took away the pre-war standard, then the taxation would be imposed on men who are making less profits now than they were before the war.",38
152,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"If we were to take away the pre-war standard, we should have to provide for taxation according to the scale of profits made. Under the Canadian Act, as has been mentioned, a man who was making any profit beyond 15 per cent, would be liable to taxation.",38
153,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Eve n if, before the war, he had been making 20 per cent. ?",38
154,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Yes .,38
155,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"If we abolished the pre-war standard, this would not be a wartime profits tax.",38
156,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"As I have said, if we abolished the pre-war standard, the tax would have to be imposed according to a scale of profits.",38
157,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"It would be a general tax % without reference to the war. I Sir ROBERT BEST - This Bill does not provide for the taxation of profits un- arising out of the war.

160,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"It has not; but I remind the honourable member of clause 11, which deals with the decrease of capital, and also clause 16 and other clauses, which deal with the investment of capital. The position is that where capital is withdrawn from a business, there is a presupposition that it will earn the same amount of profit that, it did in the business, whereas, if it is withdrawn, as thousands have been withdrawn, for - investment in war loans, there is an infinitely less return than previously. However, I am glad to hear emphasized objections which I emphasized .a little while ago.",39
161,Mr SAMPSON,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,How could you get war profits under a super-income tax proposal 1,39
162,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The Bill does not attempt to do that.,39
163,Mr SAMPSON,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"It does, by the exemptions.",39
164,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"If it were possible to get at war profits I would go so far as to make an attempt in that direction, although I admit the difficulty. We are, however, - fixing a period during which we shall tax war-time profits; and that should be done in a fairer way than the terms of the Bill permit.",39
165,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"That is true; but it has nothing to do with the pledges made to the country. Sir ROBE RT BEST - Personally , I .am pledged against the Bill .",39

168,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [5.39] - It was understood that the Bill was recommitted to enable us to pass it to-night and send it on to the Senate. This afternoon, however,. we have had nothing but a repetition of the criticisms that have been directed against the Bill all through. We are now really asked to withdraw the measure altogether ; . because if we omit the pre-war standard, we omit the basis, and the whole of the> B i ll must go. The honourable member for Flinders (Sir Willia m Irvine) and tlhe> honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) have referred to the election pledges. The Prime Minister said at BendigoThe Government intend to proceed with the War-time Profits Bill . Every consideration will be given tb new businesses, to exceptional industries, and to individual cases where Hardships would arise; but the principle that no> man is entitled to make undue profit in war time ie sound and equitable, and will the applied'. The Government were pledged to .proceed with a War-time Profits Bill , and the Bill before us is a War-time Profits Bill . It was contended on all sides that if ,a man engaged in business before the war earned a certain income, and if , during the war period, when our men are falling in the at trenches and on the battlefield, his profits increased, it was a fair thing to subject - those profits io taxation. That was clearly stated as the principle which ought to be the basis of' this taxation; and the Bill carries it out, inasmuch as it taxes excess profits which are made in business during war time. Special amendments have been introduced to deal with small businesses, and an exemption is given to the extent of £1,000. Practically the Bill gives a pre-war standard of £1,000. In addition, it is provided that exceptional cases may be dealt with by the Commissioner on their merits, and power is given to make modifications in the pre-war standard itself, in the computation of profits, and in the fixation of what should be a fair 'capital.",39
169,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,It is a very limited power.,39
170,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"The power is limited only as regards one paragraph - of clause 10. Paragraph / of that elause is as follows:- l The fact that on account of the recent commencement of the business there has not been one pre-war trade year or the fact that the business has only 'commenced to be remunerative since the 4th day of August, 1914. There is a number of other cases, but the limitation applies only to paragraph / . In paragraph g of clause 10 provision is made for special circumstances, as specified in the regulations; and that bears out what I say, namely, that a wide power is given to - the Commissioner to meet certain cases of hardship.",39
171,Mr SAMPSON,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Do you,say that clause 10 is not governed by financial stability t",40
172,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Paragrap h / of clause 10 is so governed. Honourable members will see that the promise given by the Prime Minister on the public platform is being carried out, though, of course, in dividual members may have pledged themselves as they chose.",40
173,Mr BKENNAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Are you sure of that?,40
174,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"At present I am dealing with this Bill and the promise giveni by the Government to introduce such a measure. This Bill proposes, admittedly, taxation on war-time profits, and the whole of the arguments we have heard are in favour of the substitution of some other proposal. Of course, we would all like to tax war profits only if war profits could be segregated from obher profits. This cannot be done, because the ramifications 'of the war run through all our industries, primary and secondary. It is impossible to allocate a portion of profits, and say that it is particularly due to the war, while another portion of the profits is not - A suggestion has been made that we should schedule businesses, and distinguish those which have made war profits as distinguished from war-' time profits. Can we say that pastoralists have made war profits, and war profits only?",40
175,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Some have made huge profits.,40
176,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Coul d we say that all the boot manufacturers of Australia have made war profits only?,40
177,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Some of them have.,40
178,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,And some have not.,40
179,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Coul d we say that al l the shipping companies have made war profits only? It is utterly impossible to say which profits are war profits and war profits only.. If we were to split up, the balance-sheets, and,, after analyzing each individual case, call upon those concerned to show cause why they should not be taxed, the Department would have to hold an inquisitorial examination into the conduct of almost every business in Australia. The worse feature is that Parliament would not lay down the principle of taxation, but simply delegate its taxing power to the Commissioner to be exercised at his discretion. That, of course, is contrary to the elementary principle of taxation measures, which, as a rule, ought to be as certain and .specific as they can be made. An other suggestion is that we should adopt the Canadian measure; but if we did that we would have to drop the whole principle of war-time profits taxation. It might be a good additional form of' taxation, but because it could probably be made to apply, that is no reason for abandoning the Bill before us. - We have also to remember that, at the time the Bill was introduced in Canada, - there was' no income tax in that Dominion. As a mlatter of fact, each country, in framing its taxation measures, must have regard for its own conditions. We must take into consideration our existing legislation, our own industries, and the circumstances in which we l i v e ; and we must seek to apply the proposed taxation equitably to all sections of the community. The large companies will not escape this taxation.",40
180,Mr WISE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Accordin g to the honorablb member for Flinders, large companies will escape taxation under this Bill .",40
181,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,It is the big companies who are mostly engaged in the larger in dustries of Australia.,40
182,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,There are hosts of firms engaged in large industries.,40
183,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"If these companies-are making huge profits, they would be hit by this Bill . Does any one suggest that we should also hit' them with the income tax? It would mean double taxation. We cannot take the tax from .them twice. If the income .tax does take from them the whole of the excess profits, we cannot take it again, by an excess profits tax. The House has adopted the principle of the Bill by its decision on the second reading, and if it is sought to depart from the vita l pointa of the measure, it will simply mean asking the Government to withdraw the Bill'..

If election pledges; and when some of them l l say, "" But you are going to tax the small the businesses and let the huge incomes escape,"" the reply from Ministers is, But we must fulfil our election pledges. What matters it if the large businesses do escape, and the small men who are striving to get their heads above water are hit by the Bill ; what matters it if these Bmall men have to bear the burden of this taxation so long as we fulfil technically our tion to this Bill . election pledges, and square t(he ledger to all appearances, even though morally and small businesses. and really we have grossly failed to charge those pledges 1'' Before getting down to the merits of this question, I find it necessary to remind my friends of where they are in regard to it . These gentlemen of "" u n l i m it e d sacrifices""; these gentlemen who have advocated again and again the whole sacrifice of worker's life, wages, income, capital, in terest, and principal; in fact, worker's everything, come down here, this and say that it is unjust to place comes discriminating taxation upon the man that' whose income from his business is only £1,000 per year. Of course, it is unjust by comparison, but how badly the argument comes from those whose policy is what we know it to be! I come now to point out why I consishonorable tently witJi my general attitude oppose this Bill-lock , stock, and barrel. We are merely juggling with terms when we say that this is . a War-time Profits Tax Bill , and again, in some spects, say that it is a War Profits Tax Bill . If an honourable member and addresses himself to the war profits aspect of the measure, and says, "" Let get at the war profits,"" the reply is, "" cannot; we cannot find them; we do know where they are and what they are; therefore we"" cannot tax them, and, - besides, this is a War-time Profits Tax Bill . "" Very well; we call i Profits Tax Bill , and we say, "" Let us apply it justly to those profitfc which made during a time of w a r "" ; but Ministers previous Bill ! say, "" No, you quite forget the pect of this Bill , "" and they hark back to tihe war profits aspect of the measure. It Caucus. is a mere juggling with words. If this is a War Profits Tax Bill , let us select war profits, and tax them. If we cannot select the war profits, let us adopt a principle of taxation which will applv justly to the whole community. ",41
193,Mr BRENNAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Yes , lawyers, tax the doctors, tax the whole ' population that is capable of bearing tion.  orable member was opposed to the taxation of lawyers.",42
194,Mr BRENNAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"The honourable member does not seem to have taken the trouble to ascertain the basis of our objecOf course, I objected to the taxation of junior lawyers I would be disvery recreant to my trust if , having secured that small measure of justice to one class of persons. I sat mute while it was proposed to do an injustice to other sections of the community, as the Bill proposes to do. Of course I did my best to have exempted those junior professional the men who by personal exertion, and not - because of the war, but in spite of the war, the happen to be making increased incomes at time, while those with very large in escape altogether. Consistently with attitude I now say that the Bill should be withdrawn, because the more that I have listened to arguments such as I have heard this afternoon and previously, the more I have become convinced that it will do nothing less than gross injustice. The member for Cook (Mr J . H . Catts), who has returned to the chamber after a few days' absence, naturally asked whether the Government had made any attempts to answer the outstanding objecretions against the injustice that will be done by the Bill , and I interjected that rises, they have succumbed to our arguments in respect to a few special cases. us But, as the honourable member for KooWe yong said-and I agree with almost every not one of his remarks-the y leave an unlimited list of injustices still unremedied.  t a War-time Labour party's Bill .",42
195,Mr BRENNAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The f at u it y of this are parrot-like repetition of what was in the I never pledged myself war as to support any such Bill . ,42
196,Mr MATHEWS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Y o u are a l i a r !,42
197,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL," Order ! I ask the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to withdraw that remark, and apologize.",42
198,Mr MATHEWS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I must withdraw and apologize, but he told a deliberate lie. tax the",42
199,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The honourable taxamember must withdraw unconditionally.,42
200,Mr MATHEWS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I withdraw uncondithe hontionally, and apologize.",42
201,Mr BRENNAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,""" Wealth must bear its part,"" was the watchword of the Prime Minister in regard to this tax. Only once have we seen him in the House while this measure has been under consideration, and then he sat in the shadow of the Treasurer-the l i g h t honourable gentleman whom he referred to as a troglodyte who had never conceived a new idea.",42
202,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Order ! The honourable member must confine himself to the question before the Chair.,43
203,Mr BRENNAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"When I spoke in support of the honourable member for Henty in the early hours of Priday morning, I said I was against the Bill , and would do anything to l i m it the scope of its mischief. I voted accordingly then, and accordingly I will vote now. I do not know whether it is by the grace of the Chairman or the Standing Orders that we are discussing this Bill at such length at this stage. I think that the liberty of discussion arises rather from the growing sense on the piart of Ministerial members of the f u t i l it y and even wickedness of passing a measure of this kind in its present form. I hope that when the Bill is in transit to another place it will be happily lost or forgotten, and that the Government will come before the House with ,a measure- I do not care what they call it, a war profits tax or £ war-time profits tax-bu t a measure consistent with their own pledges to tax those people who are able to bear taxation. If our condition in regard - to this war is anything like what it is said to be, if it is in the remotest degree approaching wh,at the Prime Minister, on the platform and in the House, has said it is, we should have a measure,, not lightly and unjustly touching a small section of the icommunity, but, if necessary, cutting to the bone the whole community in proportion to their ability to pay. Let us have such a measure, and let us have this iniquitous proposal forgotten, if possible, after it passes from this Chamber, because I am certain, after what the Honorary Minister has said, that the Government are determined to pass it here, being ashamed, no doubt, to submit further amendments.",43
204,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Order ! I ask the honourable member to withdraw his last remark.,43
205,Mr BRENNAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,P certainly withdraw it .,43
206,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL," The Chairman is placed here for a specific purpose, namely, to interpret the rules of debate as liberally as possible. I have done that, and I believe that the temporary Chairman (Mr Atkinson) has acted in the same way. I recognise that this elause embodies practically all the principles in the Bill , but I ask honourable members to restrict their remarks to those principles, and not to get outside the scope of the clause. Such discursions only lead to disorder and interjections, and cause unnecessary trouble.",43
207,Mr KELLY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Wentworth) [6.10] - I do not propose to follow the honourable member for Batman in the electioneering speech he has delivered to the Committee. I would find it difficult f o follow the same circle as the honourable member described, for whilst he started with a denunciation of the measure as a ludicrous f u t i l it y , his mind was suddenly cast back to a very grave crisis only a few days ago, when he spoke with equal fervour and far deeper earnestness in advocating the exclusion of new industries sought to be brought withi n the comprehension of this measureunjustly, as I thought-to orie of which industries the honourable and learned member belongs. I am not concerned with catch phrases such as '' not because of the war, but in spite of the war."" These' phrases have been coined by interested persons to enable them to escape the compass of this proposal. I take it that mdst businesses in Australia have prospered .because of the enormous sums of money brought into circulation by this war, and placed in the hands of new classes, and because of the fact that those new classes were spending thati war money, yet the businesses which reap the benefit of this wide money circulation say, "" We have prospered, not because of the war, but in spit© of the war."" - Almost every business throughout Australia has prospered because of the vast) war expenditure. The money paid to the people has filtered back to trade,, yet trade would have the impudence to tell us thati it has not benefited because of .the war. However, I have risen to deal with one aspect of the debate on the clause rather than' to deal generally with the measure. I refer to the somewhat alarming revolutionary doctrine preached this afternoon by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), and naturally voiced afterwards by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), and others'. If the honourable member for Kooyong was pledged to anything, it was that there - hould be no tax upon wealth. His cry was that a wealth tax was an is passing, absurd and antiquated impost, and that the right levy was by means of an income uax. Yet this afternoon we heard him advocating a tax upon been wealth by advocating the abolition of pre-w?air standard. Take the case of majority of the large companies which have made most of the big profits cent years. The vast majority of - haTehoideriS bought into those companies a year or two before the war started, market value given to them by the interest return shown by the dividends,' and - ay - that those companies shall tinue to make profits representing that rate of interest is to confiscate the capital value of those shares, and to bake the wealth of those who invested in them. The abolition of the pre-war standard would he a direct tax upon wealth, and I submit that it is grossly unjust to tax that section of wealth in this country, less we are going to tax - all wealth throughout 'the community in the same way. We have heard a lot of nonsense talked about the exemption of large terests. The large interests - are not exempted by - this measure, for everybody who comes within its compass is taxed according to the same principle, that they shall not gain appreciably more from their businesses in time of war than gained in time of peace. All big indusprofits, tries stand on the same plane; the exempoften tions have been made for the small indusa tries. The only way to make ithe big (busiwith nesses pay more taxation is by confiscatbitterlyresent ing the wealth of the shareholders inapplication.. vested in those industries ",43
208,Mr FENTOIT,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Do you mean that we - ould not impose a super-income tax?,44
209,Mr KELLY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,We could still do that.,44
210,Mr COKSEK,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,And let the year 1915-16 escape taxation.,44
211,Mr KELLY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"That is the point. That was the year when the distribution of money throughout Australia 'began get back into trading hands, and large .profits. It was 'because of that fact that .notice of this tax .was given. At time. I heand no objection from honourable members opposite. The tax was hailed as a Heaven-sent proposition which only the genius of the Labour party oould evolved. Now the honourable member Maribyrnong suggests a super-income tax, not in respect of the year of plenty that but in respect of the years of decreasing income that are before us. I should not have bothered to speak this afternoon but for the claptrap which has uttered about the large interests the escaping. That is the argument advanced ithe by the other interests which wish to escape. We must tax the profits of the in reyear 1915-16 in order to keep the the National party's pledges, and there is no way of taxing that year other than by on a some such measure as is now before the Committee, because the public was given to notice of this measure, and in passing not conit there is no retrospection.",44
212,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Rubbish ! How can you tax past years Avithout retrospection?,44
213,Mr KELLY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"If I tell somebody that I intend to tax him, and that he must make provision for that tax, he makes - that provision. J£ he does not, the fault is his own. About £f.teen months' notice of this untax was given by Parliament, and every Government succeeding has reiterated the warning. If jpeople have not taken the warning they have only themselves into blame. If we abolish the pre-war standard, we - shall .act unfairly, and even foolishly, and cause immense dislocation of share values throughout Australia, and infinite inconvenience to the Treasury. Further, you cannot tax the profits they of the year 1915-16, the year of great unless you pass this Bill. It is urged against those arguing - against taxation measure that, while burning a righteous zeal to be taxed, .they being brought within its If you withdrew the Bill, and proposed a super-income tax, we should have the same gentlemen saying, "" In the name of common sense, why heap this intolerable burden on the taxpayers?"" Whatever form the proposal may ,take, it will - create trouble, - but I think that under the Bill there will be less trouble than under any other proposal. Let us see how the measure works. 'Should it work into equitably we may trust the Government to yield - to reconsider the position.",44
214,Dr MALONEY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Melbourne) [6.211 that I agree with a great deal .that was said by the honourable member for Grey (Mr. Poynton), and had - there been a division would have voted Jor the second reading have of the Bill, not that I think .that the for measure goes far enough, but because I am bound to support one having for its object the taxing of war profits in war time. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has justly characterized as. a quibble the contention that we should pass, not a war-time profits tax, but a war profits tax. To do that would be to create more technicalities. I disagree with what was said by the honourable member for Grey regarding the entertainments tax. It was stated that that tax would fal l unjustly upon the purveyors of amusement v/ho were already subject to the ordinary income taxation. Certain firms in this city, howeverHoyt's and two or three others-were willing to pay the tax, and leave their prices of. admission untouched. But the combine immediately insisted that they should make the people pay the tax. In my opinion, the Government should not permit any combine or Trust to interfere between a firm and the public when the firm wishes to pay a tax itself, and does not wish to pass it on to the public. One must agree with some of the marks of the honourable member for Flinmencement ders (Sir William Irvine), but I think that he was wrong in saying that those who earn the largest incomes would escape the proposed tax. If that were so, the Government should alter the^Bill in order to compel these large profit makers to contribute to the general taxation. In my opinion, the honourable member did not prove his statemember ment. When I asked him to say what was the yield of the Canadian tax, he said, "" only £2,500,000."" That seems very small sum to be contributed by population bf 8,000,000 persons, forming a community that is wealthier than tralia. In my opinion, a super-tax on the ordinary income tax would have been better than the proposal now under conthe sideration. But it must be admitted the Government was pledged to the introimpossible duction of the proposed tax, and Minisextent ters, according to their lights, are honorcarried ably fulfillin g that pledge, though their lights do not burn as brightly as I could wish. If I understand the measure rightly, everything over the pre-war standard of profit, making allowance for the £1,000 exemption, will pay taxation at the rate of 50 per cent. That is a fair commencement, but I hope that we are not going to stop at that. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) individuals, spoke of the Western Australian Bank, come the history of which is unique. The Dr Maloney. honourable member for Flinders spoke about capital being held in reserves. The Western Australian Bank has what, I think, no other bank in the world possesses- a reserve f u n d equal to nearly 300 per cent, of its paid-up capital.",44
215,Unknown,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 7.%5 p.m.,45
216,Dr MALONEY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"The capital of the Western Australian Bank consists of 25,000 £10 shares full y paid up which represents £250,000. It s reserve of undivided profits, however, amounts to £713,370, or nearly 300 per cent, on its paid-up capital. Thus, if the suggestion made by the. honourable member for Flinders were adopted, the percentage allowance would be upon practically £1,000,000 instead of the £250,000 actually paid up. In stead of an exemption of 20 per cent, on the actual paid-up capital of the company, the bank would thus 'receive an exemption of 80 per cent. That would be an absolute infamy. The Government are offering me, and rethose who think with me, only a comi n this form of taxation. If I cannot obtain the full loaf, I am prepared to take a portion of it ; but I shall not cease to ask for more. The Bank of New Zealand has a reserve f u n d of £2,246,595 . That reserve f u n d really represents profits, but under the honourable for Flinders' proposal the shareholders would be allowed the percentage deduction in respect of the full amount a instead of upon the amount subscribed by a the original shareholders. On one occasion Mr Clapp, then secretary of the MelAusbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company Limited, was under cross-examination for three successive afternoons in regard to way in which the capital of the old that company had been watered; but it was to clearly ascertain to what the watering-down process had been on. It was estimated that a dividend of 5 per cent, was really equal to a dividend of 45 per cent., or even 50 per cent., upon the original capital subscribed before the watering of the stock took place. I hope that the proposal made by the honourable member for Flinders will be rejected - The return prepared for the information of Sir Alexander Peacock in regard to the profits made by firms and as disclosed by the State in tax returns shows that only t h i r t y three out of 265 suffered a reduction of income in the year of war, 1916, as compared with the returns for 1914. Of thirty-three, five in the following made sumcient to more than ""balance the deficit of the previous year. Honourable members opposite talk of an exemption £1,000, but what is to be said of the tion of thousands of working men in tralia today wbo earn only £ 2 , £ 3 , £ 4 per week, or that of girls in factories who, if they are lucky, average from 30s. to 40s. per week ? A man who in pre-war times was earning £1,000 a year will be allowed an exemption of that amount i his profits exceed that amount in later years. There will also be an additional exemption of £1,000.",45
217,Mr LECKIE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Not in the case of a nership.,46
218,Dr MALONEY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I am speaking, not of partners in a business, but of indiwhich viduals. I am strongly opposed to any exemptions. As the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) has said, the fairest course to pursue would be to remove a l exemptions from this Bill . It would well if we were to require those who raised the price of foodstuffs to pay into the Consolidated Revenue every penny made by them in excess of their average ing returns prior to the war. I invite honourable members to conpot-still sider for a moment the profits made on whisky. The output of Australian whisky runs into some thousands of gallons, but who knows where and war-time how that-output is sold? It is reported that Australian whisky is blended with other whiskies, and sold in bottles porting to contain imported whisky. We cannot put a stop to the crime burglary, but we can make it awkward for the burglar whom we catch. Why we not make it awkward for the manufacwith turer or merchant who sells Australian whisky in bottles purporting to contain the imported article ? Two gentlemen the trade told me this afternoon that to the war a good Scotch whisky, having the requisite certincate of two years' turity , could be bought here in bond 2s. 6d. per gallon. At that time the duty was 14s. per gallon; it has-since been creased to 17s. We may make an allowof ance of 2s. 6d. per gallon for the increase in freight charges, but that will not count for the fact that today such whisky cannot be purchased.for less than 17s. 6d. per gallon, an increase of 600 per cent.",46
219,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,I do not think that the the freight and insurance would represent year more than ls. per gallon.,46
220,Dr MALONEY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Of course, the honourable member for Yarra, as an ex-Minisof ter for Customs, knows much more about posithis matter than does my informant, and AusI gladly accept his statement. Coming or to Australian whisky, which is manufactured in thousands of gallons, I would point out thab very few hotels sell it as Australian whisky. To my mind, that is an infamy. I desire to see our Australian f products built up as American products have been built up. Shortly before the outbreak of war Australian whisky cost 4s. 6d. per gallon. It is now being sold partat 15s. per gallon: The Treasurer will agree with me that there is a large source of profit hidden there, I object to firms are making large profits being permitted to escape taxation. Before the war , the Excise duty upon Australian whisky, distilled wholly from barley malt by a potl still or similar process, at a strength not be exceeding 45 per cent, over proof, was have 13s. per gallon, whereas upon blended whisky, distilled partly from barley malt and partly fro m other grain, containnot less than 25 per cent, of . pure barley malt spirit, which had been separately distilled by a or similar process at a strength not exceeding 45 per cent, over proof, it was 15s. per gallon. If I had my choice I would prefer a super income tax to a profits tax, because I candidly confess that I do not full y grasp the Canadian system of war profits taxation. purCanada has been credited with many good things, but I would have to understand of its system more thoroughly before I could accept it . For advanced legislation do Australia can more than hold her own Canada, just as she can more than hold her own from the stand-point of her treatment of the Mother Land. Canada in imposes upon Great Britain the cost of prior every man-as soon as the Canadian lands in England-that she places in the mafield. We have not done that. To my mind, for there should be no exemptions under this Bill . I am satisfied that if the question in - were put to the people, "" Da you approve persons making huge profits in war time?"" they would by an overwhelming acmajority answer "" No . "" I know of one man, or firm, who in 1916 made a profit of £100,000 in excess of his profit in 1914. Suppose that he made that profit ing the prices of foodstuffs. If he that every penny - of the excess would confiscated, would not that knowledge tend to prevent the raising of prices? have shown that there has been an increase of 600 per cent, in the price of Australian whisky. But that is nothing compared with the increased prices charged for other commodities. There are in this city firms which have increased the prices food to such an extent that under the old code Napoleon they would not been fined .heavily, but would also have been imprisoned.  vent that sort of thing 1 Dr MAL / ONEY - I hope so sincerely. I trust that the Government will mot yield to the suggestion of the honourable member - for Plinders. But the Bill will not duce the revenue bhat it ought to yield. I maintain that any 'Company which at a quarters. time like the present can make pre-war profits ought to be very well content - We *re 12,000 miles distant from the danger zone, and consequently are most fortu nate. When we reflect upon the countries which have been devastated-countrie like Belgium, Servia, Montenegro, A toaiiia, Roumania, and a portion of Russia, - including Riga",46
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Is the honourable member discussing war-time profits ?,47
222,Dr MALONEY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Yes . I ask the Minister for the Navy, who has been very - good lately, whether the merchants and t others of the before-mentioned countries, and of Petrograd, would not be exfo ceedingly grateful if .they could carry - on - their businesses under existing ditions, and make pre-war profits? I these devastated countries what has come of the individuals who were more wealthy? They have been swept like bookkeeping. chaff before the wind. I regret that the Government have slavishly followed the Bill which was introduced by former Administraition. They ought to recognise that the conditions which obtained are very different from those which prevail .now. Times have .changed, and whereas we might then have been content with 50 per cent, of the excess war-time profits, we should now stretch .out our .hand and (take ithe whole of In Victoria alone profits amounting to just upon ,£2,,O0O,OOO have been made since the war began, in excess of profits by raisamounting to £3,900,000 which were knew made in peace time. If we include the be rest of Australia, it is manifest that £8,000,000 of excess profits .have been 1 made in war time. Y e t it is proposed to take only one-half of these profits ",47
223,Mr LECKIE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,What were the increased profits between 1913 and 1914.1,47
224,Dr MALONEY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,I think the honortwo able member will find that profits were of liigher in 1.9.13 than iai 1914 Mr BOYD. - Eu t 1914 was a very poor ; only have year- a .drought year..,47
225,Dr MALONEY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"That bears out what I am going to say. The year 19.13 prewas .a year of peace, whereas the declaration of war was made in August, 1914; and every one will admit that trade suffered, and credit was shaken for a few weeks, thati is, until we pulled ourselves - together. The result was that profits durproing the last quarter of the year were not equal to those of the three preceding",47
226,Mr LECKI,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"E - There was an increase in - profits every year before the war, as well as after - the outbreak of the war.",47
227,Dr MALONEY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I think it will be s found that there was a decrease in 1914. l - However, that is a master for inquiry. I should have liked to see the computation of profits made absolutely on the in come-tax returns, wiiich .are on formal declarations, and any one making a false declaration is liable to a heavy penalty. It is the height of - absurdity to .have seven - different income taxes imposed in Ausr a l i a ; and, in my opinion, there ought/ - to be one income tax - and one land £ax r the whole of ithe .country. The .State could be paid a proportion .of the revenue conraised by ,the Commonwealth; and if a n ischeme to that end were carried out it bewould prove a means of economy, and just .than the differential system of Mr BOYD, - That is true ; bub how could we make the States agree to the a Commonwealth collecting the whole of this revenue ? The consent of the States then would have to be obtained first.",47
228,Dr MALONEY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"The honourable member will agree that .some day we hope to have only one representative of Australia is the Old Land, .and other - economies of the .kind; and there is no them. harm in throwing o u t seeds that may bear f r u it . There ought not to be one penny of exemption in regard tb profits which .are more than those made in peace time; and I venture to prophesy that if the present Government do not take some steps in this connection within a year, public opinion will force legislation with that object upon us.",47
229,Mr FALKINER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Hume) [8.10] - I should like to draw the attention of the Gommittee to the definition of "" capital,"" which, according to> clause 16, is(1) The amount of the capital of a business shall be taken to be the amount of its capital paid up by the owner in money or in kind, together with all accumulated profits invested in. the business, with the addition or subtraction of balances brought forward from, previous years to the credit or debit respectively of profit and loss account. In regard to land, no provision whatever is made for the earned increment, or, as it is called in connection with the Federal land tax, the added value of the improvements. Ring-barking, for instance, costs !2s, 6d. or 3s. per acre; whije burning-off from time to time may bring up the cost to 12s. 6d. or 15s. an acre. This, however, by no means accounts for the cost of the improvements, because a man has to wait fifteen or twenty years before the benefits of the improvements mature. Under this Bill , a man who has paid £ 1 per acre to the Crown for land, and ringbarks and clears it , is allowed to make 10 per cent, practically on half the value of his holding; and surely the Treasurer will abfc say that that is fair ? In business, a man is allowed the full 10 per cent., or pre-war standard, on his capital; but in the case of pastoral land, the owner will suffer great hardship.",48
230,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"That matter can be discussed more appropriately on clause 16, which deals solely with capital.",48
231,Mr FALKINER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"V e r y well. the case of a small business, if a man is the owner and does not devote the whole of his time to it,, he is allowed nothing for the time he gives; but if he is one of two partners, and gives part of his time to the business, that is allowed for. I think the individual man should have a proportionate allowance.",48
232,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"He will , as the honourable member will see from subsequent clauses.",48
233,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I have given notice of amendments in clause 14,. and these will give the honourable member an opportunity to deal with that matter.",48
234,Mr GREGORY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Dampier) [8.14] While appreciating the difficulty that confronts the Treasurer in his endeavour to meet the wishes of the Committee, I cannot help feeling, with the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Willia m Irvine), that we have started on a bad foundation. I find it extremely difficult to bring myself to support the Bill in its entirety. I feel that l.musb support the measure; but I wish the Treasurer, and the M in ister who is assisting him, would see whether they cannot do something to get over the difficulties that are felt by myself and others. I speak more particularly in relation to certain companies. At the present time, the best of our base metalsare finder the control of the Government, who supervise the sale and purchase of molybdenite, wolfram, and so forth . The Government have fixed prices which, to those who produce these articles, are considerably less than the standard value;, but I have no objection to that, because the prices are fairly good. If these people went into the open market, they could get 100 per cent, more for - wolfram and scheelite than they are getting from the Government. They could get for molybdenite 80 per cent, more in the world's market than they are geting from the Government for this metal. "" This should be remembered when we are dealing with this taxation. I am satisfied that honourable members generally desire to be fair in dealing with this question, and I should like some attempt to be made to overcome the difficulty which arises out of the consideration of the pre-war standard to which the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Will i a m Irvine ) has directed special attention. Let us assume that there are two comIn panies with a capital of £10,000 each carrying on business today - Suppose one was carrying on its business prior to the declaration of war, and one-has been established since the declaration of war. I assume that the older business, prior to the war, made a profit of £12,000 a year, and is still making a similar profit. That company would not pay a single sixpence of taxation under this Bill , ' because its profit during the accounting period would not be greater than its pre-war standard of profits. The new company, with the same capital, having a good business proposition in selling metals to the Government, is also making a profit of £12,000 a year. It would be entitled under the Bill to take 10 per eent. of its capital of £10,000, and this would give it an exemption of £1,000. Under the provisions dealing with businesses with a wasting asset it would get another exemption of £1,000.",48
235,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL," I remind the honourable member that clause 14, which has still to be considered, deals with-the question he is debating.",49
236,Mr GREGORY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"No ; I am dealing with the pre-war standard question raised , by the honourable member for Flinders.",49
237,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I remind the honourable member that a clause has been recommitted which deals specially with the subject to which he is referring, and he might defer his remarks until that clause is under consideration.",49
238,Mr GREGORY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"If the Minister in charge of the Bill will say that, when we come to that clause, some means will be devised to overcome the difficulty to which I am referring, I shall be content.",49
239,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The honourable member is practically suggesting that there shall be no pre-war standard.,49
240,Mr GREGORY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I am pointing out a difficulty that will arise under, the Bill as it stands, because I realise, as did the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Will i a m I r v in e ) that every effort should be made to induce people to bring forward new propositions to develop the resources of the country, so that when our men come back from the war there will be avenues of employment open to them in new in dustries. We should not now do anything that would block the establishment of new industries.",49
241,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The honourable member is suggesting that we should abolish the pre-war standard.,49
242,Mr GREGORY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I am pointing out that a company now making profits equal only to its pre-war standard of profits will not have to pay a sixpence of this tax, whilst a new company, with the same capital, and making the same profits of £12,000 a year, will take 10 per cent, of its capital, get an exemption of £1,000, and under the clause providing for wasting assets with ten years' life a further exemption of £1,000, and an exemption of one-fourth of the balance of £10,000 of its profits; but it will have to pay £7,500 in the shape of war-time profits tax, whereas the older company, making the same profit, will not pay a single sixpence. That is the anomaly to which I am directing attention, and I should like some means to be devised to deal with it .",49
243,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,We cannot overcome that M. difficulty if we are to have a war-time profits tax.,49
244,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,We could overcome it by abolishing the pre-war standard.,49
245,Mr GREGORY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I think that the difficulty might be met to some extent by assessing the war-time profits tax on the excess value arising from war conditions of the metals in which the company does its business. The company should be able to declare to the Commissioner of Taxes that, .for instance, the pre-war standard of the value of t in was so much per ton, and that the present price is so much in excess of that, and the company could be called upon to pay the tax on the difference between the value of the t in or of other metals prior to the war, and during the accounting period under this Bill . If that arrangement were made, I believe it would satisfy those engaged in such businesses as I have referred to, whilst it would not block the formation of mining companies, which I am sure the Government intensely desire to promote. If the Bill is passed as it stands, I am fearfu l that its effect will be to put an immediate stop to the formation of these new companies, and so will be very injurious to the Commonwealth. Honourable members are aware that mining is a very speculative business. Those investing in such a business anticipate larger profits than may be expected from any other venture, because mining is the most speculative of all industries. Although I recognisethese difficulties, I am prepared to support the Governmenb in connection with this part of the Bill in the hope that at a later stage of the measure some efforb will be made by the adoption of an amendment on the lines I have suggested to lessen the in j u ry which otherwise will be done to new companies.",49
246,Mr BOY D,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Henty) [8.24] - If the suggestions of the honprable member for Flinders (Sir Willia m Irvine) and the honourable member for Dampier (Mr . Gregory) are to be given effect, we might as well throw this Bill over-board altogether. The honourable members referred to are proposing to remove the very basis of this P ill , which is intended to impose a war-time profits tax. Both political parties, when appealing to the electors, said that they were going to get at the exploiters and profiteers, meaning the men who have been making more money since the declaration of war than they were making before the war. If 'we abolish the pre-war standard, only thosefirmswho were making profits equal to more than 10 per cent, of their capital before the war will be brought under this taxation. They may be mulct, in very heavy sums indeed. That was never contemplated in any of the Bills introduced by either political party. In all these Bills the pre-war standard of profit has been the basis beyond which the tax proposed was to operate. Any company earning so much before the war could earn that amount after the war commenced without being subjected to this taxation. No such company could be said to be profiteering or getting at the public, and neither party pledged itself to tax such people. The pre-war standard of profits'was the basis on which both parties appealed to the . country. I hope that the Government will not listen to the suggestion to abolish that standard, because it is the basis of the Bill, and if it were, abolished the Bill might just as well be withdrawn, and the suggestion made from half-a-dozen sources-to establish a super-income tax - adopted .",49
247,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,We do not propose to abolish the pre-war standard.,50
248,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I am pleased to hear the Treasurer say so. On this matter I am a solid supporter of his. The Bill is such an intricate problem, that there are very few people who understand it, and, therefore, I make the suggestion that after it passes through the Committee stage it should be reprinted with all the amendments incorporated in it before it is submitted to honourable members for the third reading. It is very necessary, on such an intricate measure, that honourable members should clearly see what they have done. I do not think thore is one honourable member except the Treasurer and the Honorary Minister (Mr Groom), who has beeu helping him so assiduously, who understands thoroughly its many ramifications. If the Government would consent to have a clean print of the measure made before the third reading comes on, it would facilitate the passage of the Bill.",50
249,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Yarra) [8.30] - We have been told that this Bill is ito give effect to a pledge that was made by the Prime Minister at Bendigo. The right honourable gentleman, when speaking at Bendigo, saidWealth has its duties and its responsibilities in this great struggle as well as manhood. No one should make a profit at his country's expense. The Government intends to proceed with the War-time Profits Tax Bill. But, apparently, the Government do not care how many amendments are made in it, or how many exemptions are placed in it, or what minimum is provided before any one shall pay the tax. Can the Honorary Minister say honestly that this Bill is anything like the form in which it was 1 introduced ?",50
250,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The underlying principle is the same.,50
251,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"-The first Bill contained no £1,000 exemption, nor did the Bill drafted by the honourable member for ",50
252,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,In his Bendigo speech the Prime Minister promised to deal with new businesses.,50
253,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Yes ; but they were to be left to a Board of Referees.,50
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Does the honourable' member object to the exemption provided?,50
255,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I said the other night that it was too high, and I say it again.",50
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,What does the honourable member consider a fair thing?,50
257,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,I am not here to frame the Government's financial policy. I am the last man that the Government would consult in the framing of that policy. They must accept the responsibility. They cannot shelter themselves behind the fact that this Bill was introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs).,50
258,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,We are not doing so.,50
259,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Severa l honourable members opposite have done so, and particularly the honourable member for jCalare  ber, "" It is your Bill,"" meaning the Bill introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia, but no one would recognise this Bill as that which was introduced by that honourable member. It contained no exemption of businesses with a profit of £1,000. There are other exemptions in this Bill which were not in the measure introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia. His Bill allowed a pre-war standard of 6 and 7 per cent. only. do not know what rates the Government will propose in their taxing According to the Treasurer's admission in his Budget speech, at least £2,000,000 has been taken from the people in the shape of excess profits, which, to my mind, should not have been taken, because he admits that by this process of taxation he is going to raise £1,000,000 or thereabouts. I think that the suggestion is that only 50 per cent, of the profits shall be taxed. The action of the Government reminds me of the case of a man who, when he was robbed of a shilling, said to the thief, "" Give me back od. and I will let you off."" The Government practically say to the persons vtfho will be affected by this taxation, "" We will allow you to keep the first £1,000 for yourselves."" honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) has said, very few honourable understand the Bill. It is whether the £1,000 exemption is not in addition to the 10 per cent, profit which can be allowed. It is also very whether persons will not be allowed a pre-war standard in addition. The Bill has been mangled. I sympathize - with the Treasurer in his indisposition. troubled with the sort of throat most of us have after an election campaign and I trust that he will be better soon. The only vigorous speech he has made on this measure was the one in which he fought for the exemption the honourable member for Henty moved to be struck out. Let honourable members look through the Hansard record for last 'week, and they will see that there was not one speech made by a member of the Government in defence of the principles of the Bill. The honourable member for Hindmarsh said at half-past 5 o'clock the other morning, and the honourable member for Grey said this afternoon, "" When it was a question of the conscription of life you said that the men had to go, but when it is a question concerning taxation you say, ' We will treat these people very gingerly. We will put the hand in a velvet glove. let them go. We will allow one to escape whom ?it is possible to exempt.' '' There is no honourable member on the other side, whether he understands the Bill or not, there is not even a Minister who can state what amount is likely to be received. There has never been a Mr Tudor. We taxation, measure submitted to any Pat* liament which has been so mangled as has measure. this one. It has been subjected to'very severe criticism even from the supporters of the Government. A f t e r it ran the gauntlet of their Caucus meeting upstairs last Thursday; after the definite principles were decided upon, honourable members on the other side came here and twitted us with having supported Bill's",50
260,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL, I hope that the honourable member will not pursue that line of argument.,51
261,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,If honourable members state that a Bill has gone before our Caucus that is all right. As the The CHAIRMAN - Order! .,51

The honourable member knows that his proper course is to move dissent from my ruling. Before he writes out his dissent, I take this opportunity of saying that under the Standing Orders, and in accordance with all the rules and prac- ' tice of the British House of Commons, the Chairman is charged with the responsibility of preserving order in the Committee, just as the Speaker has that responsibility in the House.",53

I know that the Chairman of Committees has no to power to ask for the suspension of an honourable member except through the House, but the Chairman has power to prevent disorder in Committee. The scene in which the honourable member for Bourke figured was decidedly disorderly, and wa« likely to lead to greater disturbance, and I took upon myself the responsibility of having the honourable member removed from his seat, so that disorder might cease.",53
321,Mr HIGGS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"My point of order is that you, sir, had no authority to order the Serjeant-at-Arms to remove the honourable member for Bourke from the chamber. The Standing Orders provide for every contingency in the way of disorder on the part of any honourable member. May I say that, i h my opinion, your duty was to do as you did in the case of the honourable member for M a n o a , wherein you named the honourable member, reported him to the Committee, and then called upon the Prime Minister to take the usual steps. I move That the ruling by the Chairman of Committees that he has the power to order the removal by the Serjeant-at-Arms of any member of the House of Representatives be disagreed to.

The Chairman of Committees is the guardian of the rights of all honourable members. Whenever any disorder occurs, it is the Chairman's duty to intervene immediately to see that order is restored. I did that, as the honourable member knows; and in his own case he made a graceful withdrawal fro m the position he took up.

372,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"That is quite right. The House may censure; but in this case there was no report to the House, and the Committee did - that. The Chairman is charged with the preservation of good order. In other States, particularly the State to which I belong, there is a clear and distinct ruling to this effect. In dealing with this matter, I was particularly careful in regard to the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey), because, personally, I have always been on the best of terms with him, and I know that he has no desire to defy the Chair; but the Committee will see at once that if v serious disorder arises, and if the Chairman were not authorized to preserve order in the intervening time, there could be no report from the Committee to the House except after a lengthened period. This wo""uld lead to a very grave position, such as has happened in some of the State Houses. Our Standing Orders are perfectly clear. I call the attention of the Committee to standing order 227 This is one of our own standing orders, and if honourable members do not approve of it , then, by resolution of the House, it may be referred to the Standing Orders Committee for revision. It providesThe same rules for regulating the conduct of business shall be observed in Committee as in the House itself, the Chairman of Committees being invested with the same authority as the Speaker for the preservation of order That .appears to be perfectly clear.

The Committee will resume at the point a*t. which its deliberative proceedings were interrupted. In Committee: ' Mr TUDOR (Yarra), [9.50]. - I do not know whether the time occupied, in these divisions and points of order is counted in my allotted time, bub I know that when I started about 8.32, I had not spoken for more tlian five or six. minutes when I was charged with doing what other honourable members had done, namely, indulging in a general debate. At that time, I was pointing out that the Bill before us, so far from fulfillin g the Government's pledge, is a fraud and a sham; and I say that deliberately. The measure does not fulfil one single word of the pledge of the Government; and I pointed out that, during the afternoon, the honourable member  member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald), ancl others behind the Government, had said the same thing. The whole anxieby of honourable members opposibe does nob seem to be to secure a perfect taxation measure, but to see how many people they can exempt from taxation.  War-time Profits Bill .",60
425,Mr TUDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"You r only anxiety is to exempt as many people as possible, and. to make a mere pretence of the Bill .",60
426,Mr RODGERS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"We have the support of the honourable member, for Batman (Mr . .Brennan) in making exemptions.",60
427,Mr TCJDOR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I do not care what support the Government have; the fact remains that the majority of honourable members opposite will have to shoulder the responsibility for this Bill , which is absolutely a farce and a fraud on the public- a mere pretence at being a war-time profits measure. The Treasurer (Sir John Forrest) has admitted that he does not know how much revenue it will bring in , considering the exemptions that have been made. He first of all brought one section of the community within the operation of the Bill , and then exempted that section. This is fooling the people. During the elections, we told the people that the measure was intended to fool them!, but they did not believe us. Now/, however, they will see what this measure is bhat is put for th as the finished product of this "" W in - the - w a r"" Government.",60
428,Mr WEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"East Sydney) [9.52] - 1 had not intended to speak on the Bill as presented bo us bo-day, bub I cannob keep silent when I observe the attitude of honourable' members opposite, who are supposed to represent the views of' the Government, and who, in the shorb interval since the'election, cannot have forgotten the pledges they gave on the hustings. If it be. permissible,. I shall say that those honourable gentlemen behind the Government are simply a body of tax dodgers. Hardly one of them who has spoken has not shown that there is some section of the community whom he wishes to exempt. Is there one of them, however, who did not tell the people during the elections that, if returned, he would be prepared to tax those who had made profits during the war-wh o did not impress on the public that while a duty devolved on all young men to go to the Front, there was a needful duty on those who were left behind to support our fighting Forces?",60
429,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL, I asked the Leader of the Opposition not to pursue that line of argument.  East Sydney (Mr West) is not the Leader of the Opposition.,60
430,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I am sure we do not desire any more disorder. I have twice called the attention of the Committee to the fact thab the clause before the Committee merely sets out the parts of the Bill . The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor), when speaking, proceeded to deal with pre-election events, but desisted when I asked him to do so. I now ask the honourable member for East Sydney .(Mr West) to follow the example of his leader and assist the Chair to confine the discussion to the question before the Committee.",60
431,Mr WEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I have been as regular in my attendance in the chamber as has any other member of the Committee. I'have listened to the debate which has taken place on this clause, and have noted that honourable members have been allowed a certain latitude. If I have transgressed it is owing to the latitude which has been allowed to other honourable members.",60
432,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Order ! I have indicated to the Committee that I did, perhaps, improperly allow more latitude than I should have done. I have called the attention of honourable members on both sides to the clauses of the Billthat have been recommitted for consideration, and to the fact that if they restrained themselves in debating this clause they would not be deprived of their privilege of discussing the clauses to'which they wished to refer when they came on for eonsideration. The honourable member for East Sydney is discussing a matter quite outside the clause, and, as he is an old and experienced Parliamentarian, I ask him to assist me in the performance of my duties in the chair. Mr ""WEST - My transgression may be due to the influence of the company I have kept. I have no desire to fall out with the ""Chair, but I could not help expressing myself as I have done, because it has at all times' been my desire to see the will of the people given effect. I believe that in this Bill the Government are not carrying out the will of the people. This is a serious moment in our history, and if I have transgressed the rules of debate, it must be due to my earnest determination to carry out the people's will, and see that legislation is passed in accordance with the views they have expressed. I believe that if we all went home, and asked the Government to reconsider their position, it would be a good thing to do. During this debate one honourable member has told us that he does not understand clause 3.",61
433,The CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Order ! Eor the information of honourable members. I shall quote clause 3, which is before the Committee. It provides thatThis Act shall be divided into parts lows:Part I - Introductory . Part II - Administration . Part III - War-tim e Profits Tax. Part IV - Computatio n of Profits. Part V - Pre-wa r Standard. Part VI - Capital . Part VTI - Return s and Assessments. Part VIII - Objection s and Appeals. Part IX - Collectio n and Recovery of Part X - Miscellaneous .",61
434,Mr WEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I do not think, sir, there is anything contained in the Bill that you have left out. I am entirely opposed to exemptions. I noticed a paragraph only, in today's newspapers to the effect that a son of the late Right Honourable John Bright, speaking of a measure similar to this passed by the British Parliament, stated that, owing to the exemptions provided for under it, the people of the United Kingdom were robbed of £200,000,000, which, but for those exemptions, would have been contributed in taxation by certain sections of the community. Honourable members opposite are proposing, in the same way, the exemption of certain sections from the payment of the war-time profits tax under this Bill. It is of no use for honourable members to blind themselves to the fact that we need revenue. We require £9,000,000 to pay interest, and yet honourable members are taking advantage of every opportunity to exempt from taxation under this measure persons who should be taxed. The Chairman of Committees (Hon. J. M . Chanter) has been for many years a politician, and I ask him whether he ever saw such a spectacle as we have seen today, when honourable members opposite have been trying to prevent the payment of taxation by those who are receiving profits upon which taxation should be levied. I hope that honourable members will not treat the principles of this Bill too lightly. They, no doubt, have friends whom they would like to relieve from taxation, but they should put the interests of the country before those of their personal friends. That is what I am doing. .Amongst my personal friends there are some who are perfectly willing to pay this taxation in order to assist the Commonwealth in carrying on the war. This is a quite exceptional time in our history, when .every one of us should be prepared to make sacrifices. The Treasurer (Sir John Porrest) tells us that he as folrequires money, and we are here to provide him with the means of obtaining it. The professional man, the man on the land, and the manufacturer should alike be prepared to assist the Government in this matter. We must submit to taxation in these times, and I ask» honourable members opposite, even at this Tax. late hour, to assist in obtaining revenue by the imposition of taxation that which the Parliament would not ask the people to bear at any other time. If I have done nothing else than impress upon honourable members the seriousness of the position, I have done good service for Australia. Clause agreed to. Clause 4 (Definitions). In this Aot, unless the contrary intention appears"" Business"" includes any. profession or trade and any transaction not in the course of a person's business for the sale and purchase of any commodity.

435,Mr STORY,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Boothby) [10.8] - It is my intention, when we reach it , to move an amendment to clause 14, dealing with the computation of profits, sub-clause 2 of which providesDeductions for wear or tear or for any expenditure of a capital nature for renewals or for the development of the business or otherwise in respect of the business shall not be allowed except as may be allowed for the purposes of the Commonwealth income tax. My amendment will be to insert the words "" o the r than for new business"" after "" allowed."" I have already put forward"" the claim that manufacturing businesses need protection; and this amendment, if ib is carried, will give manufacturers a certain amount of protection.

The Government are really allowing the come Tax Commissioner to enter this new sphere of taxation, which this Bill ports to deliver over specially to the Taxing Master to be dealt with under the powers it confers. The country thought that the Government were going to earment mark 50 per cent, of the excess profits for the first year, and 75 per cent, for second accounting period, whereas they are not doing so at all.",65

470,Mr RODGERS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I suggest that in come tax should be levied as at present on the normal profits, and that the Governshould be content with 50 per cent, of the excess profits. Take a pre-war in the come of £10,000, with excess profits of £5,000 in the first accounting period. My proposal is that the income tax should operate on the normal income, and that in respect of the £5,000 excess profits it should not operate, but that 50 per cent, those excess profits should be taken as a the war-time profits tax.",65

Suppose a pre-war income to be £1,000 and the excess profits to be £600, making the war-time the' income £1,600. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the income tax levied on to that £1,600 was £200. In dealing with income for ibhe purposes of the wartime profits tax, you deduct the £200 paid as income tax, thus reducing the inor come to £1,400, and from that the pre-war income, namely, £1,000, making the excess profit £ 4 0 0. Of that £ 4 0 0 the Government take 50 per cent., or £ 2 0 0 . The taxpayer, however, has already paid income tax on £1,600, and an adjustment is made by ascertaining the income tax leviable on £1,400 and deducting that from the income tax actually paid, refunding the difference.  that donet",65

473,Mr SINCLAIR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Moreton) [10.55] This appears to be the most sweeping exemption in the whole Bill , and one which will allow the larger taxpayers to escape. I quibe agree with the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) that relief should only be afforded the taxpayer in cases where, and to the exbent, that the income tax would operate ou excess profits. Ib is not fair that the income tax should operate on excess profits to the extent of 6s. 3d., and war-time profits to 50 per cent, or 75 per cent., as the case may be. Where a taxpayer's income tax is increased, he should be allowed bo sen it off against his war-time profits tax, but if he is allowed to recoup himself for the whole of his excess tax the Bill will yield very little revenue. I should like l o see the proviso wiped out altogether, or amended in such a manner as to assure to the Treasury the receipt of some revenue under this Bill . The clause is a very awkward one, and requires a good deal of consideration.",66

His instance was that of a man whose pre-war standard was £10,000, and whose taxing standard was £15,000. case he said he would first of all deduct income tax, which would be 6s. 3d. in the £ 1 , leaving then 13s. 9d. to be divided between the State and the individual. The complete answer to that is that from the £15,000 you take 6s. 3d. to sbarb with, which is £4,800, and you bring down his surplus revenue to £ 2 0 0 ; then you bake away from that amount the whole of - the State income and land tax, and wipe it out absolutely, there then being no excess profits to pay taxation upon.",66

I do noE want to do anything except that which is reasonable and fair, and I would like honourable members to realise that, if we pass this clause, irreparable in j u r y w i ll be.done to new companies.

I understood from the Minister the other night that the taxpayer had the option of a six-year period, whereas this sub-clause appears to tie h im down to three years.",69
498,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,That is to meet abnormal cases of loss.,69
499,Mr SINCLAIR,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,In the year 1914 there was a serious drought throughout provided for. Australia- a year of depression that no one would be able to choose as an accounthelp ing period.,69
500,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Sub-claus e 4 provides that T where the last three pre-war trade years have been years of abnormal. depression any two of the three preceding pre-war trade years may be substituted. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr GROOM) agreed toThat the word ""average"", sub-clause 3, be left out, and the words ""greater of the"" serted in lieu thereof. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 16(1) The amount of the capital of a business shall be taken to be the amount of its capital paid up by the owner in money or in kind, together with all accumulated profits invested in the business, with the addition, or subtraci tion of balances brought forward from previous years to Ihe credit or debit respectively of profit and loss account.  move That after the word "" kind,"" line' 3, the words "" or both, or at the option of the payer, the amount by which the value of the assets of the business exceeds the amount of the liabilities thereof "" be inserted. Unless some such amendment is the operation of this clause will be manifestly unfair. I take the case of an original selector of a piece of land, taking it up forty years ago at £ 1 per acre, bf a man holding the adjoining property, for which he has had to pay £ 8 per acre, In these circumstances the original pioneer is,"" will be taxed, under this clause, eight "" profits times as heavily as his neighbour. A be man in Victoria may be induced to go to New South Wales, and there purchase a piece of property at £ 4 per acre, whilst original selector of the adjoining land in New South Wales may have acquired it at £ 1 per acre. He will have to value his land at £ 1 per acre, whilst the other man will be able to value the adjoining property ab £ 4 per acre. If we leave the question of the value of land, and take the case pf the value of shares, one in vestor in bank shares may have paid £ 4 0 for bank shares, the market value of which today is £ 1 1 8 10s. The test should be the present value of the assets, the d if ference between assets and liabilities.",69
501,Mr FALKINER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"That would cut out borrowed money, which has already been  that. I think that the test should be the actual present'value of land.",69
502,Mr RODGERS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I rise to a point of order. The amendment proposed by the  is directly in conflict with clause 11A, which has already been agreed to by the Committee, and which makes provision for borrowed money. The amendment would n u l l i fy the effect'of clause 11A.",69
503,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL, I cannot refuse to accept the amendment on those grounds.,69
504,Mr SAMPSON,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Wimmera) [11.39] It is desirable to avoid any conflict between the amendment and clause"" 11A. In the case of a business accumulated reserves are to be regarded as capital, but n the case of land an original selector, .who paid £ 1 per acre for his land, will not be allowed to estimate his capital at more than the £ 1 per acre.",69
505,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,There is an allowance made for capital expended on land.,69
506,Mr SAMPSON,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Are we to undertaxstand that improvements made upon land by an original selector will be regarded in the same way as accumulated profits in agreed to the case of a business ?,69
507,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"The amount expended Upon improvements will be regarded as capital for the purpose of assessing the 10 and that per cent, standard.  do not consider the statement of the Honorary Minister (Mr Groom) at all satisfactory. The cost of improvements being allowed by no means compensates the owner of the land for the value added to the land by them. In the case of the ringbarking and clearing of timbered land, more than half the added value is due, not to the cost of the improvements, which' maj be a mere bagatelle, but to the time during which the improvementhas matured. It is the added value of improvements which is allowed for under the Federal land tax. I suggest that the Treasurer (Sir John Porrest) should agree to the insertion after the word "" kind "" of the words "" and the added value of his improvements.""",69
508,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"The 'honourable memberproposes that if £1,000 spent upon improvements has added £2,000 to the value of land, we should allow for the £2,000, and not for the cost of the improvements which have been responsible for the added value. The Government could not accept ""that  an amendment on the lines I have suggested.",70
509,Sir JOHN POKBEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I promise to give the matter consideration.,  view of the promise of the Treasurer (Sir John Forrest), I am willing to withdraw the amendment, but the statement now made by the Honorary Minister (Mr. Groom) conflicts with a statement made to me by Mr Collins in the presence of the Treasurer, that the land purchased at £1 per acre would be valued at that figure.",70
510,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"There must be some misunderstanding. The Commissioner assured me that the position is as I have stated it .  get the value of the land stated for land taxation purposes the Government assess it, not at the £ 1 per acre ,paid for the land, but at its present value. Apparently the Government wish to make the valuation of the land suit whatever form of 'taxation is imposed. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",70
511,Mr FALKINER,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,I do not intend to proceed with my amendment.,70
512,Mr LYNCH,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Werriwa) [11.46] - The point raised is a very important one. Though it is very difficult to appraise the value of land, we should not penalize the pioneer station-owners by contrast with others who have come in and purchased adjoining land within the last year or two. It is quite possible that this clause will tax very heavily the man who has accumulated large holdings, possibly by buying out other selectors, or by various members of the family taking up originally different blocks in years gone by. If such a person was fortunate enough to dispose of his pro- perty twelve months ago and then repurchase it , he would escape this taxation. A greater value attaches to land than is represented by the amount paid to the Crown, or the actual cost of improvements effected. These have been contributed to largely by members of the family at no cost in the shape of actual cash paid out. Yet there will be no allowance for the value of those improvements so effected. Perhaps it would be going too far to provide that the total improved value of the property shall be regarded as the value of the capital invested in it , yet some amendment should be made to give a fuller measure of justice to the holders of these properties. Otherwise their only protection will be to get in debt as much as possible. This clause will create a monstrous injustice which should not be permitted.",70
513,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The Treasurer has promised to consider the point raised by honourable members.,70
514,Mr RODGERS,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Particularl y when the value of a man's asset can be ascertained at the Land Taxation Office. Amendment (by Mr GROOM) agreed to- c That the word "" trading "" be inserted after the word "" accumulated "" in line 4. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 31 (Date of payment of tax).",70
515,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Henty) f l 1.531 - It is my intention to move an amendment to this clause. I spoke to the Treasurer (Sir John . Porrest) about the matter, but he could not see his way to accept it . I now wish to amend my proposition so that he may accept it as amended.",70
516,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,I cannot accept anything.,70
517,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I trust that the Treasurer when he hears my proposal will see how reasonable it is. My first suggestion was that firms who had provided for the payment of this tax by depositing their surplus revenue in war bonds should be entitled to pay the tax with those war bonds. My proposition now is that for the retrospective year of the tax, namely, for the year 1915-16, these bonds may be accepted in payment of the tax. It has been said dozens of times that business people had full notice of the imposition of this tax. But notice was not given until the 18th May, 1916, full y eleven months after the accounting period gan. Many firms, believing thab the would be dealt with at once, put their made? surplus profits into war bonds.",70
518,Sir JOHN PORREST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,And they done very well out of them.,71
519,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"If the Treasurer is not prepared to allow them to pay their tion for the current year in war bonds, he should at least accept those bonds in payment of the tax for 1915-16"". is a fair compromise.",71
520,Sir JOHN PORREST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,They anxious to get r i d of their war bonds. They are worth more than they paid for them.,71
521,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"If that is so, tihe amendment will be harmless, because they can sell their bonds and pay the taxation in cash.",71
522,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,We would have to float the bonds again.,71
523,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,I am suggesting a very fair compromise.,71
524,Mr MANIFOLD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,The Treasurer says that he will consider it .,71
525,Mr BOYD,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"That is.no good to me. I move That the following words be added to clause :- "" A taxpayer may pay his . the year 1015-18 in Government war bonds he so desires."" Amendment negatived.' Clause agreed to.",71
526,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister ) [11.56] - I now ask the Committee to insert the new clause which I promised to bring down to enable the Government to make an arrangement with the Imperial Government, as the New Zealand Government have done, to that prevent excessive taxation. I moveTliat the following new clause be inserted:"" 8A. In any case where war-time are chargeable with war-time profits under this Act, and are also chargeable in business. Great Britain with excess-profits - duty, under any Act of the Imperial Parliament imposing an excess-profits duty, the surer may agree with the Chancellor of the Imperial Exchequer, or other rized person, for the apportionment tween the Imperial and the Commonwealth Governments towards the supplies necessary - for the services of His Majesty of the war-time profits tax derived pursuant to this Act or the excess-profits duty derived pursuant to the Imperial Act (whichever provides the greater amount), and may further agree that in any such case the tax or duty (as the case may be) chargeable pursuant to the other of these Acts shall not be collected.""",71
527,Mr SAMPSON,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,Will the Minister be .begood enough to explain what provision Bill as to time for paying the tax has been,71
528,Mr GROOM,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"I will state the effect have of clauses 31 and 33. Under the Bill a man was called upon to pay his tax t h i r ty days after he received the notice of assesstaxament. We were told that that period was too short, and so we agreed to amend clause 33 so as to allow t h i r t y days grace That without a 10 per cent, penalty, giving the taxpayer, in effect, sixty days for are not payment. We are not going to collect the two years' tax at once. Time will be allowed between the making of the two payments. Any person can also apply to the Commissioner for an extension beyond the period of sixty days, and the Commissioner oan delegate the power to grant an extension to his deputy. Proposed new clause agreed to. Bill reported with further amendments. Standing Orders suspended. Motion (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That the reports be now adopted.",71
529,Mr LECKIE,DEFENC E INSTRUCTIONAL,"Indi) [11.59] - I wish to get from the Minister an assurance the that he will consider one point which I tax for spoke to him about, and that is if the. faet that the accounting period is to end previous to the 4th August. In the case of a business which balances on the 31st August, the period of eleven - months previous to the date of the outbreak of the war will not come into the accounting period. To a new business that will be a great hardship. I should like the Minister to give me a promise he will go carefully into Irhis matter again, and that if convinced that m y contention is fair he will have a small amendprofits ment made in the Senate.

Could oversea steamer l'ort Sydney be seat on to Brisbane direct from Melbourne)' Farmers suffering through crops of pineapples rotting, cannot send to Melbourne or Sydney markets.. In view of the serious fact that f r u it gruwers in and around Brisbane and the North Coast, arid also around Cleveland k and Redland Bay, are unable to send f r u it to the southern markets, thereby emailing great losses upon them, and also inconvenience to residents of Queensland owing to their inability to secure, certain articles of food at this time, I trust that the Governmenb will take steps to see either coastal or oversea boats or both resume running as far as possible.  vernment intend to proceed with tomorrow ?",72
