0,NA,Unknown,"people of Australia do - not propose to denude this country of defenders by throwing its men into a fight on the other bide of the world - The Leader of the Opposition said that the parties are divided with regard to industrial relations. The honourable member for Swan (' Mr Gregory) spoke of' the coal strike, but my view in regard to that disturbance is entirely different from that taken by the honourable member or by the Prime Minister. 1 believe that the coal strike was, in effect, in the same category us the engineers' strike, the strike on the Clyde, and the strike in South Wales in Great Britain during the last war.",54
1,Mr GKKOOKY,Unknown,Thos e people did not have arbitration courts.,54
2,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"- So me of them did have legislation for the compulsory settlement of disputes. It must be remembered that there cannot be a dispute unless there arc ' two or move parties at variance. In my opinion the Prime Minister made flic champion of the masters against the men. I am glad he did not pursue h'is policy to its logical extreme, because I am satisfied that, had he done so. he would have destroyed all possibility of national unity. I do not, believe that it is possible to get rid of industrial strife completely in time of war, but I believe that we should be able to got a lot nearer to completely eliminating it if we had better industrial machinery. The A r b i tration Court, has done a great deal of good work, but where it has failed is that it has continued to lay down a general standard for all industries, all workers, and all sorts of disputes; it has tried to put everybody into a sort of Procrustean bed in order to secure uniformity. The Arbitration Court said, in effect, that it could not consider the claim of the coalinincrs for reduced hours because, if it gave a. forty-hour week to the coal industry, it would be creating a precedent for other industries, and for future occasions. We must overhaul our industrial legislation which has existed unchanged since 1904. We must have a number of different types of arbitration tribunals, presided over by men who know in dustry. Our system should be such that we will be able to remove industrial f r i c tion when it first appears. AVe should use [ °1 4 our enlarged defence powers to lay down standards for the time of the war by means of legislation passed in this chamber. I think I may say without egotism that there are members on this side of the House- I am one-wh o have considerable experience of the working of industrial legislation, and if there is anything I can do to assist in bringing about this need, and making possible the removal of friction, .I shall regard it, as my duty to do it. During the last war the Federal Government in the United States of America did great work and constituted a National War Relations Board which was a kind of pyramid, at the apex of which there was a chief board presided over by two chairman who took the chair at alternate meetings. One chairman was a nominee of the employers, ex-President Taft, afterwards Chief Justice of the United States of America, and the other was a nominee of the employees, Frank P. Walsh, who had been chairman of the himself Industrial Relations Committee. That body said, "" W c have the machinery by which we can deal with all of your industrial trou'bles as soon as they arise. We shall deal with them on the basis that if you submit them to us you must not be on strike "". The result was that although it was not illegal to strike, and no attempt was made by law to prevent people from striking, the alternative system offered to the workers by the government was so satisfactory that there were no strikes at all, or at least only very small ones. The United States of America today has a more efficacious system of dealing with industrial disputes than has Australia. Of course, America has given a great deal more to the workers by law than the workers in Australia have received.",54
3,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Bot h sides arc left free in the United States of America.,54
4,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"That is not so. The employers are forced to recognize, meet and confer with the unions. That is not the case in Australia. What happens here is that the court summons a compulsory conference. The representatives of the two sides sit opposite, glower at each other, and do nothing. They cannot be compelled to confer. The iudge thereupon declares that the conference has failed and refers the matter .i : to the court. That is not the procedure in the United States of America. - Mr RANKIN - What are we fighting for today?",54
5,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"I shall deal with <hat point later in my speech. Another issue on which the Leader of (lie Opposition said that we were opposed to the Government was in relation to coercion. The honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) said that the Leader of the Opposition had declared against compulsory military training. 1 did not gather that that was his point at all. He was expressing opposition to the methods of compulsion adopted by the Government, not only in relation to military service, but also in relation to the suppression of opinion and the disbanding of certain organizations and associations. It is government policy to act in this way, and while that remains so, we cannot be expected to agree with the Government. Whatever may be the opinion held on this side of the House concerning the Communist party, we do not wish, as J understand it, to see that party suppressed or its members denied the opportunity to express their opinion. I believe that the reasons which are impelling the Government to take steps to suppress the party are related not to its belief that the party is a menace to Australia, hut, first, to its desire to make political capital by connecting the Labour party with the Communist party and secondly to its desire to placate an enormous number of middle-class Roman Catholics who are opposed to the Communist party because of differences of religious opinion which T think are quite irrelevant to the main problem. The previous Commonwealth Government attempted to suppress the Communist party by other methods. I refer to the repressive measure passed years ago which provided for proceedings in our law courts. The Minister for Commerce (Mr Archie Cameron) regaled the Millions Club, a few days ago, with a story of subversive activities which he had discovered in 1935.",55
6,Mr AKCHIE CAMEBON,Unknown,"I did not discover them. I was informed of them, and they occurred in 1931, when a Labour government which was in office did nothing about it.",55
7,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"We have an act on our statute-hook which provides that any association may be declared an unlawful association by order of the High Court. After that course has been taken every member of such an association becomes stamped with a stigma of being a member of an unlawful association. An unlawful association is defined, in brief, as an association which advocates the overthrow, by violence, of the Government of - this or any other country. The Lyons Government took action under the Crimes Act to have the Communist party declared an unlawful association. The matter arose in this way: The Friends of the Soviet Union published a newspaper called Soviets To-day, which incidentally, this Government has now succeeded in suppressing. On the occasion to which I am referring the government of the day refused permission for Soviets To-day to be carried through the post. The proprietors of the newspaper took the remedy they had under the Post and Telegraph Act of suing the Commonwealth Government. The Government took steps in the High Court, in June, 1935, to have the proprietors of the newspaper-the Friends of the Soviet Union-declare d an unlawful association. It then contended that the Friends of the Soviet Union was affiliated with the Communist party which, it was alleged, was an unlawful association. So action was taken to have both bodies declared unlawful associations. This action, which was taken in August, 1935, was based on the allegation that the Communist party advocated the overthrow of constitutional government by violence. The proceedings were still before the court in May, 1937, at which time they finally disappeared quietly in this way: The action brought by the proprietors of the Friends of the .Soviet Union was dismissed without costs by the consent of the Friends of the Soviet Union. The action taken hy the Commonwealth Government was then dismissed hy the consent of the Commonwealth Government, and the Government removed the postal ban which had applied to Soviets To-day and also to about twenty other newspapers. It seems to me to be curious that there has been no change in the character of the speeches against this body. Honourable gentlemen opposite say, "" We know that this is a subversive organization, the purpose of which is to destroy constitutional government "". The Commonwealth Government had an opportunity to prove this charge before the court between 1935 and 1937, but it did not take it . Instead it surrendered its opportunity and said, "" ""We shall drop our proceedings and we shall also withdraw the postal ban on Soviets To-day and other newspapers "".",55
8,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,Who was the Attorney General at that time?,56
9,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"The Prime Minister. The Minister for Commerce was not a. member of the Government, but. his colleague, the present Postmaster-General (Mr Thorby), was in the Cabinet. I dissent entirely fro m the views and methods of the Communists, but the differences between myself and the Communists are much less than those between myself and the United Australia party, because the ultimate objective of the Communist party and myself is really identical. The ultimate objective of the United Australia party is not at all identical with my objective.",56
10,Mr HUTCHINSON,Unknown,Does the honourable member believe in the destruction of everything?,56
11,Mr BLACKBUBN,Unknown,"I do not believe in destruction; nor do I believe in the adoption of violence of any kind as a method of securing changes. I doubt if even the Communist party believes in it . What the Communist party says is : ""Before any fundamental change can be made in our system the possessing class will take up arms to resist it , and the workers have to be prepared for that "". 1 do not agree with the adoption of that course. I do not believe that any change is worth paying for by violence or by the - lestruction of a single innocent life. I fail to see how the use of force to effect changes can do other than bring ruin and destruction upon innocent people and, consequently, I am against that method. Whatever opposition I had towards the Communist party was intensified after the war began, when the Russian Government sent its forces into Finland. A large number of people in this community, and also in the Labour movement, feel exactly as I do in that connection, although others tried to apologize for what Russia did. Our opponents seized the opportunity to say "" Now let us make war on Russia "" . They pretended that because Russia had invaded Finland Great B r it a in should make war on Russia. I disagree with that view. However I detest the Russian invasion of Finland. I must say that I regard the Russian experiment in government as one of the greatest that the world has ever known. I do not wish to see it fail or destroyed. Thousands upon thousands of workers, and people who are not Communists, present feel as I do. We do not wish to see the war turned against Russia.",56
12,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,Who said we wanted war against Russia?,56
13,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"I do not believe that I am far wrong when I express the belief that the Minister for Commerce has been advocating for a long time past, that Great B rita in should go to war with Russia.",56
14,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,I have not been able to distinguish between German aggression against Poland and Norway and Russian aggression against Finland. If it were a crime for Germany to invade those countries it was equally a crime for Russia to do so.,56
15,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"I agree that it was a crime, hut I cannot see that that is a sufficient reason for advocating war against Russia. This advocacy has made men feel that the anti-Communist action in Australia is a cloak to cover war against socialism. In my opinion it would be a serious crime for Great Britain or France, or any other country, to use the Russian invasion of Finland as a pretext for an attempt to destroy Russia. I look upon the Russian Revolution as many other people now look upon the French Revolution. The French Revolution caused a great deal of bloodshed and repression, hut, in its ultimate result, it effected one of the most beneficial changes that the world has ever known. The Russian Revolution may do the same thing. The activities of the Government against the Communist party are regarded by great masses of workers not as a means of attacking the principles of the Communists, but as a means to secure an advantage over the Australian Lahour party. "" We have heard it said over and over again by certain individuals that they draw a distinction between the Leader of the Labour party, who, they say, is a patriotic man, and some other members of his party who, they say, are guilty of subversive actions. They go on to say, "" We know that certain Labour organizations and certain members of the Labour party will defend the Communist party as long as we keep attacking it. We shall therefore keep on attacking it for it will enable us to brand the Labour party with the stigma of communism"". It has been said that members of the Communist party who are also members of trade unions have dictated trade union policy and so caused strikes. I point out, however, that there were strikes during the great war before the Communist party existed. It was said, at that time, that the strikes were due to an organization known as the Industrial Workers of the World. The power of this Parliament was used to destroy that organization. An act was passed which declared it an unlawful association. That measure was passed, I believe, when the members of the Industrial Workers of the World were accused of having started certain fires. Some members of the organization were tried for this offence, convicted, and sent to prison. Several years afterwards all of them, excepting one, were liberated. If members of the Communist party are officials of trade unions this is not to be taken to mean that the workers are favourable to communism. It indicates, rather, their desire to appoint to official positions the most efficient members available in their organization. Communists who have been elected to office in different trade unions have been chosen because they were believed to be efficient by their union colleagues. The policies of the trade unions are not dictated by the Communists. The policy of the coal-miners - union was not so dictated. This was proved conclusively hy the ballots taken recently when great majorities were recorded in favour of a certain course of action. The few Communists who might be in those unions could not possibly have influenced that vote to such a great degree. The policies of the trade unions Mr Blackburn. are dictated by the trade unionists themselves. To say that the coal-miners are as wax in the hands of the few Communist leaders is an insult to the men.",56
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The debate is now very wide of the subject-matter of the paper referred to in the motion.,57
17,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"I connect my remarks, Mr Speaker, in this way: The Government did not use its power to repress the Communist party in peace time. As I have pointed out, it actually abandoned legal proceedings that it had initiated.",57
18,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,The Government did not intern Germans in peace time.,57
19,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"The argument that is now being used in order to justify action against the Communists is that they are causing industrial trouble. I have indicated what I regard as three . impassable gaps between honourable members opposite and ourselves. I do not. believe that it is practicable to form a national government while those gaps remain, and it seems to me that they are of such a nature that we cannot bridge them. However, that is not to say that there is the slightest reason why, even having regard to our differences of opinion, we should not work together on the big task before us.",57
20,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,It is ridiculous to suggest that we can work together when we have ideals on which we cannot agree.,57
21,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"I have no desire to remind the Minister for Commerce of certain things which he has said in the past. In fact I am not concerned about; them at all at the moment. I am trying to conduct this discussion on a purely impersonal basis. The Minister was not in the chamber when I said that on this side of the House there were men whose experience in industrial matters was probably unrivalled, either inside of Parliament or outside of it. I added that we were prepared to put our services at the disposal of the Government in any way that would tend to minimize industrial friction and preserve continuity of industrial operations during the war, provided that in doing so we do not sacrifice the interests of the people we represent. I. know that the Government and the Opposition cannot work together towards u common end. That is why the two parties cannot unite in a national government. But surely there are things which the Opposition can do to hring about an easier solution of the Government's problems. I believe it is possible to create machinery which will make it unlikely that there will be. industrial stoppages during the war.",57
22,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Bichinond) [9.16] The subject of this debate is Australia's increased war effort. I propose to confine my remarks to that subject, and avoid following those honourable members who raised controversial issues. I was in Sydney on Sunday last and I felt deeply impressed by the numbers of people who filled the churches to overflowing, seeking spiritual support and guidance in their determination to carry ou this struggle which will affect the destiny of our nation as well as other nations for generations to come. Few of those who prayed imagined that their prayers would be answered by some-sudden success of our armed force?, unless the efforts of those forces were accompanied by deeds of courage, by endurance, by the sacrifice of thousands of lives and by the provision to those forces in the air, on the sea and on land, of equipment equal to that of the enemy. What the people of the Empire prayed for was the strength, determination and courage to carry on the fight to final victory so that the will to win should be unimpaired by any reverses which wo might meet on the way. To-night we have heard news of serious reverses in the theatre of war in Belgium. There may be other hard knocks to come. But, whatever may be the final verdict in Belgium, the continuance of this war to final victory is an essential. Even if the Government has not the active co-operation of all parties in this House, it has behind it the strength of all classes of the people outside. It is a matter for very great regret it has not been possible to secure the acceptance of joint responsibility in the Government by members of the Opposition. I shall not discuss the motives which prevent; those honourable gentlemen from participating in the formation of a national government. They have expressed certain reasons for their stand which may, or may not be, sound. But the time will come when we will have to close our ranks and forget even the differences of ideals that were stated by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn). When all is said and done, those differences are insignificant in relation to the very big issues confronting us today. If the prayer of the people so fervently expressed on Sunday can be given a practical answer by the Government, that answer will be by the Government's increased purpose in the national effort and the trebling of its energies in the work which confronts it. This is not the time for recrimination. I believe that if any honourable member had before the dinner adjournment prepared a speech that contained any recriminatory statements, he must have been strongly inclinedto tear it up on hearing the grave news from overseas. The Government needs help and support. It needs a sympathetic understanding of its problems. It also needs the spur of helpful criticism ancl commentary applied by honourable members. It is not all-wise, It is not acquainted with the ideas and reactions of all sections of the people, and, therefore, honourable members can do a service to the country, without being hurtful to the Government, by giving helpful criticism and commentary whenever they think it is needed. The people are anxious for action indicative of resolution, steadfastness of purpose, and a proper conception of today's serious situation. Effort and sacrifice are now to be ourportion. Eor the first eight months it almost seemed as though the Avar were being conducted in an atmosphere of peace. We carried on our normal recreations and business customs. Those days are gone. The majority of the people today are ready to do whatever is required of them in the national interest. Those who will not co-operate, should be forced to do so, that under the poAvers which the Government possesses. If any lesson is to be learned from the fighting in Flanders, it is that intensely trained men, in large numbers, modernly equipped, are an essential of warfare which Ave, too, must haA'e to the limits of our capacity. There are, of course, physical and practical limits to what we can do, but I believe that we often regard as insuperable obstacles which appear so only because our approach to them is out of date and lacking in determination. Many tasks which we think are impossible and which Ministers tell us are impossible, can be accomplished if they are approached with the conviction and determination that they can and must be done. There is but one solemn duty and purpose confronting the Government, the Parliament and the people today-the defence of Australia at home and abroad. Nothing else matters very much. I have felt strongly, since news was first received of the invasion of Belgium, that we should set aside all matters not directly pertaining to the prosecution of the war. The Government has adequate powers under the National Security Act to deal with all other matters, and I believe that the co-operation of the Opposition, if it were sought, would be readily given in an endeavour to avoid discussion in Parliament of any subjects of lesser moment than the winning of the war. We must double, treble and even quadruple our rate of production in defence industries. It is useless for Ministers to tell honourable members, in answer i;o questions asked in this chamber, that double shifts, or even treble shifts, cannot be worked in munitions factories. It can be done if there is the will to do it. Thousands of skilled men are engaged at the present time in unessential occupations. Their services could be secured for the nation's war effort if the seriousness of the position were properly put to them. There would be no need to employ industrial conscription or deprive them of their personal liberties. Thousands of men are engaged on relief works and other jobs, such as the construction of scenic roads and tourist tracks-facilities for the enemy, in fact, should it ever invade this land. Their services could easily be diverted to constructional work of a character which would be valuable to us in our present extremity. The spirit of the people must be mobilized. There is today a great deal of concern among Australians; and at times it may amount even to some weakening of the morale. The surest Mr Anthony. way to strengthen that morale is to give the people something useful to do when they want to do it, and make them feel that each one is helping towards a successful conclusion of the war. I know that many thousands of men capable of helping the nation in this emergency are denied the opportunity to do so, because they are a year or two over military age, or for some other relatively unimportant reason. An expert mechanic or engineer 50 years of age would be as good as one 40 years of age as a fitter in an aircraft, factory. In many instances he would be better, because he would possess more experience than younger men. I know highly qualified men who time and again have offered themselves for some sort of war-time service. Many of them have written to me asking me to use any influence that I possess in order to secure the acceptance of the service which they willingly offered, in some cases without asking for remuneration. The Government should co-opt the services of every one capable of helping the nation at this time. It is not sufficient to offer to these people, a and to their representatives in this Parliament, polite refusals and then to sidetrack them for the duration of the war. It is the duty of the Government to organize the resources of the nation. Should it decide to take the strongest, a.ction, it will have the support of the vast majority of the people. The services of every citizen ought to he utilized, [n the last resort, the Government will probably demand the services of every person capable of serving. Individual liberty and civil rights will become a thing of the past if we lose the war, and, with it, our general rights. The safeguarding of individual and civil rights can he ensured only if we are able to safeguard the general rights of the community. I believe that at this juncture the Government could ask for any sacrifice, and that the people would respond. Recriminations will avail us nothing now. We all can be wise after the event; that retrospective view is of no benefit, except insofar as we can learn from our mistakes to do better in the future. Finally, I say that the greatest gap in this country through which the enemy can drive is the division in our own ranks. I sincerely hope that, even now, the members of the Opposition and those who are not direct supporters of the Government, hut recognize as clearly as does any member on this side of the House how serious the situation really is, will change their views regarding co-operation with the Government, and after consultation with their organizations outside-and that I realise is essentia]-wil l adopt a different attitude, with the result that Parliament itself will reflect the unity of the people outside. [Quorum formed.]",58
23,Mr WARD,Unknown,"East Sydney) [9.33] Like my colleague, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn), I believe that the present situation is too grave for any member of this Parliament to try to make party political capital out of it. Whatever observations I shall make during this discussion, I shall make solely with a view to helping the people of this country. I am of the opinion that the best thing that could happen at the moment would be for the Government to make way for a Labour government, as that would enable a proper defence policy to be put into operation. The present Government is inefficient; it has merely muddled along since the war began. As the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) said, there is an outcry against the Government from every section of the community. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) frankly admitted that the only purpose that a national government would serve would be that, with all of the parties united, the workers could be coerced into accepting whatever conditions the Government saw fit to force upon them. He said that had there been a national government, there would not have been a coal strike. There willnever be an effective defence policy for this country while the government in office represents the monopolies. Honourable members who are older than I am will recollect that, during the last war, private enterprise was responsible for the scandals connected with the KidmanMayo contracts for the building of ships. In that crisis private enterprise was unable to rise to the occasion and give unselfish service to the country. Instead, it used the difficulties confronting the country'to enrich itself. To-day we have in office a government similar to that which was in office at the termination of the last war. The Government has modelled its defence system in accordance with the wishes of monopolistic interests, principally the Broken H i ll Proprietary Company Limited. It has done so to such a degree that the functions of Parliament are being handed over to the big business executives. Mr. Essington Lewis was first an adviser of the Government, but from now on he will practically direct the Government's policy. In the present grave situation, a Labour government would not talk to these big monopolistic interests about limiting their excess war profits, but would say that there was no reason why any individual or company should make exorbitant profits as the result of the war activities of the Government. It would see that industries were taken over in theii entirety as part of a scheme for the proper organization of the defence effort. The Government would have the workers believe that it intends to call for equality of sacrifice. It claims that it will limit war profits, but it does not explain what is meant by excessive profits. We know well what will happen. The Treasurei (Mr Spender), in deciding upon a war profits tax, fixed certain classifications to determine the rate of interest which companies may earn, hut he made certain that those classifications were satisfactory to the big business executives. That they were satisfied with the Government's policy is evident from the fact that immediately the Government's proposals were announced, the shares in many companies rose in value. The Government has made no real effort, to prevent war profiteering. It asks the Opposition to assist it in a full-blooded war effort. What is meant by that? Instances have been brought to light of manufacturers supplying inferior goods to the Department of Supply and Development, but instead of the Government taking action against them, it has deliberately used its powers in such a way that these unscrupulous manufacturers and suppliers of inferior goods have been able to enrich themselves at the country's expense.",60
24,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,That is not so.,60
25,Mr WARD,Unknown,"The honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) would have us believe that no evidence has been submitted of the existence of such a state of affairs. I remind him of the revelations made in this House in connection with the supply of military boots, and of the victimization of a zealous officer because he did his duty in rejecting boots of inferior quality. I ask honourable members opposite why it is that Australia is in such a precarious position in regard to its defence. Governments of a similar political colour to that which now occupies the treasury bench have had control of this country for a number of years. Time after time they have rejected proposals which the Labour party considered were necessary for the defence of this country. The experience of other countries has at last convinced the Government of the importance of the air arm of our defence services, but, after eight months of warfare, the Government is able to utilize only one-tenth of the men who have offered to serve in the Air .Force. The reasons are that it has not sufficient aeroplanes to train them properly, and that there are not in this country the materials necessary for the construction of such machines. Even if the Government had the 'planes, it is doubtful whether it could be sure of sufficient supplies of petrol for their use. When the Labour party proposed that an industry should be established to extract oil from coal, the Government was not prepared to listen. Yet it is obvious that if the supplies of petrol from outside sources were cut off, Air Force machines could not remain in the air for long.",60
26,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"The machines of the Air Force could do so, as there would be sufficient petrol for the purpose. Mr ""WARD-Ha d an industry for the production of petrol from coal been established in this country, the position would be much more satisfactory. There is also a lack of shipping space for our exportable surplus products. It is true that under various schemes the Imperial authorities have agreed to purchase much of Australia's surplus production, but because of the lack of shipping space the problem of getting those products to the Old Country still remains. The Government, in a muddling way, instead of proceeding with the construction of ships, is having inquiries made, and is calling for reports for the consideration of Cabinet. The matter of shipping space has been discussed and examined over a period of years, and ample data with respect to it should be available. I believe that sufficient data are available to enable the Government immediately to proceed with the extension of the existing shipbuilding facilities, in order that it might make a proper contribution to the defence of this country. It now proposes the construction of a dockyard which will take three years to complete. The period of construction will probably be longer than three years because, although the Government, has reached the stage of having come to a decision, it is more than likely that another twelve months will elapse before the work is put in hand. The endeavour is being made to inculcate the idea that there is to be equality of sacrifice. Let us consider the present methods of financing the conduct of the war. We are living in unusual times, and I believe that the only government which could provide for the adequate defence of Australia is one which would be prepared to depart from the old orthodox methods of finance and try out new methods. It is necessary to re-orientate our ideas with respect to the financing of the war. Unless that be done, what will be the position of the workers of this country; how can they be expected to become enthusiastic in regard to the Government's programme? Prices are sky-rocketing, the purchasing power of the wages they receive is being reduced, and they are asked to exist under worse living conditions than those that they have previously enjoyed, whilst those who move in more influential circles-the wealthy section of the community-ar e not asked to make a contribution commensurate with their capacity. It is amazing to find that under the taxation proposals of the Government the increase of tax in respect of the worker with an income of £300 a year is to be 120 per cent., whilst the man whose income is £40,000 a year will have his tax increased by only 2 per cent. A man whose income from property amounts to £400 will pay an increased tax of 150 per cent, whereas one whose income from property is £1,000 will have his tax increased by only 12 per cent. Doubtless the Government believes that it can convince the people that these proposals represent. equality of sacrifice. If tomorrow the people were to place a Labour government in charge of the affairs of this country one of its first actions, in order to make adequate provision for our defence, would be, not to hand over the powers of the Parliament to business executives, but immediately to nationalize all war industries, and so develop and extend them as to make the fullest use of the whole of our resources, including manpower. As an example of inadequacy of preparation, I instance the single-track railway to northern Queensland. There are many essential defence works winch are not being undertaken by the Government, while thousands of men arc still walking the streets looking for employment and are being asked to exist ou a dole of 8s. 6d. a week. Our resources may be utilized fully only by the nationalization of our industries. Certain big business executives are more concerned about preserving their privileges and profits than anything else, and their political representatives in this Parliament are not prepared to do - anything which would displease them. Honourable members who have been interjecting are more concerned about defending capitalism than about winning the war. If , for instance, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser), who criticizes the point of view of the Labour party in these matters, had to choose between preserving capitalism and losing the war, he would prefer to lose the war. Government members may say, ""This is not the time for such criticism; what we want is co-operation from the members of the Labour party and from the workers' organizations outside "" ; but let us consider what the workers got out of the last war and what they are likely to get out of the present conflict. In an endeavour to induce Labour members to join a national government, bonorablo gentlemen opposite argue that we have to protect our liberties. Judging by what is happening, I believe that we shall have need to protect, our liberties in Australia as well as abroad. We cannot close our eyes to what is occurring. The Government uses a strict and excessive censorship against many journals in Australia. It has completely suppressed some, not because of their refusal to assist in keeping valuable information from the enemy, but because they have criticized the Administration. The Minister for Commerce (Mr Archie Cameron) says that in these times there is no room for any criticism. We kuow the record of that gentleman in regard to the defence of liberties. Before the outbreak of the war, he had earned the reputation of being what may be described as a petty dictator. Some months before the war began he wanted to disfranchize all women, ito take away from them all of their civil rights and liberties. The only right that he is prepared to grant to them is that of being slaves in the home. - That is exactly what he said-that they had only one niche in this community. Before there was any talk of subversive agencies, he closed down a broadcasting station, merely because it was criticizing the Government and himself personally. He does not like criticism. Then we have the Postmaster-General (Mr Thorby) who is such a champion of liberty that if he had the opportunity he would shoot members of the Opposition who disagree with him.",61
27,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,It was the Leader of the Opposition whom he mentioned.,62
28,Mr WARD,Unknown,"That is true. He would probably act similarly to other members of the Opposition. If we cared to examine the credentials of other members of the Government we should probably he able to show what their characteristics are. Take the Assistant Treasurer (Mr. Fadden) who sits complacently on the front ministerial bench. During the fir3t Darling Downs by-election, he described as "" bloodsuckers "" the very persons with whom he is in complete agreement today - the members of the United Australia party.",62
29,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not discussing the question before the Chair.,62
30,Mr WARD,Unknown,I am endeavouring to show that it is impossible for us to have any association in a national government with members of the present Administration.,62
31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not even doing that.,62
32,Mr WARD,Unknown,"Thes e gentlemen are today urging the co-operation, of the Labour.party in a national government for the one purpose of giving effect to a policy that is suitable to big business but unpalatable to the workers. They believe that they could induce the workers to swallow the dose only by prevailing upon some members of the Labour party to join them in a national government. One of the journals that are criticizing the Government is the Sydney Daily Telegraph. What does the Government propose to do with respect to it? Action to prevent its publication is not to be taken against it because of its criticism, for the reason that there are wealthy interests associated with it. Instead, if rumour be correct, the Government proposes to make one of the wealthy executives of the company, who formerly was a member of this Parliament, the Co-ordinator of Industrial Services. On the one hand, the Government is exercising its powers of suppression, and on the other hand, a form of political bribery in order to prevent criticism of its administration. Further, according to rumour, Sir Keith Murdoch is to be appointed to the position of adviser to the Government in connection with the Department of Information. Thus by gradual stages - the powers and the rights of this Parliament are being sacrificed. If the Government succeeded in its efforts to induce some honourable members of the Labour party to join in the formation of a national government- I am pleased that it will be unable to do so because we are unanimous in our opposition to the proposal-the next move would be to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson), to extend the life of this Parliament and to set up an outside organization in the form of a dictatorship which would take away every civil right and liberty that the people enjoy today.",62
33,Mr BERNARD CORSER,Unknown,The Labour party has joined in the formation of national government in Great Britain.,63
34,Mr WARD,Unknown,"The honourable member refers ito happenings elsewhere. At moment my concern is with what the tralian Labour party proposes to do in present situation. I join with the able member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) in saying that the Labour party and those who oppose it can have no received unity of purpose in respect of the ultimate goal. The objeot of honourable members opposite is to preserve capitalism and all that it means-hovel s in the cities, starvation among the workers, and inequality in the treatment of the community. The aim of the members of the Labour party is to end such conditions. For that reason, Labour members cannot be induced to enter a national government. I am chided with being unprepared to support the Government's efforts. I tell the Government that if the Labour party were given an opportunity to govern, the people of this country would have their shores properly defended. We believe that Australian man-power should be kept in this country for the defence of its shores, that Australia should have an air force powerful in its ability to strike in the defence of this country, and that the industries of the nation should be so developed that that air force could be put in action and kept in action against any invader, from whatever quarter he might come. Organizing the nation's resources, we would not bother to discuss with big business execu-t tives whatever problems arose in order to see whether it was possible or profitable for them to engage in Government undertakings or to make supplies available. On the contrary, we would nationalize and take complete control of their industries. By such means the resources of the nation could be organized as they never had been previously; and only a Labour government is capable of doing that. The workers are asked to make sacrifices for the defence of this country. Honourable members opposite should understand clearly that eventually the workers will come to the conclusion that if they have to make sacrifices they must obtain some of the rewards, and must not be treated as they were in the last war, when many unfortunates who went abroad returned a smashed in health and body, only to find that anti-Labour governments denied them pensions and even the opportunity the to obtain employment. I remind honorAusable members who complacently talk the about the responsibility of others that honorHitler could never have been in the position to develop his present effective war machine but for the support that he from eentain interests in Great Britain. Honourable members talk about the F if t h Column. Of whom is the F if t h Column composed in this country ? I ask the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr . Rankin) what persons in this Parliament and outside it endeavoured not very long ago .to prevent the shipment of war materials to Japan? The members of the Lahour party, the members of the trade unions, who had nothing to gain personally-the y were not striking for higher wages or better conditions of employment-realise d that the quarter to which' these materials were being shipped was the only quarter from which Australia might expect attack in the future. They refused to make the supplies available; but because the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited was concerned, aud because it. had its political representatives in this Parliament, it demanded that the men should be coerced into shipping war materials to a potential enemy. Labour, on the other hand, is prepared to defend this country, because it desires to build up in Australia a different form of society from that which has always existed here. Labour wishes to see proper development of industry in the interests of the peonle, and not in the interests of an influential few. Then this country would be able to give to its defenders, after they had rendered war service, an opportunity to bring up their families with a decent standard of comfort. The honourable member for Wide Bay would say that the Labour party does not believe in the sanctity of the home; but, after the last war, many returned soldiers could not remain with their families. They were forced to hump their swags along country roads, picking up a few shillings here and there, in return for their labour. The honourable member does not object to that, because he sits back on comfortable cushions in this Parliament and enjoys his parliamentary salary. Of course, the standard of living at Canberra is quite satisfactory to him ; but, in my electorate, and in many other parts of Australia, there are thousands who have to submit to a very low standard of living, not. only as the result of our participation in war, but also in peacetime. What does the Government propose to do to solve Australia's economic problems? We have a large surplus of primary products that cannot be disposed of. Mice are destroying wheat stacks; yet, in the cities, and even in the country towns, there is among the poorer sections of the community a dearth of food and clothing. The Government has no suggestion to offer as to how the food that is being wasted could be made available to those who art in sore need of it . One of our defence problems arises from the fact that we have a sparse population with which to defend a large country. Owing to the present insecure economic position of the working classes, many of them are not prepared to undertake the responsibility of rearing large families, and, consequently, the population is not, increasing. In what were called the depression years, private employers were permitted to evade the conditions of various industrial awards, and, therefore, there are not sufficient aporentices coming forward in the skilled trades. Yet, today, the Government bemoans the fact, that there is a dearth of skilled tradesmen. Had Labour been in office in recent years, it would have implemented a progressive policy in this regard. There would have 'been an adequate supply of skilled tradesmen, a healthier population, and fewer rejects among those offering for military service. Owing to the extent of malnutrition among the children of the workers in crowded cities, voluntary organizations have been set up to distribute hot soup to them during the winter months. The Government has no plan to solve this problem, but it protects the class which exploits the public and reaps rich profits from the country's difficulties. When the Labour party is offering criticism of the Government, in order to assist the community, the Government is not prepared to grant the right of free speech, even in this Parliament. It desires only to hear speeches which in some degree commend the Government for its actions. Various organizations are being established outside this House, with the object, if they cannot ibring about the formation of a national government, of setting up a form of dictatorship. Of course, if they could get the Labour party to agree to the proposal, their task would be simplified, but the people are most anxious at the present time to bring about the downfall of this Government. The subversive elements in Great Britain that are retarding the war efforts at the present time are not found in the ranks of the trades unionists, but among those who move in more influential circles. The Pifth Column is formed of men like Sir Oswald Mosley, of whom the honourable member for Wide Bay no doubt approves. Discrimination has been shown in Australia regarding the allowances made to the dependants of men serving with the defence forces, and even with regard to the internment of enemy aliens. Influential enemy aliens are allowed their liberty in various cities in Australia, although other enemy aliens, who are not so wealthy, are interned. It is common talk in the streets of Sydney that certain wealthy Germans, although supposed to be interned, are allowed abroad, at certain periods, to attend to their business affairs in the city, after which they return to the internment camps. That is how the Government is carrying out its defence programme! The programme to which it is giving effect is that of "" big business "". The sooner we have a federal election, the sooner the people will have an opportunity to pass judgment on the present Government, and the sooner we shall have a Labour government in power.",63
35,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,"Bendigo) [10.11] believe it to be absolutely essential, interests of Australia's war effort, every party in this House should get behind the Government. It is hyposo critical for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) and the leader of the Communist Labour party (Mr Beasley) to criticize the Government for our adequate defence preparations, when and their parties are so largely responand sible for the position. The security Australia as well as that of Great Britain and the rest of the Empire is threatened today, and it was a Labour party that abolished compulsory military training this country. No doubt members of the nate Opposition will retort that this Governare ment, or one of the same political comand plexion, has been in power for some years, and could have restored compulin sory .training if it had wished to dp I point out, however, that the Labour government dismissed many highly trained officers of the Navy and the Army, and so disrupted the organization for compulsory military training that it would have been a very big task to put the system in operation again. During the years of the depression, the people were fed with stories that the League of Nations would protect us, and that war would not occur again. In the circumstances, they were not prepared to face the cost of an adequate defence system. Only when they saw that their liberties were directly threatened were they willing that the necessary expense should be incurred. All thoughtful people have known for a number of years that Nazi Germany constituted a threat to the security of Great Britain and the Empire. The Government cannot be absolved of all the blame for our present ineffective defences. Instead of being strong when our fate is being decided on the battlefields of Planders, we are able to provide only one paltry air squadron for reconnaissance work in the North Sea. Within nine months after the outbreak of the 1914 war, we were able to put a force on the slopes of Gallipoli consisting of more than a division of infantry and three or four brigades of dismounted light horse, and those forces had an important bearing upon the conduct of the war. To-day in the same I period we have only one incomplete in the division in Palestine. The Government thai has no reason to be proud of its war effort, nor has the Opposition, which is largely responsible for the fact that our young men are not now trained to nondefend their country. I would warn them that Germany is not the only inpossible enemy. Australia's war effort they is lagging because the Government this Parliament have failed to of face facts. Por the last few years every one has known that the Einpi.;was threatened. Because of the position in Europe today, the threat is a very in grave one, and the Empire will be fortui f it escapes that threat. Many things responsible for our present position, I do not exonerate the Government. The apathy of the people has been due great measure, to the slogan of the so. Government, "" business as usual"". That. advice, and the talk about making a just peace, had a bad psychological effect, so that the people were not prepared to make the necessary sacrifices. The wealthy people of Australia were not prepared to give up their wealth. The young men of Australia were not prepared to risk their lives, and the workers of Australia were not prepared to forget their unions and think only of their future as a race. They were misled. Democracy, as it is known today, can survive only if the people are told the truth. Churchill told the people of Great Britain the truth for years past, and everything he prophesied has come to pass. We, too, must be told the truth if we are to come safely through this, the greatest crisis in our history. Many things must be done to put the country on a proper war footing. For one thing, I believe that Australia should be properly mapped. For military purposes, such maps as we now have are practically useless. There are huge areas in the centre of Australia of which there are no maps at all. With modern photography, it is not a difficult thing to map a country, and the work could be carried out as a part of the training of our Air Force. I know the value of accurate maps. In the Palestine campaign we fought over great areas of desert similatto the country in central Australia. We also fought over mountainous country in Judea. Lord Kitchener, when a. lieutenant in the engineers, was responsible .for the mapping of that country, and more than 40 years later the maps proved invaluable. Maps of the same kind ?hould be prepared here. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Blain), who, I believe, is the only licensed surveyor in this House, has pleaded on many occasions for the proper mapping of Australia, but little has been done. For many years honourable members have urged that adequate supplies of military requirements should be obtained. Shortly after I entered this House, I heard the honourable member for Hume (Mr Collins) say that the military forces were even short of blankets in this, the greatest wool-growing country in the world, and he urged the Government speed up military supplies; yet vernment took no notice of him. When it was necessary to call up 70,000 militiamen for training, they could not be supplied with blankets, uniforms or tents. The Government has something to answer for. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) said that he had been told that Australia could defend itself. I do not know who told him so. Possibly, he was told by some of the Communists from the coal-fields-perhap s Mr William Orr.  Navy (Mr Archie Cameron) told us that we could defend ourselves.",65
36,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"And so we will, to the last man in this country.",66
37,Mr GANDER,Unknown,Lord Kitchener told us.,66
38,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,"Lord Kitchener was here in 1910 when the proposition was very different. In those days it might have heen possible for Australia to defend itself, but only with the assistance of the British fleet. It is the same today. We depend on the British navy.  Navy said that we could do it. Mr BAN K.I.N - He may have said so, but I have very grave doubts about it. Australia might be able to defend itself for a little while, as Abyssinia did, but, if the British fleet were destroyed and we were left to fight with our own resources, although we would put up a better fight 'than Abyssinia did, the end would be just as sure. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) asked, ""Why is Australia in such a. state as regards defence?"" The answer is: Simply because the. party to which he belongs has done everything that it. can to destroy the defence of Australia, to stop Australia from preparing itself, and to stop our production of munitions and our training of men. As honourable members know, the honourable member for East Sydney has made some of the most disloyal speeches that have ever been made in any legislature of the British Empire. He is one of many who are responsible"" for our present inability to defend ourselves. ",66
39,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,"It is true. I have to heard the honourable member for East the GoSydney make those speeches here. To-day we are taking part in the 'Empire air scheme and are asking for great, numbers of young men to join the Air Force, but the Government says that, irrespective of other qualifications, a man must hold the intermediate certificate before he is a fit and proper person to become a fighter-pilot or an observer. Some of the greatest fighters that we produced in the last war did not have any "" old school tie "" to wear. Men from my own regiment--Bill y Guilfoyle, who is now an Air Vice-Marshal in the Royal Air Force, StanMuir and MCCann, men of that type-and MACNamara, the first winner of the Victoria Cross in Palestine, who, I believe, is now a group captain in England, did not have an intermediate certificate. They were soldiers with the fighting spirit and did not need the intermediate certificate to tell them how to shoot the enemy. Yet today the Air Force is refusing the services of some .of the best material in the world, men from the hill country of Gippsland and fvom the plains of the Mallee, who have had no opportunity to attend a secondary school. They have the merit certificate from the State schools, which were the only schools they could attend. For that reason the Government says: ""No. They are not fit and proper persons. They would not be able to navigate a 'plane "". In the last war men like them proved that they were among the greatest fighting pilots that the world had ever seen. The possession of "" the old school tie "" did not enable other pilots to shoot one extra aeroplane down. Another matter which I shall bring forward closely concerns the Minister for the Army. Many insulting references to the Militia of Australia have been made by certain individuals, prominent amongst whom is a man who once sat in this House. He broadcasts through the National Broadcasting Stations under the name of ""The Watchman"". He has been very aptly called by Smith's Weekly ""The Botchman"". On the 15th May, this man broadcast from 2CO at 12.40 l>.m. and insultingly described the Militia, camps as holiday camps.",66
40,Mr MARTENS,Unknown,An armchair fighter.,67
41,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,"Yes . Although he was a young man at the time of the last war,.he does not wear a returned soldier's badge today. There are.hundreds of men in the division which I am proud to command who left their properties practically unattended to go to camp. Some men ride in regularly from Kosciusko 70 miles to Tallangatta in order to attend parades. They are of the type of men who, during the camp, were hurnt out by the disastrous fires which swept through the west and north-east of Victoria, and they almost lost their all. One man who owned one of the greatest merino studs in Australia had 10,000 stud sheep before the fire and only 34 after. Another man lost eighteen miles of fencing. Many farmers who owned small properties had their homesteads burnt out. They should not have to listen to the insults that are hurled against, them by a smug, self-satisfied gentleman calling himself ""The Watchman"". It is a disgrace that they should have to do so. Other people besides "" The Watchman "" want putting in their places. One of them is the silvertailed ink-slinger they call the Acting Minister for Information. That man also said that the response from the Militia was a disappointment and a disgrace to it.",67
42,Mr GANDER,Unknown,Is the present Acting Minister for Information (Sir Henry Gullett) a silver-tailed ink-slinger?,67
43,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,"Yes . The attitude of the Government to enlistment was largely responsible for the fact that, when the Sixth Division was formed, there was a comparatively small response from the Militia. The Government decided that it would call for enlistments from people outside the Militia. It said that after a certain number from outside had enlisted and the Militia had held its camps, it would allow a certain number of militiamen to join. In 1914, two or three officers were taken from every unit in Australia and the men who were in those units, having confidence in their officers, followed them. The militiamen are prepared to do the same today. From my own division, 210 officers volunteered and 1,500 other ranks followed them. Ninetyone of those officers were taken, but 120 who volunteered have not been accepted. Why should the Militia have to listen to insults from Ministers and others? The Prime Minister himself said that the Government ' was disappointed at the response from the Militia. I tell the Prime Minister and the Ministry generally that the only body responsible for whatever disappointment there might have been at the response of the Militia to the call was the Government itself. Thia week, 30 officers and 230 men from my division have been accepted. If the Government look a reasonable number of officers from that division, the number of other ranks that would enlist would increase four or five-fold. Two officers were taken for the reconnaissance regiment, and that squadron was practically completed from other squadrons of the division. Whilst I have no sympathy with the statements of the Leader of the Opposisition or the Leader of the so-called anti-Communist party concerning our war effort, I do not exonerate the Government from blame. If it does not wake up the people will put in its place another government which will take the necessary steps to ensure that Australia will accept its full share of the job of supplying the Mother Country and the Allies with material, nnd will also put as many troops on the plains of Flanders as Great Britain itself has today. I do not say that the Government of the United Kingdom has altogether pulled its weight, as it had, for some time, in Mr Chamberlain, a Prime Minister who did not do his job. The people of England, for that reason, replaced him. If this Government does not wake up and accept the services of every man who is prepared to fight for the honour of the Empire and Australia, or to work so that our forces shall be supplied with all the equipment they need, it must be dispensed with, and another put in its place, which will coordinate and expand all of our war-time activities. [Quorum formed.]",67
44,Mr JOLLY,Unknown,"Lilley) [10.33] - I do not propose to speak at any length in this debate, for this is no time for futile cussion. The Empire and its Allies today fighting an enemy which acts first and talks afterwards. We are, in fact, engaged in a life and death struggle in which Australia is vitally concerned, all our spiritual, social and material privileges are at stake. It is imperative that we should concentrate all our energy on the war effort. Parliamentary control at this period is too unwieldy. We cannot expect to conduct the.affairs of the country efficiently in a time of war if the Government has to listen to the advice of 110 members of the Parliament. I appreciate the reasons given by the Opposition for declining to take part in a national government. These are, as 1 understand them, related to their desire to preserve their party interests and rights. I would remind honourable gentlemen opposite, however, and also the members of other parties who are anxious to preserve party interests, that if the Empire is defeated we shall not have a parliament, let alone political parties. In order that we may concentrate all of our resources on our war effort, I offer the suggestion that a committee representative of all parties be selected to confer with the Government and to advise it concerning the most effective way to meet the exigencies of the situation which faces us. Such a committee would not devote its time to useless debate, but would actively consult with and advise the Executive. Such honourable gentlemen as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway), the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley), and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Bosevear), are sincerely anxious, I believe, that we should win the war, and they could with propriety be asked to act on such a committee as I have suggested. If this course were followed the Government would be assured at this critical time in our history that advice would be available, in an effective form, concerning all the activities that must be undertaken. In Germany, whatever one man says, goes. Here, 110 individuals are offering advice. How can we expect successfully to combat our enemy under these conditions?",68
45,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"""Where no counsel is, disthe people fail, but in the multitude of are counsellors there is safety"".",68
46,Mr JOLLY,Unknown,"In the multitude of counsellors we may also fall by the way. I offer my suggestion because I feel that for we must act today. To-morrow may he too late. I appreciate the sincerity of honourable members and the earnestness of - their :de§ire to assist the Government, but no good purpose can be served by long debates at this critical time. I have sat in the House throughout this debate and, for the most part, not more than - twenty members have been present at any one time. ""What good purpose can the debate serve in such circumstances? I very much fear that we are in grave danger of destroying our democracy by talk. I urge that the most careful consideration be given to my suggestion.",68
47,Mr MCHUGH,Unknown,"Wakefield) [10.39] At this critical period of our history I wish to say a few words which I hope will be constructive and helpful. We are undoubtedly facing the gravest issues that have ever confronted us. I have read a lot about totalitarian methods of government and preparation for war, and consequently I have no illusions about the power of the enemy. My interpretation of civilization is that it leads to Christian socialism, under which governments will be actuated by high ethical principles. I claim to be a Christian socialist, and thai is why I am a member of the Australian Labour party. For that reason, I have some leanings towards free trade, and at times have been asked why I am not a member of the Country party. My reply has been that I am not, a member of the Country parly because, in my opinion, that party takes a parochial view, and does not, have regard to the interests of the nation as a. whole. That leads me to refer to the present war position. I that the Allied forces are in imminent danger. Germany has been working - for many years to achieve its present great strength. How can democracy face.such a situation and counteract the totalitarian idea of government? In my opinion it can do so only by using the resources of the nation to the full capacity, in order make a supreme effort to resist the evil force overshadowing the world. We all - hope that the struggle will soon end, but I fps<r that the rumblings of this conflict will continue for a long time. At such a time, the Government should forget that it is a capitalist, government, and opposed to national control of the country's assets. The Government is not, in fact, opposed to national control, because in the Post Office, for instance,-it has a great public utility which handles large revenues and performs a national service effectively and efficiently. The resources of the nation should be commandeered by the nation and used in the interests of the people. It is idle to say that that cannot be done. If we are going to call upon the flower of our manhood to offer their greatest possession, the citizens of the nation who have wealth in any degree should make that wealth available to the nation, free of interest. I appeal to the Government to marshal the nation's resources along the lines of national socialism.  government?",69
48,Mr MCHUGH,Unknown,"There is no need at the moment for a national government in Australia, although, if I were in England, I should'support a national government there because of the imminent danger facing that country. In my opinion, the British and French armies arc more courageous than the German forces-that was shown during the last war; but the mechanization of the German forces has made it possible for them to force their way to the Channel ports. There has been a good deal of talk about a national government. I ask supporters of the Government what more could members of the Opposition have done than they have done. Representatives of the trade unions are now in conference with the .Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) with a view to the industrial organizations assisting the nation in this crisis to the fullest degree possible. To-night the realise honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) offered his industrial legal knowledge and experience to the Government in an attempt to keep the industrial machinery working smoothly and effectively. This afternoon, the Leader of the Opposition (. Mr Curtin) left the House in no ..doubt as to the support of the to Opposition for a maximum war effort. [ agree with the remarks of the honourable mem her. for Bourke regarding the danger associated with Labour amalgamating with its political opponents. Labour is totally opposed to the Government's peace policy in many respects, for Labour believes in a collective effort by the nation for the nation. The Labour party has ronsistently aimed at socialistic ideals. Labour believes that the nation should assist the wheat industry, the sugar industry, and other industries which are of national importance and in need of assistance. We, on this side, believe that the industries of a nation should be so regulated that their watchword will be ""use"" instead of ""profit"" . I offer my services to the Federal Government to be used in any way that will not conflict with the principles that I hold dear. Those principles I shall not sacrifice; hut anything that I can do to help this country during this crisis I am willing to do. Some of ns in this Parliament have a knowledge of rural problems which may be of assistance to the Government. My knowledge of such problems and of marketing, 1 offer freely to the Government. Unfortunately, Australia has large quantities of primary products which cannot be exported. If I can see the writing on the wall for Europe, particularly England, it is that those countries will experience' great difficulty in regard to food supplies. The Government should speed up production, and take control of industry. There should not be one unemployed' person in Australia at a time like this. The resources of the country should be utilized to ensure the maximum effort possible. Non-Labour governments have had control of the Treasury for the last nine years, yet they blame the Labour Government which was in office in 1931 for not having organized the resources of the country to prepare for war. The effect of the rectification of the financial position of this country by the Government led by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) was to put that right honourable gentleman and his party into opposition. But the point is, not what may have been the omissions of cither the Scullin Government or the Lyons Government, hut that this young country, in common with the whole of the British Empire, is dangerously close to losing all of the freedom for which it has fought. I have no illusions concerning the organized attempt that is being made in that direction. Why have the democracies not been able so to arrange their affairs that they would be strong enough to meet this onslaught?",69
49,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I gave the reason two years ago. It is, that we talking while the dictators are acting. [BO]",70
50,Mr MCHUGH,Unknown,"Eve r since the termination of the last war there have heen from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 unemployed in Great Britain. That has not been the case in Germany. Democracy has failed in that regard. There have been from 100,000 to 400,000 unemployed in Australia, quite unnecessarily. For the last ten years, the average number of unemployed has been 200,000, in consequence of which the loss to the nation has been no less than £400,000,000. That unemployed army has been described in certain publications as the "" demons of democracy "". No conservative government would eradicate unemployment. A Labour government would so marshal the resources of the country that unemployment would disappear entirely. In New Zealand, resources have been brought into contact with labour power, with the result that unemployment was brought to an end in two years. Had that been the position in Australia since the termination of the last war, we should have had sufficient strength in every way to resist an enemy. Democracies are at the cross roads and must change their policy, removing the nightmare of unemployment which stares the great mass of the workers in the face day by day. These are the causes of our weakness, and they must be rectified. Just as chickens run to the mother's wing in time of trouble, so does the nation now look to the Government for aid. Industries like those of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, and General Motors-Holdens Limited, in tvhich millions of pounds are invested and which have so much to lose, must be marshalled in the interests of the nation in this crisis. If the present Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) is not big enough to undertake the task, the people of this country will defeat him and his Government and will place the responsibility on a Labour government. The Government has clone a good deal in the last few months in preparations for the conduct of the war. Like the Leader of the Opposition, I realise that the first and most important thing is to have our factories working to their fullest are capacity. If the Opposition can assist the Government, without affecting the principles which it holds dear, its help and advice will he freely placed at the disposal of the Ministry.

58,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"On the loth May, the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) asked the following question, without notice:Will the Prime Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Defence Co-ordination, arrange to co-ordinate the methods adopted in regard to recruiting for the Air Force and the Australian Imperial Force? In order that the right honourable gentleman may understand the purport of the question, I mention that the mayor of Grafton told me last night that whilst the local recruiting committee may publicly farewell Air Force recruits and publish their names in the newspaper, ami whilst they may march through the streets, thereby stimulating recruiting, the uame3 of recruits for the Australian Imperial Force arc never published and that such men arc merely given their rail warrants and allowed to leave the railway station without any public farewell. Would it not be possible for them both to be treated in the same way? There seems to be some doubt as to whether the censor is p inventing the names of Australian Imperiitl Force recruits from being published. Moreover, will he arrange to make it possible for the medical officers for the Air Force and Australian Imperial Force, who are stationed respectively at Grafton and Lismore, which are 90 miles apart, to examine recruits fot both the Air Force and the Australian Imperial Force! At present recruits have to travel to the respective town, except on occasions when the appropriate authority visits the other centre. I am now in a position to inform the right honourable member that there is no departmental objection to civic and other bodies according public farewells to recruits, whether Australian Imperial Eorce or Air Eorce. It is not the practice of either the Army or Air Force authorities to publish the names of recruits, nor is it considered advisable for such information to be made available through departmental channels for publication. There is, however, no departmental objection to the publication of names of recruits if they are. communicated to the press by the men themselves or by civio or other bodies with the men's consent. With regard to the medical examination of recruits, notwithstanding the similarity of the requirements for recruits for the Australian Imperial Force and those for recruits for enlistment as gound personnel for the Royal Australian Air Eorce, there are certain administrative difficulties which render it inadvisable to provide for medical officers of the Air Force and of the Army stationed respectively at Grafton and Lismore, to examine recruits for both the Air Force and the Australian Imperial Force, as suggested by the right honourable gentleman. In the case of prospective air crews, these personnel are required to pass tests which are not imposed on recruits for the Australian Imperial Force, and it would be impracticable for army medical officers to examine A ir Force recruits as such officers have not undergone special training required to familiarizo Air Force examiners with the technique of examinations for that force, nor are they versed in the use of certain special equipment or the interpretation of special tests as applied to aviation. An arrangement has, however, been in force for some timo under which the appropriate Army forms are made available to Air Force recruiting centres so that men rejected for the Royal Australian Air Force may be recorded as fit for the Australian Imperial Force, if such is the case. Such tlio medical examinations are accepted by the Army. Forms of application for enlistment in the Royal Australian Air Force are being made available at Australian Imperial Force recruiting depots.",71
